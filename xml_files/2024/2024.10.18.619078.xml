Here, we show that a DNA damage response gene, which we named <italic>LIFERING</italic>, is under the direct and independent regulation of ATM/ATR-SOG1 and RBR pathways. We demonstrate that LIFERING upon DNA damage plays an essential role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Downstream of RBR, it is required to maintain proliferation, and in response to DNA damaging agents it initiates a cell death accompanied by rapid elongation and differentiation of the transit amplifying cells in the root meristem. LIFERING is a RING-between-RING E3 ligase; its ligase activity is dependent on the Cys392 residue located in the BRcat domain, responsible for the coordination of zinc ion binding. Using proximity labelling, we identified the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like protein IBR3, which is involved in the conversion of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), as one of its targets. We provide evidence that IBR3 is ubiquitinated at several Lys residues in the presence of LIFERING. Our findings show that LIFERING rapidly responds to DNA damage and via ubiquitination of IBR3, is likely to be involved in the regulation of free-auxin level, indicating a link between DNA damage response and auxin regulation in the root.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA damage response (DDR)</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase LIFERING</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like protein (IBR3)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">During their entire lifecycle, plants are exposed both to exogenous and endogenous stresses and toxic compounds. Although sunlight is required for photosynthesis, the short-wave electromagnetic radiation causes cellular and DNA damage. Furthermore, other abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, and heavy metal contaminants also induce similar genotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yoshiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pedroza-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In addition, endogenous damage, spontaneously generated during DNA metabolism, replication and repair can also have an impact on the genome integrity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Szurman-Zubrzycka <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Protection of genome integrity is especially crucial in the stem cell niches. The plant RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) plays a central role in this process by two distinct mechanisms: (i) promoting the exit from cell proliferation to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Harashima &amp; Sugimoto, 2016</xref>) (Cruz-Ramirez <italic>et al</italic>., 2013), and (ii) directly regulating the expression of DNA damage response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). RBR performs these functions in complex with the three canonical E2Fs (E2FA, E2FB, and E2FC) and other core components of the DREAM complex (dimerization partner (DP), retinoblastoma (RB)-like, E2F and MuvB), which are essential to establish transient and stable cellular quiescence and DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gombos <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In addition to the transcriptional control of genes involved in S-phase progression, replication and cell-cycle checkpoint, RBR, primarily in conjunction with E2FA, directly regulates the expression of numerous damage response and repair genes, including <italic>AtBRCA1</italic> and <italic>AtRAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biedermann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This allows RBR to act rapidly to endogenous replication-induced DNA damage and initiates an ATM/ATR-SOG1 independent response pathway.</p><p id="P5">To mitigate the consequences of DNA damage, plants similarly to other organisms have evolved mechanisms to sense DNA lesions and initiate the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">LaRocque &amp; McVey, 2023</xref>). The DDR signalling cascade is conserved in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Clay &amp; Fox, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>); the double-strand breaks (DSB) activate the ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) kinase by the MRN complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1), while the ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA-AND-RAD3-RELATED (ATR) is mainly recruited to single stranded breaks (SSB) by the complex of Replication Protein (RPA) and ATR Interacting Protein (ATRIP). Though both ATM and ATR have distinct functions during signalling in response to genotoxic agents such as γ-irradiation, they show additive and complementary roles during DNA replication, cell cycle progression and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nisa <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) .</p><p id="P6">In plants, the activity of the ATM/ATR-driven signalling pathway merges with the phosphorylation of the plant-specific transcription factor, SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), which is considered to be the functional analogue of the mammalian p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yoshiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yoshiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2013b</xref>). Upon genotoxic stress, in parallel to RBR and E2Fs, the activated SOG1 regulates the expression of numerous DNA repair and cell cycle genes to coordinate repair with cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bourbousse <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ogita <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Halted cell cycle resumes when the lesions are repaired via various pathways depending on the nature of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Raina <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Szurman-Zubrzycka <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). However, in the case of severe damage, proliferating cells escape from further division and initiate processes of (i) cell death, especially in the stem and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Furukawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), (ii) endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lang &amp; Schnittger, 2020</xref>), and/or (iii) differentiation. RBR plays a key role to establish the threshold at which cell death is initiated upon genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Besides transcriptional regulation, posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation, also play an essential role in the regulation of the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Among the characterised plant-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in DDR, the DNA damage response mutant 1 (DDRM1) and 2 (DDRM2) play a role in the early steps of damage recognition and recruitment of repair proteins to the damaged site. DDRM1 monoubiquitinates the phosphorylated SOG1, thereby promoting its stability (Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022). Subsequently, SOG1 induces the expression of DDRM2, binding of which to AtRAD51 is required for its recruitment to the damaged DNA site labelled with γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Upon DDR, the RBR-induced <italic>KNOTEN1</italic> (KNO1) also partially co-localises with γ-H2AX and is stabilised by the de-ubiquitinases, UBP12 and UBP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). After stabilisation, KNO1 mediates the K63-linked ubiquitination and autophagic degradation of RMI1 protein, a structural component of the Bloom syndrome complex, thereby increasing homologous recombination frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Studying the role of RBR in the protection of genome integrity, we found that the <italic>At5g60250</italic> transcript exhibited significantly higher expression levels than any other transcripts upon silencing of <italic>RBR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horvath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).

Our genetic analysis shows that upon genotoxic stress LIFERING is required to maintain meristematic activity by preventing the exit to differentiation as well as to regulate stem cell divisions downstream of RBR. We demonstrate that LIFERING is a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase; it is capable of autoubiquitination, and its activity depends on the Cys392 residue involved in the coordination of zinc ion binding. Using proximity-based labelling and protein interaction studies, we show that the most prominent interacting protein of LIFERING, the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like protein, IBR3 is involved in the conversion of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

Using AlphaFold computational protein structure prediction combined with the AlphaFill algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), we assumed that the cysteine at position 392, along with cysteines at positions 387, 420, and 423, are part of one of the two zinc-binding sites of the BRcat domain and are liable to engage in zinc-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Varadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hekkelman <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).

It also provides a local auxin source in the root cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xuan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), while along the root axis, the IBA-derived auxin is responsible, on the one hand, for setting the local auxin level to position lateral root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xuan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) and, on the other hand, in co-operation with cytokinin, for the formation of adventitious root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Damodaran &amp; Strader, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P53">In the root tip, IBR3 is localized to the lateral root cap; mostly to the lateral - and columella root cap cells, but also in the QC, dividing and young meristem cells, albeit at a lower level. In the differentiation zone, its expression was identified in the stele cells including the pericycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xuan et al., 2015</xref>; Ryu, KH et al., 2019). Importantly, the expression of IBR3 overlaps with that of LIFERING in the lateral - and columella root cap cells and the dividing meristematic cells, albeit on a significantly lower level in non-genotoxic conditions (Ryu, KH et al., 2019). In the triple IBA response mutants, <italic>ibr1,ibr3,ibr10</italic>, the overall IAA level is unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Strader <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), while in the quadruple mutant, <italic>ech2,ibr1,ibr3 ibr10</italic>, the free auxin level is reduced with 20-25% in the root tip. As expected from the local auxin levels, the quadruple mutant develops a significantly shorter meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Strader <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and an overall reduced root system with fewer number of lateral roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xuan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, despite the morphological changes, no spontaneously developed cell death response was reported related to any of these mutants in normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Strader <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="S17"><title>How can we integrate our data in the existing knowledge on the connection between DNA damage response and hormonal regulation?</title><p id="P54">Root growth is dependent on the balance of the hormones, cytokinin and auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Salvi <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Upon DNA damage, however, the balance between cytokinin and auxin levels shifts. Through SOG1, DNA damage induces cytokinin synthesis and activates its signalling around the transition zone, thereby inhibiting downward auxin flow. With the reduction in auxin level, the position of auxin minima changes towards the stem cell niche, resulting in the G2 arrest of the dividing cells. Independent of G2 arrest, reduced auxin signalling also leads to stem cell death. In parallel, increased cytokinin signalling triggers early onset of endoreduplication. The combined effects of G2 arrest, early transition from division to endoreduplication and stem cell death, reduce meristematic activity and thus inhibit root growth to safeguard genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Davis <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The fact that, in the absence of functional LIFERING, there was no or significantly reduced cell death in the root meristem, either upon treatment with genotoxic agent or in silencing of RBR, especially in the stem cell niche, we suggest that LIFERING plays a role in setting the auxin level in the stem cell niche. Furthermore, closer endoreduplication in the meristem also indicates a shift in hormone balance.</p><p id="P55">Both the suppression of auxin signalling and auxin levels are prerequisites to the prompt local development of cell death response in the root meristem to protect genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Upon DNA damage, the otherwise lowly expressed <italic>IAA5</italic> and <italic>IAA29</italic> genes, coding for the transcriptional repressors of auxin signalling, are directly induced by SOG1 in the vascular stem cells and daughters. This way, they can locally reduce the auxin response and ensure cell death upon damage in the stem cell niche and surrounding vascular cell layer. In contrast, in the double mutant <italic>iaa5-1, iaa29-1</italic>, due to lack of suppression of the local auxin level signalling, spatial reduction of the cell death response was detected in the apical meristem when challenged with DNA damage agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Similar to the <italic>iaa5-1,iaa29-1</italic>, the mutant line, <italic>lifering-1</italic> develops no or substantially weakened cell death response upon DNA damage and thus has significantly reduced number of dead cells in both the apical and distal meristems with no or only one dead cell either in the distal and/or in the vascular stem cell niche compared to the Col-0.</p><p id="P56">In line with the overlapping localisation of LIFERING and IBR3 and considering that LIFERING targets IBR3 for ubiquitination and consequently potentially inactivates it by an-as-yet-unknown mechanism, we propose that under normal growth conditions, in the absence of LIFERING in the root, the IBA to IAA conversion supplies auxin to support growth along the root meristem. In contrast, under stress, when <italic>LIFERING</italic> is rapidly induced, it attenuates the auxin supply, thereby leading to growth arrest and early differentiation. By setting the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, LIFERING through auxin signalling also regulates cell death response upon DNA damage.</p><p id="P57">In conclusion, we propose a working model according to which we suggest that by adjusting the level of free auxin available in the root meristem, LIFERING initiates a cell death response to prevent further division with damaged DNA and to fine-tune the auxin level in the QC and the surrounding area. Further experimentation should provide evidence to prove this model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199620-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d95aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Hana Kourová and Pavla Binarová (Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic) for their valuable advice during the experimentation.
