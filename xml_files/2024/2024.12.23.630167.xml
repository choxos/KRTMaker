Yet, we can intentionally stop this process and thus prevent the memory from entering awareness. Such suppression not only transiently hinders the retrieval of the memory, it can also induce forgetting. Neuroimaging has implicated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in initiating this process. Specifically, this region seems to downregulate activity in brain systems that would otherwise support memory reinstatement. Here, we probed the causal contribution of the right dlPFC to suppression by combining the Think/No-Think task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants first learned pairs of cue and target words, and then repeatedly recalled some of the targets (think condition) and suppressed others (no-think condition). We applied 10 Hz rTMS bursts to the right dlPFC during the suppression of half the no-think items and to the contra-lateral primary motor area (M1) as an active control site during the other half. As hypothesized, participants experienced less success at keeping the memories out of awareness with concurrent dlPFC than M1 stimulation. Similarly, a memory test yielded evidence for suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) following M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the difference in forgetting between the stimulation conditions was not significant. The study thus provides causal evidence for the role of the dlPFC in preventing retrieval. Future work will need to conclusively establish the relationship between this transient effect and suppression-induced forgetting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>memory suppression</kwd><kwd>Think/No-Think</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</kwd><kwd>retrieval stopping</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">When we are confronted with a reminder of an unwanted memory, we can prevent the memory from entering awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anderson &amp; Hulbert 2021</xref>). One mechanism supporting such mnemonic control is referred to as retrieval suppression. This mechanism is thought to avert unwanted recall by systematically inhibiting the retrieval process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Levy &amp; Anderson 2009</xref>). Such suppression successively weakens the avoided memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Levy &amp; Anderson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Levy &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>), hinders the reactivation of its neural representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Meyer &amp; Benoit 2022</xref>), and can eventually lead to forgetting, a phenomenon referred to as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderson &amp; Green (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Stramaccia et al. (2020)</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence that retrieval suppression is associated with increased activation in a set of brain regions that entails the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). At the same time, it is associated with reduced activation in a set of regions that are critical for memory retrieval. These most notably include the hippocampus. This pattern has been interpreted as reflecting a top-down inhibition of hippocampal retrieval processes originating from the right dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Anderson et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Depue et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Over the last decade, this account has been supported by several studies that examined the functional connectivity between the dlPFC and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Apšvalka et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Benoit et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Depue et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagnepain et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Leone et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mary et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Paz-Alonso et al. 2013</xref>). These studies varied in procedural details, including the type of memories examined and the methods used for their initial acquisition. Yet, they consistently provided evidence that the dlPFC modulated activity in the hippocampus during suppression.</p><p id="P6">However, neuroimaging studies can only provide correlational evidence for the involvement of the right dlPFC. Here, we tested its causal contribution by complementing a Think/No-Think task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderson &amp; Green 2001</xref>) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We first had participants associate pairs of cue and target words. In the subsequent suppression phase, we then presented some of the cues repeatedly in green font and requested participants to covertly recall the associated target (think items). We presented other cues repeatedly in red front (no-think items) and instructed participants to prevent the associated targets from coming to mind. In case a memory intruded into their mind, they were instructed to push it back out of awareness. We thus used instructions that have previously been associated with the typical activity pattern of retrieval suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bergström et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To assess the causal contribution of the right dlPFC, we perturbed activity in this region using 10 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) bursts for half of the suppress items (no-think<sup>dlPFC</sup> items). For the other half of these items, we perturbed the contralateral M1 as an active control site (no-think<sup>control</sup> items). We could thus test whether stimulating the right dlPFC hinders participants’ ability to prevent unwanted retrieval.</p><p id="P8">Afterward, we assessed participants’ memories of the targets from the <italic>think</italic> and the two <italic>no-think</italic> conditions (dlPFC, M1 control) as well as from a baseline condition. This latter condition comprised memories that had not been cued during the preceding suppression stage. This allowed us to infer whether suppression exerts an impact that goes beyond the passive forgetting over time occurring for the baseline items. Finally, after the experiment, we measured the experienced disruption in mnemonic control by asking participants how often each memory had inadvertently intruded into awareness during no-think trials.</p><p id="P9">Based on the hypothesis that the right dlPFC - but not M1 - is causally involved in suppression, we had two predictions. First, perturbing activity in the right dlPFC should make it more difficult to prevent the retrieval of unwanted memories than perturbing activity in the active control site. Second, impeding suppression should also prevent the typical inhibitory after-effects: we expected suppression-induced forgetting only in the control condition but not for memories whose suppression had been hindered via dlPFC stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">Thirty-one participants (23 female, 8 male; mean age = 25.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.58) took part in the experiment. They were German native speakers, right-handed, and had graduated from high school. Furthermore, they reported no color blindness, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were naive to the Think/No-Think task. One participant was excluded due to technical issues, leaving a sample of 30 (23 female, 7 male; mean age = 25.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.64). We recruited the participants from the database of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig.</p><p id="P11">Our sample size (n = 30) is common for studies examining memory suppression with the Think/No-Think procedure (24–30 participants). It provides 80% power to detect a medium effect size (i.e., Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.47, one-tailed; Cohen’s <italic>f</italic> = 0.43 in a 2×3 repeated measures ANOVA) at α = 0.05 (according to G*Power 3.1). This is below the meta-analytic effect-size estimate (<italic>d</italic> = 0.66) of SIF in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Stramaccia et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P12">A study physician certified their eligibility for MRI and TMS, which was also assessed by the experimenters prior to each experimental session with a safety questionnaire. The study protocol was approved by the local research ethics committee (protocol number 506/16-ek) and was in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. At the beginning of both experimental sessions, we obtained written informed consent. All participants were reimbursed for their time.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Think/No-Think Procedure</title><p id="P13">Our Think/No-Think procedure comprised three phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): First, a study phase, in which participants learned cue-target word pairs; second, a Think/No-Think phase, in which a subset of cues were shown again: some cues in red, indicating that the target is to be suppressed (<italic>no-think</italic>), and some in green indicating the target is to be retrieved (<italic>think</italic>). And third, a test phase, in which they attempted to recall all targets.</p><sec id="S5" sec-type="materials"><title>Material</title><p id="P14">Stimuli consisted of 50 German cue-target word pairs and another word that was semantically related to the respective target (e.g., RADIO – SNOW – WINTER). The latter word served as an independent memory probe on the final memory test (see below). Most of the stimuli were translations from a Dutch set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">van Schie &amp; Anderson 2017</xref>). They were divided in five sets of 10 pairs. An additional set of 8 stimuli was used to practice the tasks and to minimize primacy and recency effects during the study phase. The five critical sets were comparable in terms of word frequency as well as orthographic and phonological properties as indexed by the dlexDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Heister et al. 2011</xref>) and the Leipzig Corpora Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Goldhahn et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We adopted a Latin-square counterbalancing strategy so that, across the sample, each item appeared equally often in all conditions (<italic>baseline, think, no-think</italic>) and stimulation sites (dlPFC, M1). For each counterbalancing condition, one set of stimuli was assigned to <italic>baseline</italic> items, whereas <italic>think</italic> and <italic>no-think</italic> items were assigned two sets each. Participants thus encountered as many <italic>think</italic> as <italic>no-think</italic> items in the Think/No-Think phase. This approach led to ten counterbalancing conditions, which we repeated three times across the 30 participants.</p><p id="P16">During each phase of the procedure, we ensured that (a) a maximum of three items of the same condition were presented consecutively, (b) the same item could reappear only once all other items had been presented, and (c) the average serial position of the items was similar for all conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Study Phase</title><p id="P17">In the initial study phase, participants encoded 50 critical cue-target pairs. Participants also learned a further 8 filler pairs, which were used during training the task and to mitigate primacy and recency effects during learning. First, we presented half the critical and filler pairs for 4000 ms each, followed by a fixation cross for 400 ms. Afterward, we assessed participants’ memory for the pairs in a series of test-feedback cycles. Here, participants encountered each cue word for 3500 ms and attempted to covertly recall the associated target. Irrespective of their response, the correct target was then displayed in blue font for 1000 ms. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 1000 ms. Participants carried out these test-feedback cycles until they had correctly recalled at least 50% of the targets in a single run. This procedure was then repeated for the second half of the word pairs. Afterward, participants once more attempted to recall each target in response to its cue, which was presented for 3500 ms, each trial preceeded by a fixation cross for 1000 ms. No feedback was provided at this stage. On average, participants were able to learn about 75.7% of the stimuli by the end of the initial study phase (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.9%).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Think/No-Think Phase</title><p id="P18">In the following Think/No-Think phase, forty cue words were presented one at a time for 2500 ms, either in green (<italic>think</italic> items, n = 20) or red color (<italic>no-think</italic> items, n = 20). Each trial started with a fixation cross for 400 ms and was followed by a blank ISI of 400 ms. For the green <italic>think</italic> items, participants were instructed to recall the associated target silently and to rehearse it in their mind for as long as the cue remained on screen.</p><p id="P19">For red <italic>no-think</italic> items, participants were instructed to avoid thinking about the associated target at all costs while focusing on the presented cue. If a target intruded into their awareness, they were supposed to push it out. Furthermore, they were asked to keep doing so during the subsequent fixation period. We thus used instructions previously shown to induce a mechanism of retrieval suppression that presumably involves an engagement of the right dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P20">After receiving the instructions, participants practiced the tasks on the filler items in two blocks. They then entered the Think/No-Think phase proper. During this phase, each critical cue was repeated ten times for a total of 400 trials across all conditions, divided into five blocks. Short breaks were provided between blocks, which also allowed us to adjust the positioning of the TMS coils if necessary. Furthermore, brief questionnaires were administered after both practice rounds and after the third experimental block to ensure that they were following the instructions to engage in retrieval suppression.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Final Test Phase</title><p id="P21">In the final phase, we tested memory for all 50 targets using two different tests. First, on a same probe (SP) test, we presented the original cue, and participants attempted to recall the corresponding target aloud. Second, on an independent probe (IP) test, we probed the memories with novel words that were not previously shown during any phase. These words were strongly associated with the respective target only. They were presented together with the target’s first letter (for example, WINTER S… to test memory for SNOW). The task was to say aloud the target word with the given starting letter that matches this novel cue. The IP procedure has been designed to test whether suppression weakens the very memory trace of the target rather than merely the association between cue and target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anderson 2003</xref>). On each test, a trial started with a fixation cross of 1000 ms followed by the cue shown for 3500 ms. Participants practiced both tests on the filler pairs, and they always received the SP test first.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Apparatus</title><p id="P22">In the study and final test phase, words were presented in white (cues) and blue (targets) on a gray background, on a 23-inch color flat screen display (EIZO EV2450 FlexScan) with a maximal resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. During the Think/No-Think phase, stimuli were either presented in green or red on a gray background on a 17-inch color flat screen display (EIZO FlexScanS1901) with a maximal resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels and refresh rate of 60 Hz.</p><p id="P23">Participants were seated ∼50 cm (study and final phase) and ∼125 cm (Think/No-Think phase) from the screen in a quiet, dimly lit room. Words were presented at the center of the screen, with a letter width and height of approximately 1.3 cm for the shorter and 3 cm for the longer viewing distance (equivalent to a visual angle of 1.49° and 1.38°, respectively). PsychoPy version 1.85.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Peirce 2008</xref>) was used to run the experiment and to control the TMS pulses via parallel port.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Transcranial magnetic stimulation</title><sec id="S11"><title>Apparatus and Target Localization</title><p id="P24">We delivered 10 Hz rTMS bursts with two C-B60 figure-of-eight coils attached to two MagVenture MagPro X 100 stimulators. We used two coils to alternate stimulation over the right dlPFC and the M1 control site, thus allowing us to test our main hypothesis in a within-participant design. To ensure precise coil positioning, we used a neuronavigation system (TMS Navigator, Localite GmbH, 2015) with individual T1-weighted MRI scans. These were acquired prior to the experiment with a three Tesla Siemens Magnetom Prisma Scanner (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, 2018). The T1 scans were converted to DICOM format und then segmented and normalized using SPM8. After visual inspection the target coordinates (see below), they were then transformed from MNI to native space using the SPM8 function spm_get_orig_coord.</p><p id="P25">The target position for each coil was based on the MNI coordinates obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson (2012)</xref> for the right dlPFC, and from a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mayka et al. (2006)</xref> for the left hand area in M1. Specifically, for the right dlPFC, we used the group-level peak coordinates from the contrast associated with retrieval suppression (i.e., Suppress &gt; Recall, x = 36, y = 38, z = 31). For M1 we chose the hand-responsive area, defined by the peak activation-likelihood estimate across motor tasks involving the right hand (x = -37, y = -21, z = 58). We converted the MNI coordinates to each participant’s MRI native space and overlaid them on their individual structural scans. Once in place, we manually maintained the coils’ position during the experiment to enable on-the-fly adjustments to participants’ movement. Because the neuronavigation system could only display a single coil at a time, we tracked and maintained the position of the dlPFC coil online to maximize the precision of the critical stimulation and only adjusted the position of the control M1 coil during the breaks between blocks of the task.</p><p id="P26">We oriented both coils at 45° relative to the mid-sagittal axis (with handles pointing backward) to induce a posterior-anterior current flow approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus. Due to technical limitations of the neuronavigation system, we were only able to continuously monitor the movement of the right dlPFC coil throughout the experimental blocks. The position of the M1 coil was checked during each break and adjusted accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Stimulation Parameters</title><p id="P27">We employed a 10 Hz repetitive TMS stimulation protocol which is thought to lead to a suppression of activity during the first 100 to 200 ms after a TMS pulse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Silvanto &amp; Pascual-Leone (2008)</xref>. Meta-analytic evidence has corroborated that rTMS at a frequency range from 10 Hz and 20 Hz can disrupt attention, executive function, language, memory, motor, and perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Beynel et al. (2019)</xref>. As such, this protocol has been successfully used for perturbing higher cognitive functions in event-related designs similar to the one employed in the current study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kennerley et al.

(2008)</xref>). Importantly, this protocol allowed us to stimulate the respective target areas during all 400 no-think trials while complying with standard safety guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rossi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rossini et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Specifically, on each trial, we delivered bursts of five 10 Hz rTMS pulses (100 ms inter-pulse interval) that lasted for 400 ms. For each of the two stimulation sites, this resulted in a total of 500 TMS pulses. We used an intertrial interval of 3 s to minimize (i) carry-over effects of stimulation from one trial to another, (ii) and summation of excitability due to trans-synaptic communication, while (iii) staying within safety limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rossi et al. 2021</xref>). Our interstimulus interval of three seconds has previously been shown to prevent any spill-over effects from one trial to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hamidi et al. (2011)</xref> see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Julkunen et al. (2012)</xref>). Indeed, the effective gap between stimulations was even longer in this study, because the suppress trials alternated with recall trials during which we did not apply any stimulation.</p><p id="P29">Within each <italic>no-think</italic> trial, we started the stimulation 300 ms after the red cue had appeared on the screen, at a time when its sensory and linguistic properties could already have been processed. Critically, in doing so, we targeted a time window that likely marks the earliest deployment of inhibitory processes in the service of memory suppression as indicated by the emergence of a frontal negative event-related potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hellerstedt et al. 2016</xref>). We thus assumed that our stimulation would interfere with the suppression process early on.</p><p id="P30">We adapted the stimulation intensity based on each participant’s individual resting motor threshold (rMT), defined as the minimal intensity required to elicit a motor-evoked potential (MEP) of at least 50 μV in five out of ten consecutive TMS pulses to the primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rothwell et al. 1999</xref>). In an intake session, prior to the main experimental session, we measured the rMT with single TMS pulses (0.2 Hz) for the right first dorsal interosseous muscle.</p><p id="P31">To measure the individual resting motor threshold, electromyography (EMG) electrodes were connected to a patient amplifier system (D-360, DigitimerLtd., UK, Welwyn Garden City; bandpass filtered from 10 Hz to 2 kHz), which in turn was connected to a data acquisition interface (Power1401 MK-II, CED Ltd., UK, Cambridge, 4 kHz sampling rate). Electromyography was recorded using the Signal software (CED, version 4.11).</p><p id="P32">Adopting a conservative approach, we began stimulating at a 35% intensity and gradually increased intensity in steps of 1% to 3% while systematically searching for the coil position, tilt, and orientation that most reliably generated MEPs. We adjusted each participant’s individual stimulator intensity to 90% rMT for the subsequent experimental session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rossini et al. 2015</xref>).

For this, participants were given a list with all cues from the No-Think condition. For each cue, they indicated the proportion of trials on which they had successfully kept the target out of mind, using a scale ranging from 0% to 100% in steps of 25%. A lower score corresponds to a greater difficulty in suppressing the respective memory. We calculated and compared the average response for all items in the dlPFC and in the M1 conditions. The questionnaire did not indicate which item belonged to which experimental condition. Other studies have more directly assessed the difficulty of suppressing a memory by having people rate, on a trial-by-trial basis, whether a memory had involuntarily intruded into their awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gagnepain et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Legrand et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Levy &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>). We opted for an offline measure, however, to avoid potential confounds in the interpretation of any TMS effects.

Specifically, using open questions, it asked participants whether they had experienced any distracting muscle twitches and, if so, which parts of their body had been affected. If participants reported twitches around the right eye or temple, we coded this to have occurred as a consequence of right dlPFC stimulation. If they reported twitches of the right arm or hand, we coded this as having occurred due to left M1 stimulation. In cases where a participant reported both but did not clearly state which one was more distracting, we counted this as <italic>both</italic>. When in doubt, we conservatively coded greater distraction to have occurred as a consequence of right dlPFC stimulation.

Previous neuroimaging evidence has assigned a key role to this region in preventing the intrusion of unwanted memories. A stronger engagement of the right dlPFC leads to a steeper decline in the frequency with which unwanted memories intrude into awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>), and it has also sometimes been associated with stronger suppression-induced forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Anderson et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hanslmayr et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Here, we complemented the correlational evidence from neuroimaging by testing for the necessary involvement of the right dlPFC in memory control. We disrupted the suppression process via a 10 Hz rTMS stimulation over the right dlPFC and included, as an active control site, stimulation over contralateral M1. Critically, our design allowed us to assess the contribution of the dlPFC to two facets of suppression: (i) people’s transient ability to prevent unwanted retrieval and (ii) the sustained <italic>aftereffect</italic> of this process, i.e., suppression-induced forgetting.</p><p id="P57">The right dlPFC has been suggested to transiently prevent unwanted memory intrusions by eliciting a targeted inhibition of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Anderson et al. 2004</xref>) and of other regions involved in encoding the memory’s neural trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Benoit et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Depue et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagnepain et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Meyer &amp; Benoit 2022</xref>). The right dlPFC would thus contribute to the reduction of a memory’s intrusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Levy &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>), hinder its subsequent neural reactivation and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Meyer &amp; Benoit 2022</xref>), reduce its vividness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Meyer &amp; Benoit 2022</xref>) and eventually cause forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anderson &amp; Hulbert 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Stramaccia et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P58">This model of top-down modulation has been supported by several neuroimaging studies that reported stronger functional connectivity between the dlPFC and hippocampus during suppression. Using dynamic causal modeling, some of these provided specific evidence for a directed modulation of hippocampal activity originating from the dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Apšvalka et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagnepain et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mary et al. 2020</xref>). At the structural level, this top-down modulation could be accomplished via excitatory pathways from the prefrontal cortex onto inhibitory neurons in the entorhinal cortex or via the nucleus reuniens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P59">In the present study, we examined whether perturbing activity in the right dlPFC makes it more difficult to suppress unwanted memories. On average, participants reported that they were less successful at preventing memories from entering awareness during the targeted stimulation of the right dlPFC than of the active control site. We thus obtained evidence that the right dlPFC causally contributes to transiently preventing the retrieval of unwanted memories.</p><p id="P60">One potential confound to consider is whether dlPFC stimulation may have caused greater discomfort and thereby may have distracted participants from deploying. We addressed this question by asking whether they experienced any TMS stimulation as distracting, especially due to possible muscle twitches, and, if so, which stimulation site they felt was more distracting. Their responses did not indicate a stronger impact of stimulating either site. However, future studies may more systematically assess any physiological sensations induced by the two stimulation conditions.</p><p id="P61">This distraction measure, however, did not allow us to isolate the precise TMS side effects at each stimulation site such as the overall pain or intensity of muscle twitches. Given that prefrontal stimulation may be experienced as more aversive, future studies may want to assess these possible effects in more detail.</p><p id="P62">Our evidence for an effect of right dlPFC stimulation is less conclusive with respect to the sustained aftereffects. We indeed only observed suppression-induced forgetting for memories that people tried to suppress with concurrent M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the critical comparison of these stimulation conditions was not significant. We thus did not obtain direct evidence that dlPFC stimulation leads to reduced SIF compared with M1 stimulation.</p><p id="P63">There are several potential reasons for this absence of evidence. First, it is conceivable that the dlPFC only contributes to the momentary prevention of unwanted retrieval but not directly to the ensuing forgetting. Given the cited evidence linking the top-down modulation to forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Apšvalka et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benoit &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Depue et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagnepain et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mary et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Paz-Alonso et al. 2013</xref>), we suggest that this is a rather unlikely account. It certainly would also be less parsimonious than postulating a common process that yields both a transient and a sustained effect.</p><p id="P64">Second, overall, recall performance was close to ceiling in all conditions, indicating that memories were generally strong in our experiment. This was probably a consequence of the elaborate test-feedback procedure that we had implemented to ensure a sufficient learning rate of the large stimulus set. We might have observed stronger SIF in the M1 condition if the initial encoding strength of the M1 memories had been weaker. In this case, the procedure would have been more powerful for detecting a detrimental effect of the dlPFC stimulation on intentional forgetting.</p><p id="P65">Third, due to technical constraints and safety regulations, we only applied TMS during 400 ms of each suppression trial. We had carefully chosen our time window to increase the chance that we would disrupt the early stages of the suppression phase. This may have been sufficient to hinder people’s ability to control unwanted memories compared with the M1 condition. However, the remaining time of the trial and the subsequent fixation period may have provided sufficient opportunity to suppress the memories to some degree.</p><p id="P66">Indeed, our instructions stressed that participants were required not only to prevent the retrieval of the memory but also to push it out of awareness if it came to mind by accident. Accordingly, participants may still have reactively engaged in suppression to purge the intruded memory, even when initial attempts at stopping retrieval failed due to dlPFC stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Benoit et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Levy &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>). Indeed, although our questionnaire data demonstrated that participants were hindered in their ability to suppress memories, they did not indicate a total inability to keep the memories out of awareness.</p><p id="P67">Fourth, though the E-field modeling corroborates that our manipulation likely affected dlPFC functioning, we do not suggest that it inflicted a complete functional disruption of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bergmann &amp; Hartwigsen 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hartwigsen &amp; Silvanto 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Numssen et al. 2024</xref>). The residual functioning of this region may have induced some degree of forgetting – though it was not sufficiently strong to become significant, it may have been strong enough to minimize the difference to the M1 condition.</p><p id="P68">Taken together, these points suggest that the transient ability to prevent a memory from coming to mind may be more sensitive to the impact of the dlPFC stimulation than suppression-induced forgetting. However, the obtained evidence for a disruption of memory suppression is consistent with other evidence from non-invasive brain stimulation on the contribution of the right dlPFC to active forgetting. For example, transcranial direct current stimulation of the right dlPFC disrupts the phenomenon that targeted retrieval of some memories leads to the incidental forgetting of other, competing memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Penolazzi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Stramaccia et al. 2017</xref>), i.e., retrieval-induced forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson et al. 1994</xref>). It also seems to prevent intentional forgetting at encoding (i.e., directed forgetting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Imbernón et al. (2022)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Silas &amp; Brandt (2016)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stauch et al. (2020)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Xie et al. (2020)</xref>). The current study complements this finding by showing that disrupting the right dlPFC also makes it harder to intentionally control unwanted memories at the retrieval stage.</p><p id="P69">Intriguingly, the right dlPFC may support an even broader function in initiating inhibitory control. fMRI and EEG studies have provided evidence that a common part of this region is involved in both suppressing memories and suppressing motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Apšvalka et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Castiglione et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Depue et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Depue et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Guo et al. 2018</xref>).Consistent with this account, evidence from non-invasive brain stimulation has demonstrated that interfering with activity in this region impairs the inhibition of prepotent motor responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hannah et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Obeso et al. (2013)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Stramaccia et al. (2015)</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that the right dlPFC may be part of a supramodal inhibitory control mechanism deputed to stop a variety of prepotent responses across different cognitive domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wessel &amp; Anderson 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P70">This study provides the first causal evidence for a role of the dlPFC in suppressing unwanted memories. However, future research could be benefit from addressing several key points. First, in light of the current data, it should ideally employ larger sample sizes to achieve sufficient power to detect also more subtle changes in SIF. Second, future studies may more precisely equate the strength of the induced E-field at the respective stimulation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Numssen et al. 2024</xref>), to further bolster inferences about the spatial specificity of the obtained effects. Third, future research could incorporate trial-by-trial intrusion ratings, to obtain an online measure of memory control. In the present study, we measured intrusion control with a post-experimental questionnaire to avoid additional meta-cognitive task demands. Trial-by-trial ratings of intrusions, however, may be a more sensitive and reliable measure of the disruptions induced by TMS. It would thus be particularly adequate to examine how the transient disruption of dlPFC activity changes the typical association between declining intrusions and long-term forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Legrand et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Levy &amp; Anderson 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P71">That being said, it is important to note that including such online ratings may alter the metacognitive structure of the task. In having to reflect on the immediately preceding trial, participants may inadvertently think and thus elaborate on the memory that had just intruded. It may also add to an expectation of a final memory test, which may entice participants to rehearse No-Think memories. If so, these changes in the task might potentially weaken SIF effects. Moreover, responding on each trial via button press may potentially also interact with stimulation.</p><p id="P72">Finally, future work should build on this study to examine the contributions and interactions of other regions. Of particular interest may be those parietal areas involved in bottom-up attentional capture and top-down processes underlying the retrieval of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cabeza 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cabeza et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hutchinson et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sestieri et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P73">To conclude, this study provides critical evidence that disruption of the right dlPFC makes it harder to control unwanted memories. It causes a transient disruption of a suppression mechanism, corroborating the hypothesis that this region initiates an inhibitory process that interferes with hippocampal retrieval. However, given the inconclusive results with respect to suppression-induced forgetting, it remains to be determined whether these disruptions can also weaken the sustained after-effects of this process. Nevertheless, the presented data provide the first evidence for the causal contribution of the dlPFC to retrieval suppression.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work as well as DFS, FB, KL, and RGB were funded by a Max Planck Research Group awarded to RGB.

study phase, participants learned associations between pairs of cue and target words (stimuli are translated from the original German for illustration), without knowing that the pairs would appear in different conditions later. In the subsequent Think/No-Think phase, they recalled target words prompted with green cues, whereas they attempted to suppress the retrieval of targets prompted with red cues. During these trials, we either stimulated the left M1 (as an active control site) or right dlPFC. Targets from the Baseline condition were not cued during this phase. They thus serve as a baseline measure of memory performance on the two final memory tests. After the final recall tests, participants filled out a post-experimental questionnaire. Here, they were given a list of all No-Think cues and judged to what degree they were able to keep the associated targets out of mind during the TNT task.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202410-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>A)</bold> Anatomically specific stimulation of the cortical targets.
