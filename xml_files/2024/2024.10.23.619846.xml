Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold. PAD12 tau will be a useful tool for the study of molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The assembly of tau into amyloid filaments characterises a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are called tauopathies. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common tauopathy. Whereas in most tauopathies tau is the only protein that assembles into filaments, in AD intracellular assemblies of tau co-exist with extracellular plaques of filamentous amyloid-β.</p><p id="P4">Six tau isoforms, with lengths ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids, are expressed in the adult human brain by alternative mRNA splicing from a single gene (<italic>MAPT</italic>). The tau sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) comprises an amino-terminal projection domain (residues 1-150), a proline-rich region (residues 151-243), four microtubule-binding repeats (R1-R4; residues 244-368) and a carboxy-terminal domain (residues 369-441). Tau isoforms vary by the incorporation of zero, one, or two inserts of 29 amino acids at the amino-terminal domain (0N, 1N or 2N isoforms) and the presence or absence of the second microtubule-binding repeat, resulting in three- or four-repeat (3R or 4R) tau isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goedert et al., 1989</xref>). A mixture of all six tau isoforms is present in AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), whilst only 3R tau assembles in Pick’s disease, and only 4R tau assembles in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), globular glial tauopathy (GGT) and argyrophilic grain disease (AGD).</p><p id="P5">Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that specific folds of assembled tau define different tauopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). Residues from the microtubule-binding repeats plus approximately 10 residues from the carboxy-terminal domain are ordered in tau filaments from the different diseases. In tau filaments from AD and several other diseases, the remaining residues are disordered, forming a fuzzy coat that surrounds the ordered core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wischik et al., 1988</xref>). Intriguingly, with the exception of a familial tauopathy caused by a P301T mutation in tau (Schweighauser et al., 2024), only a single tau fold has been observed for each disease, whereas multiple individuals with a given disease always had the same filaments. The consistent structure of tau filaments across individuals with the same tauopathy supports the prion hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Prusiner, 1998</xref>), in which tau filaments propagate their structure through templated misfolding.</p><p id="P6">The specific tau folds that form and propagate in the human brain may be influenced by the cellular environments where they assemble. Model systems used to study tauopathies should therefore replicate the same tau folds observed in diseased human brains. However, this has proven challenging. For instance, when recombinant wild-type (WT) full-length tau is assembled <italic>in vitro</italic>, it requires the addition of negatively charged molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goedert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kampers et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pérez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wilson and Binder, 1997</xref>), but the structures of tau filaments assembled in the presence of heparin or RNA are unlike those extracted from human brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abskharon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lövestam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, attempts to reproduce disease-specific tau filaments by over-expressing full-length human tau in SH-SY5Y cells, combined with seeding using human brain-derived tau filaments, did not recapitulate the structures of AD or CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tarutani et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, mice over-expressing 4R tau with the P301S mutation under the control of different promoters form tau filaments with different structures, suggesting that different promoters may cause filament assembly in distinct cell types, affecting which tau fold forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schweighauser et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>). None of the tau filament structures from mouse models were identical to those observed in human brains.</p><p id="P7">We previously reported that, under shaking conditions, the truncated tau construct comprising residues 297-391 (tau297-391) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Al-Hilaly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Novak et al., 1993</xref>) assembles into paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are the main filament type in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lövestam et al., 2022</xref>). The addition of sodium chloride to the assembly reaction of tau297-391 led to the formation of CTE filaments. Subsequent time-resolved cryo-EM studies revealed that formation of the disease-specific structures occurs through many intermediate amyloid filaments, with a common first intermediate amyloid (FIA) observed in the assembly of AD and CTE filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>). But unlike filaments isolated from AD brains which contain full-length tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee et al., 1991</xref>), filaments of tau297-391 lack the fuzzy coat that is typical of tau filaments inside brain cells.</p><p id="P8">Besides the cellular environment in which they assemble, different tau folds may also be determined by chemical modifications of tau itself. PHF-tau from the brains of individuals with AD is hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>); this is believed to precede filament assembly to which it has been linked. Hyperphosphorylation of tau may also accelerate aggregation indirectly by detaching tau from microtubules. Mass spectrometry and epitope mapping of antibodies that were raised against PHFs from AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Greenberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mercken et al., 1992</xref>) led to the identification of multiple sites, all in the fuzzy coat of tau, that are hyperphosphorylated in PHFs from AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Monoclonal antibody AT270 recognises phosphorylation of threonine 181 (T181); AT8 recognises phosphorylation of serine 202 (S202) and threonine 205 (T205), AT100 recognises phosphorylation of T212, S214 and T217, AT180 recognises phosphorylation of T231 and S235, and PHF-1 recognises phosphorylation of S396 and S404. A comprehensive mass spectrometry map of post-translational modifications confirmed that these residues are hyperphosphorylated in assembled tau from AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wesseling et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Based on these observations, we previously designed four phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau (S396D, S400D, T403D and S404D) that allowed the assembly of recombinant tau297-441 into filaments with the Alzheimer fold, albeit only with a single protofilament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lövestam et al., 2022</xref>). A similar construct was also shown to be suitable for the production of large amounts of isotope-labelled protein for NMR, but again it yielded filaments with the Alzheimer protofilament fold, but with protofilament packings distinct from those in PHFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duan et al., 2024b</xref>). Additionally, a tau construct with phosphomimetic mutations in the proline-rich region (S202E, T205E, S208E), as well in the carboxy-terminal region (S396E, S400E, T403E, S404E) was found to assemble, but the filaments formed were again distinct from those found in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Mammeri et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We hypothesised that the introduction of additional phosphomimetic mutations in the proline-rich region of tau might facilitate the assembly of recombinant full-length tau. Based on the epitopes of antibodies and the mass spectrometry data described above, we mutated eight residues within the proline-rich region of tau (T181, S202, T205, T212, S214, T217, T231 and S235) to aspartate. Combined with the four previously described mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau, this resulted in twelve phosphomimetic mutations in full-length tau, nine of which were in serine/threonine-proline motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We show that these mutations, which we refer to as twelve phosphomimetics of AD, or PAD12, allow both nucleation-dependent and seeded assembly of full-length recombinant tau into PHFs, thereby opening new avenues for studying the role of tau’s fuzzy coat in the molecular mechanisms of disease. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which phosphorylation in the fuzzy coat of tau leads to filament formation, and they indicate that the hyperphosphorylation of tau at specific sites may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold from full-length protein.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Assembly of PAD12 full-length tau into PHFs</title><p id="P11">0N3R and 0N4R versions of PAD12 tau were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly under shaking conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <bold>Methods</bold>). Assembly was carried out with 500 rpm orbital shaking (2 min on; 1 min off) for 7 days at a protein concentration of 100 µM in a buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.2, 400 mM potassium citrate and 4 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). We used cryo-EM to determine the structures of the resulting filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). 0N3R-PAD12 tau primarily formed paired helical filaments (PHFs) (85%), with a minor population (15%) of single protofilaments with the Alzheimer fold. The remainder of the filaments, including false positives from automated filament picking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lövestam and Scheres, 2022</xref>), were discarded during image processing. 0N4R-PAD12 tau assembled into filaments consisting only of a single protofilament with the CTE fold. It is possible that small amounts of sodium chloride in the protein sample led to the formation of protofilaments with the CTE fold. The observation that part of the second microtubule-binding repeat is ordered, forming cross-beta packing against the third repeat, may be related to this construct forming filaments with only a single protofilament.</p><p id="P12">Because tau filaments from AD brains contain equimolar amounts of 3R and 4R tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Goedert et al., 1992</xref>), we assembled a 1:1 mixture of 0N3R-PAD12 and 0N4R-PAD12 tau under identical conditions. Again, we observed predominantly PHFs (72%), with a minority of singlets with the Alzheimer tau fold (28%). The PHFs are identical to those found in AD brains, with a backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further increase the proportions of PHFs-to-singlet ratio, we removed the plate from the shaker after one week and incubated it quiescently at 37 ºC for two more weeks. This resulted in 100% PHFs formed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4</xref>). When repeated seven times, on average 95.3% PHFs formed, with 25% of singlets formed in a single outlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PHFs of PAD12 tau are not sticky and form under various shaking conditions</title><p id="P13">While several groups have replicated our finding that tau297-391 assembles into PHFs, filament formation has required further optimisation of the assembly conditions, and the formation of other filament types has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duan et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Glynn et al., 2024</xref>). We previously showed that multiple filament types exist in the assembly reactions that are on-pathway to form PHFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>). Another possible reason for the difficulties in reproducibility may be that the assembly of tau297-391 is sensitive to shaking conditions, with different structures forming when shaking is performed at 200 or at 700 rpm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lövestam et al., 2022</xref>). The physical forces inside the assembly reaction vessel due to shaking are likely more difficult to control than the biochemical components of the reaction mixtures. For example, different shaking machines, or differently shaped vessels with different volumes, may all lead to different forces. The observation that the assembly of 100 μl of 0N3R-PAD12 tau inside an Eppendorf LoBind microcentrifuge tube, with orbital shaking at 500 rpm in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C, led to the formation of PHFs with the Alzheimer fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 3A</xref>) suggests that the assembly of full-length PAD12 tau is less dependent on the physics of shaking than the assembly of tau297-391.</p><p id="P14">Another disadvantage of tau297-391 PHFs is that they tend to clump together, especially after prolonged storage or freeze-thawing. Clumping of filaments complicates cryo-EM structure determination and may interfere with subsequent experiments, such as binding studies of small-molecule compounds or seeding experiments in cell culture and in animals. In contrast to tau297-391, almost all micrographs of full-length PAD12 tau showed individually dispersed filaments, even after assembled filaments were kept at 4ºC for two months, or flash-frozen at -196ºC and then thawed at RT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). The observation that tau 0-391 and 151-391 3R PAD12 tau constructs also did not clump together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3D,E</xref>) suggests that the absence of an amino-terminal fuzzy coat contributes to the stickiness of tau297-391 filaments.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Different phosphorylation patterns lead to different filaments</title><p id="P15">We first tested whether the PAD12 mutations could also be made using glutamates instead of aspartates by substituting all 12 aspartates into glutamates. The resulting structures were again PHFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, to test whether the formation of AD PHFs depends on the specific PAD12 mutations, we tested another three 0N3R tau constructs with different mutations. In the first construct (PAD12-4), we removed four of the eight phosphomimetic mutations in the proline-rich region, leaving only T181D, S202D, T217D, and S235D. In the second construct (PAD12+4), we added four phosphomimetic mutations that also had high levels of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry of AD tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wesseling et al., 2020</xref>) (T153D, S237D, S262D and T263D). In the third construct (PAD12+/-4), we removed the same four mutations as in the first construct and added the same four new mutations as in the second construct, resulting in the same net charge as in the original PAD12 construct. Assembly of the 0N3R versions of these constructs, under the same orbital shaking conditions as before, led to the formation of filaments in all three cases. However, the filaments formed with the PAD12+4, PAD12-4 or PAD12+/-4 constructs had morphologies that were distinct from those of PHFs; they did not twist and we were thus not able to determine their structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PAD12 tau filaments can be labelled</title><p id="P16">Next, we explored the ability to label filaments of PAD12 tau using NHS-ester chemistry, which specifically targets primary amines in lysine residues. Fluorescently labelled filaments may be useful, for example, to follow seeding reactions in cells by optical microscopy. We labelled pre-assembled 0N3R-PAD12 tau filaments with DyLight-488, Alexa-647, Atto-647, Atto-565 and CF-680. We observed a fluorescent pellet after ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Cryo-EM of the resulting filaments confirmed that the PHF structure remained intact in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We also explored whether filaments of PAD12 tau can be biotinylated using the same NHS-ester chemistry. Biotinylation is used for protein selection and for studying protein-protein interactions by proximity labelling. Immuno-gold EM with 10 nm gold-conjugated streptavidin confirmed that pre-assembled 0N3R-PAD12 tau filaments can be extensively biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>In vitro seeded assembly with PAD12 tau</title><p id="P18">Next, we investigated whether AD brain-derived tau filaments could seed the assembly of PAD12 tau, and if this seeding could be sustained over more than one round. We introduced sonicated AD brain-derived tau filaments to a solution of 40 μM (~1.5 μg/μL) 0N3R-PAD12 tau and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly under orbital shaking at 500 rpm (2 min on; 1 min off) for 48 h in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.3, 4 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.2, 300 mM sodium citrate and 4 mM TCEP. Under the same conditions, but without the addition of AD seeds, we observed no filament formation within 48 hrs. Although we only used extracts from 0.8 μg of AD brain tissue for reactions that contained 60 μg of recombinant (unlabelled) PAD12 tau, we observed no lag phase in Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence upon addition of the seeds. Instead, ThT fluorescence increased linearly directly after the seeds were added and fluorescence plateaued after 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cryo-EM analysis confirmed that the seeded tau filaments were predominantly (73%) PHFs (with a backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å with PDB-ID 6hre), along with a minority of single protofilaments with the Alzheimer fold (8.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">It was recently reported that <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly of wild-type 0N3R tau can be seeded with large amounts of AD brain-derived filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Duan et al., 2024a</xref>). The seeded filaments were shown to be PHFs, but they were not capable of seeding the assembly of wild-type 0N3R tau in a second round of seeded assembly. To test whether this is also the case for PAD12 tau, we used filaments from the first round at an estimated ratio of 1:2,500 to recombinant (unlabelled) PAD12 tau for a second round of seeded assembly. We again observed a rapid increase in ThT fluorescence directly after addition of the seeds, and cryo-EM analysis of the seeded aggregates still showed PHFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), indicating that PAD12 tau can be used for multiple rounds of seeded aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Seeding of tau reporter cells with PAD12 PHFs</title><p id="P20">We then used a biosensor cell line that overexpresses hemagglutinin (HA-)tagged tau297-391 in HEK293T cells (see <bold>Methods</bold>) and compared its seeding response to increasing amounts of PHFs made with tau297-391, PAD12 0N3R or PAD12 0N3R:0N4R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). These cells also yielded robust seeding, in a concentration-dependent manner, when exposed to seeds extracted from AD brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5 – Figure supplement 1A</xref>). Comparing the recombinant PHFs of tau297-391 and PAD12 0N3R or PAD12 0N3R:0N4R tau, we observed efficient seeding at low concentrations (~5 ng) of PAD12 PHFs, whereas tau297-391 did not lead to seeding at the same concentrations. At higher concentrations, seeding with tau297-391 PHFs was less efficient and showed greater variability among replicates than seeding with PAD12 PHFs. Using appropriate excitation and emission settings to visualise seeds of PAD12 0N3R filaments that were labelled with DyLight-488 inside the biosensor cells, we observed colocalization of the original seeds with the HA-297-391 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain affect the FIA region</title><p id="P21">We used solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to explore the effects of PAD12 mutations on the tau monomer. Because of size limitations imposed by this technique, we used two truncated tau constructs. The first construct comprised residues 151-391 of 4R tau, with or without the eight phosphomimetic mutations of PAD12 in the proline-rich region. The second construct comprised residues 297-441 of 4R tau, with or without the four phosphomimetic mutations of PAD12 in the carboxy-terminal domain.</p><p id="P22">The effects of the phosphomimetic mutations in the proline-rich region of the tau151-391 construct were subtle. Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) between wild-type and PAD12 tau151-391 were largest around residues 198-222, which harboured mutations at S202, T205, S212, S214 and T217, and around residues 237–244, which were adjacent to the mutations at T231 and S235 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1A; Figure 6 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of the backbone Cα and Cβ chemical shifts (which are sensitive to back bone torsion angles) revealed little difference in secondary structure propensity in the 297-391 region between wild-type tau151-391, PAD12 tau151-391 and tau297-391 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1B</xref>), or in the proline-rich region of wild-type and PAD12 tau151-391 (although its 26 prolines may prevent any potential alterations to secondary structure). Heteronuclear NOE (HetNOE) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1C</xref>), which reports on picosecond time scale backbone mobility, revealed increased rigidity of PAD12 tau151-391 compared to wild-type tau151-391, predominately around the mutation sites. Relative peak intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1D</xref>), showed some differences in the proline-rich region, where peak attenuation indicated greater conformational sampling for wild-type tau151-391 than for PAD12 tau151-391. However, the subtle differences between these two constructs do not suggest an obvious reason for the increased propensity of the PAD12 tau151-391 to form filaments.</p><p id="P23">By contrast, comparison of wild-type and PAD12 tau297-441 revealed interesting differences. Secondary chemical shift analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3A</xref>) suggested that residues 393–404, which harbour the four mutation sites, had an increased propensity to adopt extended conformations in the PAD12 construct, possibly because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged aspartates. Residues 405–407 exhibited a strong preference for helical backbone torsion angles, indicating the presence of a turn-like structure, in the PAD12 construct, but not in wild-type tau297-441. The effect of the phosphomimetic mutations on these residues was also echoed in the CSPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3B; Figure 6 – figure supplement 4</xref>). HetNOE analysis suggests that the PAD12 construct is more rigid on the picosecond timescale than wild-type tau297-441 between residues 305-311 and 398–412 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3C</xref>).

We previously hypothesised that partial rigidity of these residues in tau297-391 monomers may reduce the entropic cost of nucleating new filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>). The observation that, by hetNOE analysis, the same region appears more rigid in PAD12 tau297-441 than in wild-type tau297-441 may contribute to the ability of the former to assemble into filaments. In addition, it could be that the reduced peak intensities for residues 297-319 and 392-404 stem from conformational exchange broadening as a result of a transient intramolecular interaction between their respective IVYK motifs in repeat 3 (residues 308-311) and in the carboxy-terminal region (residues 392-395). Such a hairpin-like interaction, which may resemble that between the two protofilaments of the FIA, could inhibit filament formation in the absence of phosphomimetic mutations. A similar interaction, which was also impeded by phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain (S396E and S404E), has been hypothesised to occur between the microtubule-binding repeat region of tau and its carboxy-terminal domain based on FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jeganathan et al., 2008</xref>). Much earlier, phosphorylation of tau had already been observed to lead to a pronounced change in electrophoretic mobility, which was suggested to reflect a conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lindwall and Cole, 1984</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To investigate this further, we also tested a tau construct comprising residues tau297-441 without the phosphomimetic mutations, but with a deletion of residues <sub>392</sub>IVYK<sub>395</sub> (Δ392-395). Filaments formed rapidly and the cryo-EM structure showed that the ordered core consisted of the amino-terminal part of the construct spanning residues 297-318 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). NMR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 – figure supplement 5B</xref>) showed that the tau297-441 Δ392-395 construct exhibited similar backbone rigidity properties to the tau297-441 PAD12 construct, despite peak locations and local secondary structural propensities being more similar to the wild-type tau297-441 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6 – figure supplement 5A; Figure 6 – figure supplement 6</xref>).

These data suggest that the IVYK deletion has a similar effect as the phosphomimetics on residues 396, 400, 403 and 404 on disrupting an intra-molecular interaction between the FIA core region and the carboxy-terminal domain, which may therefore be mediated by interactions between the two IVYK motifs that are similar to those observed in the FIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Tau filaments that are extracted from the brains of individuals with AD using sarkosyl contain full-length, hyperphosphorylated tau of all six isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Goedert et al., 1992</xref>).

We previously showed that heparin-induced <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly of full-length recombinant tau yields structures that are different from those of filaments extracted from AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), but that truncated tau297-391 can be assembled into PHFs in the absence of cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lövestam et al., 2022</xref>). We also reported that the introduction of four phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau297-441 yields individual protofilaments with the Alzheimer fold. In this paper, we show that an additional eight phosphomimetic mutations in the proline-region rich region are sufficient for the assembly of recombinant full-length tau into PHFs. These findings show for the first time the nucleation-dependent assembly of full-length recombinant tau into PHFs.</p><p id="P27">The proline-rich region of unmodified tau is positively charged. Our findings with the PAD12+4, PAD12-4 and PAD12+/-4 constructs show that the assembly of full-length tau into PHFs is not merely dependent on the introduction of negative charges in this region: which residues are mutated matters too. This is in agreement with studies by others using pseudo-phosphorylation of recombinant tau and phosphorylation of recombinant tau by some protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Haase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that each construct requires its own optimisation of assembly conditions and that constructs with modifications other than those of PAD12 could be made to form PHFs too. Previous studies have reported that phosphorylation or phosphomimetic mutations of different subsets of the PAD12 mutations could lead to the assembly of tau <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alonso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Despres et al., 2017</xref>). However, for none of these studies are cryo-EM structures available to show that the resulting filaments were PHFs. The definition of a minimal set of phosphomimetic mutations that is necessary for the spontaneous assembly of full-length tau into PHFs would require the systematic removal of PAD12 mutations, each with their own optimisation of assembly conditions and cryo-EM structure determination to verify that the correct structures are formed. While such work may yield further insights in the future, we feel that the assembly of PAD12 full-length tau into PHFs warrants dissemination before such explorations are performed.</p><p id="P28">Like tau filaments in disease, and unlike filaments of tau297-391, PAD12 tau filaments have a fuzzy coat. The role of tau’s fuzzy coat in the molecular mechanisms of disease remains poorly understood. For example, AD-seeded PAD12 tau filaments can be used as seeds in a second round of <italic>in vitro</italic> seeded assembly, whereas AD-seeded unmodified tau filaments were reported to be seeding-incompetent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Duan et al., 2024a</xref>), even though both tau constructs formed PHFs in the first round of seeding. It is also possible that the fuzzy coat affects the interactions between tau filaments and cellular components, such as extracellular receptors for the uptake of tau filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De La-Rocque et al., 2021</xref>), or macromolecular complexes that degrade them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koopman et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the fuzzy coat may interfere with the binding of candidate ligands for positron emission tomography or biologics designed to target the ordered cores of tau filaments in disease. Further research to explore the roles of the fuzzy coat and its post-translational modifications is required, and the ability to make PHFs with a fuzzy coat from recombinant PAD12 tau will facilitate this.</p><p id="P29">Hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts its ability to interact with microtubules and has been implicated in filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>). Phosphorylation of the fuzzy coat may facilitate spontaneous filament assembly by reducing the entropic cost of nucleating new filaments. In addition, the negative charges of hyperphosphorylated tau in filaments may actively recruit soluble tau monomers with less phosphorylation through electrostatic attraction. This could explain why the assembly of wild-type full-length tau with large amounts of AD brain-derived seeds worked for a single round of seeding, with the resulting filaments being unable to seed the assembly of wild-type full-length tau in a second round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Duan et al., 2024a</xref>). It is striking that phosphorylation patterns of tau from AD brains exclude residues from the ordered core of the PHF. In agreement, no cryo-EM density for phosphorylation groups is visible in the ordered cores of any of the reported tau filaments from postmortem brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Scheres et al., 2023</xref>). Because the ordered cores of PHFs comprise the third and fourth microtubule-binding domains of tau, it is possible that these residues are protected from phosphorylation, while tau is bound to microtubules. In fact, tau molecules with phosphorylation of the residues in the ordered core of PHFs may not be able to form filaments, due to the size of the phosphate groups and the repulsive forces between their charge.</p><p id="P30">Our NMR data provide insights into the mechanism by which phosphorylation in the fuzzy coat of tau, or truncations of tau, lead to the assembly of filaments with ordered cores of residues that are themselves not phosphorylated. HSQC peak intensity differences between unmodified tau 297-441, PAD12 tau 297-441 and tau297-391 suggest that phosphorylation of the fuzzy coat, particularly near the <sub>392</sub>IVYK<sub>395</sub> motif in the carboxy-terminal domain, affects the conformation of the residues of tau that become ordered in the FIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>). Removal of residues <sub>392</sub>IVYK<sub>395</sub> in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau 297-441 led to rapid filament formation in the absence of phosphomimetics, while HSQC peak intensity differences for this construct indicate similar backbone rigidity compared to tau 297-441 without the deletion, but with the four PAD12 mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain. Combined, these observations support a model where the <sub>392</sub>IVYK<sub>395</sub> motif in unmodified full-length tau monomers interacts with the <sub>308</sub>IVYK<sub>311</sub> motif, thus inhibiting filament formation by preventing the formation of the nucleating species, the FIA. Phosphorylation of nearby residues 396, 400, 403 and 404, or truncation at residue 391, disrupt this interaction and lead to filament formation. This model agrees with the previously proposed hairpin-like model of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jeganathan et al., 2008</xref>), although the corresponding interaction between the amino-terminal domain of tau and the core-forming region remains unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The observation that PAD12 tau migrates at a higher apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE than predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1</xref>) also supports a model where the PAD12 mutations lead to a more extended conformation. It is possible that phosphorylation of tau in its normal physiological role of regulating microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>) does not extend to all the residues that are required for filament assembly, but this may sometimes be the case. It remains to be seen if tau filaments form occasionally as a result of this physiological regulation, followed by their degradation, or if tau filament formation is always the consequence of a pathological event.</p><p id="P31">It could be that distinct post-translational modification patterns are important for the assembly of tau into protofilament folds that are specific for the other tauopathies. To explore this, similar approaches as described here for AD could be applied to other tauopathies, provided proteomics data on tau filaments from these diseases becomes available. In the meantime, the present findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau is sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer fold. It remains to be seen if other post-translational modifications of tau can also give rise to PHFs. The ability to form PHFs from recombinant PAD12 tau will enable further research into the molecular mechanisms of tau aggregation and its role in AD. The observations that PAD12 tau filaments can be labelled, and that individual filaments are stable in solution for weeks, will facilitate their use in the seeding of tau in cells and in animals, as well as for high-throughput binding assays with potential therapeutic or diagnostic compounds, and their structure determination. Understanding how and why tau adopts specific folds in the different tauopathies, and whether or how these folds affect the different diseases, may provide new avenues for therapeutic development.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="P32">Tau constructs in pRK172 containing 0N4R or 0N3R cDNA tau were made using <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">García-Nafría et al., 2016</xref>) and transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL competent cells (Agilent) for expression.

Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated using CTFFIND-4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Helical reconstruction was performed in RELION-5.0. Filaments were picked manually or automatically using a modified version of Topaz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lövestam and Scheres, 2022</xref>). Picked particles were extracted in box sizes of 1024, 768 or 512 pixels and down-scaled to 256, 128 or 64 pixels for initial 2D classifications. We performed reference-free 2D classification for 35 iterations with 150-200 classes, ignoring the CTF until the first peak, to assess overall filament quality, presence of different polymorphs and crossover distances. Polymorphs were separated by the hierarchical clustering approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lövestam et al., 2024</xref>) and quantified by counting the number of segments in the filament clusters that were identified by this method. Additional 2D classifications were run for each identified cluster, iterating the procedure until homogenous populations of 2D classes were generated. Particles that did not give rise to 2D class averages with suitable filaments were discarded in the quantifications of polymorphs. Initial 3D references were generated by 2D class averages using relion_helix_inimodel2d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Scheres, 2020</xref>). Selected particles were re-extracted in boxes of 384 pixels for initial 3D refinement. Subsequently, 3D classifications and 3D auto-refinements were used to optimise helical parameters and improve the reconstructions, applying symmetry where necessary. Bayesian polishing and CTF refinements were used to increase resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zivanov et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">2019</xref>).
