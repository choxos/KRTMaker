On the contrary, the development of cardiovascular drugs is experiencing a decline, largely due to the bottleneck in understanding the pathophysiology of various heart diseases and assessing the effects of drugs on healthy human hearts. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and the availability of cardiac cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>, has resulted in a surge in efforts to fabricate human cardiac models for disease modelling and drug discovery applications. Although numerous attempts evidence successful fabrication of 3 dimensional (3D) engineered heart tissues, the innate immune cell population of the myocardium – particularly cardiac macrophages, was until recently, overlooke. With increasing appreciation of the interactions between cardiomyocytes and macrophages in the myocardium, in this work, isogenic populations of cardiac resident-like macrophages and cardiomyocytes were generated using iPSCs, to understand the interactions between the two cell types in both 2D and 3D settings, and subjected to electric stimulation. After characterizing iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) in depth, the conditioning of iMacs to align to a cardiac resident macrophage-like phenotype in the presence of iCMs in 2D culture was explored. In co-culture with iCMs, iMacs upregulated known genes expressed by cardiac resident macrophages. Additionally, in co-culture with iMacs, iCMs displayed an elongated morphology, improved calcium function and an increase in known maturation genes such as the ratio between MYH7 and MYH6 as well as SERCA2. In a 2D setting, iMacs showed the ability to electrically couple with iCMs and facilitate synchronous beating in iCM cultures. The 2D characterisation was translated into an engineered cardiac tissue model, wherein, improvement in tissue characteristics in the presence of iMacs was demonstrated in terms of increased cell alignment, enhanced cardiomyocyte elongation, physiologically relevant beat rates and improved tissue compaction. Taken together, these findings may open new avenues to use iMacs in engineered cardiac tissue models, not only as an innate immune cell source, but also as a support cell type to improve cardiomyocyte function and maturation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cardiac diseases, ranging from arrhythmias to heart failure, represent a formidable global health burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], posing a significant challenge to medical science and making cardiac diseases one of the leading causes of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Until recently, our endeavours to comprehend and address these conditions were hindered by the limitations of conventional research practices, often reliant on animal models whose physiological nuances do not faithfully translate to the complexities of the human cardiovascular system. Animal cells, while valuable for certain studies, often fail to capture the intricacies of human cardiac physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has prompted significant improvement in our ability to reproduce the cellular landscape of human myocardium <italic>in vitro</italic> and understand their interactions with each other. <italic>In vitro</italic> models of the myocardium have evolved over the years, with researchers exploring various cell compositions and scaffold materials to mimic native cardiac tissue.</p><p id="P3">Commonly explored <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the myocardium range from self-assembling organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], to organ-on-a-chip models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and engineered heart and cardiac tissue models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. While cardiomyocytes are a central component of these models, incorporating supporting cell types such as fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] has shown promise in enhancing tissue functionality.</p><p id="P4">Despite constituting a relatively small fraction of the total heart cell population, cardiac resident macrophages (CRMs) are the most abundant immune cell type in the myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], involved in governing a myriad of cellular processes including electrical conduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], elimination of cardiac exophers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], facilitation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and limiting adverse remodeling post myocardial infarction (MI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In the past decade, although we have significantly improved our understanding of CRM biology and function, further refinement of our knowledge requires efficient and reliable <italic>in vitro</italic> culture set ups to study CRMs. Thus far, many studies have relied on blood-derived macrophages (BDMs) and immortalised cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], which unfortunately do not reflect the heterogeneity of tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. With limited availability of healthy human donors to study TRMs <italic>in vitro</italic>, novel cell types such as iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) have come to light as a potential candidate, as they share ontogeny with TRMs that develop in an MYB-independent, RUNX1- and SPI1-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Importantly, previous studies have shown the potential of iMacs to mimic TRMs including microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and Kupffer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] by using tissue-specific cues from conditioned media or co-culture with the primary cell type. Recent studies demonstrated the resemblance of human embryonic stem cell-derived macrophages and iMacs cultured in 3D tissues (<italic>Biowire™ II</italic> and engineered heart tissues respectively) to CRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] so we sought to investigate the effects of distinct cardiac cues on iMacs, to derive a reliable CRM-like population <italic>in vitro</italic>. We exposed iMacs to conditioned media from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) or co-cultured them with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs). After assessing the response of iMacs to these cardiac cues, we evaluated the function of iCMs in response to iMacs co-culture. We examined the impact of electrical stimulation (ES) on iCM maturation as well as iMacs polarisation. Finally, we incorporated iMacs into engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) to verify improvement in iCM function at 3D tissue level.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>iMacs express phenotypic and genotypic differences when subjected to cardiac cues</title><p id="P5">Previous studies have modelled blood-derived macrophages (BDMs) and immortalised cell lines such as THP-1 cells to study TRMs <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, we chose to use iMacs as the macrophage source to model CRMs <italic>in vitro</italic>, due to the reported similarities of iMacs to MYB-independent yolk-sac derived TRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. It is critical for TRMs to maintain quiescence until triggered by an external stimulus, such as infection and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To assess the resting state of iMacs we compared the expression of specific genes that mark their phenotypic and functional states with BDMs. As reported in literature, iMacs were found to exhibit highly quiescent characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], with a reduced level of expression of both pro-regenerative (<italic>TGFB</italic>, <italic>MRC1</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic>) and pro-inflammatory genes (<italic>NOS2</italic>, <italic>HIF1A</italic> and <italic>TNF)</italic> compared to BDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1 (a and b)</xref>). The functional capability of iMacs was confirmed by subjecting them to inflammatory triggers such as LPS and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) to obtain a pro-inflammatory response or IL-4 to yield an anti-inflammatory response as previously reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.2</xref>). The absence of CCR2 has been used as a basic benchmark to identify CRMs in the myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, iMacs expressed CCR2 at a lower level than BDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1 (c)</xref>), indicating their potential as a favourable cell source to study CRMs.</p><p id="P6">Having chosen iMacs as the macrophage source, we next sought to establish the appropriate cues to educate iMacs to a more CRM-like fate <italic>in vitro</italic>, by either exposing iMacs to conditioned media from iCMs (iMac_CM) or by performing a co-culture of iMacs with iCMs (iMacs co-culture) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (a)</xref>). Using BDMs and untreated iMacs as controls, iMacs_CM were assessed for the expression of several macrophage cell surface markers. As cardiac macrophages have been reported to express CD14 at high levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], the flow cytometry analysis performed in this study followed a similar gating strategy to previous work by Bajpai <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], thus gating for cell populations expressing CD14. In comparison to BDMs, iMacs and iMacs_CM expressed almost 41% more CD14, highlighting a phenotype more akin to TRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Compared to untreated iMacs, iCM conditioned media treatment was found to increase the CD14<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> population by 67% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (d)</xref>). Upregulation of CCR2 expression was confirmed using immunofluorescence imaging. In line with earlier observations, iMacs were negative for CCR2, while BDMs and iMacs_CM were found to express comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (b and c)</xref>). CCR2 upregulation is typically linked to chemotactic and migratory responses in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Since CRMs are known to be CCR2<sup>-</sup> with high CD14 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], further evaluation of iMacs_CM was performed on the CD14<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup> cell populations. The expression of CX3CR1, which has been previously shown to be abundant in murine CRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], was found to be significantly upregulated in CD14<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup> iMacs_CM by almost 60% in comparison to untreated iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (e)</xref>). Additionally, the expression of HLA-DR, the human equivalent to MHCII, was 25% downregulated in iMacs_CM in comparison to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (f)</xref>). Regardless, iMacs_CM were functionally active, showing comparable phagocytic and polarisation potential to iMacs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 3</xref>). Notably, the response of iMacs_CM to LPS treatment was found to highly suppressed in comparison to LPS treated iMacs, with a 97% downregulation in IL6 release, 91% downregulation in TNFa release and 95% downregulation in IL10 release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 3</xref>). Further functional assessment was performed on iMacs_CM using immunofluorescence imaging. Both iMacs and iMacs_CM expressed connexin-43 (Cx43), with iMacs_CM displaying a 35% upregulation in the expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (g and h)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>iMacs display a more CRM-like phenotype when in co-culture with iCMs</title><p id="P7">With encouraging responses in iMacs following treatment with iCM-conditioned media, the subsequent goal was to investigate how iMacs interact with iCMs in a co-culture setting. In murine hearts, the ratio of cardiomyocytes to CRMs have been reported to be 1:5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, in this study, a 5:1 ratio of iCMs to iMacs was used when performing co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (a)</xref>) based on an average reported by Litviňuková <italic>et al.</italic> using single-cell analysis of adult human atrial and ventricular heart tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Despite iCMs being plated at high cell densities (200,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), iMacs were found to integrate well into iCM cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (b)</xref>), notably into beating patches of iCMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 1</xref>). As previously demonstrated, both iCMs and iMacs express Cx43. In the myocardium, cardiomyocytes and CRMs communicate with each other through Cx43 gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and hence, the expression of Cx43 was assessed. Although shared Cx43 gap junctions could not be isolated in iCM/iMacs co-cultures, both the cell types abundantly expressed Cx43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, to examine potential pro-inflammatory activation of iMacs caused due to iCM media (RPMI media with B27™), secretome from iMacs_CM and iMacs_co-culture were collected and ELISAs were performed for the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Untreated iMacs and iMacs cultured in RPMI media with B27™ (supplemented with 100 ng/ml M-CSF; iMacs_RPMI+B27) were used as controls. TNFa and IL10 productions were found to be similar in all culture conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 5</xref>). However, over 60% more IL6 was found to be present in iMacs_CM and iMacs_RPMI+B27 secretome, potentially indicating mild activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 5</xref>). Notably, iMacs displayed quiescence when in co-culture with iCMs, with strong suppression in their IL6 release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In attempt to further characterise iMacs_CM and iMacs_co-culture, their expression of a panel of genes was assessed, using untreated iMacs as control. While iMacs_CM displayed a highly upregulated pro-regenerative response, with a three-fold increase in <italic>TGFB1</italic> and a two-fold increase in <italic>MRC1</italic> expressions, iMacs_co-culture maintained quiescence, with no difference in their expression of <italic>TGFB1</italic>, <italic>MRC1</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic> in comparison to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (c)</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>NOS2</italic> were comparable between iMacs and iMacs_CM, while iMacs_co-culture exhibited a 90% lower level of TNF and 80% lower level of <italic>NOS2</italic> compared to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (d)</xref>). Notably, previous work by Li <italic>et al.</italic> to study the interaction between cardiomyocytes and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> (using HL-1 and RAW264.7 cell lines), showed a reduced level of expression of pro-inflammatory markers when macrophages are exposed to cardiomyocyte conditioned media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Taken together, these results highlight the differences in the activation states of iMacs_CM and iMacs_co-culture, with iMacs_co-culture displaying a quiescent and anti-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (c and d)</xref>). In addition to the activation states, the functional ability of macrophages is also of great importance. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (<italic>MMP9</italic>) plays a direct role in ECM degradation and activation of cytokines and chemokines, for the regulation of tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, in a number of pathological conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and cancer, high <italic>MMP9</italic> production is highlighted as a biomarker for inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, the deletion of <italic>MMP9</italic> has been proven to be beneficial, to facilitate effective tissue remodeling post-MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. In this study, the expression of <italic>MMP9</italic> was found to be 99% lower in iMacs_co-culture compared to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>), indicating homeostasis and a potential for robust matrix production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The expression levels of <italic>CCR2</italic>, <italic>VEGFA</italic> and <italic>TRPV4</italic> further highlighted the quiescence of iMacs_co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>). In iMacs_CM the expression of <italic>CCR2</italic> transcript was consistent with the protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 (b, c and d)</xref>), with an 85% increase compared to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>). Remarkably, iMacs_co-culture maintained the CCR2<sup>low</sup> phenotype, which is of high significance, much like CRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. In the myocardium, CCR2<sup>+</sup> and CCR2<sup>-</sup> macrophages express TRPV4 in abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. While <italic>TRPV4</italic> and the angiogenesis marker <italic>VEGFA</italic> expressed at significantly higher levels (84% and 48% respectively) in iMacs_CM, the expression level of these genes was comparable between iMacs_co-culture and iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>). Although the quiescence of iMacs_co-culture was evident in most of the genes assessed, their functional potential was highlighted with the expressions of <italic>AREG</italic> and <italic>GJA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>). As previously mentioned, CRMs couple with cardiomyocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> through Cx43 gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Dephosphorylation of Cx43 has been shown to affect cardiac function, by damaging the electrical coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Additionally, more recent studies have demonstrated the role of amphiregulin (AREG), a growth factor produced by CRMs, in carrying out efficient Cx43 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. A 58% upregulation in <italic>AREG</italic> and 84% upregulation in <italic>GJA1</italic> (gene encoding Cx43) was found in iMacs_co-culture when compared to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (e)</xref>). Collectively, these findings highlight the quiescent state of iMacs_co-culture, with a steady downregulation in <italic>CCR2</italic> expression and upregulation in <italic>AREG</italic> and <italic>GJA1</italic> expression, demonstrates an appropriate interaction between iMacs and iCMs.</p><p id="P9">According to most recent studies, macrophage populations in the myocardium include TLF<sup>+</sup> macrophages which are maintained through self-renewal with minimal monocyte input (expressing TIMD4 and/or LYVE1 and/or FOLR2), CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages that are almost entirely replaced by monocytes (TIMD4<sup>−</sup>LYVE1<sup>−</sup>FOLR2<sup>−</sup>), and MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> macrophages that are partially replaced by circulating monocytes (TIMD4<sup>-</sup>LYVE1<sup>-</sup>FOLR2<sup>-</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Observing pronounced differences in the expression of CCR2 between iMacs_CM and iMacs_co-culture (iMacs_CM being CR2<sup>high</sup> and iMacs_co-culture being CCR2<sup>low</sup>), the expression of other known CRM markers such as TIMD4, LYVE1 and FOLR2 was analysed. While iMacs_co-culture showed a 94% increase in TIMD4 expression, iMacs_CM demonstrated a 97.2% increase in LYVE1 expression, compared to iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (f)</xref>). In comparison to iMacs, iMacs_co-culture also exhibited an 89% increase in LYVE1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (f)</xref>). FOLR2 and MERTK were expressed at a comparable level in all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (f)</xref>). The expression of MERTK was also found to be comparable across the three groups, with a subtle trend of upregulation in iMacs_co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 (f)</xref>).</p><p id="P10">During the process of differentiating iMacs, non-adherent monocyte-like macrophage precursors (pre-macs) are collected and matured for 7 days to generate functional iMacs. Pre-macs generated using this protocol are considered ideal precursors for the generation of macrophages resembling key features of TRMs such as alveolar macrophages or microglia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Bearing this in mind, iMacs_CM and iMacs_co-culture were assessed for the expression of cardiac developmental markers, to understand the impact of cardiac cues on iMacs. BDMs were used as the control, to make comparisons.

Taken together, the expression of all genes analysed show that iMacs respond differently to being exposed to iCM conditioned media and to being in physical contact with iCMs. In particular, the responses of iMacs in co-culture with iCMs demonstrate a profile that resembles CRMs, with a downregulation in the expressions of <italic>MMP9 and CCR2</italic>; and an upregulation in the expressions of <italic>AREG, GJA1, TIMD4, LYVE1, GATA4, TBX18 and TBX5</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>iCMs display signs of improved maturation when in co-culture with iMacs</title><p id="P11">Following analyses of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of iMacs in co-culture with iCMs, it was of interest to comprehend the response of iCMs to the presence of iMacs in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 (a)</xref>). In adult hearts, cardiomyocytes exhibit an elongated and rod-shaped morphology, with approximately 65% of them being mononucleated—a percentage that remains relatively constant throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].

Remarkably, a nine-fold (88.8%) increase in expression of <italic>SERCA2</italic> was noted in iCMs in coculture with iMacs, further highlighting their maturation in terms of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 (g)</xref>).

This suggests that the addition of iMacs within iCM cultures could be an excellent solution to facilitating synchronous beating.</p><p id="P14">Following this initial observation, calcium transient read-outs were used to quantify the beat rate of iCMs and iCMs in co-culture with iMacs. Using the same approach as before, different regions of interest were chosen in individual wells of iCM cultures.

It is worth noting that iCMs in co-culture with iMacs exhibited strikingly low variability in terms of their rate of spontaneous beating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 (c)</xref>), indicating synchronous beating of various patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 3</xref>).

Caffeine is also a commonly used drug that increases the beat rate of iCMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and improves their active calcium transients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. In our study, although iCMs did not show a notable increase in beat rate on exposure to caffeine (47.6 ± 10.2 bpm), iCM/iMacs co-cultures were highly sensitive and displayed a steady beat rate of 56 ± 0 bpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 (h)</xref>). Despite iCMs being known to exhibit poor calcium handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], our results suggest the addition of iMacs show great potential in improving the calcium handling of iCMs, with highly robust beat rates and very little variability. To further confirm that the synchronous beating of iCMs was facilitated through electrical coupling with iMacs and not just through paracrine factors, iCMs were also cultured for 7 days with M-CSF, and with iMacs conditioned media. Synchronous beating with very little variability could only be seen when iCMs were in co-culture with iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 (i)</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 3</xref>), whereas iCMs cultured with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 4</xref>) and iMacs conditioned media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 5</xref>) displayed high variability in beat rates (24 ± 10 bpm and 19.6 ± 10 bpm respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 (i)</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Previous studies also show that prolonged culture time (&gt;50 days) improved iCM maturity, facilitating elongation of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>] and causing reduced beat rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>].

To efficiently simulate a cardiac environment in a 2D setting <italic>in vitro</italic>, two approaches were chosen - providing iMacs with iCM conditioned media (iMacs_CM) and performing co-cultures of iMacs and iCMs (iMacs_co-culture). In this comprehensive exploration, the most profound impact in terms of iMac maturation and function was seen when iMacs and iCMs were in co-culture, showing that the effects of CRMs in the heart extend beyond paracrine signalling. Despite high cell densities of iCMs, iMacs integrated well into iCM cultures, particularly into beating patches. The expression of Cx43 in both cell types further emphasised potential communication through gap junctions, crucial for myocardial function. It should be emphasised that, iMacs_co-culture not only displayed a reduced level of pro-inflammatory genes (<italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>NOS2</italic>) compared to control iMacs, but also expressed a robust increase in expression of CRM-specific genes (<italic>TIMD4</italic>, <italic>LYVE1</italic> and <italic>FOLR2</italic>) and cardiac developmental genes (<italic>GATA4</italic>, <italic>TBX18</italic> and <italic>TBX5</italic>), indicating overall quiescence, a key feature of TRMs.</p><p id="P26">In addition to characterising the response of iMacs, the phenotypic and functional changes in iCMs was also investigated. In co-culture with iMacs, iCMs displayed an elongated morphology, in addition to an increase in the expression of maturation markers such as <italic>SERCA2</italic>, the ratio of <italic>MHY7</italic>/<italic>MHY6</italic> and improved calcium handling. Furthermore, one of the most significant drawbacks of iCM cultures - asynchronous beating of the cells - was mitigated upon co-culture with iMacs, wherein synchronous beating of iCMs could be seen, owing to electrical coupling between iMacs and iCMs. To that end, the gene and protein expression profiles of both cell types gave good indicators of their maturation and cardiac resident function. Subsequently, we sought to address the limitation of poor iCM maturity in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. To achieve improvement in iCM maturity, electrical stimulation (ES) was chosen, as over 2 decades of research backs the efficacy of this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. To maintain the same systematic approach, the effect of ES on iCMs, iMacs and iCM/iMacs co-cultures was investigated, by adopting a physiologically accurate ES regimen resembling the characteristics of native myocardium. The ES regimen that yielded the greatest improvement in the expression of iCM maturation genes also drove a highly pro-regenerative response in iMacs. Moreover, functional activation markers, including <italic>MMP9, CCR2, TRPV4,</italic> and <italic>GJA1</italic>, were notably upregulated, demonstrating the multifaceted impact of ES on iMacs. Furthermore, the examination of iMacs from electrically stimulated co-cultures revealed that they maintained quiescence, in addition to expressing pro-inflammatory genes at significantly reduced levels. Electrically stimulated iMacs in co-culture with iCMs also demonstrated exceptional functional activation, emphasising high <italic>VEGFA</italic>, <italic>AREG</italic>, and <italic>GJA1</italic> expressions. Interestingly, functional readouts of iCMs, such as calcium handling (dF/F), elongation and maturation gene expressions were found to be comparable between electrically stimulated iCMs and iCMs in coculture with iMacs, further highlighting the symbiosis between iMacs and iCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7(c, d, e)</xref>). These findings not only reiterated the anti-inflammatory phenotype of iMacs under ES but also highlighted the safety of delivering ES to iMacs, reinforcing the benefits of ES in conjunction with iCM culture for functional improvement of iMacs.</p><p id="P27">Having seen excellent interactions between iCMs and iMacs in a 2D setting, our next focus was to study the effect of iMacs addition on ECTs. Although majority of conventional ECT models only focused on cardiomyocytes, or a combination of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>], newer studies underline the immense benefits of adding iMacs into ECTs in terms of improving tissue function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and vascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>]. In line with these findings, addition of iMacs significantly reduced the variability in the beat rate of the tissues, improved cell alignment and iCM elongation, as well as remarkably increased tissue compaction. These results indicate that in comparison to conventional ECTs, ECTs with iMacs are be more enhanced and physiologically relevant.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, the findings of this work show that iMacs in co-culture with iCMs exhibit a more CRM-like phenotype and iCMs display improved maturation and calcium handling in this coculture. Additionally, these findings also highlight iMacs as excellent support cells in ECTs, contributing to improved tissue function and providing a foundation for advancing cardiac immunoengineering. The findings of this study open up new avenues for further research in the field of cardiac tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to help understand the complex interactions between macrophages and other non-myocytes, to develop true multicellular healthy and injured cardiac models.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Differentiation of iPSCs to macrophages (iMacs)</title><p id="P29">All experiments were performed using iPSC lines SCFi55 (accession: CVCL_UL47) and SFCi55- ZsGr (assession: CVCL_UL48; tagged with Zeiss green) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. iPSCs were expanded using mTESR™ media (Stemcell Technologies) in Matrigel® (Corning) coated plates, with the addition of 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Stemcell Technologies) on days of passaging.

first delves into two potential strategies to generate cardiac resident-like macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, by exposing iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) to isogenic iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte (iCM) conditioned media, or by performing co-cultures of iMacs and iCMs. Next, the effect of electrical stimulation on iCMs, iMacs and iCM/iMac co-cultures is explored. Finally, the benefits of iMac addition into iCM cultures is demonstrated in a 3D engineered cardiac tissue model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201806-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>iMacs exhibit phenotypic and functional differences when subjected to iCM conditioned media.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental setup, (<bold>b</bold>) Representative images of BDMs, iMacs and iMacs_CM stained with DAPI and CCR2.
