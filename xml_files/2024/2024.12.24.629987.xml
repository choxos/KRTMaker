The jujube industry is currently facing an unprecedented threat due to the Jujube Witches’ Broom (JWB) disease, which affects main jujube cultivation areas in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo et al., 2023</xref>). Diseased jujube trees exhibit a spectrum of symptoms including witches’ broom, phyllody, leaf yellowing, and stunting trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bertaccini, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo et al., 2023</xref>). Infected trees typically succumb to the disease within 2-3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Economic losses caused by JWB are not only due to reduced yield, fruit quality, and tree longevity, but also substantial costs for disease control and management measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, a deep understanding of the virulence mechanisms underlying JWB development is crucial for developing effective disease control strategies and to safeguard the global jujube industry.</p><p id="P7">JWB is caused by phytoplasma infection. Phytoplasmas are obligate bacterial pathogens that colonize phloem sieve elements of infected plants through insect transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). Phytoplasmas undergo a life cycle that alternates between plant hosts and specific insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wei et al., 2004</xref>). Insects become infected by acquiring phytoplasmas from the phloem of diseased plants. Once the bacteria invade the insect’s salivary glands, they can be transferred to the phloem of healthy plants during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Namba, 2019</xref>). These bacteria lack a cell wall and possess a highly reduced genome, reflecting their lifestyle as obligate pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Oshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo et al., 2023</xref>). The phytoplasma responsible for JWB belongs to the 16SrV-B sub-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Xue et al., 2023</xref>). The primary insect vector for JWB phytoplasma transmission is the leafhopper <italic>Hishimonus sellatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jung et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, JWB can also spread through grafting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, phytoplasmas axenic culture of phytoplasmas is difficult, and few chemical or biological control methods exist for JWB disease management. Previous studies have demonstrated that techniques such as shoot tip culture to produce pathogen-free propagations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Namba, 2019</xref>) and injecting tetracycline derivatives into infected stems or seeds can reduce phytoplasma infection in plant explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Askari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bertaccini, 2022</xref>). However, these management measures are costly, laborious, and time-consuming. While there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches to accomplish sustainable resistance to JWB in jujube, achieving this goal requires a comprehensive understanding of the disease and the phytoplasma pathogen.</p><p id="P8">During the infection process, phytoplasma secretes a variety of effector proteins via the Sec-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). These effectors, which are crucial for the phytoplasma colonization, insect transmission, and disease symptom development.</p><p id="P9">To date, approximately 20 phytoplasma effectors have been experimentally studied, although the number of predicted effector proteins is much larger (Carreón et al., 2023). The best-studied effectors are encoded in the strain Aster yellows witches’ broom (AY-WB; or <italic>Ca</italic> Phytoplasma asteris), which infects the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sugio et al., 2011</xref>). AY-WB was predicted to secrete 56 secreted proteins (also known as SAPs) as putative effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bai et al., 2009</xref>). Some of these SAPs are mobile and affect host cellular processes in adjacent companion cells or distal meristem tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>). So far, all characterized SAPs (SAP11, SAP54, and SAP05) have been shown to target plant transcription factors, manipulating host cells by reprograming their transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lakhanpaul et al., 2023</xref>). This transcription reprogramming not only facilitates colonization in the plant tissue but also insect transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Orlovskis et al., 2023</xref>). For example, SAP11 interacts with and destabilizes class II TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR) host transcription factors (TFs), resulting in leaf crinkling and stem proliferation. Homologs of SAP11 from Maize bushy stunt phytoplasma (MBSP), Wheat Blue Dwarf phytoplasma (WBD), and Apple Proliferation phytoplasma (AP) - referred to as SAP11<sub>MBSP</sub>, SAP11<sub>WBD</sub>, and SAP11<sub>AP</sub>, respectively also interact with TCP TFs. These interactions lead to significant alterations in leaf and shoot architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lakhanpaul et al., 2023</xref>). SAPs can induce additional developmental anomalies such as phyllody and bolting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Orlovskis &amp; Hogenhout, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Iwabuchi et al., 2020</xref>). For example, SAP54<sub>AY-WB</sub> degrades MADS-box TFs in transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, resulting in the formation of leafy flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Homologs of SAPs in JWB phytoplasma have also been studied. These effectors are named SJPs (<underline>S</underline>ecreted <underline>J</underline>WB <underline>P</underline>roteins). The SAP11<sub>AY-WB</sub> homologs SJP1 and SJP2 promote lateral bud outgrowth by destabilizing the jujube protein ZjBRC1 and regulated auxin efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). The SAP54<sub>AY-WB</sub> homolog SJP3 induces pistil reversion partly through interaction with MADS-box TF SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE 3 (SVP3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Deng et al., 2024</xref>). Despite these insights, many SJPs remain uncharacterized.</p><p id="P11">Here we identified and characterized the JWB phytoplasma effector, SJP39 (AYJ01459.1), which is the most highly expressed SJP during jujube infection.

Therefore, bHLH TFs with diverse functions are exploited by different pathogens to facilitate their infection.</p><p id="P50">Typical symptoms caused by phytoplasma infection include severe developmental abnormalities, such as increased lateral branching and leafy flowers. The JWB phytoplasma effectors, SJP1, SJP2 and SJP3, induced phenotypes related to these symptoms when expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Deng et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, infected jujube trees often exhibit stunted growth. Interestingly, jujube seedlings expressing <italic>SJP39</italic> were significantly smaller than controls. Similarly, over-expression of <italic>ZjbHLH87</italic> also led to stunted growth in jujube, consistent with the possibility that the growth defects caused by SJP39 can be attributed to its stabilization of ZjbHLH87. While we do not have data on transgenic jujube, transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> expressing SJP39 also showed delayed flowering, which is another symptom observed in phytoplasma-infected trees. As such, SJP39 may contribute to the disease symptom development after phytoplasma infection of jujube trees.</p><p id="P51">Transcriptome analysis of jujube expressing <italic>SJP39</italic> or overexpressing <italic>ZjbHLH87</italic> indicates a potential disruption in the gibberellins (GAs) pathway. Phytoplasma effectors are known to interfere with phytohormones and cause developmental deficiency. The effector TENGU from <italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris induces stunting and floral developmental defects in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> by suppressing auxin-related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hoshi et al., 2009</xref>). GA are crucial regulators of plant growth and development, particularly in controlling plant height through the promotion of stem elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sun, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davière &amp; Achard, 2013</xref>). Disruption in GA biosynthesis or signalling often leads to dwarf phenotypes, as seen in various crop species and model organisms. For example, in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), mutations in the GA biosynthesis gene <italic>GA20ox2</italic> resulted in the semi-dwarf varieties of the “green revolution,” which exhibit reduced height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nawaz et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, mutations in <italic>GA3ox</italic> genes, encoding key enzymes in bioactive GA synthesis, lead to significant reductions in plant height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hedden &amp; Thomas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). A suppression of GA pathway by SJP39 is therefore consistent with the stunted growth observed in the transgenic plants. A panel of GA biosynthetic and signalling genes in jujube was found to be repressed in transgenic plants expressing <italic>SJP39</italic>. ZjbHLH87 also negatively regulates the promoter activity of <italic>ZjKAO</italic> and <italic>ZjGRP11</italic> when co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. Importantly, this suppression was enhanced in the presence of SJP39, likely through stabilizing ZjbHLH87. Therefore, SJP39-induced suppression of GA signalling is likely mediated by ZjbHLH87, which explains the defective growth phenotype in jujube. This is also consistent with the observation that transgenic jujube plants expressing <italic>SJP39</italic> or overexpressing <italic>ZjbHLH87</italic> were largely unresponsive to exogenous GA treatment.</p><p id="P52">Overall, our study established a role of an important JWB phytoplasma effector, SJP39, which interacts with ZjbHLH87 to enhance its negative regulation of GA signalling in jujube. This mis-regulation of the ZjbHLH87 regulon results in developmental abnormalities especially stunted growth and potentially delayed flowering, which are relevant to the disease symptoms of JWB. This finding significantly advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which JWB phytoplasma causes disease on jujube and can be leveraged to develop management strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure 1-7</label><media xlink:href="EMS202344-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_1_7.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d122aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table 1-7</label><media xlink:href="EMS202344-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d122aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>XP was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFD2200404), Hebei Province Academy of Sciences Key Cooperative Unit, research on jujube witches’ broom disease pathogen, rhizosphere microorganisms, the interactions and pathogenic mechanisms with jujubes.
