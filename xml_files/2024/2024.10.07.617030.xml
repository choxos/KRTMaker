This induces DNA supercoiling as a function of transcript length due to over- and under-twisting of the DNA downstream and upstream of RNAP, respectively. Using single-particle cryo-EM and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays we investigated the relationship between bacterial RNAP and DNA Topoisomerase I (TopoI), which removes negative supercoils accumulating upstream of RNAP. TopoI binds to relaxed DNA upstream of RNAP in a manner suggesting a sensory role awaiting the formation of negative supercoils and involving a conformational switch in the functional domains of TopoI. On DNA substrates mimicking negatively supercoiled DNA, TopoI threads one strand into the active site for cleavage while binding the complementary strand with an auxiliary domain. We propose a comprehensive model for DNA relaxation in the context of a transcribing RNAP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During gene expression, RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcribes the DNA template strand (tDNA) to RNA. The translocation activity of the RNAP elongation complex (EC) causes overwinding of the downstream DNA (positive supercoiling) and underwinding of the upstream DNA (negative supercoiling) as a function of transcript length. This phenomenon, known as the twin supercoiled domain model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), was initially described by Liu and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and later confirmed both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Locally, DNA supercoiling can reach high levels that might stall transcription by disfavouring forward translocation of RNAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To prevent inhibitory excessive DNA supercoiling, transcription is coupled with DNA relaxation. Bacterial topoisomerase I (TopoI), a type IA topoisomerase, relaxes negative supercoils upstream of the EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). TopoI acts on single-stranded DNA and relaxes one negative supercoil in each catalytic cycle by passing one DNA strand (T-strand) through a transient break in the complementary strand (G-strand) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Crystal structures of the catalytic core or the C-terminal domain (CTD) bound to single-stranded DNA were used to characterize its interaction with DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, TopoI preferentially binds the junctions of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively), a property thought to facilitate the recognition of negatively supercoiled DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Structural and biochemical data suggested the CTD is required for DNA relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Two competing models have been proposed based on structural and biochemical information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. According to the single-chain model both domains bind the same DNA strand, while in the double-chain model the catalytic core and the CTD bind two complementary strands. DNAse I protection assays provided support for the latter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In the context of the twin supercoiled domain model, the negatively supercoiled DNA upstream of RNAP is believed to represent a hotspot for TopoI activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, in several species, including <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, RNAP and TopoI were proposed to be in direct contact. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, RNAP and TopoI co-purify from cell lysates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

To understand how TopoI operates in the context of the EC, whether its activity is modulated by specific protein-protein contacts or if it is only driven by DNA topology, we used nucleic acid scaffolds to mimic different upstream DNA topologies and obtained single-particle cryo-EM structures of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP-TopoI complex in different functional states. The structures and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays shed light on RNAP-TopoI coupling on relaxed and negatively supercoiled DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RNAP-TopoI complex on relaxed DNA</title><p id="P6">We first sought to understand how RNAP and TopoI cooperate on relaxed DNA before supercoils accumulate or after DNA relaxation. An EC was reconstituted for cryo-EM on a nucleic acid scaffold imitating a transcription bubble, which forms double-stranded DNA immediately upstream of RNAP to mimic locally relaxed DNA (duplex scaffold). Focused cryo-EM reconstructions allowed us to generate a composite map and refine atomic models of an EC and TopoI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">TopoI binds DNA at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble in proximity of RNAP, which resembles a canonical EC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (C<sub>ɑ</sub> RMSD: 0.8 Å). In contrast, TopoI adopts a different conformation compared to the crystal structure of the full-length protein bound to single-stranded DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, the TopoI-CTD rotates relative to the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary movie 1</xref>) so domains D7 to D9 approach the TopoI body to avoid a steric overlap with RNAP. Tyr704 in the linker connecting domains D6 with D7 can stabilise both, the previously observed and the novel conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This TopoI-CTD conformation aligns DNA-binding residues with the DNA emerging from the EC. In contrast to the TopoI crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, an EC provides ssDNA and dsDNA regions. TopoI domains D7 to D9 bind the edge of the transcription bubble, where the unpaired non-template DNA (ntDNA) reanneals to form the upstream DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). The DNA geometry, which is different compared to the crystal structure, dictates an alternative TopoI-CTD interaction with the DNA. In the crystal structure, TopoI predominantly contacts DNA bases through aromatic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the present structure these are often replaced by electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In contrast to the TopoI-DNA contacts, the interface of TopoI and RNAP is not well-resolved indicating substantial flexibility. The few protein-protein contacts between RNAP and TopoI involve mainly electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>). D5, which was shown to bind DNA, contacts the RNAP β’ subunit instead. Interestingly, in a subset of particles we observe a flexible loop in the TOPRIM domain of TopoI (residues 37 – 60) to form additional contacts with RNAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c, Supplementary table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The surface area buried by protein-protein interactions is ˜900 Å<sup>2</sup> (TOPRIM loop included). In comparison, TopoI covers ˜1570 Å<sup>2</sup> of DNA surface, suggesting the latter drives complex stability. To test whether DNA is required for stabilisation, we compared the binding of TopoI to an EC assembled either on the duplex scaffold used for cryo-EM, or a minimal scaffold lacking the transcription bubble and upstream DNA. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), an RNAP-TopoI complex formed only with the duplex scaffold and not with the minimal scaffold. Consistently, TopoI co-eluted with RNAP in size-exclusion chromatography only in presence of the duplex scaffold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). We conclude the upstream DNA is required for a stable RNAP-TopoI complex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RNAP-TopoI complex on negatively supercoiled DNA</title><p id="P11">Next, we wanted to understand how TopoI engages negatively supercoiled DNA that accumulates upstream of a transcribing RNAP. To model strand separation arising from high levels of negative supercoiling, we designed nucleic acid scaffolds with mismatched upstream DNA forming a bubble or single-stranded overhangs.</p><p id="P12">Preliminary cryo-EM reconstructions using scaffolds with short ssDNA overhangs (short-overhang scaffold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) confirmed that TopoI-CTD binds the junction of ssDNA and dsDNA, in a manner resembling the duplex scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, the relative orientation of TopoI and RNAP was different, suggesting the TopoI catalytic core binds the non-template strand of negatively supercoiled DNA. This informed two alternative scaffold designs (bubble and long-overhang scaffold) harbouring a consensus TopoI cleavage sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> in the ntDNA to promote binding to a specific site. DNA cleavage assays confirmed TopoI activity in a complex with RNAP on both scaffolds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The consensus cryo-EM reconstruction of the RNAP-TopoI complex on the bubble scaffold refined to a nominal resolution of 3.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary table 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, TopoI exhibited a high degree of flexibility but the map was sufficiently resolved to unambiguously fit the crystal structure. In this complex, TopoI still binds the EC at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble, but in an orientation rotated by ˜150° relative to RNAP compared to the complex on the duplex scaffold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 2</xref>). The TopoI-CTD is now positioned to bind the template DNA (tDNA) exiting from RNAP, consistent with the strand polarity observed in the full-length crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. 3D variability analysis in CryoSPARC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> identified two populations with similar TopoI and RNAP relative orientations, but different scaffold configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In one population, the transcription bubble and the upstream bubble merged. The ntDNA path deviates compared to the canonical EC in the same dataset and connects the transcription bubble with the TopoI catalytic core. The density is not sufficiently resolved to see individual DNA bases but it can be traced to the active site near the junction of TOPRIM and CAP domains. Consistent with the DNA cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), modelling of the ntDNA strand suggests the TopoI consensus cleavage sequence can reach the active site in this configuration. We propose this reconstruction represents a state of the complex poised for cleavage and re-ligation. In the second population, the ntDNA emerges from the transcription bubble and re-anneals at the upstream edge forming two bubbles as intended by design. In this conformation, the ntDNA does not enter the TopoI active site suggesting TopoI is in a standby state in contrast to the ‘single-bubble’ conformation.</p><p id="P14">Unlike on the bubble-scaffold, we observed two distinct TopoI orientations relative to RNAP in cryo-EM reconstructions using the long-overhang scaffold, due to increased flexibility of the ntDNA end. They refined to 4 Å and 3.9 Å nominal resolution, respectively. In the first, TopoI adopts a similar orientation as seen on the bubble scaffold (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c</xref>, orientation 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 2</xref>). The second orientation is related to the first by a ˜145° rotation around an axis that aligns with the exiting ntDNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary movie 2</xref>). The TopoI density is better resolved in both reconstructions compared to the bubble scaffold, except for the TopoI-CTD. The CTD is highly mobile causing fragmented density for domains D7 to D9. In both orientations, the ntDNA strand emerging from the transcription bubble extends to the TopoI active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), consistent with the active, ‘single-bubble’ conformation on the bubble scaffold, and with the results of the DNA cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Protein-protein contacts between RNAP and TopoI differ in each relative orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>), consistent with our biochemical results suggesting a shared DNA drives complex stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) and DNA geometry guides the TopoI orientation. Interestingly, the tip of the RNAP β’ subunit clamp domain can form electrostatic contacts with a charged loop in domain D2 of TopoI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>) in orientation 1 on the long-overhang scaffold and on the bubble-scaffold. This loop has been proposed to facilitate T-strand passage or regulation of DNA gate opening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, 3D variability analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> identified a transient TopoI state, with a partially open gate and a gap in the EM density between domains D1 and D3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d, Supplementary movie 3</xref>). We conclude that TopoI adopts a range of relative orientations to RNAP on scaffolds that mimic negatively supercoiled DNA and any functionally relevant contacts are transient.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> functional analysis of TopoI mutants</title><p id="P15">To investigate the impact of the TopoI-CTD conformational change, we introduced two point mutations. Firstly, we reduced TopoI-CTD flexibility by mutating the pivotal residue, Gly703, to proline (TopoI-G703P). Secondly, we mutated Tyr704 to alanine (TopoI-Y704A) to diminish the stabilising interactions of the two alternative TopoI-CTD conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Our cryo-EM reconstructions of the RNAP-TopoI complex on negatively supercoiled DNA indicate a potential contact of a charged loop in D2 of TopoI with RNAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>). This loop in type IA topoisomerases has been hypothesised to play a role in T-strand passage or gate opening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To elucidate its function, we replaced the loop (residues 442 – 448) with five glycines (TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub>).</p><p id="P16">We compared the activity of these proteins in DNA relaxation assays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). TopoI-G703P exhibited reduced relaxation activity compared to the wild type, while TopoI-Y704A and TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub> showed no discernible effect. This suggests CTD flexibility is necessary for efficient DNA relaxation but the conformational stabilisation observed in the crystal structure and our cryo-EM reconstruction is not required. Likewise, the D2 loop does not appear to be important for DNA relaxation by the isolated enzyme. Next, we tested how CTD mutations (G703P and Y704A) affect binding to the EC on the duplex scaffold. Electromobility shift assays and size-exclusion chromatography revealed reduced binding to the EC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c</xref>). This suggests conformational stabilisation of TopoI-CTD is required for stable binding to an EC, aligning with our structural observations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> functional analysis of TopoI mutants</title><p id="P17">To investigate these interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>, we assessed the impact of the TopoI mutants (TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub>, TopoI-Y704A and TopoI-G703P) on <italic>E. coli</italic> viability. A TopoI deletion mutant is not viable or acquires compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, evaluating phenotypes of TopoI mutants affecting the relationship with RNAP is challenging and we engineered an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain encoding a degradable TopoI using the <italic>Mesoplasma florum</italic> Lon protease and its cognate signal peptide PDT (TopoI-PDT, see Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Remarkably, this strain remained viable with no growth defect or change in physiology, despite TopoI being reduced to 15% of its original level upon Lon protease induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a-f</xref>). RNA-seq experiments demonstrated that reduced TopoI levels significantly affect expression of 214 genes (118 upregulated and 96 downregulated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). TopoI expression increased ~2-fold, while DNA gyrase, TopoIV and TopoIII were expressed at similar levels. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated a significant upregulation of genes involved in bacterial motility and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These changes correlated with a robust increase in bacterial motility after growing overnight in TopoI depletion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Whole genome sequencing of the TopoI-PDT strain before and after depletion indicated no other mutations were acquired.

Moreover, in presence of wildtype TopoI levels, the expression of the mutants significantly increased the motility suggesting they may have a dominant negative effect.</p><p id="P19">Next, we introduced the same mutations directly at the <italic>topA</italic> locus using CRISPR-Cas9 (see Methods).

Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub> and TopoI-Y704A clone 2 had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). In contrast, TopoI-G703P clone 1 shifted the reporter plasmid to more supercoiled forms, while TopoI-G703P clone 2 and TopoI-Y704A clone 1 showed more relaxed forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). However, except for TopoI-Y704A clone 2, the presence of acquired mutations prevents us from drawing strong conclusions.</p><p id="P22">Finally, we evaluated if TopoI mutants affect RNA polymerase activity by monitoring gene expression using mVenus and mCerrulean fluorescent reporters. To exclude promoter specific or transcription factor related effects, we used λ pR (for mVenus) and the synthetic apFAB67 (mCerulean) promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub> and TopoI-Y704A mutants had reduced expression of mVenus and mCerrulean. Importantly, TopoI-Y704A clone 2 did not contain additional mutations and we conclude reduced reporter expression is a direct effect of the TopoI-Y704A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The reporter expression of the TopoI-G703P mutants differed from each other. Clone 1 containing the <italic>dusB::IS1</italic> mutation showed increased expression, while clone 2 containing the <italic>cyoE::IS2</italic> mutation did not show changes in expression. The Topo-G703P tagged mutation of clone 1 and 2 was transduced in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and reporter expression was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Both transduced clones conveyed an increase in reporter expression. Although we cannot exclude the emergence of new mutations, we propose that TopoI-G703P is favorable for gene expression in this context.</p><p id="P23">Altogether, these results showed that the TopoI mutants affect motility, gene expression and accumulate adaptive secondary mutations, that likely compensate for reduced TopoI function and cause changes in plasmid supercoiling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">TopoI must be able to monitor the topological state of DNA during transcription and intervene when the level of negative supercoiling inhibits EC progression. In line with this function, our results now show that the interaction between the EC and TopoI depends on the presence of DNA and is modulated by the level of DNA supercoiling.</p><p id="P25">In the RNAP-TopoI complex on relaxed DNA, TopoI binds exclusively through its CTD to the junction of ssDNA and dsDNA at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, in the crystal structure TopoI binds exclusively single-stranded DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The structurally homologous DNA-binding domains of the TopoI-CTD contain positively charged and aromatic residues that interact with the phosphate backbone or DNA bases, respectively. This dual interaction mode enables TopoI to bind single-stranded DNA and junctions between single- and double-stranded DNA, which may enable recognition of DNA topology. In the context of transcription, this distinction allows TopoI to detect when the upstream DNA fails to re-anneal due to excessive negative supercoiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P26">TopoI binding to the RNAP EC on relaxed DNA is accompanied by a rotation of the TopoI-CTD relative to the catalytic core. Its orientation is stabilised by a network of residues that act as a conformational switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Moreover, different RNAP-TopoI complexes showed different relative orientations of catalytic core and TopoI-CTD. Domains D5 and D6 are the least flexible and remain associated with the catalytic core. In contrast, domains D7 and D8/D9 move as two independent modules, owing to two hinge points on each side of domain D7. The TopoI-CTD flexibility is important for the interaction with the EC as well as for its activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> because both are impaired in the TopoI-G703P mutant. This is consistent with the proposed function of the TopoI-CTD during DNA relaxation that involves passage of the T-strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, which would likely require significant movement. However, TopoI-G703P was the only mutant that led to increased reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that downregulation of TopoI activity compared to the wildtype may be beneficial for gene expression. The conformational stabilisation by Tyr704, on the other hand, does not seem to be important for DNA relaxation, but contributes to the EC binding. The presence of either mutation in the CTD (G703P or Y704A) in the chromosomal locus is detrimental, leading to additional adaptive mutations. Surprisingly, we did not observe the well characterized TopoI suppressive mutations leading to gyrase down regulation or TopoIV overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, mutations affecting the <italic>dusB-fis</italic> region were also observed in long-term evolution experiments for TopoI mutants causing high levels of DNA supercoiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The relationship with supercoiling for the other mutations (<italic>hemA A399G, cyoE::IS2, uvrY-IS5-yecU</italic> and <italic>ΔyhhZ-yrhA</italic>) is unknown. Transduction of these TopoI mutants into the wildtype genetic background causes increased motility phenotypes reflecting lack of normal TopoI function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), which may be linked to impairment of its supercoiling sensor function during transcription or hampered EC binding.</p><p id="P27">In the RNAP-TopoI complex on negatively supercoiled DNA, TopoI adopts an active state and uses the ntDNA as the G-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The ntDNA is threaded from the transcription bubble directly into the active site of TopoI, consistent with our biochemical results. On the other hand, if the upstream DNA reanneals, even if only for a few base pairs, the TopoI active site cannot access the ntDNA strand and thus cannot perform DNA relaxation in the complex with RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-e</xref>). The presence of the active and standby state on negatively supercoiled DNA suggests that TopoI becomes active when supercoiling levels are high enough to cause extensive melting of the upstream DNA, which would likely interfere with RNAP translocation. This agrees with the proposed ‘open’ variation of the twin-supercoiled domain model in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where TopoI in complex with an RNAP EC only partially relaxes the DNA, leaving the residual supercoils to diffuse further upstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and potentially favour promoter opening for subsequent rounds of transcription.</p><p id="P28">In addition, TopoI-CTD on the bubble scaffold likely binds the upstream tDNA emerging from RNAP. This supports the previously proposed ‘double-chain’ model of DNA binding, where the TopoI catalytic domain binds the G-strand and TopoI-CTD the T-strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the RNAP EC, the G-strand would thus correspond to the ntDNA, and the T-strand to tDNA. However, the mechanism of engaging the TopoI-CTD is likely specific to transcription-coupled regulations in <italic>E. coli</italic>, since the TopoI-CTD is not conserved between species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Remarkably, we observed a small fraction of particles with a partially opened DNA gate on the long overhang scaffold. Although gate opening does not necessarily depend on DNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, it is an obligatory conformational transition for DNA relaxation. Thus, TopoI in this complex is competent to carry out the complete catalytic cycle of DNA relaxation.</p><p id="P30"><italic>E. coli</italic> TopoI contains several non-conserved loops, whose function is unclear. Some may play regulatory roles. For example, the charged loop in domain D2 (residues 442 – 448) is thought to be involved in the T-strand passage or regulation of gate opening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, in two of the RNAP-TopoI complexes on the negatively supercoiled DNA, this loop interacts with the tip of the RNAP clamp domain. A mutant replacing the loop with a Gly<sub>5</sub> linker (TopoI-Gly<sub>5</sub>) retains the DNA relaxation activity of the wild type but <italic>in vivo</italic> it reduces the expression of the reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that the TopoI-RNAP interface might play a regulatory role in transcription.</p><p id="P31">Taken together, we revealed a novel regulatory interplay between RNAP and TopoI, which is beyond simple TopoI recruitment through its CTD as suggested earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We propose that timely detection of supercoil accumulation behind transcription machinery on one hand and on the other hand tuning of TopoI relaxation activity to ensure optimal supercoiling levels for transcription, have important consequences for proper gene expression and might be vital for the fitness of <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199324-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Alexandre Durand and Nils Marechal from the Structural biology platform at the IGBMC, Simon Fromm from the EMBL Heidelberg Imaging Centre, and Alessandro Grinzato from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) for their help with EM data collection.

Both domains, the catalytic core and the CTD, can bind single-stranded DNA with opposite polarity (G-strand and T-strand). The active site is formed by domains D1 (TOPRIM) and D3 (CAP), the latter having the catalytic Tyr residue. Top right: RNAP consists of five subunits (α<sub>2</sub>ββ’ω).

When DNA is relaxed, the transcription bubble stabilises the preferred DNA geometry for TopoI – the ssDNA/dsDNA junction between the ntDNA strand and the upstream duplex. TopoI can bind the junction with the CTD domains D7 – D9, but not D5. <bold>b</bold>, Melting of the duplex due to excessive (–) supercoil accumulation would change the DNA binding mode of TopoI to entirely single-stranded DNA and potentially allow domain D5 to bind as well, as observed previously in the crystal structure (PDB ID: 4RUL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>). This transition would necessarily result in the conformational change of the TopoI-CTD, since the conformation in the crystal structure is not compatible with the RNAP EC. <bold>c</bold>, The expansion of the transcription bubble due to melting of the upstream DNA would allow TopoI to access single-stranded DNA with its active site to relax supercoils. <bold>d</bold>, TopoI binds and cleaves the ntDNA strand, while the tDNA strand is bound by its CTD. The direction of CTD movement towards the catalytic core would likely promote the strand passage. <bold>e</bold>, Supercoil relaxation allows re-annealing of the upstream duplex and transcription to resume. At moderate levels of (–) supercoiling (no strand separation), TopoI is sterically hindered from cleaving the non-template strand in the transcription bubble and thus cannot relax the DNA, but remains available to intervene if the supercoiling level increases again.</p><p>The active site Tyr in TopoI is labelled with a cyan star.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199324-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
