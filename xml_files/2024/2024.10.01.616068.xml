We reconstituted the flat assembly of ESCRT-0 protein HRS and clathrin onto lipid membranes <italic>in vitro</italic>. HRS was found to form protein condensates. These condensates spread as a two-dimensional layer on negatively charged membranes and promoted the assembly of clathrin into a flat coat. Correlative cryo-tomography of HRS-labeled endosomes revealed a pure hexagonal lattice, consistent with flat clathrin structures. Cholesterol enhanced HRS recruitment to the membrane both in cells and in supported bilayers. Furthermore, cholesterol promoted the phase separation of HRS onto membranes, which in turn concentrated cholesterol underneath. This positive feedback promoted the formation of HRS-clathrin microdomains that sorted reconstituted ubiquitinated cargoes. Altogether, our results show that the unique architecture of ESCRT-0 is assembled by the two-dimensional phase-separation of HRS which drives the assembly of flat clathrin coats.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Clathrin, the main component of the coat involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), self-assembles i<italic>n vitro</italic> into spherical cages that resemble the coats observed on endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Ybe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Roth and Porter, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Ungewickell and Branton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Crowther and Pearse, 1981</xref>). During CME, membrane-binding adaptor proteins drive clathrin assembly into hexagons and pentagons, promoting membrane deformation and invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Sochacki and Taraska, 2019</xref>). Besides CME, clathrin is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking routes between endosomes, trans-Golgi network, and the plasma membrane. During these trafficking processes, the clathrin coat assembles on the organellar membrane and facilitates membrane budding in a similar way to CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Vassilopoulos and Montagnac, 2024</xref>). However, how adaptors control the position and the ratio between pentagons and hexagons, setting membrane curvature, remains unknown.</p><p id="P3">In addition to vesicular clathrin structures that promote membrane deformation, mammalian cells have flat and tubular clathrin structures, which are usually not linked to vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Vassilopoulos and Montagnac, 2024</xref>). At the plasma membrane, hexagonal clathrin lattices participate in the formation of integrin-dependent adhesion plaques or collagen-pinching tubular adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hakanpää et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Elkhatib et al., 2017</xref>). Among the flat clathrin lattices, the least characterized are found on endosomes. There, clathrin associates with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-0 by binding with Hepatocyte growth factor tyrosine kinase substrate HRS/HGS (from now on, HRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Raiborg et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>). HRS-clathrin domains sort ubiquitylated cargoes, which are further concentrated in intraluminal vesicles (ILV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wenzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Migliano et al., 2023</xref>). Remarkably, HRS-clathrin coats have a distinctive bi-layered organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>), which is unique among clathrin structures in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Vassilopoulos and Montagnac, 2024</xref>). However, how the unique architecture of the ESCRT-0-clathrin coat is assembled on endosomes and how it is linked to its sorting function remains unanswered.</p><p id="P4">Cholesterol is more abundant in membranes where clathrin-mediated trafficking occurs: the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kim and Burd, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Cholesterol plays a crucial role in lipid phase separation and sets membrane biophysical properties, making it essential for numerous membrane functions. For example, cholesterol promotes membrane bending during CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rodal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Pichler and Riezman, 2004</xref>). Cholesterol is highly enriched in multivesicular endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ikonen, 2018</xref>), and its trafficking in cells is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wheeler and Sillence, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ikonen and Zhou, 2021</xref>). An imbalance of this tight regulation causes diseases, as the excess of cholesterol in endosomes alters transport functions in the Niemann-Pick type C disease caused by mutations in <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Naureckiene et al., 2000</xref>). While its endosomal excess causes trafficking defects, the physiological roles of cholesterol at endosomes remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, while both cholesterol and clathrin are enriched in the same membrane compartments, whether the cholesterol and clathrin assembly impact each other has not been investigated.</p><p id="P5">Here, we studied the assembly of ESCRT-0-clathrin coats on endosomes and their interplay with the underlying membrane. Our reconstitution approach showed that HRS recruitment to the membrane depended on its interaction with PI(3)P and was enhanced by cholesterol. HRS, which contains unstructured domains, formed spherical condensates in solution and two-dimensional condensates on membranes. Two-dimensional HRS condensates promoted the assembly of a solid and dense, flat coat of clathrin. In cells, the recruitment of HRS and clathrin on endosomes also depended on cholesterol, and cryo-electron tomography showed that clathrin forms a flat, hexagonal protein lattice.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HRS recruits clathrin on membranes as flat lattices and domes</title><p id="P6">Since clathrin does not directly bind to membranes, the formation of various clathrin structures on cellular membranes relies on organelle-specific adaptors, with HRS being uniquely associated with endosomes. Its FYVE domain binds phosphatidyl-inositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which is enriched in early endosomal membranes and intraluminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gillooly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Raiborg et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Urbé et al., 2000</xref>). To understand their assembly mechanism, we initially aimed at reconstituting the ESCRT-0 clathrin coat <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified and labeled human HRS and bovine clathrin. We measured the dynamics of clathrin recruitment on HRS-coated supported lipid bilayer (SLB) membranes containing 1mol% PI(3)P, 44mol% DOPC, 20mol% DOPS, 20mol% DOPE, and 15mol% cholesterol (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) by using microfluidics-assisted sequential addition of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Our experiments revealed that HRS recruits clathrin on SLBs in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-E</xref>) with both the nucleation rate and the final amount of membrane-bound clathrin proportional to the bulk HRS concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Clathrin recruitment followed a single exponential kinetics but did not saturate at the high HRS concentrations.</p><p id="P7">Next, we aimed to better understand the recruitment of HRS on membranes. As expected, HRS and clathrin were recruited onto PI(3)P-rich giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) membranes (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), but not in the absence of PI(3)P (Lipid mix 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>). To test the recruitment kinetics of HRS onto PI(3)P-rich membranes, we prepared SLBs with 1% PI(3)P (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), and followed the recruitment of labeled HRS by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. Recruitment of HRS followed single exponential kinetics, saturating after 15-20 minutes with 100 and 250 nM bulk HRS and significantly faster with 500 nM bulk HRS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). 100 nM bulk HRS led to a protein coat on the membrane that showed moderate fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, an indication of lateral protein movement on the membrane after recruitment. In contrast, at 250 nM and 500 nM bulk HRS, the recruitment led to a stable protein coat with minimal lateral movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Our reconstitution experiments indicated that HRS promotes clathrin recruitment in a concentration-dependent manner, and we wanted to visualize these HRS-clathrin coats at a higher resolution. Platinum replica electron microscopy (PREM) is a powerful approach to visualize protein lattices on flat surfaces because it provides high contrast and shadowing, suited to visualize flat polygonal lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Heuser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wernert et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>). We deposited SLBs on a glass substrate and compared clathrin recruitment kinetics to the resulting lattice morphology. We prepared samples by incubating SLBs first for 60 minutes with 100 nM or 500 nM concentrations of HRS, then washed five times with reaction buffer to remove the remaining bulk HRS and finally incubated with 200 nM clathrin for 30 minutes. Samples were then fixed and platinum replicas were prepared for electron microscopy analysis. With 100 nM HRS, we observed small, flat clathrin patches on SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). These patches were often accompanied by spherical clathrin cages. Because these cages were always connected to a neighboring clathrin patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), we reasoned that they originated from initially flat clathrin lattices or were assembled as cages next to flat protein patches. With 500 nM HRS and 200 nM clathrin, we frequently observed large patches of flat and dense clathrin islands along with regions where clathrin formed cup-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Notably, these cup-shaped structures appeared to have various degrees of curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We often observed round clathrin islands in our PREM samples prepared with 500 nM of HRS and 200 nM of clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). These clathrin islands had a dense and predominantly flat appearance. They appeared as stacked flat patches coated with clathrin, having multiple layers of similar thickness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-D</xref>). However, clathrin looked flatter on the layer closer to the glass. The observation of flat clathrin patches raised the question of how they are formed. Their appearance suggests they form on top of protein or membrane domains, which are surrounded by more curved clathrin coat regions: Indeed, tilt series of these samples supported that the clathrin patches are thicker than just the clathrin layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We reasoned that a specific mechanism was needed to form such defined and round-shaped clathrin patches. Intrigued by the disordered nature of HRS (AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, AF-O14964-F1-v4), we hypothesized that HRS might phase-separate to form protein patches onto which clathrin could assemble. Supporting this notion, we occasionally observed highly dense protein domains on GUVs and SLBs when these membranes were incubated with 500 nM of HRS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>). Notably, the size of these protein domains was in the same range as the clathrin patches observed by PREM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). To understand the nature of the HRS domains onto which flat clathrin lattices were formed, we further investigated if HRS could undergo phase separation in solution and on membranes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HRS forms condensates that wet the supported lipid bilayer membranes</title><p id="P11">According to UIPred3 predictions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iupred3.elte.hu">https://iupred3.elte.hu</ext-link>), HRS contains two Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs): one between the DUIM motif and the helical region and the other one at its carboxy terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) often drive liquid phase separation of proteins into condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently with the high proportion of disordered regions in its sequence, we observed that labeled HRS at 2 µM formed liquid droplets of protein condensates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). These droplets could grow by fusion and coalescence, supporting their liquid nature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie S2</xref>), a defining characteristic of phase-separated protein condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We wondered how these condensates would interplay with membranes. To test this, we introduced 2 µM labeled HRS on SLBs containing 1% PI(3)P (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The protein condensates interacted with the membrane and started spreading on it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, orange arrows). Protein droplets spread entirely on the membrane surface and fused into a continuous and homogenous layer of HRS fully covering the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, orange arrows) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie S3</xref>), further indicating that HRS condensates are liquid. This process resembled surface wetting by liquid droplets. The fluorescence intensity of HRS remained rather constant throughout the wetted area, indicating that the HRS layer that spreads onto the membrane forms a two-dimensional film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also noticed the spontaneous formation of HRS domains with the same intensity than the two-dimensional condensate growing out from droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, yellow arrowheads). This suggested that the two-dimensional condensate can form from the low-density phase of HRS on the membrane surface. To test if protein can diffuse in HRS condensates on the membrane, we photobleached small regions of the droplet-like condensates, and of the condensate film spread on the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C-D</xref>). Similarly to the HRS coat assembled with 250-500 nM protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), neither of these HRS condensate populations showed a fluorescence recovery in the photobleached region within the 3-minute acquisition period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C-D</xref>). This suggests that when these condensates are spreading on the membrane in a time scale of 1-3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>), they become very viscous, which would lead to negligible lateral protein diffusion.</p><p id="P13">To better understand the formation of HRS condensates on membranes, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). When HRS was injected into the imaging chamber containing SLBs on mica, we initially observed a homogeneous binding of HRS, which separates rapidly into patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, these protein patches did not show high-ordered structure, which indicates they form through phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). HRS patches grew over time with larger protein patches being less mobile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie S4</xref>), supporting the low protein diffusion observations done by FRAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D and S3C-D</xref>). HS-AFM also allowed us to measure the thickness of the HRS patches with the height around 10 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">High-energy interactions with membranes are known to favor complete membrane wetting by protein condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the strong interaction between HRS and lipids in the SLBs could promote wetting behavior. We tested this by observing whether the protein condensates spread on a membrane composed of DOPC lipids only (uncharged membrane, Lipid mix 7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) or a membrane containing negatively charged DOPS as well as PI(3)P (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). HRS condensates did not adhere and spread on the DOPC-only membranes but readily spread on the DOPS/PI(3)P-rich membrane as well as membranes containing 20% DOPS but no PI(3)P (Lipid mix 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), forming a dense protein film (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that electrostatic interactions of HRS with charged lipids were essential for membrane wetting and growth of the two-dimensional condensate.</p><p id="P15">HRS droplets fully wetting the membrane resembled the two-dimensional condensates reported in previous studies with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>). However, the physiological functions of such two-dimensional condensates remained speculative. In our system, we could directly test the role of two-dimensional condensates on clathrin assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Clathrin assembly varies depending on the type of HRS condensates it binds to</title><p id="P16">We wondered how HRS condensates modify the structure and dynamics of clathrin assembly compared to the low density of HRS on the membrane. To this end, we incubated PI(3)P-rich SLBs (Lipid mix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) with 2 µM HRS. Immediately after droplet-like condensates formed, we washed the remaining HRS out five times with reaction buffer and introduced 200 nM of clathrin. Droplet-like HRS condensates readily recruited clathrin, which did not enter inside the condensates but covered the surface of the protein condensate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). To investigate how clathrin binds to two-dimensional condensates, we used the same protocol but waited until the spreading of two-dimensional condensates occurred before injecting clathrin. Fluorescent clathrin was recruited both onto HRS droplets that had not fully spread into two-dimensional condensates, as well as onto two-dimensional condensates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). In confocal fluorescence microscopy images, we observed that HRS fluorescence intensity increased stepwise from the low-density region to high-density two-dimensional condensate and dramatically increased at the droplet-like condensate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B-C</xref>). Clathrin fluorescence intensity followed the same trend, increasing at the border of two-dimensional HRS condensates and substantially increasing at the HRS droplet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Our fluorescence microscopy data with HRS condensates and labeled clathrin support the idea of three different HRS populations on the membrane: 1) low-density HRS, 2) two-dimensional HRS condensates, and 3) droplet-like HRS condensates, which all readily recruit clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We looked at the clathrin coat architecture on droplets and two-dimensional condensates using PREM. Platinum replica samples prepared with 2 µM HRS and 200 nM clathrin at room temperature showed extensive amounts of clathrin cages at the surface of HRS droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D-F</xref>).

These flat clathrin lattices were similar to those we observed at 500nM HRS concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that these dense, round-shaped patches of flat clathrin are assembled on two-dimensional HRS condensates.</p><p id="P18">We then wanted to measure the height of HRS-clathrin coat.

As earlier, the thickness of HRS condensates was around 10 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). When clathrin was assembled on these two-dimensional HRS condensates, it yielded a coat with a median height of 16-18 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with our observations of different layers of HRS-clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and S4B-C), HRS-clathrin coats imaged with HS-AFM had regions with different heights (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A-B</xref>). The height of the thicker regions was around 20-30 nm, while the height of the thinner ones was 15-20 nm, consistent with stacking of layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A-B</xref>). We observed hexagonal and pentagonal clathrin structures especially on the thicker regions, while the thinner regions appeared to contain less structured clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C-D</xref>).

Interestingly, with 0% and 15% cholesterol, HRS was recruited on the membrane as small patches, whereas on membranes with 30% cholesterol, HRS either formed larger patches or covered the whole GUV membrane. We wondered if cholesterol could also promote the wetting of SLB membranes by HRS condensates. To test this, we prepared SLBs with varying cholesterol concentrations as above (0%, 15%, or 30% cholesterol) and tested the membrane wetting by using 2 µM fluorescently labeled AF488-HRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Moreover, we did not observe membrane deformation upon HRS-clathrin coat assembly on GUV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that the physiological assembly of HRS and clathrin may be flat. GUV membranes cannot be remodeled when membrane tension is too high, but lowering the tension through osmotic shocks promotes membrane remodeling by clathrin coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Saleem et al., 2015</xref>). To test the membrane remodeling properties of HRS-clathrin assemblies, we coated GUVs with HRS and clathrin and then lowered the membrane tension with hyperosmotic shocks. HRS and clathrin reconstitution on GUVs containing 0% or 15% cholesterol and subjected to osmotic shock did not change shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, hyperosmotic shocks induced GUV flattening when HRS and clathrin were reconstituted on GUVs containing 30% cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Such flattening, which appeared as facets on the GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) and gives them the appearance of a broken line to the GUV contour, was previously observed with protein assemblies that preferred low curvature areas, such as Snf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Souza et al., 2025</xref>).

TopFluor fluorescence decreased as a function of HRS concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11B</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that HRS clusters cholesterol.

While it may look incoherent that HRS-dependent clustering of TopFluor-Cholesterol leads to global fluorescence quenching at the same time as fluorescence increase under the HRS domains, the lateral segregation of cholesterol under HRS domains could lead to apparition of fluorescent domains while promoting quenching because of the increased cholesterol density in HRS domains. Cholesterol was enriched under protein domains formed by both HRS condensates alone as well as HRS condensates incubated with clathrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11C</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that cholesterol-rich domains form under HRS and HRS-clathrin patches.</p><p id="P29">The clustering of cholesterol underneath the HRS-clathrin coat should be associated with reduced diffusion, which can be measured by FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kefauver et al., 2024</xref>).

Here, we reconstituted endosomal, ESCRT-0-driven clathrin coats with minimal components to gain a comprehensive understanding of their assembly mechanism and structural features. We reveal that HRS directly interacts with the membrane, initially forming a low-density protein coat which can also phase-separate into a dense, two-dimensional protein film on the membrane. Clathrin assembles on HRS-rich membrane as a dense coat which has either a flat or cup-shape architecture depending on the nature of the condensate it binds to (two-dimensional films versus three-dimensional droplets). Our experiments with GUVs show that the dense HRS-clathrin coat flattens low tension membranes, indicating that the flat architecture is a dominant feature of the HRS-clathrin coat.

This layering of clathrin structures is also seen in our in vitro samples. Notably, two-dimensional HRS condensates and HRS-clathrin coats on SLBs had a thickness of 10 nm and 20-30 nm, respectively, which are in the range of the measured distance between the membrane and the clathrin lattice on endosomes. Besides the fact that the in vivo and in vitro structures are multi-layered with similar thicknesses, the layer closer to the membrane contains clear flat clathrin lattices both in vivo and in vitro. Sub-tomogram averaging revealed a hexagonal lattice 16 nm away from the endosome membrane, which resembled other clathrin assemblies imaged in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Heuser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kravčenko et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Tagiltsev et al., 2021</xref>). Supporting a two-dimensional condensate of HRS forming the ESCRT-0 structure, we did not observe a distinct protein structure between the clathrin layer and the membrane, where HRS is expected to localize. This observation could be explained by the intrinsically disordered nature of HRS, which will result in “averaging out” relative to the clathrin lattice. We observed two additional protein layers on top of the hexagonal clathrin lattice on endosomes. These layers did not show apparent symmetry and the identity of these additional layers remains to be solved. We speculate that the three layers of this unique coat could be stacks of two-dimensional condensates separated by different types of clathrin assemblies. The flat nature of the HRS-clathrin coat may be due to the higher rigidity, associated with the loss of diffusion, of the two-dimensional HRS condensate that could force clathrin to adapt a flat layer.</p><p id="P33">Protein phase separation through IDRs is a phenomenon that has recently been shown to play an important role in membrane remodeling and membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ravindran and Michnick, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mangiarotti et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bussi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Schiano Lomoriello et al., 2022</xref>).

However, to our best knowledge, HRS is the first protein directly interacting with clathrin that undergoes condensation. Thus, HRS and clathrin are unique in combining a liquid-like protein condensate and a well-structured protein lattice in the same protein assembly and give a plausible explanation why clathrin coats on endosomes have distinct, multilayered architecture compared to clathrin structures on the plasma membrane and on other organelles. In addition, HRS phase separation may be needed to circumvent the ESCRT-0 domains in delimited regions of endosomes, as without phase separation, the HRS-clathrin coat could grow indefinitely because it is flat.</p><p id="P34">We show that when HRS and clathrin form a protein coat on the membrane, they change the membrane composition by enriching cholesterol under the protein coat. Here, cholesterol shows lower diffusion, which suggests that HRS and clathrin can promote the formation of cholesterol-rich membrane domains. Since HRS does not contain cholesterol-binding domains or motifs, cholesterol enhances HRS recruitment via an indirect mechanism. Cholesterol was shown to increase the phosphoinositide-dependent membrane interaction with other proteins by clustering phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lolicato et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the interaction of protein condensates with membranes is coupled with lipid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>). We speculate that HRS combines these mechanisms to promote cholesterol clustering and membrane domain formation. HRS-clathrin coats form distinct protein domains on endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9e</xref>), which were also reported by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wenzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Norris et al., 2017</xref>). How these protein domains are assembled in the first place and how their size is regulated have remained unanswered questions. We propose that the feedback loop between HRS recruitment and the formation of cholesterol-rich membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) facilitates the rise of HRS-positive microdomains on endosomes. Supporting this, the depletion of CD63, a tetraspanin protein that sorts cholesterol to ILVs on endosome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Palmulli et al., 2024</xref>), results in an unusual abundance of multilayered clathrin coats on multivesicular endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">van Niel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Niemann-Pick C (NPC) 1 and NPC2 proteins at lysosomes are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ikonen and Zhou, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Ikonen, 2008</xref>). Our observation that cholesterol depletion increases the HRS localization at endosomes highlights that cholesterol homeostasis is an important factor regulating ESCRT function and, more globally, the endosomal activity in cells.

To our knowledge, the effect of sterols on clathrin adaptor recruitment and clathrin assembly on the plasma membrane has not been studied thoroughly. However, it would not be surprising if cholesterol affects clathrin adaptor recruitment on cellular membranes in a similar fashion to HRS. It would thus be interesting to test if clathrin adaptor proteins linked to endocytosis, long-lived plasma membrane clathrin plaques, or reticular adhesions are regulated by sterols.</p><p id="P36">In conclusion, we reveal the unique mechanism of how endosomal protein microdomains of ESCRT-0 and clathrin are formed. Clathrin is assembled as a hexagonal lattice on HRS, which forms two-dimensional condensates on membranes. The interplay between the cholesterol-rich membranes and HRS condensates facilitates the protein recruitment on the membrane and formation of a cholesterol-rich diffusion barrier in the membrane. This mechanism also provides a platform for cargo clustering under the HRS-clathrin microdomain. Future studies will reveal how cargo proteins are transported from the HRS-clathrin domain to the intraluminal vesicle.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Plasmids and protein purification</title><p id="P37">All lipids used in this study are commercially available at Avanti Polar Lipids and are listed with their respective catalog numbers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

Chloroform was evaporated under argon gas and then in a vacuum, and lipids were hydrated in a reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 125 mM KAc). Liposomes were then freeze-thawed 10 times with a water bath and liquid nitrogen and then extruded through 100-nm polycarbonate filters using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). To measure TopFluor-cholesterol fluorescence quenching, the final concentration of 50 µM liposomes was mixed with the desired concentration of HRS in the reaction buffer.

The scale bar is 5 µm. The experiment was repeated four times (N=4) with similar results. (D) A model of HRS and clathrin assembly on PI(3)P-rich membrane in a cholesterol-dependent manner. HRS binds to PI(3)P through its FYVE domain (1), and clusters cholesterol, which leads to increased HRS recruitment on the membrane (2) and finally to the formation of a stable, cholesterol-rich membrane domain under dense HRS clathrin lattice (3). High local protein concentration leads to the formation of two-dimensional HRS condensates. High-density HRS lattice and stable cholesterol domain under the protein promote cargo sorting under the HRS-clathrin lattice (4). All HRS populations recruit clathrin. Ubiquitinated cargoes get clustered under the HRS-clathrin lattice, and cholesterol stabilizes these HRS-cargo clusters (5).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199183-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
