However, this type of catalysis would be even more thriving if customizable and stable protein scaffolds would be readily available. Such highly stable protein scaffolds could act as asymmetric reaction chambers in catalyzing a wide range of reactions. In this study, we are detailing the design and experimental characterization of computationally designed de novo proteins with a non-natural fold, which act as biocatalysts. The initial design and several variants of it, catalyze the aldol condensation and the retro-aldol reaction. All designs form a helical barrel structure comprised of six antiparallel straight helices connected by five loops, resulting in an open channel with two accessible cavities. The designs exhibit high thermal stability and an excellent overall fit between measured and calculated scattering profiles from small-angle x-ray scattering experiments. An experimentally determined crystal structure of a surface redesigned variant shows close to perfect agreement to the design model. To highlight the versatility and mutational tolerance of this fold, we rationally designed variants in which the active site is placed at different positions throughout the central channel of the original design. Finally, we showcase that the initial design as well as variants exhibit significant aldolase/retro-aldolase activity in whole cell biotransformations, making them the first de novo biocatalysts to be tested in this form. With a tolerance of up to 20% of organic solvent, these designs hold promise for further utilization and optimization in the field of white biotechnology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since the turn of the century, biocatalysis has emerged as an indispensable tool for chemists, offering unparalleled precision and selectivity in chemical transformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Particularly in the production of fine chemicals, biocatalysis has become a method of choice, owing to its ability to finely control stereochemical outcomes of reactions while producing minimal amounts of waste and exhibiting an excellent resource-balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Early efforts in biocatalysis predominantly relied on natural enzymes, which often posed limitations in terms of scope and versatility. However, with the advent of directed evolution, a revolutionary opportunity arose to tailor native enzymes to specific process conditions. This breakthrough facilitated the enhancement of enzyme activity for both native and novel substrates and the optimization of stereoselectivity and adaptability to diverse reaction environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition to these experimental advancements, computational tools offered valuable assistance in the engineering and analysis of experimental-directed evolution workflows The integration of computational methods into the biocatalysis toolkit represented a significant milestone, promising to expedite the development of next-generation biocatalysts with enhanced performance characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the use of biocatalysts for synthetic purposes has contributed significantly to the transition of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries towards clean production processes and a renewable resource base<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Most of these approaches relied either on the identification of a spurious activity in a naturally occurring protein or used natural protein scaffolds as starting points. In both situations the starting points are likely to be compromised by evolutionary effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, something that can be overcome by using de novo proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Custom designed de novo enzymes can become an alternative to natural starting points and should even further enhance the aforementioned advances to aid in the remedy of biotechnological challenges of the 21st century. Several recent publications demonstrated this, creating highly active luciferases, heme-dependent (oxidation) enzymes, xylanases, P450 enzymes and more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. An emphasized detail of these studies is their high specificity for the designed reaction and substrates. As a result, though, the current paradigm for desiging efficient biocatalysts is to design entirely new proteins for each new substrate and reaction. While this approach is valuable and robust, it is not suited to quickly engineer catalysts for well-known chemical reactions or reactions accessible only through cofactor binding. Additionally, small de novo scaffolds often are not very tolerant against variations in their amino acid sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. For this, we need to address functional design and selection for activity within a single, highly stable protein fold, able to withstand destabilizing variations. The broad availability of accurate structure prediction methods and protein design tools encourages an investigation in this direction. This also offers a shot to apply de novo biocatalysts for whole cell biotransformations, arguably still the most valuable way of using enzymes for synthesis purposes.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present a highly versatile protein scaffold which acts as an efficient whole cell biocatalyst, designed by finely sampling helical arrangements of long straight alpha-helices using parametric design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In addition to finding optimal packing solutions for an anti-parallel six helix barrel with high thermostability, we investigate placement of a potent catalytic array along the central channel of the design to probe its resistance to high mutational loads and exemplify its versatility as a re-usable asymmetric reaction chamber by designing nine variants. Biochemical and biophysical characterization as well as an experimentally determined structure allowed us to test several of the above-described features, we deem necessary for a universally applicable de novo protein backbone for biotransformations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Parametric design allows for ultrafine backbone geometry optimization</title><p id="P5">We set out to design a multifunctional de novo protein chassis, which can be used as an asymmetric reaction chamber. To do so, we aimed at designing anti-parallel six-helical barrels accommodating ligand or substrate accessible channels, starting from the design principles elucidated during the design of four-helix bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To identify stable arrangements, we extensively sampled super-helical coiling, radius and the translation along the central axis of the individual helices. Loops to connect the individual helices were kept short and idealized. This resulted in lowest energy sequences for totally straight helical arrangements with 18-residues repeating units and an average diameter of 15.7 Å (Cα-Cα of opposing helices, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to smaller helical bundles, the large helical barrels do not allow for tightly packed cores. Thus, the biggest contribution to structural integrity is coming from neighboring anti-parallel helices. Naturally occurring helical barrels with similar numbers of anti-parallel helices typically feature oligomerization of smaller, stable entities or stabilizing domains on each side of the helix barrel due to the lack of a stably packed core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which makes this approach very challenging from a design perspective. The backbones of these designs were generated as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and by using the parametric design code as implemented into Rosetta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The straight helices and overall configurations made it possible to install salt-bridges across the barrel at two distinct positions, thereby, enhancing the folding and stability of the generated designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We generated eleven versions of such designs with different twists and repeating units, however, only one of the designs – 6H5L – could be produced in high amounts in the wet lab and exhibited an all-helical circular dichroism (CD) signal and high thermostability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C&amp;D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Interestingly, during combinatorial sequence design calculations, we found that the frequency of alanine incorporation at helical interface positions strongly depended on the set supercoil and individual helical coiling parameters, with some designs being overpopulated with this residue type, even though no obvious geometry or space restrictions were apparent. Therefore, we adjusted the Rosetta reference energies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to achieve the desired residue identity balance. All the herein described designs were computed prior to the advent of machine learning based structure prediction methods and thus could not be tested in this respect prior to ordering synthetic genes. However, we and others recently found that AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> could accurately predict the structures of designed helical barrels from single-sequence input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, we checked 6H5L and all its variant sequences subsequently on their prediction quality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">suppl Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of the parametrically designed helix bundles in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p id="P8">Production of the parametrically designed protein 6H5L and all its variants yielded soluble protein after production in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The proteins were purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, yielding nearly identical SEC chromatogram profiles for 6H5L and its variants, featuring a prominent absorbance peak at 280 nm with the expected retention volume for a protein of this size. In addition, the chromatograms displayed a second minor peak, which corresponded to a dimeric form of our designs. However, excellent separation between the monomeric and dimeric form could be achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S2A</xref>). The pooled and concentrated fractions from the monomer peak were confirmed to contain highly pure protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To confirm folding and the secondary structure content of our designs, we recorded CD spectra for both pure 6H5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and its variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Table S6</xref>). All recorded spectra exhibited a characteristic α-helical profile. Notably, these structures exhibit very high thermal stability as exemplified by only a minimal loss of signal (222nm) during temperature ramps up to 95 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>) and refolding after cooling back down to 20°C. This highlights the robustness of the designs, even when introducing mutations in the core for active site redesign (all single K and YQY variants) or on the surface for improved crystal formation (FKQ variant). A summary of all CD spectra from all variants can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>. To assess barrel formation, we used previously described binding experiments of fluorescent molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> One of the benefits of this assay is that it can be performed in a semi-high throughput manner using 96-well plates. All designs exhibited saturation binding curves, which could be fitted to a one-site total binding model for calculating dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>). The observed affinities are in the micromolar range with specific K<sub>D</sub>s between 1.1 to 4.5 <underline>µM</underline> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). These results corroborate the designed barrel-like structures for all designs. To further investigate the correct folding and dynamics of our designed proteins, we employed SAXS measurements. The obtained results show good fits between the measured and calculated scattering profiles, characterized by low chi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> values, particularly within the Guinier region of the logarithmic plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Table S6</xref>). All obtained fits indicate that the designs exhibit the expected behavior in solution, consistent with the AlphaFold2 predicted models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">An important feature of a practically applicable biocatalyst is its stability and activity in organic (co)solvent. We assessed the stability of 6H5L <italic>in</italic> up to 30% DMSO over time points of 0, 3, and 24 hours. Notable instability was observed only in concentrations of 30% DMSO and higher, highlighting the proteins high solvent tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protein crystallization and structure determination</title><p id="P11">Initial crystallization of the original 6H5L sequence resulted in the formation of 2D crystals only and ultimately did not produce high enough diffraction quality to determine an experimental structure. However, protein modification to enhance crystal contact formation by exchanging a total of 15 lysine residues on the equivalent helical wheel <italic>f</italic> position with glutamine (6H5L_FKQ variant), lowered the pI from 8.99 to 5.7 and resulted in well-ordered three-dimensional crystals diffracting up to 2.8 Å. To ensure that this extensive residue exchange did not interfere with correct folding, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the 6H5L_FKQ structure and found that it closely matched the original 6H5L, with an RMSD of 0.17 across all atoms.</p><p id="P12">The 2.8 Å structure of 6H5L_FKQ shows an overall high degree of similarity to that of the design model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with the predicted straight helices, no supercoil twist and the 18-residue repeating unit. The packing differences within individual repeats between design and structure are minimal with an Ca-atom RMSD of ∼0.7 Å over the core repeating units. This structure is another example of a computationally designed helix bundle that deviates from perfect supercoil geometry, further corroborating that low energy structures for monomeric antiparallel helix bundles are not strictly confined to the space spanned by the Crick parameterization, particularly not near the turns.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Exploring the catalytic potential of the <italic>de novo</italic> designed structure</title><p id="P13">The design model of 6H5L, confirmed by crystallography, presents an open, straight six-helix barrel with a hydrophobic channel, highly effective at binding hydrophobic aromatic molecules, as proven by DPH and TMA-DPH fluorescence assays. Crystallographic analysis also identified two hydrophobic cavities within the barrel, each accommodating three lysine residues, electrostatically coupled with three glutamates, forming two identical electrostatic rings. We reasoned that this feature should in principle enhance the lysine nucleophilicity, which is crucial for various enzymatic reactions. Moreover, structure prediction and experimental characterization of variants, with a single lysine in the central channel and the remaining five replaced by arginines, still showed very similar behavior to the original 6H5L design. This enables the identification of the active lysine residue. Have a potentially nucleophilic lysine present, we opted to assay the designs for the retro-aldol reaction, utilizing methodol <bold>3</bold> as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was selected as the model system due to its simplicity and the established reliability and sensitivity of fluorescence measurement techniques, facilitating easy application.</p><p id="P14">As a proxy to assess the ability of the original 6H5L design and its variants to catalyze retro-aldol reaction through an active nucleophilic lysine, we conducted an inhibition reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) using the corresponding 1,3-diketone derivative <bold>5</bold> (1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthalenyl)-1,3-butanedione) of methodol <bold>2</bold>. This derivative is expected to covalently react exclusively with the catalytically active lysine residue (H<sub>2</sub>N-Enz) through a Schiff-base intermediate, forming a stable vinylogous amide <bold>6</bold>. The reaction was monitored using a UV-Vis spectrometer.</p><p id="P15">After the reaction of 1,3-diketone inhibitor <bold>5</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) with 6H5L and its six single lysine variants, the resulting UV-Vis absorbance spectra show a new peak at 340 nm compared to the free protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This indicates the successful formation of vinylogous amide via Schiff-base, underlining the capability of these proteins to catalyze a retro-aldol reaction. The intensity of the vinylogous amide absorbance peak increases with an increasing protein-to-diketone ratio (1:1, 5, and 10), indicating more diketone binding with higher concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The vinylogous amide peak of 6H5L has almost double the intensity compared to its variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting activity in both binding pockets, while only one pocket is active in the single lysine variants.</p><p id="P16">To exclude spurious activity from surface residues and confirm specific activity through the lysine residues in the central channel, we performed competition assays between the diketone inhibitor and DPH. The first competition assay showed a decrease in fluorescence intensity for the diketone-labeled 6H5L in comparison to the free 6H5L protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S5A</xref>). This decrease persisted even at higher diketone inhibitor concentrations. The decrease in fluorescence intensity provides conclusive evidence of diketone binding within the hydrophobic channel of 6H5L, effectively blocking the central channel and preventing the binding of DPH. The reverse way of the competition assay, involving the titration of diketone inhibitor into 6H5L previously saturated with DPH dye, demonstrated a progressive decrease in fluorescence intensity with the addition of more diketone inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) value of 0.27 mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S5B</xref>). These findings elucidate the heightened binding affinity of covalently bound diketone with 6H5L, displacing noncovalently bound DPH molecules from the hydrophobic channel. Consequently, this displacement led to the observed decrease in fluorescence, confirming the binding of the diketone inhibitor to the lysine residues within the central channel.</p><p id="P17">To test for retro-aldolase activity, a well-established fluorescence-based method to measure the formation of a naphthaldehyde derivative (6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde) <bold>1</bold> as product from racemic methodol <bold>3</bold> as a substrate, was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The original 6H5L design demonstrated noticeable retro-aldolase activity with a second-order rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>/K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, of 1.96 M<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This rate is comparable to some of the first <italic>de novo</italic> retro aldolases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This underscores its potential as a promising retro aldolase candidate by further improvement. An important validation experiment for this is checking the pH dependence of the monitored reaction. We found that the activity of 6H5L decreased at lower pH levels in the reaction media but remained significantly higher compared to the knockout version (6H5L_6R), which lacks any lysine residues inside the two binding pockets. The knockout version (6H5L_6R) exhibited almost no activity at pH 6, whereas 6H5L remained visibly active under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S6</xref>). This illustrates the active nucleophilicity of the lysines in the hydrophobic channel while maintaining inactive protonated lysines on the surface at lower pH.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Single lysine and knockout variants</title><p id="P18">To identify the most catalytically proficient lysine among the six within the hydrophobic channel, we designed six single-lysine variants (19K, 37K, 121K, 139K, 223K, 241K). Each variant features one lysine in the hydrophobic channel, with the other five lysine residues being replaced by arginines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, we used the knockout variant 6H5L_6R, which lacks any lysine residues within the two binding pockets as a negative control. All six single lysine variants exhibited measurable activity over time, albeit with lower activity than the original 6H5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests the possibility of both cavities being active and highlights the influence proximity effects of nearby lysine residues in lowering the <italic>pKa</italic> of the nucleophilic lysine.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Placing of a catalytic tetrad enhances the activity of the designed retro-aldolase</title><p id="P19">We aimed to enhance retro-aldolase activity by introducing the highly evolved active site of the efficient retro-aldolase RA95.5-8F <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> into 6H5L. This involved incorporation of two tyrosine residues, one glutamine, and a catalytic lysine (KYQY tetrad) to form a fully connected hydrogen bond network. Initially, we selected the single lysine variant 223K as our starting point and used Foldit as an interface to Rosetta to redesign three residues near this lysine to the corresponding tyrosines and glutamine. The resulting model was repacked and minimized. This process resulted in the design of the 223K_YQY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In a second approach, we used RosettaMatch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> for a comprehensive search for geometric matches of 1,3-diketone <bold>5</bold> (1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthalenyl)-1,3-butanedione) and the residues form the evolved active site of RA95.5-8F within our parent 6H5L design model. Initially, we confined this search to the central lysine resides and their immediate surroundings, which led to the design 37K_YQY. Furthermore, matching across the entire scaffold, led to the design variant 6H5L_199K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Combinatorial sequence design in Rosetta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> was used to optimize the amino acids surrounding the cavities hosting the ligand. The best scoring design was superimposed onto the best-ranked AF2 predicted structure of the same sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Both 37K_YQY and 6H5L_199K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) designs with the lowest rmsd were selected and ordered as synthetic genes for the purpose of evaluating the resulting protein folding behavior and catalytic efficiency. All 6H5L active site redesign versions were successfully produced and characterized using our standard methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Both the rational (223K_YQY) and computational (37K_YQY) redesigns of the active site exhibited almost a 3-fold and 3.5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared to the single lysine variant 223K and the original 6H5L design, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure. S7A&amp;B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To confirm that the increase in catalytic efficiency arises from the newly installed active site and redesigned cavity, knockout variants K223A_YQY and K37A_YQY were tested.

While this is a highly efficient strategy, it lacks the ease that many of the orthogonal approaches, like organocatalysis, exhibit - to quickly and rationally engineer and repurpose catalysts for envisioned reactions. One way of gaining quicker access to products of interest and using the exquisite asymmetric environment that a protein provides, is via a highly versatile and stable protein chassis with a high mutational tolerance. Our study constitutes a significant step forward in this direction. Using the highly accurate backbone generation via parametric design, we demonstrated that such a scaffold for holding catalytic centers in an asymmetric environment can be made and yields moderately efficient enzymes while screening as little as nine variants. While the most active design does not show an improvement over previous in-silico designs, its high thermostability and solvent tolerance allows it to be used as an efficient whole cell biocatalyst. This highlights the compromise between ease of engineering and high-rate accelerations, usually only achieved through lengthy laboratory evolution campaigns. However, the ability to scaffold catalytic centers in a robust protein chassis with high accuracy now allows the type of experiments that can elucidate such structure- and function relationships quickly, helping to build models for synthetic strategies in biomolecules.</p><p id="P26">Thorough biochemical characterization allowed us to identify practically useful enzymes that exhibited high stability and moderate turnover in whole cell biotransformations. For generalized models of proteins being used as asymmetric reaction chambers, datasets like this will be needed for a diverse set of chemical transformations. In addition, the ability to design protein scaffolds like ours could foster the creation of a set of asymmetric environments that can be highly engineered to be used as versatile biocatalysts. Much like the streptavidin system has been used to anchor artificial cofactors to an asymmetric environment and thereby fostered the development of new synthesis routes, our approach could drive the development of methods for reusability of de novo designed functional proteins.</p><p id="P27">Finally, whole cell biotransformations have played a pivotal role in biocatalysis campaigns to create synthetic routes to new pharmaceuticals and complex fine chemicals. Here, we established a protein scaffold which shows great promise in being generally applicable for biotransformations.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p id="P28">All individual protein variants were ordered as gene fragments and cloned using Gibson assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> into the pEThTEV plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure.
