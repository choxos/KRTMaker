This is especially true for soils, where dramatic shifts in resource input or physicochemical properties occur through land use and agricultural practices. Here, we examined the relationships between soil properties and bacterial traits within highly managed agricultural soil systems subjected to arable crop rotations or management as permanent pasture. We assessed the bacterial communities within these soils using amplicon sequencing and assigned each amplicon trait scores for rRNA copy number, genome size, and GC content, which are classically associated with potential growth rates and specialisation. We also calculated the niche breadth trait of each amplicon as a measure of social ubiquity within the examined samples. Within this soil system, we demonstrated that pH was the primary driver of bacterial traits. The weighted mean trait scores of the samples revealed that bacterial communities associated with soils at lower pH (&lt;7) tended to have larger genomes (possess more potential plasticity), have more rRNA (higher growth rate potential), and are more ubiquitous (have less niche specialisation) than the bacterial communities from higher pH soils. Our findings highlight not only the association between pH and bacterial community composition but also the importance of pH in driving community functionality by directly influencing genomic and niche traits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genomic traits</kwd><kwd>metabarcoding</kwd><kwd>land use</kwd><kwd>soil properties</kwd><kwd>agricultural systems</kwd><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd><kwd>social niche breadth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Microbial genomic traits such as genome size and rRNA copy number are key indicators of niche breadth and ecological strategies in soil bacterial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These traits reflect the ability of microorganisms to adapt to varying environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, including nutrient availability, pH, and organic matter content. Understanding the relationship between soil properties and microbial genomic traits is crucial for advancing our knowledge of microbial ecology, particularly in agricultural systems, where soil management practices can significantly alter these properties.</p><p id="P3">Agricultural soils represent a significant portion of land use in the United Kingdom, with 70% of the total land area classified as Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In 2023, the total arable area in the UK was reported to be just over 6.0 million hectares, accounting for approximately 36% of the UAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Soils in these agricultural systems vary widely in pH and organic matter content, which are critical factors that influence soil dwelling microbial communities and their genomic traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that conversion to arable land leads to modified microbial communities, where the consequences include reductions in functionality and decreases in genes relating to important biogeochemical cycles, including those that indlfluence the cycling and fate of carbon, phosphorous and nitrogen containing compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, the age of managed and permanent pastures, key for providing food and income, affects the microbial community, especially bacteria, through the influence of soil physicochemical properties, such as pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Microbial metabolic versatility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and the ability of taxa to thrive in diverse and fluctuating environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> are typically associated with larger genome sizes and increased rRNA copy numbers. Conversely, smaller genomes and fewer rRNA copies suggest specialisation and efficiency under more stable or resource-limited conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The ability of soil microbial communities to adapt to changes in soil properties, such as pH and organic matter content, is reflected in these genomic traits, which in turn influence the overall health and functionality of the soil ecosystem. For example, Wilhelm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> demonstrated a positive relationship between genome size and rRNA copy number in soil bacteria. These genomic traits are relevant for understanding the classical concept of ecological niche breadth, which defines the range of conditions under which organisms can survive in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Although niche breadth has previously been assessed with respect to environmental variables, it has been limited to specific taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> or environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, the notion of generalists, taxa found in many samples or predefined habitats, and specialists, taxa that are rare or highly fastidious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, have not been assessed in soils under land use effects, necessitating the need to understand how anthropogenic influences affect the social niche breadth of microorganisms.</p><p id="P5">To test the relationship between microbial traits and environmental influences, we assessed microbial communities and their traits in soils from arable and permanent grassland across 245 samples from 68 fields at 20 farms in southern UK/England. By leveraging systematic sampling and molecular methods, our study provides novel insights into the relationship between soil properties and microbial genomic traits in agricultural systems, especially arable and permanent pastures, the latter of which are relatively unknown. Our findings highlight the importance of pH as a key factor influencing microbial genomic traits, such as size and niche breadth, challenging the view that nutrient availability (carbon content) is a key determinant of these traits. These results have important implications for understanding microbial adaptation in agricultural soils and the management of soils in these systems for specific ecological outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P6">During the Autumn of 2019, 245 subsurface (&lt;15 cm) soils were sampled from 68 fields in southern England, by Agrii-Masstock Arable (UK) Limited.

The filtering settings were as follows: maximum number of Ns (maxN) = 0 and maximum number of expected errors (maxEE) = (5,5). Sequences were dereplicated, and the DADA2 core sequence variant inference algorithm was applied. Forward and reverse reads were then merged using the <italic>mergePairs</italic> function to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).

To do this ASV taxonomies were matched iteratively to IMG-ER representative genomes as described by Markowitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Genomic traits summarised by the database were downloaded (September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2024) for all isolate, single-cell amplified, and metagenome-assembled genomes. Based on the availability of taxonomies in the IMG-ER database, relevant genomic traits such as genome size, rRNA operon copy number, coding density, and GC content were retained. ASVs with unclassified genera were iteratively matched to higher taxonomic ranks. For example, if a particular genus did not have a genome size, the genome size of the family to which the genus was ascribed was used. To confirm rRNA copy numbers, a FASTA file containing the representative sequences of all ASVs was used to approximate rRNA copies using an Artificial Neural Network Approximator (ANNA16)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. A consensus of the rRNA copies was used for subsequent analyses. The weighted mean rRNA copies, weighted mean GC, and weighted mean genome size of each sample were calculated using the rarified sequence abundance table.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Social niche breadth</title><p id="P15">To determine the niche breadth of the identified ASVs within the dataset, we used the social niche breadth (SNB) metric, as described by Miejenfeldt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. SNB quantifies the diversity of ecological interactions that a microbial taxon engages in by analysing co-occurrence patterns across samples. First, the taxonomic profiles were rarefied to equal sequencing depths to avoid bias from differential sequencing coverage. The rarefied data were then formatted and processed using the <italic>calculate_SNB.py</italic> script from the SNB analysis toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MGXlab/social_niche_breadth_SNB">https://github.com/MGXlab/social_niche_breadth_SNB</ext-link>). SNB scores for each ASV were calculated based on their co-occurrence with other taxa, reflecting the range of ecological networks an ASV interacts with, where higher scores indicate a more generalist strategy and lower scores reflect specialisation. For each sample, a weighted mean SNB score was computed by combining the SNB scores of all ASVs present, weighted individually by their abundance (count), to provide an overall measure of the sample’s community niche breadth. This approach was used to assess how environmental factors influence microbial generalisation or specialisation across samples.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Phylogenetic and PhyloFactor analysis</title><p id="P16">For phylogenetic analysis, we generated a multiFasta file from the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table produced by the DADA2 pipeline. We utilised the DECIPHER package in R to align the DNA sequences. Following alignment, we constructed a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree based on a distance matrix calculated from the aligned sequences using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, employing the General Time Reversible (GTR) model for optimisation. The resulting optimised ML tree served as the basis for subsequent phylogenetic analyses, including downstream PhyloFactor analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This analysis incorporated taxonomic data, which were combined into a single column (lineage), along with the ASV abundances and associated metadata. To further evaluate potential biases in the estimated SNB across different lineages, including dominant and rare taxa, we assessed phylogenetic signals within the dataset. Specifically, we estimated Blomberg’s K and Pagel’s Lambda using phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regression for statistical inference (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Code availability</xref>).</p><p id="P17">As highlighted above, to analyse phylogenetic factors driving patterns in community composition, we employed the PhyloFactor package in R, where the input was the phyloseq object. We ensured that the phylogenetic tree was unrooted using the unroot function from the ape package, a critical step for the proper functioning of the PhyloFactor method. The ASV abundances were modelled as a response variable to the SNB score of the individual ASVs, applying a log-ratio transformation and establishing a significance threshold of 0.01. We specified several factors (n=15) to be evaluated, from which the detailed summaries of the PhyloFactor analysis were extracted, selecting for significant taxa.</p><p id="P18">For data visualisation, isometric log-ratio (ILR) boxplots, incorporating the ILR results into the phyloseq object through a custom function (see Code availability), were generated.

To understand how arable and permanent pastures vary in microbial composition, diversity, and abundance, in this study, we analysed 245 soil samples collected from arable and permanent pasture fields across southern England (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The average pH of these soil samples was 7.6 (range 5.6 to 8.7), and the average LOI was 7.7% (range 3.1% to 16.1%). A weak but significantly positive relationship between pH and LOI (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), demonstrating that this sample set does not conform to the broadly typical trend of high LOI at low pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This non-conformity can be explained due to the limited land use range, and because of the prevalence of samples with basic parent material where this trend breaks down<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. An ordination analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) revealed that, as per previous studues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, the soil bacterial communities were primarily structured by pH.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Broad taxonomic variability across arable and permanent pastures</title><p id="P22">In-depth classification and analysis of the taxonomic components of the soils led to the observation of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobiota, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Crenarchaeota, Planctomycetota, and Myxococcota phyla being within the ten most abundant and cosmopolitan phyla within the soils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Among these, the abundant phyla Entotheonellaeota, Crenarchaeota, Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Nitrospirota, NB1-j, Methylomirabilota, RCP2-54, and Bacteroidota were found to be positively correlated/associated with pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). A selection of the same taxa also positively correlated with LOI. Conversely, taxa, such as Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobiota, and WPS-2, were negatively correlated with pH. Diversity (Simpson’s) was found to increase with soil pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), again highlighting that these soils from highly managed land use exhibit atypical characteristics when compared to broader national surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Soil properties influence genomic traits of bacteria</title><p id="P23">Given the observed variability in community composition and abundance, it is important to understand the effect of inherent soil properties on bacterial communities within arable and permanent pastures. To achieve this, we assessed the relationship between the dominant soil properties (pH and LOI) and the genomic traits of bacteria found in these soils. Importantly, we focused on genome size and rRNA copy number which are indicative of life history, ecological strategies, and evolutionary adaptation. Genomic traits of the observed taxa were determined using genome representatives obtained from the publicly available IMG-ER database (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). We found a positive correlation between the weighted mean genome size and weighted mean rRNA copy number per genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

We found a clear distinction between the weighted mean SNB values, driven primarily by pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, at low pH levels, samples exhibited a higher SNB score, whereas the score was reduced at higher pH. The genome sizes within these communities varied and were diverse, with average genome sizes ranging from 3,263,535 bp to 4,840,393 bp (3,805,988 bp average). To rule out phylogenetic and abundance biases, we applied phylofactorization to assess phylogenetic signals linked to SNB scores. Of the 15 factors tested, 46% (7/15) were associated with high SNB, whereas the remainder were associated with low SNB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, these SNB scores were independent of phylogenetic classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that environmental factors primarily shape community composition. Factor 6 was representative of all factors where taxa across the bacterial tree were included in the low and high SNB clades along the tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Additionally, phylogenetic and abundance factors did not bias SNB, as both dominant and rare taxa were represented in the low and high SNB groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). To further investigate the drivers of SNB, that is, soil properties, we used generalised additive models to establish their importance and significance. Generalised additive model analysis confirmed that alongside pH and LOI, both average GC content (ave.gc; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>), and average rRNA copy number (ave.rrna) were significant drivers of SNB within the observed microbial community (adj. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Our study underscores the significant influence of pH and LOI on shaping microbial community composition in soils from arable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and permanent pasture fields, and demonstrates that the primary structuring factor for these microbial communities is pH.

A positive correlation between pH and LOI with Entotheonellaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Acidobacteria suggests that these taxa may play critical roles in adapting to and mediating the effects of these environmental factors, providing further insight into the ecological strategies employed by these microbial communities. For example, certain taxa may be particularly well adapted to low-pH environments with high LOI, potentially through specialised metabolic pathways or ecological interactions that allow them to thrive under such conditions.

The role of soil carbon fluxes as a key function of microbial interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> is further supported by Garcia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> who reported that soil carbon levels are influenced by microbial interactions. Furthermore, Cole et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> recently reported that in low-pH soils, land use intensification increases microbial physiological constraints and decreases carbon use efficiency. These findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the complex interactions between soil properties and microbial community structure, particularly in managed ecosystems.</p><p id="P27">The observed variability in microbial community composition and abundance across different soil types further led us to hypothesise that microbial genomic traits may reflect adaptive strategies. The positive correlation between genome size and rRNA copy number across these soils suggests that these genomic traits may be key indicators of microbial life history strategies, ecological adaptability, and evolutionary processes. Interestingly, we found that larger genomes and increased rRNA copies were associated with lower pH (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting soil-specific adaptations. Our observations are in agreement with the recent report by Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, where genome sizes across soils from pH 3.7 to 7.2 decreased with higher pH, and also align with the findings of Malik et al.31, where at higher pH, a higher GC content is observed, leading to reduced genome size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that non-acidophilic bacteria, typically observed in soil, do not follow the genome streamlining trends reported by Cortez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Larger genomes and higher rRNA copy numbers may provide a competitive advantage in nutrient-poor, complex, lower pH environments by enabling more efficient resource utilisation and rapid responses to environmental changes and opportunities. We hypothesise that this is likely because of lower pH soils being more environmentally and spatially variable. Although specific gene types are not associated with bacterial pH preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, anion/cation transporters, phosphatases, and efflux pumps have been identified in taxa that share pH associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">These results emphasise the importance of considering genomic traits when assessing microbial community dynamics in response to soil properties, as they offer valuable insights into the adaptive strategies of microbial taxa in different ecological contexts. Furthermore, mean sample SNB estimates revealed that pH was a major determinant of niche differentiation within the microbial community. It is likely that taxa in low [pH 5.5] to neutral pH soils are diverse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and may possess broader ecological niches, potentially due to the need to exploit a wider range of resources or tolerate more variable conditions. This finding supports the idea that metabolic versatility, which is closely correlated with genome size, is higher in communities inhabiting low pH soils. As previously stated, Wilhelm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> demonstrated a positive relationship between genome size and rRNA copy number in soil bacteria, however, unlike Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> our findings indicate that pH, rather than carbon content, is the dominant factor influencing genome size in the soils we examined. This suggests that care must be taken when using the average genome size as a proxy for carbon content or soil health, as pH may play a more significant role in shaping microbial genomic traits than previously thought. Additionally, Malik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> identified a pH threshold of 6.2, above which significant shifts in carbon use efficiency occur, leading to smaller, more specialised genomes with narrower SNB at higher pH levels. The diversity in genome sizes coupled with SNB indicates that microbial taxa may employ different strategies to cope with the challenges posed by varying pH levels and significant additional drivers, such as genome size and rRNA copy number. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that larger genomes are associated with increased metabolic capacities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, potentially explaining the increased niche breadth. Collectively, our findings emphasise the need to understand how soil properties influence microbial ecology, particularly in managed ecosystems, where soil conditions may deviate from broader, natural trends.</p><p id="P29">Overall, this study provides new insights into the relationships among soil physicochemical properties, microbial community composition, and genomic traits in arable and permanent pasture soils. These findings challenge existing paradigms and highlight the need for further research on the specific mechanisms by which microbial communities adapt to and thrive in soils with atypical pH and LOI relationships. By integrating taxonomic, genomic, and ecological analyses, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive microbial diversity and function in these important agricultural ecosystems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199658-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d68aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements and funding</title><p>This project was funded by UKCEH under the ASSIST programme (NERC Reference: NE/N018125/1).
