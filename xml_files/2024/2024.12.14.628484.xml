Advanced techniques based on combinatorial decoding can resolve thousands of features in a reasonable time but are often constrained by either the prohibitive costs associated with commercial platforms or the complexity of developing custom instruments. Alternatively, sequential detection methods, like single-molecule FISH, are easier to implement but offer limited multiplexing capability or signal amplification. Here, we introduce Cassini, a new approach for straightforward, cost-effective multiplexed measurements of mRNA and protein features simultaneously. Cassini leverages rolling circle amplification (RCA), known for its robust amplification and remarkable stability even after intense stripping, to serially detect each feature in under 20 minutes of total experimental time. The method also enables simultaneous immunostaining with either fluorophore-conjugated or DNA-barcoded antibodies, through an optimized immunostaining buffer. In a single overnight run, we show that Cassini can quantify 32 features (comprising both RNA and proteins) with sensitivity similar to state-of-the-art FISH techniques. We provide a comprehensive protocol alongside an online probe-design platform (cassini.me), aiming to enhance accessibility and user-friendliness. With our open-source solution, we aspire to empower researchers to uncover the nuances of spatial gene expression dynamics across diverse biological landscapes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Main</title><p id="P2">Imaging-based spatial genomics technologies enable surveys of biomolecular characteristics in intact tissues at submicron resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. There are primarily two types of methods. One involves combinatorial detection, where each round of detection exponentially increases the number of detectable features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In this detection approach, thousands of transcripts can be examined in fewer than 20 rounds. The other strategy utilizes sequential detection, resulting in a linear increase in the number of identified features with each hybridization round<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, consequently exhibiting much lower multiplexing capacity compared to combinatorial methods. Nevertheless, sequential methods remain prevalent due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation, and ability to achieve the highest sensitivity. State-of-the-art sequential methods employ signal amplification to improve the signal-to-noise ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, each round typically necessitates the re-amplification of the endogenous target molecules, a process that can exceed 24 hours of experimental time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> or requires complex temperature control setups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Other methods, such as osmFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, have a more straightforward cycling regime but suffer from low signal amplification, compromising the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="P3">A major opportunity associated with spatial genomics platforms is the ability to simultaneously profile gene expression and protein expression in the same assay. Existing methods for accomplishing this suffer from relying on complex combinatorial schemes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, low multiplexing capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> or slow and complex cycling setup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. One technical challenge has been the difficulty with combining enzymatic amplification strategies like rolling circle amplification (RCA) with immunostaining that relies on buffer ingredients that can inhibit downstream enzymatic activity. For example, dextran sulfate is used to enhance the staining specificity of DNA-conjugated antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but this potent enzymatic inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> renders downstream enzymatic amplification very challenging.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present a method for spatial profiling of RNA and protein, which we call Cassini in honor of the renowned dynasty of cartographers and astronomers. Our system combines strong signal amplification that can withstand harsh probe stripping, with fast cycling times for a simpler, more straightforward cycling approach. Cassini relies on the ability of PBCV-1 DNA ligase (also known as SplintR ligase) to directly ligate Padlock probes onto RNA templates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. After probe amplification through rolling circle amplification (RCA), the individual gene sequences are directly detected using a specific fluorescent probe. To render our RCA amplification compatible with both conjugated antibodies and conventional immunostaining, we devised: (a) a novel staining buffer to mitigate enzymatic inhibition while preserving specificity; and (b) a post-staining fixation protocol to ensure the retention of the signal. Cassini can detect simultaneously mRNA, conjugated antibodies, and conventional immunostaining and achieves precise spatial mapping of transcripts and proteins. Following probe amplification, we demonstrate the ability to map an entire adult mouse brain hemisphere at a rate of 18 minutes per gene at a low per-sample cost. By leveraging accessible technologies, openly shared protocols and providing a web interface to design the probes (cassini.me), we circumvent the barriers of instrumentation and cost.</p><p id="P5">It has been previously shown that padlock probes can be efficiently ligated and amplified on mRNA template using SplintR ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. First, we confirmed that RCA products remained fixed <italic>in situ</italic> after multiple rounds of stripping with 80% formamide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1a</xref>) with the estimated displacement of the foci being below 200 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1b</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed that the foci count remains constant throughout the cycles, demonstrating that the sensitivity remains stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1c</xref>). However, we discovered that the method strongly compromised conventional immunostaining, suggesting that the antibody is being washed away during the process (see green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2a</xref>). We hypothesized that fixing the antibodies after immunostaining would prevent them from being dislodged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref> top). We therefore post-fixed the antibodies with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours; this modification resulted in the complete restoration of immunostaining signals (orange bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2a</xref>), regardless of whether the initial staining was strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> left), moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> center), or weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> right). We also confirmed that post-fixation does not alter the expected spatial distribution of the immunostaining signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2a</xref>). The quality of the immunostaining remains consistent with the conventional method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2b</xref>, left), whether the secondary immunostaining is performed prior to the second fixation and amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2b</xref>, center) or after the entire process is completed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2b</xref>, right). We next tested DNA-conjugated antibodies with our updated fixation protocol; similar to the conventional immunostaining, the signal was retained post fixation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The DNA-conjugated antibodies frequently employed to increase multiplexing capabilities have an additional challenge associated with their use: blocking buffers employed in conventional immunostaining do not provide sufficient specificity when used with conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> left image and blue line in left panel). Typically, blocking buffer for conjugated antibodies employs high-molecular-weight (&gt;500K) dextran sulfate polymers to prevent off-target binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but these polymers are highly inhibitory to most enzymatic reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> including RCA with Phi29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> center left image and red line in left panel). We tested a variety of alternative blocking additives and discovered that low-molecular-weight (~4K) dextran sulfate can be used as a highly efficient blocking buffer for conjugated antibodies without interfering with the enzymatic amplification and displays very similar profile to conventional immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> right images and green and purple lines in left panel). Due to the RCA amplification, the positive signal would be expected to be orders of magnitude higher when compared to staining with secondary antibodies. To match the optimal signal, the concentration of conjugated antibodies was decreased 100-fold compared to conventional immunostaining. Dual staining of the same antibodies with and without conjugation showed excellent overlapping signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and correlations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>), with some key, interesting differences. Specifically, the conjugated antibodies produced a more punctate signal compared to immunostaining with conventional anti-NeuN antibodies, likely reflecting the localized, rolony-based amplified signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> left). Furthermore, conjugated antibodies showed less positive signal in thin subcellular structures like the astrocytic processes labeled by GFAP immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> right). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a custom immunostaining buffer that preserves the specific binding of conjugated antibodies while maintaining compatibility with enzymatic activity.</p><p id="P7">We next evaluated our method by comparing it to smFISH performed by hybridization chain reaction (HCR), a well-established reference technique for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Cassini produced larger foci (mean of 0.99±0.51 μm<sup>2</sup>) than HCR (mean of 0.55±0.15 μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 5</xref>), which can be advantageous in tissues with high autofluorescence background but could impair sensitivity in cases of overcrowding of highly expressed RNAs. We chose 7 genes with different levels of abundance and compared the measured density in selected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 6</xref>), which was calculated by computing the local foci density within a 10 µm radius around each spot. This quantification approach is advantageous compared to the total count or area density, as it is less sensitive to how the area is selected in each sample, tissue damage or imaging artifact. The foci count was performed by computing the local maxima, with the prominence adjusted to the spot intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 7</xref>). Our method produced results that closely matched those of HCR, with only 2 out of 7 genes showing a significant p-value for local density differences (&lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that the performance of Cassini is comparable regardless of expression density. To confirm this, we compared the expression gradient of Amigo2 across the CA2-CA3 regions, where transcript density shifts from high to low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, top). Along the hippocampal axis, both Cassini and HCR methods yielded comparable values, further validating that gene counts remain unaffected by expression density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next assessed Cassini’s ability to simultaneously probe mRNA alongside both conventional and oligo-conjugated immunostaining. Conventional immunostaining was performed on a brain hemisphere to map the cellular localization of nestin, a marker for neural progenitor cells, and gephyrin, a scaffolding protein associated with inhibitory synapses. Nestin is a cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein that forms expansive fibrous networks. By contrast, gephyrin displays a more uniform distribution, characterized by widespread punctae indicative of its localization to inhibitory synapses. In this configuration, two channels are used for conventional immunostaining and the third is available to survey mRNA and conjugated antibodies. On this same sample, we also measured expression of 8 RNA species, and stained with two conjugated antibodies in 10 rounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 9</xref>). The spatial patterns of the RNA features were highly concordant with the patterns of the same genes in Allen Mouse Brain Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 9b</xref>). We confirmed that the conventional immunostaining (nestin and gephryn) remained intact throughout the 10 rounds of stripping and re-probing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 10</xref>). This experiment demonstrates the ability of Cassini to retain conventional immunostaining patterns while also being able to measure gene and protein expression in a highly multiplexed, barcode-driven fashion.</p><p id="P9">Without conventional immunostaining, all three channels can be used to detect different features in each round. In a final experiment to demonstrate Cassini’s ease and throughput, we surveyed 30 mRNAs and 2 conjugated antibodies on a mouse brain hemisphere of ~40mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The full cycle time for this experiment was 48 minutes, with an imaging time of 7 minutes, achieving a detection rate of ~18 minutes per feature (Detailed workflow and protocol in supplementary material). The hippocampal regions were well delineated by <italic>Prox1</italic> (labeling the dentate gyrus), <italic>Prdm8</italic> (marking the CA2 and CA3 fields), <italic>Amigo2</italic> (a CA2-specific marker) and <italic>Wfs1</italic> (specifically expressed in CA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, 11 neuronal marker genes for cortical layers were accurately stratified in the Cassini data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). The neuronal markers showed strong enrichment around the hippocampus and the cortical layers, but were almost absent from white matter (<italic>Mbp</italic>). Moreover, markers of inhibitory neurons (<italic>Gad2, Cnr1</italic> and <italic>Sst</italic>) clustered together, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The two conjugated antibodies we included in this run, NeuN and GFAP, demonstrated robust colocalization with their corresponding mRNA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) as well as a strong correlation, especially with NeuN/<italic>Rbfox3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 11</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate how highly multiplexed imaging of gene and protein expression, across a wide tissue area (40mm<sup>2</sup>), can be performed in rapid, routine experiment.</p><p id="P10">We believe that for an open-source method to be truly effective, it must not only be easy to implement but also provide a clear protocol and easy design. All non-enzymatic reagents can be prepared in a few minutes from standard lab chemicals (formamide, SSC, Dextran sulfate), while enzymatic reactions utilize ready-to-use commercial kits. In addition to a clear protocol (Detailed workflow and protocol in supplementary material) we provide an online platform for designing probes (cassini.me) for most human and mouse genes.</p><p id="P11">In summary, we introduce a novel method, Cassini, for the efficient, cost-effective surveying of proteomic and genomic features within intact tissue. Our approach performs multiplexing via sequential detection, enabling a simple setup and achieving a rate 50 times faster than state-of-the-art commercial techniques (HCR), without compromising sensitivity. Moreover, the total cost for detecting 30 genes and 2 conjugated antibodies, including all necessary probes, antibodies, reagents for Padlock amplification, and multiple rounds of fluorescent detection, was under $50 for this sample with manual buffer exchange and under $100 with automated buffer exchange (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref>). The ability of Cassini to rapidly survey dozens of transcript and protein types has broad applications in molecular biology, including cell type abundance profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, monitoring infection across tissue, characterizing tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and <italic>in situ</italic> analysis of perturbation assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. At this level of throughput, ease, cost-efficiency and versatility, Cassini has the potential to become a routine tool for investigating tissue molecular organization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animal handling</title><p id="P12">All procedures involving animals at the Broad Institute were conducted in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under protocol number 0120-09-16.

The probe solution contains 10nM of each probe 2X SSC, 20% formamide and 0.8 U/ μl of RNAse inhibitor (Lucigen #30281-1-LU) in ultra pure water. The samples were incubated with 30 μl of probe solution overnight at 37°C. After probe incubation, samples are washed 3 times with 80 μl of Wash20 at 37°C for 15 minutes each, followed by one wash with 80 μl of PBS for 15 minutes at 37°C, followed by one wash with 80 μl of 1X splintR ligase buffer (NEB M0375L) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The ligase solution was prepared on ice, with 1x splintR ligase buffer (NEB M0375L), 1.25U/ μl of ligase (NEB M0375L) and 0.8 U/ μl of RNAse inhibitor (Lucigen #30281-1-LU). The samples were incubated with 50 μl of ligase solution and incubate 6h to overnight at 37°C The ligation was stopped with a wash of 80 μl of 2X SSC buffer incubated for 30 min at RT. The RCA primer hybridization mix was prepared by diluting in Wash-20 the RCA primer to a final concentration of 500nM supplemented with 0.4 U/ μl of RNAse inhibitor (Lucigen #30281-1-LU). The samples were incubated with 50 μl of RCA primer for 2hr at 37°C). The sample was washed with 80 μl of Wash-20 incubated for 30min at 37°C, followed by a wash of 80 μl of PBS incubated for 15min at 37°C, followed by 80 μl 1X Phi-29 buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific EP0094) incubated for 15min at room temperature. The RCA mix was prepared on ice, with 1X Phi-29 buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific EP0094) + 250μM of dNTP (NEB N0447L) + 0.8U/ μl of Phi29 (Thermo Fisher Scientific EP0094) + 0.8 U/ μl of RNAse inhibitor (Lucigen #30281-2-LU). The samples were incubated with 50 μl of RCA mix and incubate overnight at 30°C. After the RCA amplification, RCA mix was replaced with 80 μl of PBS. From this point the samples is stable for at least 3 months at 4 °C (probably more but we did not test it).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Automated buffer exchange</title><p id="P23">The buffer exchange was performed using a FCS2 flow cell (Bioptechs), a pair of 12-inlets rotary valves (Advanced Microfluidic) and a peristaltic pump (Kamoer KCM-ODM-B253). The rotary valves and the peristaltic pumps were controlled by a Raspberry Pi using a script written in Python provided by the rotary valve manufacturer (AMF) and custom made for the pump control. The two rotary valves are connected in series. The first valve receives the probe mixes (one mix per cycle), and its outlet is connected to the inlet of the second rotary valve. Additionally, the inlets of the second rotary valve are connected to the stripping buffer, tissue blocking + DAPI buffer, and wash-20. The outlet of the second rotary valves is connected to the flow cell. The peristaltic pump is placed downstream of the flow cell and controls the flow rate at 0.3 ml/min for the probe mix buffer and 1 ml/min for the other buffers. The probe mix contains 300nM of each probe diluted in Wash-20; the stripping buffer contains 80% of formamide (Millipore F7503-4L) + 0.5X SSC (Thomas Scientific C000A15) diluted in distilled water; the tissue blocking + DAPI buffer contains 0.5% of High molecular weight (MW &gt; 500,000) dextran sulfate (Sigma S4031) + 1:4000 DAPI (Thermo Fisher # 62248) diluted in Wash-20. The cycle was run as follow. Stripping phase: flow 2.5ml of stripping buffer incubate for 30 seconds, flow 1ml of stripping buffer incubate for 30sec and flow 2.5ml of stripping buffer incubate for 5 minutes. Tissue blocking and Dapi phase: flow 2.5ml of tissue blocking + DAPI buffer incubate for 30 seconds and flow 2.5ml of tissue blocking + DAPI buffer incubate for 3 minutes. The pre-incubation phase: flow 2.5ml of Wash-20 incubate for 30 seconds and flow 2.5ml of Wash-20 and incubate for 2 minutes. Probe incubation phase: Flow 0.8ml of probe mix and incubate for 25 minutes. Probe wash phase: Flow 2ml of Wash-20 incubate 1 minute, repeat 5 times flow 1ml of Wash-20 incubate 1minute and flow 3ml of Wash-20 incubate 30 second.

We used 405n, 488 nm, 561 nm and 638 nm laser lines paired with 445/46, 521/38, 594/43, 684/47 emission filters, respectively. All images were done using a 20x objective lens. Microscope control, acquisition, and stitching were performed using the Fusion interface.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Probe design and ordering</title><p id="P26">The probes were designed from the exon sequences of the genes using the GRCm39 mouse genome assembly. The gene sequences were scanned with a sliding window of 32 nucleotides to find a sequence that match the following criteria: the Tm of each arm (16nt) is &gt;50°C and the difference of Tm between 5’ and 3’ arms is &lt;9°C. The GC range of the 32nt binding sequence (5’ + 3’ arms) is between 45% and 65% and the probe junction with GC, GG or CG were excluded. The 5’ to 3’ sequence of the probe is composed of the 5’ arm, RCA primer binding sequence, detection probe binding sequence, spacer and 3’ arm. We provide an online platform, cassini.me, for designing exonic or intronic probes for almost all human and mouse genes.</p><p id="P27">The RNA probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table S1</xref>) were ordered as an oPool from IDT with a 5’phosphate group. The probe targeting the oligos on the conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table S3</xref>) were ordered as individual oligos from IDT with a 5’phosphate group. The RCA primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table S3</xref>) were ordered from IDT, with two phosphorothioate bounds on the 3’ to prevent exonuclease activity from Phi29. The fluorescent probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table S2</xref>) were ordered from Gene Link. The fluorophore was placed on the 5’ of the probe sequence and in most fluorescent probes two adjacent thymines were added between the fluorophore and the binding sequence to prevent any nucleobase-specific quenching. Fluorescent probes were purified by the manufacturer using reverse cartridge.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Image and data processing</title><p id="P28">Alignment: the set of microscopy images from multiple rounds of hybridization and stripping were aligned on the Dapi channel of round 0 using a Python script.

(b) Effect of Cassini on conventional immunostaining and signal retention after to 2<sup>nd</sup> fixation. Microscope images display immunostaining prior to Cassini processing, with the white outlines indicating the regions selected for signal retention quantification shown in bar charts below (c) Buffer optimization for conjugated antibodies. The microscope images show a zoom area of the CA1 hippocampal field. The white lines indicate the areas measured for signal intensity, which are plotted on the left. All conjugated immunostaining utilized the same lookup table (LUT) settings, while the conventional immunostaining images were enhanced to match the intensity levels of the conjugated staining. (d) Comparison of conventional and oligo conjugated immunostaining after Cassini run. The DAPI signal is shown in blue in both conjugated and regular antibody images, but not in the merged image to facilitate visualization. (e) Violin plot of foci area of HCR and Cassini. (f) Comparison of foci density between Cassini and HCR. Density is the average number of foci around each dot in a 10 μm radius. At the top left is a schematic of the density calculation, and at the bottom left are the different genes and areas that were considered. (g) Cassini/HCR ratios along the Amigo 2 gradient. The sliding window was 10% of the total length with an increment of 2%. The blue line indicates the average of all possible Cassini/HCR ratios (points) from triplicates experiments calculated for each time window. Note: Cassini data in panels (e), (f), and (g) do not involve immunostaining and are limited to RNA detection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202293-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Multiplexed detection of 30 RNAs and 2 conjugated antibodies.</title><p>(a) All 30 RNA types are displayed in a mouse brain hemisphere, with rectangles indicating zoomed-in areas shown in (c) and (d).
