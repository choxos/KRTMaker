However, most of these ligands are unable to target individual G4s or iMs in the genome, severely limiting their scope. Herein, we describe a new Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures (ATENA) that relies on the chemical conjugation of established G4 and iM ligands to a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9), enabling their individual targeting in living cells. ATENA demonstrated that the selective targeting of the G4 present in the oncogene <italic>c-MYC</italic> leads to the suppression of transcripts regulated exclusively by one of its promoters (P1). Conversely, targeting the <italic>c-MYC</italic> iMs on the opposite strand leads to the selective increase of P1-driven transcripts. ATENA revealed that G4-mediated transcriptional responses are highly ligand-specific, with different ligands eliciting markedly different effects at the same G4-site. We further demonstrated that the basal expression levels of the gene targeted can be used to predict the transcriptional impact associated with G4-stabilization. Our study provides an innovative platform to investigate G4- and iM-biology with high precision and unveils the therapeutic relevance of individual DNA structures with unprecedented selectivity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">G-quadruplex (G4) structures can promptly form within single-stranded DNA sequences rich in guanines by generating stacks of G-quartets held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonding that are further stabilized by coordination of potassium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The ability of G-rich sequences to form G4s under physiological conditions has been known for decades <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Yet, the biological relevance of these structures has been heavily disputed until recently. Over the past decade, the development of orthogonal approaches to detect and map G4s has provided robust evidence to support their formation in living cells. These include immuno-fluorescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, live-cell imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and genome-wide mapping strategies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">While G4-formation in cells has been extensively validated, its active contribution in regulating biological processes is yet to be fully demonstrated. Given the high enrichment of G4s at gene promoters measured experimentally <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it has long been speculated that these structures may play an essential role in regulating gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, many G4-selective ligands have been developed to date, revealing that targeting G4s within gene promoters is generally associated with transcriptional suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Since key oncogenes like <italic>c-MYC, KRAS</italic>, and <italic>BCL-2</italic> bear a G4 in their promoter, applying G4 ligands for cancer intervention has been extensively investigated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the human genome displays more than 700,000 experimentally detected G4-structures <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and around ~10,000 G4s detected in chromatin using genomics strategies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, making single-G4 targeting by small molecules extremely challenging. Indeed, most ligands recognize G4s by establishing π-π end-stacking with G-tetrads, a promiscuous interaction that hampers these molecules from displaying any significant inter-G4 selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. For example, evidence supports that the transcriptional suppression of <italic>c-MYC</italic> observed upon treatment with certain G4-ligands is an indirect consequence of global G4 stabilization rather than a specific response regulated exclusively by the G4 in the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Additionally, there are experimental discrepancies between what could be the endogenous biological function of G4s and what is instead observed when ligands bind these structures. A series of independent genomic studies consistently indicated that G4-formation is strongly associated with active gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, contrasting the transcriptional repression mostly observed upon G4-ligand treatment. Similarly, recent studies have leveraged gene-editing techniques to demonstrate how the selective deletion of the G-rich sequence in the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter responsible for the G4-structure formation on this promoter (MYC-G4) is associated with loss of transcriptional activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, further pointing to an active role of G4s in stimulating transcription. To justify the discrepancies between endogenous G4-function versus the responses observed by G4-targeting with small-molecules, it has been postulated that ligand binding can prevent key transcriptional factors from recognizing G4s, leading to transcriptional repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, it remains challenging to discern whether transcriptional suppression at specific genes is caused by protein displacement at a given G4 site or is a response triggered by global G4-stabilization, as reported for <italic>c-MYC</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. It is also often supposed that structurally different G4-ligands should elicit similar responses when targeting the same G4s, with the assumption that G4 binding proteins respond identically to a ligand-bound G4 irrespective of the ligand used. Overall, this highlights the urgent need for tools that can provide inter-G4 selectivity to widely used G4 ligands to fully underpin G4-biology and harness the therapeutic potential of these DNA secondary structures.</p><p id="P5">Similarly, i-motifs (iMs) structures have been recently mapped through the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, visualized in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and have been heavily linked with transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although several ligands have been shown to bind the i-motif-forming sequences in <italic>c-MYC</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the exact biological responses elicited by targeting iMs still remain elusive, owing to their lack of inter-iMs selectivity that confounds phenotypes arising from global versus site-specific iM targeting.</p><p id="P6">Therefore, it is evident that the absence of inter-G4 or inter-iMs selectivity displayed by most of the available ligands strongly hampers their use as therapeutic agents and their application as reliable tools to investigate the biology of these DNA structures. Hence, the development of ligands displaying preferential binding toward a specific G4 or iM structure (i.e., <italic>c-MYC</italic>) has represented a longstanding quest in this area of research. To this end, Schneekloth and co-workers recently designed a small-molecule ligand (DC-34) that displays preferential binding to the G4 in the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Treatment of multiple myeloma cell lines with DC-34 revealed suppression of <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcription with minimal perturbation of other G4-bearing oncogenes, such as <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BCL-2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Similarly, our group and others have shown that short peptides and oligonucleotides can also display binding selectivity towards specific G4s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, these remain isolated examples that require ligand optimization to achieve binding selectivity against any given DNA structure of interest and are not suitable for high-throughput screening of G4 or i-motif function at scale. Furthermore, the highly diverse chemical and structural nature of ligands targeting G4s and iMs might represent an additional confounding factor. For example, different G4-ligands might elicit different biological responses when binding to the same G4s, leading to experimental observations that are dependent on the type of ligand used, rather than reflecting the endogenous biological function of the targeted G4.</p><p id="P7">To overcome these limitations, we have developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures), a CRISPR-Cas9-based platform that enables selective localization of different G4 or iM ligands in the proximity of a given DNA structure of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). To achieve this, we have exploited HaloTag technologies to selectively install modified G4 or iM binding ligands onto Cas9 protein in living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. More specifically, we have designed a small library of established G4-ligands (pyridostatin (PDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and PhenDC3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>) functionalized with chloroalkane side chains that ensure incorporation into a nuclease-inactive Cas9 protein fused to a HaloTag (dCas9-Halo) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, we decorated one of the iM selective peptides (Pep-RVS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, recently developed by the Waller’s group, with a chloroalkane side chain to explore selective iM targeting with ATENA. The synthesized analogs of PDS, PhenDC3, and Pep-RVS contain different polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-linkers (n = 0, 2, 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1 c,d</xref>), with the PEG chain serving to tether the DNA-binding scaffold to the HaloTag-binding chloroalkane. By fine-tuning the PEG linker length, we optimized the spacing between the DNA-binding moiety and the dCas9-Halo fusion to attain ideal G4 engagement with ATENA, using a dedicated FRET-based assay. We leveraged this knowledge to deploy ATENA in cells and achieve selective targeting of either the G4 or the iM present in the promoter of the proto-oncogene <italic>c-MYC</italic>. ATENA-mediated G4-targeting resulted in the reduction of <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcripts generated exclusively by one of the four promoters regulating <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression (P1), irrespective of the ligand used, which is in agreement with recent literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, ATENA has shown, for the first time, that selective MYC-G4 targeting does not result in a net reduction of <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression, as increased transcription from the alternative P2 promoter counterbalances the P1-specific downregulation induced by G4 engagement. The P1-dependent downregulation upon G4-targeting was also confirmed by treatment with the MYC-G4 selective ligand DC-34, further validating the ability of ATENA to target individual G4s. Importantly, we have also observed that guiding G4-ligands in the proximity of the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter TATA-box can lead to G4-independent transcriptional suppression. This strongly suggests that previous observations obtained with dCas9 decorated with multiple G4-ligands are likely reflecting occupancy of transcriptional regulatory regions rather than genuine G4-binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Upon employing ATENA to target selectively the iM present in the promoter of <italic>c-MYC</italic>, using a HaloTag-compatible version of Pep-RVS, we have also observed P1-specific transcriptional perturbation. An increase in P1-expression was associated with iM targeting, opposing the transcriptional inhibition observed by G4 stabilisation, in line with other systems which indicate that iM-binding results in induction of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and that iMs and G4 shape opposing effects in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">While downregulation of P1-mediated <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression was observed with two distinct ligands, PDS and PhenDC3, ATENA also revealed that other G4s could provide different transcriptional outcomes when targeted by the same compounds. This suggested that the biological response elicited by G4 stabilization might reflect more the structural nature of the G4-ligand complex rather than providing direct insights into the endogenous function of G4s, underscoring the importance of the choice of ligand used in the different reports aimed at unveiling G4-biology. Finally, we showcased the ability of ATENA to infer the biological relevance of cell line-specific G4s, revealing a strong dependence of the transcriptional perturbation attained upon ligand treatment on the expression level of the gene targeted.</p><p id="P10">Altogether, our study provides robust evidence supporting ligand and transcriptional-dependent responses to both G4s and iM targeting. ATENA functions as a modular platform to target individual DNA secondary structures in living cells, enabling a precise study of G4- and iM-biology. We anticipate that ATENA will offer unprecedented potential for screening cell and ligand-specific responses to DNA secondary structure targeting in a high-throughput manner, which can be further translated for therapeutic design and development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Chemical labelling of CRISPR-Cas9 proteins with G4 ligands</title><p id="P11">Catalytically inactive CRISPR-Cas9 (dCas9) fused to functional proteins has been widely used in biology to attain site-selective perturbation of gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This strategy takes advantage of the selectivity provided by dCas9 bound to a short-guiding RNA (sgRNA) in recognizing a specific genomic site by base-pairing, which can be used to recruit an effector protein (i.e., a transcription factor or an epigenetic enzyme) at the targeted site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. A similar strategy has been recently devised to decorate dCas9 with G4-ligands using non-covalent biotin-streptavidin recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Irreversible chemical functionalization of dCas9 proteins has been previously achieved using commercially available chloroalkane-modified fluorophores to label a dCas9-Halo fusion protein in living cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that generating modified G4-ligands functionalized with chloroalkane moieties could have been exploited to decorate with higher control and irreversible covalent chemistry Cas9 proteins with G4 ligands under physiological conditions. To achieve this, we designed analogues of the widely established G4 ligands PDS based on the previously described PyPDS scaffold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Unlike PDS, PyPDS presents a single primary amine within its structure, which can be selectively functionalized with chloroalkane sidechains by peptide coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. After successful synthesis of PyPDS following previously established methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, we functionalized the primary amine of the molecule with chloroalkane side chains of different lengths, enabling systematic investigation of the ideal distance between the G4-binding scaffold PyPDS and the HaloTag protein to achieve optimal G4-engagement. Specifically, we have used linkers containing different PEG repeats (n = 0, 2, 4) to vary the distance between PyPDS and the chloroalkane (Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI-1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To avoid limiting the use of ATENA to a single G4-ligand, we also functionalized with chloroalkane moieties another widely characterized G4 ligand called PhenDC3 using the same chemical strategy (Cl-PhenDC3<sub>n</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Unlike PDS, PhenDC3 has a cationic side chain and is structurally bulkier, displaying a phenanthroline core wider than the pyridine one present in the PDS scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). While PDS and PhenDC3 have been extensively validated as selective G4-ligands, the structural differences between these two ligands might lead to distinct biological responses when targeting G4s in cells, which cannot be assessed with current methods. Therefore, we decided to systematically compare these two ligands with ATENA when recruited to a single-G4 site. To achieve this, we have synthesized a previously reported PhenDC3 analogue displaying an exocyclic primary amine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which can be functionalized by peptide coupling using the same synthetic strategy described for PyPDS to afford chloroalkane-modified PhenDC3 analogs that are compatible with HaloTag conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI-1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> validation of covalent conjugation of G4-ligands to dCas9-Halo</title><p id="P13">With both PyPDS and PhenDC3 analogues in hand, we initially assessed whether functionalization with the chloroalkane side chains could affect the G4-binding properties of these molecules. To test this, we have subjected all the ligands to FRET or Circular Dichroism (CD) melting to evaluate their ability to stabilize G4-structures after chloroalkane functionalization. All analogues tested displayed good G4-stabilization, providing an increase in melting temperature (ΔT<sub>m</sub> &gt;10 °C at 4 μM) against four distinct G4 structures tested (c-MYC, hTelo, BCL-2 and c-KIT2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), with ΔT<sub>m</sub> values comparable to the unfunctionalized ligands. This suggested that the addition of the chloroalkane side chains had a negligible effect on the G4-stabilization properties of both PhenDC3 and PyPDS.</p><p id="P14">Having confirmed that both chloroalkane-functionalized PyPDS and PhenDC3 analogues retained good G4-binding recognition properties, we next investigated if these molecules could be covalently engaged to dCas9-Halo and performed a competition assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we expressed and purified the dCas9-Halo protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">methods</xref>) and incubated it for 45 minutes with increasing concentrations of Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub> and Cl-PhenDC3<sub>n</sub>. This was followed by incubation with an excess (5 μM) of the commercially available HaloTag<sup>®</sup>TAMRA (Cl-TAMRA) ligand to label dCas9-Halo with the TAMRA fluorophore. Since labeling of HaloTag is a covalent irreversible process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we reasoned that initial exposure of the dCas9-Halo protein to the chloroalkane functionalized G4-ligands would prevent subsequent incorporation of the fluorescent Cl-TAMRA, leading to a dose-dependent reduction of TAMRA incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Indeed, all tested analogues induced a robust dose-dependent decrease of the dCas9-Halo TAMRA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), indicating high efficiency in labeling dCas9-Halo irrespectively of the G4-ligand (i.e., Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub> or Cl-PhenDC3<underline><sub>n</sub></underline>) or the PEG-linker used to connect the chloroalkane to the G4-binding scaffold. To quantify labeling efficiency, we measured fluorescence intensity for each line of the gel and generated dose–response curves to extract the concentration of ligand required to attain 50% labeling of the dCas9-Halo <italic>in vitro</italic> (IV-CP<sub>50</sub>).

To achieve this, we investigated the ideal distance between the dCas9 binding site and the targeted G4 to achieve optimal engagement of the G4 ligands with the targeted structure by systematically varying both the short guiding RNA (sgRNA) sequences used and the PEG-linker connecting the Halo reactive moiety (chloroalkane) to the G4-binding scaffold tested. To quantify G4-engagement, we designed a dually fluorescent-labelled DNA template containing an established G4-forming sequence (c-KIT2-G4) at its 3’ end to monitor G4-stabilization through FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We then designed two sgRNAs to orient the dCas9-Halo complex towards the G4 structure sitting at either 18 (NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-18</sub>) or 42 (NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-42</sub>) base pairs from the targeted G4 and whose Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAM) are located on the non-template strand bearing the G4 (NT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). This is based on previous structural studies indicating that the C-terminal domain of the Cas9 protein, where the Halo protein is situated, will point towards the 3’ end of the PAM sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, we have used a standard non-targeting RNA control (NTC) to rule out any potential unspecific binding that is not strictly mediated by sgRNA-driven proximity. We then used Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub> molecules as prototype G4-ligand to assess the extent of G4 targeting by ATENA under different conditions, by measuring changes in FRET when targeting the oligo construct with the dCas9-Halo complex in the presence or the absence of Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub>. We failed to detect any significant changes (p&gt;0.05) in the FRET signal for both sgRNAs tested (NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-18</sub> vs NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-42</sub>) when using Cl-PDS<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). Considering that Cl-PDS<sub>0</sub> can efficiently bind to dCas9-Halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, IV-CP<sub>50</sub> = 1.6 µM), the lack of G4-stabilization displayed by this molecule indicates that the linker connecting the PDS-scaffold to the dCas9-Halo is inadequately short for engaging with the G4-structure. Nevertheless, a trend showing higher changes in FRET efficiency when using sgRNAs closer to the G4 (NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-18</sub> vs NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-42</sub>) suggests that placing the dCas9 closer to the G4 facilitates ligand engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 1d</xref>). Indeed, when decorating dCas9-Halo with a PDS analogue with a longer PEG-linker (Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub>), a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in FRET-signal could be measured when using NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-18</sub> (ΔFRET = 0.42), which is indicative of G4-engagement. However, when using NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-42</sub> we failed to measure an increase in FRET signal, confirming that placing dCas9-PDS closer to the G4 provides better ligand engagement. To further investigate ideal conditions to obtain G4-targeting with ATENA, we also designed T-sgRNA<sub>FRET-21</sub> and T-sgRNA<sub>FRET-41</sub> that sit at 21 and 41 base pairs from the G4 but whose PAM is located on the template strand (T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>) to investigate the effect of the dCas9-Halo orientation on G4 targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g, h</xref>). Consistent with our observations indicating that closer placement of dCas9-Halo to the G4 is linked with better ligand engagement, we detected a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in FRET signal when using T-sgRNA<sub>FRET-21</sub> (ΔFRET = 0.33, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) that was abrogated when using T-sgRNA<sub>FRET-41</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, SI). This further indicated that optimal G4-targeting by ATENA is achieved by using sgRNAs closer to the G4 regardless of the orientation imposed by the sgRNAs used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1h</xref> and SI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). When further increasing the PEG-linker using Cl-PDS<sub>4</sub>, we failed to observe any significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in FRET efficiency with both NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-18</sub> and NT-sgRNA<sub>FRET-42</sub>, suggesting that using PEG-linkers that are excessively long is detrimental to G4-engagement, possibly due to high entropic penalty associated with ligand-recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Altogether, our study demonstrated that dCas9-driven G4-ligand engagement is both PEG-linker and sgRNA dependent, with optimal G4-engagement achieved when using a PEG2 linker and sgRNAs placing the dCas9-Halo complex as close as possible (depending on the PAM availability) to the targeted G4.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Chloroalkane-modified ligands can label dCas9-Halo efficiently in cells</title><p id="P16">Having optimized conditions to achieve G4-engagement <italic>in vitro</italic> with ATENA - using Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub> and c-KIT2 G4s as a model system - we next investigated whether ATENA can be used to stabilize individual G4 structures in living cells. The use of cell lines that constitutively express dCas9-Halo is essential to ensure consistent cellular levels of the protein across different experiments, avoiding bias introduced by the significantly variable levels of protein expression typically with transient transfection used in previous reports. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> To this end, we integrated dCas9-Halo into the genome of the breast cancer cell line (MCF7) using standard lentiviral integration approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">methods</xref>). We selected MCF7 cells in light of the highly diverse transcriptional response previously reported upon treatment with PDS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, which we wanted to investigate further with ATENA. Successful integration of dCas9-Halo was confirmed by PCR-based genotyping and Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Next, we evaluated the ability of the chloroalkane functionalized ligands to bind dCas9-Halo in cells. Using an established chloroalkane penetration assay (CAPA), we compared each ligand’s relative potency to label covalently dCas9-Halo under physiological conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. During CAPA, cells are initially exposed to increasing concentrations of the chloroalkane-modified G4-ligands, before incubation with a Halo-reactive Oregon Green fluorophore (Cl-OG), which reacts with any Halo-tag binding site that has been left unoccupied by the previous exposure to the chloroalkane G4-ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, i-ii</xref>). The efficiency of G4-ligand incorporation can be, therefore, measured as an inverse function of the Oregon Green fluorescence emission, as successful G4-ligand incorporation to Halo prevents subsequent fluorophore functionalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, iii-iv</xref>). To quantify this numerically, we calculated the half-maximal chloroalkane penetration value (CP<sub>50</sub>), which is the ligand concentration required to label 50% of the available dCas9–Halo molecules and can be used as a direct readout of target occupancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> (right), treatment of MCF7 cells expressing dCas9-Halo with both Cl-PDS<sub>0</sub> and Cl-PDS<sub>4</sub> revealed a modest dose-dependent reduction of Oregon Green emission, providing CP<sub>50</sub> values of 15.9 μM and 5.4 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>).

Given that the PEG2 linker also led to best G4-engagement <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), we decided to assess the compatibility with ATENA of a different G4-ligand (PhenDC3) bearing a PEG2 linker (Cl-PhenDC3<sub>2</sub>) through CAPA.

Many studies have linked the targeting of MYC-G4 with ligands to transcriptional suppression of <italic>c-MYC</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To assess the extent of transcriptional perturbation mediated exclusively by G4 stabilization, we designed a panel of sgRNAs to direct ATENA at MYC-G4.</p><p id="P18">Specifically, we designed sgRNAs targeting either the non-template strand (NT) bearing the G4-structure at its 3’ end or the opposite strand at its 5’ end (T), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>. Based on our biophysical investigation, we reasoned that placing sgRNAs close enough to the G4 would have ensured G4-stabilization by G4-ligands tethered to dCas9-Halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Considering PAM sequences available for dCas9-Halo binding at either G4 ends, we designed sgRNA<sub>MYC-19</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC-67</sub> that would place the protein complex on the T strand, respectively 19 and 67 base pairs away from the MYC-G4. Similarly, we generated sgRNA<sub>MYC+22</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC+58</sub>, targeting the MYC-G4 from its 5’ end at a distance of 22 and 58 base pairs on the NT strand, respectively. To further investigate the optimal distance to achieve G4 stabilization in a cellular context, which might differ from our simple biophysical model, we have also designed sgRNA<sub>MYC-89</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC-93</sub>, along with sgRNA<sub>MYC+75</sub>, sgRNA<sub>MYC+77,</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC+119</sub>, also targeting the MYC-G4 at its 3’ and 5’ end, respectively, but at a further distance from the targeted structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). After cloning sequences encoding the various sgRNAs into a vector for mammal expression (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">methods</xref>), we have transfected MCF7 cells stably expressing dCas9-Halo with individual sgRNAs, followed by treatment with either Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub> or mock (DMSO) for 48 hours. We then measured changes in <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression using RT-qPCR, normalizing the expression level against individual samples transfected with the respective sgRNAs and mock-exposed. This enabled us to consider any change in gene expression potentially triggered by the positioning of the dCas9-Halo complex on the targeted site and, therefore, control for any transcriptional perturbation imposed by dCas9 not functionalized with ligands.</p><p id="P19">Unexpectedly, we observed that sgRNAs placing ATENA within a ~50 bp window of the MYC-G4 on the T strand (sgRNA<sub>MYC-19</sub>, sgRNA<sub>MYC-67</sub>) in conjunction with Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub> treatment led to negligible effects on the global expression of <italic>c-MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), contrasting our biophysical predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Conversely when placing the complex on the NT strand with sgRNA<sub>MYC+22</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC+58</sub>, we observed a modest decrease of <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression to 0.8-fold the mock (~20% reduction), which could be indicative of G4-engagement of PDS mediated by ATENA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To investigate this further, we analyzed the transcriptional effects elicited by placing the ATENA further away from the MYC-G4 using sgRNA<sub>MYC+75</sub>, sgRNA<sub>MYC+77,</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC+119</sub>, which should lead to abrogation of G4-engagement in a distance-dependent fashion, as observed in our biophysical measurements.

By closer inspection of the promoter annotation, we noticed that sgRNA<sub>MYC+58</sub> to sgRNA<sub>MYC+119</sub> overlapped with the P1 promoter and TATA-box sequences. Since sgRNA<sub>MYC+75</sub> and sgRNA<sub>MYC</sub>+77 are complementary to the region identifying a TATA box, we reasoned that ATENA occupies the TATA-box region and hinders transcription initiation, resulting in the observed <italic>c-MYC</italic> suppression.

We then asked why the reduction in P1-driven expression observed with ATENA does not result in an overall decrease in <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcription. To achieve this, we also measured changes in transcription originating from the P2 promoter using promoter-specific qPCR primers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">methods</xref>).

Finally, when comparing PyPDS vs DC-34, we observed 24 shared DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). However, these DEGs failed to enrich for any known pathways or MYC-related functions, indicating that even structurally distinct G4 ligands with overlapping target preferences can elicit unique transcriptional responses, likely due to differences in binding affinity, cellular uptake, and selectivity.</p><p id="P36">Altogether, these analyses indicated that ATENA, DC-34, and PyPDS can elicit distinct transcriptional responses, with negligible overlap and no shared enrichment for <italic>c-MYC</italic>-related genes. This reinforces the conclusion that ATENA - by spatially confining ligand activity to a single G4 at the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter - induces highly selective gene expression changes, contrasting with the broader, less discriminating effects of freely diffusing G4-ligands. Additionally, our mRNA-Seq analysis further confirmed that MYC-G4 targeting is not associated with significant <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation in MCF7 cells, and caution is needed when designing MYC-based therapeutics based on G4-targeting.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Targeting of the <italic>c-MYC</italic> i-motif with ATENA is associated with transcriptional stimulation</title><p id="P37">After validating the suitability of ATENA for the selective targeting of individual G4-structures in the genome - exemplified by the MYC-G4 - we next explored whether this platform could be adapted to interrogate other DNA secondary structures, such as i-motifs (iMs). Similarly to G4s, iMs are stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. However, they form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome, typically complementary to G-rich G4-forming sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. The formation of iMs in cells has been recently validated in living cells by both immunofluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and genome-wide mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Like G4s, iMs have been implicated in transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, although their mechanistic roles remain less well characterized compared to G4s.</p><p id="P38">To assess the potential of individual iMs to modulate gene expression, we decided to use ATENA in combination with selective iM ligands. Conveniently, the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter also bears an iM structure complementary to the G-rich sequence forming the MYC-G4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, which has been reported to modulate <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression when targeted with selective iM ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that the same sgRNAs optimized for selective targeting of MYC-G4 could be repurposed to localize ATENA to the MYC-iM, enabling selective iM targeting when decorated with an appropriate ligand. To this end, we utilized a recently developed class of short peptides from the Waller group, which show high affinity and specificity for iMs over G4s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Among those, we selected the RVS peptide (pep-RVS) for synthetic ease and potential amenability for modification. To enable compatibility with ATENA, we chemically modified pep-RVS with chloroalkene side chains to ensure covalent attachment onto the Halo-Tag (SI-2 and SI-7), generating Cl-pep-RVS<sub>n</sub> analogs with different PEG-linkers (n). We first confirmed that functionalization with chloroalkene did not affect the ability of pep-RVS to bind iMs <italic>via</italic> UV titrations, confirming that it bound the c-MYC i-motif structure with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.35 ± 0.12 µM compared to &gt;33 µM for G4 (Fig. SI-18). We next assessed the ability of Cl-pep-RVS<sub>n</sub> analogs to covalently bind to the dCas9-Halo in living cells using CAPA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>, all Cl-pep-RVS<sub>n</sub> analogs displayed good cellular permeability and effectively labelled dCas9-Halo at low µM concentrations. However, Cl-pep-RVS<sub>4</sub> performed best in CAPA, providing a CP<sub>50</sub> value of 2.3 µM, and was selected for further application in ATENA.</p><p id="P39">To evaluate whether targeting the MYC-iM affects <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcription, we employed ATENA with sgRNA<sub>MYC-19</sub> and treated the cells with Cl-pep-RVS<sub>4</sub> for 48h, using the same conditions previously optimized for G4 targeting. Notably, ATENA-mediated iM-targeting led to a significant increase of P1-driven (~2-fold increase) <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), in contrast to the transcriptional repression observed upon MYC-G4 targeting. Interestingly, this P1-mediated upregulation was accompanied by a decrease in P2-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), resulting in minimal net changes in global <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression - mirroring the outcome observed when targeting the G4 motif.</p><p id="P40">Overall, these results underscore the modularity of ATENA in targeting distinct DNA secondary structures within the same genomic locus simply by varying the conjugated ligand. By exploiting the high iM selectivity of pep-RVS, we show that selective iM targeting is associated with P1-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>c-MYC -</italic> a functional effect opposite to that seen with G4 engagement. This highlights the capacity of ATENA to disentangle the complex regulatory roles of overlapping secondary structures in gene promoters.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>PDS can act as a molecular glue of specific G4-protein interactions</title><p id="P41">After establishing the reliability of ATENA to accurately measure biological responses mediated by individual DNA secondary structures, using <italic>c-MYC</italic> as a case study, we next questioned if this platform could be expanded to study transcriptional responses that are uniquely associated with specific ligands. For instance, previous reports indicated that PDS treatment of MCF7 cells led to significant upregulation, rather than repression, of the long non-coding RNA <italic>PVT1</italic>-an observation we confirmed also for PyPDS by RT-qPCR and mRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 3a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to leverage ATENA to determine if PDS-mediated <italic>PVT1</italic> upregulation was a direct response to the specific stabilization of the G4 in its promoter or rather an indirect effect caused by global G4 stabilization. Previous CUT&amp;Tag experiments performed in MCF7 cells identified a clear G4-peak in the <italic>PVT1</italic> promoter, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> which we have used to design sgRNAs for ATENA-based targeting of the PVT1-G4. Considering available PAM sequences, we designed two sgRNAs targeting the PVT1-G4 at either 20 base pairs from its 5’ end (sgRNA<sub>PVT1-20</sub>) or 33 base pairs from its 3’ end (sgRNA<sub>PVT1+33</sub>) and that display no overlap with any annotated regulatory site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Upon transfection with either sgRNA<sub>PVT1-20</sub> or sgRNA<sub>PVT1+33</sub> and treatment with Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub>, we observed a boosted <italic>PVT1</italic> expression of ~4-fold, consistent with observations reported using free PDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). G4-ligands typically compete with regulatory proteins for G4-binding, which leads to transcriptional suppression, as we recapitulated measuring BG4 occupancy upon MYC-G4 targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Therefore, we questioned whether PDS could instead act as a molecular glue when binding to the PVT1-G4, leading to enhanced protein binding to the PVT1-G4 and, thus, justifying the observed transcriptional increase upon PDS treatment. We performed BG4 CUT&amp;Tag qPCR on PVT1-G4 target by ATENA and in conjunction with Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub> and observed a rise in BG4 occupancy at <italic>PVT1</italic> of ~2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This contrasts the transcriptional response elicited by the same ligand when targeting a different G4 (MYC-G4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and points to the role of PyPDS as a molecular glue for protein-G4 interactions within the PVT1-G4. Moreover, this observation suggests that the previously described increase in <italic>PVT1</italic> expression elicited by PyPDS treatment in MCF7 cells reflects the genuine response of the ligand targeting the PVT1-G4 and cannot be ascribed to a secondary response associated with global G4-targeting.</p><p id="P42">We next asked whether the increase in <italic>PVT1</italic> expression measured with PyPDS was limited to this molecule or if a more general response could be observed with any G4-ligand. MCF7 treatment with free PhenDC3 led to the suppression rather than the enhancement of <italic>PVT1</italic> expression, suggesting that different G4-ligands might elicit different responses when targeting an identical G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P43">To further investigate this, we targeted selectively the PVT1-G4 using ATENA in conjunction with Cl-PhenDC3<sub>2</sub> and sgRNA<sub>PVT1-20</sub> or sgRNA<sub>PVT1+33</sub>. Under these conditions, we observed a suppression of <italic>PVT1</italic> transcription, 64% and 34%, respectively, (expression level of the sample was 0.36-fold and 0.66-fold the mock respectively), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), which is consistent with free PhenDC3 treatment and opposite to what was observed with PyPDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). This suggested that G4-ligands can elicit a different response when bound to the same G4, possibly reflecting binding modalities that can either increase or prevent protein accessibility, which can be indirectly measured by BG4 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). This is an essential factor to consider when using different G4-ligands to infer the biology associated with these secondary structures, as it is often assumed that G4 ligands will all behave the same.</p><p id="P44">To further investigate these ligand-specific observations, we have also synthesized a chloroalkene analog of a third widely used G4-ligand: Pyrido Dicarboxamide (PDC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. We functionalized the PDC scaffold with a PEG2 chloroalkane side chain (Cl-PDC<sub>2</sub>) to mimic the PyPDS and PhenDC3 analogues used in ATENA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, SI-1). After validating the labelling efficiency of Cl-PDC<sub>2</sub> through CAPA (Fig. SI-5), we used it in conjunction with sgRNA<sub>-20</sub> to target the <italic>PVT1</italic> promoter and investigate associated transcriptional responses. Similarly, to what was observed with PhenDC3, PDC lowered <italic>PVT1</italic> expression (0.27-fold), leading to a 73% reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), suggesting that PDC interacts with the PVT1-G4 in a manner reminiscent of PhenDC3 and causes protein displacement from the G4. Structurally, the PDC scaffold is indeed similar to PhenDC3, displaying methylated nitrogens on the quinolines that are facing opposite orientation compared to PDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Moreover, both PhenDC3 and PDC lack the amino-side chains present in PyPDS, further highlighting the structural similarity between these two scaffolds, which might recapitulate the similar response observed. Collectively, our results indicated that the transcriptional responses elicited by ligands at individual G4s depend heavily on the structural nature of the ligand and on their binding modality, which might lead to protein displacement at the G4-site or might act as a molecular glue enhancing G4-protein interactions. This strongly suggests that transcriptional changes observed upon G4-ligand treatment should be interpreted as ligand-specific outcomes, reflecting the response to a specific ligand at a specific G4 structure rather than the endogenous function of the DNA structure.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Targeting cell-specific G4s with ATENA reveals transcription-dependent response to ligands</title><p id="P45">CUT&amp;Tag and other chromatin-compatible G4-mapping methods, such as BG4-ChIP and Chem-Map, have shown that genomic G4 distribution is cell-specific and predominantly located at promoters of highly expressed genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Therefore, we decided to investigate biological responses attained when directing a ligand towards previously unexplored MCF7-specific G4s. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the biological relevance of individual G4s and their response to ligand binding correlate with the expression levels of the associated genes. We leveraged the existing dataset on G4-distribution in MCF7 cells previously obtained using CUT&amp;Tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This dataset identified a G4-peak in the promoter of the highly expressed <italic>HMGN1</italic> gene - encoding for a non-histone chromosomal protein able to interact with nucleosomes and regulate chromatin structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> - as unique to MCF7 cells compared to other cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We designed sgRNA<sub>HMGN1-22</sub> and sgRNA <sub>HMGN1+34</sub> to target the HMGN1-G4 at 22 and 34 base pairs, respectively, at its 3’ and 5’ ends, ensuring no overlap with known functional regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). After transfecting MCF7 cells expressing dCas9-Halo with sgRNA <sub>HMGN1-22</sub> and sgRNA <sub>HMGN1+34</sub>, we incubated them with Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub> for 48 hours, as per the optimized ATENA protocol. Under these conditions, we measured a striking 99% reduction of <italic>HMGN1</italic> expression (0.01-fold) when targeting its G4 at the closest distance of 22 base pairs with sgRNA<sub>HMGN-22</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). <italic>HMGN1</italic> downregulation was partially attenuated when placing ATENA further away from the G4 with sgRNA<sub>HMGN+34</sub>, consistent with the distance-dependent ligand engagement observed for other G4s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To place the observed <italic>HMGN1</italic> down-regulation in a biologically meaningful context, we examined the role of this gene in breast-cancer dormancy - an epigenetic-driven, non-replicative state, from which cancer cells “awaken”, causing cancer relapse and resistance to therapy. In dormant MCF7 cells (estrogen-deprived), we inspected the epigenetic changes, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional profile at the <italic>HMGN1</italic> promoter. Dormant cells exhibited loss of the active histone mark H3K4me3, gain of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, and a corresponding drop in <italic>HMGN1</italic> expression; these epigenetic and transcriptomic changes were partially reversed upon cell-cycle re-entry - “awakening”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended data Fig. 6a, 6b</xref>). Remarkably, ATENA-mediated stabilization of the HMGN1-G4 reproduced this repressive transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Therefore, these convergent observations suggest that the HMGN1-G4 could act as an epigenetic switch: stabilizing the structure could indeed reinforce the <italic>HMGN1</italic> repressive state characteristic of dormancy and might be investigated as a strategy to maintain residual tumor cells in a dormant state.</p><p id="P46">Altogether, these findings indicated that targeting a cell-specific G4 located in the promoter of a highly transcribed gene can profoundly suppress gene expression, suggesting that maintaining G4-homeostasis at the promoter of highly transcribed genes is key to sustaining elevated expression levels and making these G4s particularly sensitive to ligands. Therefore, the varied transcriptional response observed upon G4-ligand treatment might reflect the relative relevance of different G4s in sustaining gene expression in the specific cell line studied.</p><p id="P47">To corroborate this hypothesis, we used ATENA to target a G4 present in the promoter region of a gene expressed at very low levels in MCF7 cells: <italic>IL17RA</italic>. Indeed, BG4 CUT&amp;Tag performed in MCF7 cells revealed a distinct G4-peak in the promoter region of <italic>IL17RA</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, a gene that is only marginally expressed in this cell line. <italic>IL17RA</italic> encodes for the Interleukin 17 Receptor A, a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by activated T-lymphocytes and, therefore, not essential for breast cancer cell homeostasis. We generated sgRNA<sub>IL17RA-20</sub> to target the IL17RA-G4 at 20 base pairs from its 5’ end and within a region that does not overlap with other regulatory elements of this promoter.</p><p id="P48">Following transfection with sgRNA<sub>IL17RA-20</sub> or sgRNA<sub>NTC</sub> and incubation with Cl-PDS<sub>2</sub>, we failed to detect any measurable changes in <italic>IL17RA</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This observation indicates that targeting a G4 in a promoter of a transcriptionally inactive gene is not associated with gene-expression perturbation, linking tightly the functional relevance of G4s to the transcriptional levels of the genes associated. Considering that both G4s in the <italic>HMGN1</italic> and <italic>IL17RA</italic> promoters are equally detected in MCF7 by CUT&amp;Tag <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and targeted with similar sgRNA designs (within PAM sequence constraints), our findings suggest that the transcriptional levels linked to the targeted G4 can be used to anticipate the extent of transcriptional perturbation associated with ligand treatment. This model also explains the relatively modest transcriptional changes observed by the selective targeting of <italic>c-MYC</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic> G4s, which are only moderately expressed in MCF7 cells. Increasing evidence in the literature suggests a model whereby G4s act as epigenetic factors to mark highly transcribed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Our data support this model by showcasing how the extent of gene suppression/activation elicited by G4 ligands is linked to basal transcriptional levels, underscoring the relevance of maintaining G4 homeostasis in preserving transcriptional profiles characteristic of specific cell lines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P49">There is now substantial evidence to support that G4 structures form within endogenous chromatin and that their formation is intimately linked to transcriptional activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. For instance, G4s have been detected in the promoter regions of key oncogenes in cancer cells, and recent studies have demonstrated that they constitute critical structural features required to sustain high transcriptional rate, such as in the case of c-<italic>MYC</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Over the past decades, the development of selective G4 ligands has revealed that stabilizing these structures often results in suppression of oncogene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Consequently, G4s have represented a therapeutically appealing target for decades. However, using G4-ligands for clinical application has not yet gained traction, reflecting two intrinsic limitations.</p><p id="P50">Firstly, the recognition mechanism leveraged by most G4 ligands relies on end-stacking interactions, which lack the selectivity to discriminate amongst different G4s - while effective at distinguishing G4s from duplex DNA. Given that the prevalence of G4s in the genome is highly cell-type specific, the lack of inter-G4 selectivity displayed by G4 ligands results in widespread transcriptional perturbations and inconsistent phenotypes across cell models used. Secondly, the binding affinity of individual ligands to different G4s varies broadly, making it difficult to pinpoint which G4s are functionally responsible for the biological responses elicited by any given ligand.</p><p id="P51">To address these limitations, tools enabling single-G4 targeting have been considered essential to unravel the fundamental biology regulated by specific G4s and to validate their therapeutic potential. Although several locus-directed and ligand-based strategies for single-G4 targeting have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, intrinsic limitations associated with these methods summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13</xref>, motivated us to develop ATENA- a CRISPR-guided platform in which catalytically inactive dCas9 is chemically functionalized with G4 ligands.</p><p id="P52">This system allows the positioning of a ligand in proximity to a specific G4 of interest using a short guiding RNA. We demonstrated that this approach enables transcriptional modulation attributable to G4 engagement at a single genomic locus We initially optimized conditions for single-G4 targeting <italic>in vitro</italic>, before applying ATENA in cells to investigate the transcriptional role of a G4-structure located in the promoter region of the proto-oncogene <italic>c-MYC</italic>. While independent studies have previously reported <italic>c-MYC</italic> suppression upon treatment with G4-ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, it remains unclear whether this effect is exclusively mediated by engagement of ligands with the MYC-G4 or from broader transcriptomic changes induced by global G4-stabilisation. Indeed, Hurley and co-workers – who initially proposed that <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation was exclusively attributed to the targeting of MYC-G4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> - challenged the previous proposed model suggesting that transcriptional suppression was more likely a response to global G4-stabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P53">Using ATENA, we observed that G4-mediated <italic>c-MYC</italic> suppression in MCF7 cells is minimal and limited to P1-controlled transcription. These findings are not only in line with what has been shown by recent genomic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> but were also fully recapitulated when using the MYC-G4 selective small molecule DC-34 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This strongly indicates that the biological response obtained by selective MYC-G4 targeting is limited to P1-mediated transcription, regardless of the targeting approach.</p><p id="P54">Importantly, we have noted that the MYC-G4 lies in proximity of key regulatory regions of the promoter, including the P1 promoter and the TATA-box sequence. Therefore, using CRISPR-based tools for selective MYC-G4 targeting can easily lead to misleading results when using sgRNAs targeting those regions and placing small molecules near these key regulatory elements. For instance, a recent study reported global <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation when using either dCas9-Nucleolin fusion or dCas9 poly-labeled with ten G4-ligands in tandem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, this effect was observed when targeting the same region as our sgRNA<sub>MYC+58</sub>, which places the dCas9 protein 9-bp apart from the TATA-box and we demonstrated to cause unspecific <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These findings indicated that placing ligands near core promoter elements can lead to transcriptional changes unrelated to G4-stabilization and that careful design of sgRNAs is required when using dCas9-based tools to avoid false positives. Additionally, our data suggested that the use of multiple ligands on a single dCas9 protein to induce transcriptional perturbation is likely leading to false positives by inducing local overcrowding at promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Similarly, using multiple sgRNAs on a single target can perturb the homeostasis of regulatory elements in a ligand-dependent manner, without necessarily reflecting G4-specific effects, and should thus be avoided <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P55">Using the selective G4-antibody BG4, we confirmed that the P1-specific <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation induced by ATENA is accompanied by reduced protein accessibility at the MYC-G4 site, supporting the notion that G4 engagement underlies the observed transcriptional suppression by hampering G4-protein interactions. Notably, a similar effect was observed with DC-34, further suggesting that reduced BG4 binding, rather than the previously reported enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, is to be expected when the ligand successfully engages the G4 within the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter. This also provides evidence that selective G4 targeting at the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter can be leveraged therapeutically to suppress its expression by interfering with protein-G4 interactions. However, this effect is limited to <italic>c-MYC</italic> transcription mediated by the P1 promoter and, therefore, heavily dependent on the cellular system investigated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. For example, the substantial <italic>c-MYC</italic> downregulation, observed upon treatment with DC-34 in multiple myeloma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, is consistent with the high levels of P1-driven <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression characteristic of these cancers <sup>,67</sup>, while it is ineffective in other cells that are less reliant on the P1 promoter for <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression (i.e., MCF7).</p><p id="P56">ATENA further enabled us to investigate the transcriptional response elicited when targeting the iM structure, also present within the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter. By decorating ATENA with an iM-selective peptide recently developed by the Waller’s group (RSV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, we also observed transcriptional changes limited to the P1-promoter. However, when targeting the iM, we measured an increase of P1-driven transcription, rather than a reduction, suggesting that distinct DNA secondary structures might differently affect the expression at the same promoter. Moreover, this demonstrated the modularity of ATENA, which can be easily adapted to target any DNA structure of interest using the same design principles.</p><p id="P57">ATENA also enabled us to explore ligand-dependent variation in responses when targeting the same G4-structure. It is well established that G4-ligands can cause either transcriptional activation or repression depending on the G4-associated promoter, and this variability has often been attributed to context-dependent biological roles of the specific G4 investigated. However, this model contradicts genomic studies that strongly indicate a global association of G4-formation with transcriptional activation rather than a context-dependent function of these structures. Using ATENA in combination with CUT&amp;Tag, we could demonstrate that the variation in gene expression responses at specific G4 sites stems not from inherent differences in G4 function, but rather from how structurally different ligands affect protein-G4 interactions.</p><p id="P58">We tested this by characterizing the different transcriptional responses observed upon targeting the G4 in the promoter of the long non-coding RNA <italic>PVT1</italic> when using two established G4 ligands: PDS and PhenDC3. The previously observed upregulation in <italic>PVT1</italic> transcription following PDS treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> was recapitulated with ATENA. This transcriptional increase was accompanied by increased BG4-binding at this G4-site, as quantified by BG4 CUT&amp;Tag qPCR, suggesting that PDS binding might enhance local protein accessibility, acting as a molecular glue and, therefore, stimulate transcription. In contrast, PhenDC3 treatment resulted in transcriptional suppression - consistent with the more commonly reported effects of G4 ligands- demonstrating that structurally distinct ligands can drive divergent transcriptional responses at the same G4 site.</p><p id="P59">Notably, these ligand-dependent responses were also observed when using the free - not bound to dCas9 - PyPDS or PhenDC3, indicating that the lack of inter-G4 selectivity does not necessarily prevent these molecules from providing meaningful information on the specific G4 site. Taken together, these findings suggest that G4-ligands - while useful tools for perturbing G4-homeostasis and investigating the consequent biological responses - cannot be used to directly infer the native biological roles of G4s,but should instead be used to gain insights into the responses triggered by their binding to these structures. Moreover, our data strongly indicate that it is not safe to assume that different G4-ligands will lead to similar biological responses, which is a common assumption often reported in the literature.</p><p id="P60">Finally, we utilized ATENA to target uncharacterized G4s previously identified in MCF7 cells with CUT&amp;Tag but never investigated their biological functions. Given that G4s are typically found at active promoters, we reasoned that a gene’s transcriptional status can strongly influence its responsiveness to G4-ligand targeting. We took advantage of ATENA to direct PyPDS to a G4-promoter of either a highly expressed gene (<italic>HMGN1</italic>) or a low-expressed one (<italic>IL17RA</italic>). Single targeting of the G4 located in the <italic>HMGN1</italic> promoter - unique to MCF7 cells and not detected in other cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> - led to the higher transcriptional suppression measured in MCF7 (a 99% reduction), confirming a strong link between transcriptional activity and ligand sensitivity that indicates a substantial contribution of the HMGN1-G4 in sustaining elevated expression levels of <italic>HMGN1</italic> in breast cancer cells.</p><p id="P61">We recently observed that PDS treatment in chemo-resistant ovarian cancer cells resensitizes them to chemotherapy, due to the enrichment of G4s in highly transcriptionally active genes that are essential to establish a chemo-resistant state, such as <italic>WNT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Given the relevance of epigenetic changes in establishing dormancy in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and our observation linking expression levels of <italic>HMGN1</italic> with dormancy/awakening transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>), targeting of the HMGN1-G4 with ligands might offer scope for the development of a therapeutic strategy to prevent awakening of dormant cells and cancer relapse.</p><p id="P62">Altogether, these results support a model in which the biological significance of G4 structures within the genome is contingent on the epigenetic landscape and the gene transcriptional status in a given cell line.</p><p id="P63">In conclusion, ATENA provides a robust method for targeting single G4s within the genome of living cells using distinct G4-ligands. This technology allowed us to dissect the diverse biological responses elicited by different ligands at the same G4 site, as well as the effects of targeting various G4s with the same ligand with high precision. We found that the chemical nature of the ligand used can perturb the local protein-binding homeostasis of promoter G4s differently, leading to either increased protein accessibility and transcriptional activation or decreased accessibility and transcriptional suppression. These effects can be monitored directly using BG4 CUT&amp;Tag qPCR, providing an assessment of protein accessibility at the targeted G4 as a response to ligand binding. We demonstrated that some ligands could act as molecular glue of G4-protein interactions or as displacers, depending on the specific G4-targeted. This can be valuable for developing therapeutic agents based on G4-targeting, which can be tailored chemically to either diminish or amplify transcription based on their binding modalities. Moreover, ATENA enabled us to disentangle local effects triggered by individual G4-targeting from broader responses driven by global G4-stabilization obtained when using canonical G4-ligands. Interestingly, our data suggest that G4-ligands - despite their lack of inter-G4 selectivity - often recapitulate the transcriptional changes observed with selective targeting of G4s and can be used to infer the therapeutic potential of individual structures. Indeed, the response to G4-ligand treatment is mainly shaped by the intrinsic level of transcription of the targeted promoter, making the ligand responses highly epigenetic and cell-dependent.</p><p id="P64">We envisage that further development of ATENA can be leveraged to generate genome-wide screening of G4-functional response to various ligands in different cell lines. Additionally, this technology can be used to generate Halo-functional ligands and screen their ability to perturb protein accessibility at a given G4 site. We also anticipate that - given the minimal perturbation of ligands required for Halo-functionalization (chloroalkane) - ATENA is potentially a promising platform for gene-selective localization of other DNA-interacting therapeutics, including Topoisomerase inhibitors or cross-linking agents.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P65">Comprehensive synthetic protocols and purification methods for Cl-PDS<sub>n</sub>, Cl-PhenDC3<sub>n</sub>, and Cl-pep-RVS<sub>n</sub> ligands are provided in the Supplementary Information (SI1).</p><sec id="S18"><title>FRET-melting assay</title><p id="P66">Before each experiment, a solution containing 20 µM DNA ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), labeled at 5’-with FAM and at 3’-with TAMRA, was freshly prepared in 10 mM lithium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 supplemented with 20 mM KCl.
