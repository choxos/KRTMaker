Poor translation of potential new therapies from pre-clinical studies to the clinic could be one reason behind this. The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse is the gold-standard for testing new bladder cancer therapies, but there are key physiological and molecular differences between mouse and human bladders. Thus, more human cell-based models may improve translation of treatments.</p><p id="P2">Here, we introduce a bladder cancer microtissue model called <underline>3D</underline> <underline>U</underline>rine-tolerant <underline>Hu</underline>man <underline>U</underline>rothelium-Tumour (3D-UHU-TU), which incorporates spheroids derived from human bladder cancer cell lines RT112 (low grade) and T24 (high grade) into the previously published 3D-UHU healthy urothelial model in a 100% urine environment. Both low- and high-grade 3D-UHU-TU models were characterised using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining with diagnostic markers (CK7, CK20 and GATA3), cadherin markers (E- and N-Cadherin), invasion and migration markers (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and a proliferation marker (Ki-67). Both models expressed the correct markers in the correct spatial areas. We also investigated the utility of both 3D-UHU-TU models as a platform to test treatments, using the conventional chemotherapeutic Mitomycin C as proof of principle. After 2 hours of treatment and 24 hours of recovery, cell lysis and nuclear damage were observed in both low- and high-grade cancer spheroids, with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy urothelium. At higher doses, cancer spheroids either disintegrated or were reduced in size, with the healthy urothelium still intact.</p><p id="P3">Taken together, 3D-UHU-TU is a novel, <italic>in vitro</italic> model for testing both the safety and efficacy of new treatments. Furthermore, our work lays the foundation for testing treatments on patient-derived tumour spheroids in a personalised medicine approach.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>2</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Bladder cancer is one of the most expensive cancers to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), and cases and deaths continue to rise year on year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Due to the heterogenous nature of bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), treatment strategies specific to the particular tumour type are limited. This may explain in part why treatment outcomes have not improved for the last four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), lagging behind progress with many other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P5">There are two main types of urothelial carcinoma: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC (clinical stage Tis, Ta and T1) is the most common (˜75% of cases), which can be further separated into low-, intermediate- and high-risk categories, for which different treatments can be implemented depending on tumour grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). First-line treatments include transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT), Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy, and chemotherapy involving mitomycin C (MMC) and/or cisplatin. For more advanced NMIBC, the second-line chemotherapeutic gemcitabine can also be used in combination with cisplatin or another platin drug such as paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The chance of recurrence of high-risk NMIBC five years after TURBT is approximately 69.5%, with up to 22.8% progressing to MIBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P6">First-line treatment for MIBC includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy, i.e. complete bladder removal and the implementation of a stoma. The impact on such patients can be significant, with overall survival post-treatment at 49% after 5 years and 36% at 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In addition, those who survive nevertheless suffer from major quality-of-life issues involving social and psychological impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This highlights the importance of developing new therapies and models to test them, especially at the NMIBC stage before progression has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The most widely used preclinical models for bladder cancer are orthotopic and xenograft murine models. However, working with mice is labour-intensive, ethically challenging, expensive and subject to time-consuming regulation. Other disadvantages include the length of time needed to establish disease in mice, which can take 4-6 months, and in the case of the PDX model, poor implantation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). More profoundly, there are concerns about physiological inaccuracies caused by the species difference of the surrounding urothelial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). It has been shown that the method of tumorigenesis and the tumour microenvironment greatly influence the molecular subtype which consequently influences cancer development and response to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Therefore, in the mouse model context, even implanted human bladder cancer cells may not respond as they would in a human context. This highlights the need for developing complementary approaches to model bladder cancer.</p><p id="P8">A more representative model would involve combining human tumour cells with a human microenvironment. On the cancer side, 3D spheroid models provide more complexity than simple tumour cell lines, allowing cells to communicate with one another and express chemical gradients shown in normal tumour progression such as nutrients, oxygen and catabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Tumour spheroids can also be derived from patients, which may usher in an era of personalized medicine for bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P9">On the microenvironment side, recent years have seen exciting advances in healthy human urothelial organoid and microtissue modelling (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>)). Briefly, human cell lines and patient-derived cells have been used including UROtsa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and normal human urothelial cells (NHU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Cross <italic>et al</italic>. developed a protocol allowing primary NHU cells to stratify to 3-7 layers with expression of a number of key markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). More recently, Sharma et al. developed a human bladder-on-chip model for studying UTI with UPEC infection. Human bladder endothelial and epithelial cells were co-cultured under flow conditions using highly diluted urine. Significantly, the model also incorporated neutrophils as an immune component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Recently, our laboratory has developed a <underline>3D</underline> <underline>u</underline>rine-tolerant <underline>h</underline>uman <underline>u</underline>rothelium model (3D-UHU) which has previously been characterised and used for research into urinary tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This microtissue model, derived from commercially available HBLAK cells, is novel because it can be grown and maintained in a 100% urine environment. Cells stratify to 5-7 cell layers (as opposed to the mouse urothelium, which only expresses three) with terminally differentiated umbrella cells. Urothelial biomarkers are also correctly expressed (Claudins, Uroplakins, Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), Cytokeratins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), E-Cadherin) with the formation of a luminal glycosaminoglycan layer and strong barrier function. Importantly, it is fully urine-tolerant for weeks, allowing for experimentation in the native environment, which may affect both tumour and normal urothelial gene expression as well as response to chemotherapy, providing a more physiologically relevant tumour microenvironment for understanding both basic biology and treatment response.</p><p id="P11">Here, we created and characterised hybrid tumour/healthy cell models using the 3D-UHU model co-cultured with bladder cancer spheroids derived from bladder carcinoma cell lines frequently used in mouse models, RT112 (low grade) and T24 (high grade). Next, we characterised the models with various markers involved in diagnosis (CK7, CK20, GATA3), adhesion (cadherins), invasion/migration (MMPs), and proliferation (Ki-67). Finally, we assessed the usefulness of 3D-UHU-TU as a testbed for treatment using the common chemotherapeutic Mitomycin C. Our results suggest that the models hold promise for trialling potential therapies in a manner far simpler, quicker and cheaper than animal experimentation. It also allows for testing in a human urinary microenvironment, where urothelial side effects can be assessed alongside tumour cell killing.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><label>3</label><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><label>3.1</label><title>Cell Lines and Culture Conditions</title><p id="P12">Human HBLAK cells (CELLnTEC, Switzerland) were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).

In particular, these markers help assess cell migration and potentially invasion.</p><p id="P31">MMP-2 and MMP-9 were expressed on both RT112 and T24 cancer spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A&amp;B</xref>; 3D-UHU component present but not shown). In RT112 cancer spheroids, MMP-2 and -9 are expressed in the main spheroid but also in cells that migrate out of the main spheroid (white and yellow arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). These cells also seem to form a ‘chain-like’ structure (blue arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) and have a mix of amoeboid (white arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and mesenchymal (yellow arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) migration phenotypes.</p><p id="P32">Similarly, in the case of T24 spheroid and migrating cells, both expressed MMP-2 and -9. There were a lot more cells that had migrated out of the main spheroid (green arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A&amp;B</xref> compared with RT112 spheroids, which is expected of a higher-grade cancer. These cells also only expressed mesenchymal migration phenotype (yellow arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>4.2.4</label><title>Proliferation – Ki-67</title><p id="P33">Ki-67 is a widely used proliferation marker in cancer cell biology. It is a vital protein of the cell cycle which is upregulated in proliferating cells and downregulated in resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). It is also a promising prognostic marker particularly for breast cancer, indicating its clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P34">In the low-grade RT112 model, the initial experiment of co-culture for 2 days in a urine environment showed expression of Ki-67 expression in the RT112 spheroid, and also in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). This was also confirmed with histological analysis after 6 days of co-culture in urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results indicate that these cancer spheroids and migrating cells could survive and proliferate in a urine environment.</p><p id="P35">In contrast, the high-grade T24 model exhibited limited Ki-67 expression, particularly within the T24 cancer spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A and B</xref>; right of the orange dotted line). However, while T24 cells proliferated normally in 2D DMEM cultures, they appeared to struggle in urine conditions, particularly within the 3D spheroid structure. In contrast, T24 cells migrating away from the spheroid mass expressed Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Histological analysis of the models further revealed Ki-67 expression in the basal cells of the surrounding normal urothelium, as well as in some intermediate cells. This is expected in the transitional urothelium, and the presence of Ki-67 in these layers supports the validity of the healthy component of the 3D-UHU-TU model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><label>4.3</label><title>Mitomycin C Treatment has Tumour-Specific Efficacy on 3D-UHU-TU Models</title><p id="P37">Mitomycin C (MMC) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of NMIBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). It works by alkylating cellular DNA, causing DNA double-strand breaks that initiate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). We trialled this gold-standard MMC treatment in the 3D-UHU-TU models to validate the platform as a potential testbed for new treatments. MMC treatment was administered, and specific cytotoxicity assessed via immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Two treatment were used, a low-dose (10μg/ml) and a high dose (50μg/ml), for two hours; afterwards, the treatment was replaced with urine and models were allowed to recover for 24 hours before assessment.</p><p id="P38">For the RT112 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; left panels), MMC caused damage to the RT112 spheroids in a dose-dependent manner, as expected. While the saline control did not induce morphological damage or affect the spheroid structure, as expected, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; top-left panel), at 10μg/ml, the structure of the spheroid was still intact, but extensive cellular lysis and nuclear damage was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; middle-left panel, white arrows). At 50μg/ml, the RT112 spheroid appeared to be completely disaggregated with the healthy urothelium still intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; bottom left panel).</p><p id="P39">In the T24 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; right panels), saline treatment again induced no morphological damage to the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; top-right panel). At 10μg/ml MMC, the cancer spheroid appeared to maintain structure with some cellular damage of migrating cells, comparable to what was observed with RT112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; middle-right panel, orange arrow). At 50μg/ml, the cancer spheroids were much smaller and some cellular damage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>; bottom-right panel, brown arrow).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">The 3D-UHU model has previously been utilised for research into urinary tract infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). 3D-UHU-TU represents the first significant advancement in adapting this model to simulate another urological disease: bladder cancer. Not only is the 3D-UHU-TU model established in a healthy urothelial and urine-dependent environment, allowing for a more physiologically accurate tumour microenvironment, but it can also incorporate tumour spheroids from different origins – in this case, both low- and high-grade 3D bladder cancer spheroids were represented as a proof-of-principle. Characterisation of the 3D-UHU-TU models revealed them to largely express the expected markers in the correct spatial environment. It is worth mentioning that growth and implantation of larger spheroids (≥400μm) is also feasible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), so there is also scope to assess larger spheroids that incorporate a hypoxic and/or necrotic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, due to imaging scale constraints, to obtain more accurate spatial information, we focused on the implantation of multiple RT112 and T24 micro-spheroids in this paper.</p><p id="P41">Clinical diagnoses of bladder cancer using immunohistochemistry staining usually involve GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), CK7 and CK20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and these three biomarkers were chosen to assess whether the 3D-UHU-TU models expressed similar diagnostic markers to patient material. Firstly, the loss of GATA3 expression has been linked to higher-grade disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). A tissue microarray study of 2,710 bladder tumours found GATA3 to be significantly more prevalent in non-invasive Ta stage tumours (98% of 790 tumours), with a marked reduction in T2 to T4 stage tumours (59.8% of 1,223 tumours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Since RT112 is a low-grade T2-stage cancer cell line, we anticipated GATA3 expression, and indeed, the 3D-UHU-TU/RT112 model demonstrated GATA3 expression in the spheroid component. In contrast, the 3D-UHU-TU/T24 model, consistent with the characteristics of a high-grade cancer cell line, did not exhibit GATA3 expression in the spheroid component.</p><p id="P42">CK7 and CK20 expression were analysed in another microtissue array study in various grades and stages of urothelial carcinoma across 1,755 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). In Ta stage and low-grade urothelial carcinoma, CK7 and CK20 were expressed in 98.7% and 69.7% of 177 tumours, respectively. In the 3D-UHU-TU/RT112 model, which mirrors these types of tumours, CK7 was consistently expressed throughout the model. However, there was little expression of CK20 in the spheroid mass. Like the RT112 model, the 3D-UHU-TU/T24 model also expressed CK7, though at a weaker level in the cancer spheroid compared with the RT112 cancer spheroid. CK20 was also not expressed in the T24 spheroids.</p><p id="P43">Although CK20 has previously been shown to be expressed in the superficial umbrella cells of 3D-UHU by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we did not observe CK20 expression via ICH in the normal margins of any of our models. Positive staining controls were employed CK20 expression was still observed in these controls suggesting no technical issues. Assessing expression with immunofluorescence on the transverse plane may be more optimal for CK20. The absence of CK20 in the urothelium component may be due to co-culture effects altering expression in adjacent cells, incomplete differentiation of umbrella cells in this set of experiments, or shedding of the top layer during the co-culture or the ˋIHC sample preparation process.</p><p id="P44">Assessing cadherin expression is crucial as members of this family play a role in invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). E-Cadherin is known to be expressed throughout the bladder urothelium at the tight junctions and is a natural tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Cancers with a decreased expression of E-Cadherin exhibit a more invasive and metastatic behaviour, with the abnormal upregulation of N-Cadherin. This is consistent with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process whereby epithelial cancers transform to a migratory mesenchymal-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In our experiments, RT112 spheroids incorporated into 3D-UHU did exhibit some migratory cells, but strongly expressed E-Cadherin, consistent with their classification as a low-grade cancer model. Conversely, T24 spheroids incorporated into 3D-UHU displayed a more frequent migratory phenotype and had an increased expression of N-Cadherin, consistent with their high-grade cancer classification. Given that low-grade cancers are typically well-differentiated and express E-Cadherin, which strengthens cell-cell adhesion, it is likely that they can tolerate the bladder’s luminal conditions without needing to invade more deeply into the nutrient-rich areas of the bladder wall.</p><p id="P45">In addition, MMP-2 and -9 are recognised as important biomarkers for bladder cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Kudelski <italic>et al</italic>. looked at their expression in low- and high-grade cancer tissue and also in healthy marginal tissue taken from the same patient. They found that MMPs were present in all tissue types regardless of grade and disease status, but MMP-9 expression was enhanced compared with MMP-2 particularly in higher-grade tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In both low- and high-grade 3D-UHU-TU models, only the presence of both these MMPs were investigated, and enzymatic activity was not measured. Our models also demonstrated a variety of migration types, consistent with the variety known to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) and demonstrating the dynamic and versatile nature of 3D-UHU-TU. It should also be noted that we did not observe an invasion phenotype in our higher-grade model, but it is possible that more time is required for this to occur, or that our model is lacking some component that might facilitate this. Enhancing the model to incorporate deeper layers of the bladder (e.g. lamina propria and or muscle microtissue) alongside more time in co-culture might allow us to model invasion in the future.</p><p id="P46">As the 3D-UHU-TU model is grown and maintained in a 100% urine environment, it was important to test the effect of the urine on cancer spheroid proliferation. The Ki-67 data from the low-grade RT112 spheroids within 3D-UHU-TU matched their proliferative nature seen in growth curves measured from individual spheroids growing in microcavity plates. In contrast, Ki-67 expression of the high-grade T24 spheroids was low within the main body of the spheroid, yet high in migratory T24 cells that had actively detached from the spheroid. Given that Ki-67 has been implicated in bladder cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), this result is consistent with that role. In the healthy 3D-UHU component, proliferation was also seen in the basal layers and some intermediate cells. This was expected, as the transitional urothelium regenerates from the basal membrane upwards, with progenitor basal cells responsible for replacing cells that have matured. In addition, rapidly proliferating intermediate cells play a crucial role in establishing the multiple layers of the urothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P47">To assess the efficacy of 3D-UHU-TU as a testbed for new treatments, 3D-UHU-TU models were treated with the commonly used chemotherapeutic MMC. MMC induces apoptosis by alkylating DNA and forming crosslinks to prevent DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). DNA fragmentation was seen in all treated RT112 spheroids which suggests that MMC did induce apoptosis. Normally, morphological signatures of apoptosis are DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) and in the absence of ‘scavenger cells’, secondary necrosis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). As the 3D-UHU-TU models do not incorporate immune cells, there are no immune cells present to phagocytose the apoptotic cells; therefore secondary necrosis is more likely to occur in the models. In our experiments, intracellular contents seemed to be lysing out of both cancer spheroids, suggesting secondary necrosis.</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, the 3D-UHU-TU model represents a new generation of <italic>in vitro</italic> urothelial bladder cancer model including a low and high-grade cancer component embedded in a healthy micro-environment, which shows promise as a testing platform for therapies. Like all models, 3D-UHU-TU does have some inherent limitations, for example the lack of a blood supply, deeper tissue layers or an immune system. On the other hand, in recent years, great strides have been made in incorporating more complexity into micro-physiological systems (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>)), suggesting that the 3D-UHU-TU prototype could be used a foundation for developing more advanced iterations. One exciting possibility, which we are actively pursuing, is the incorporation of patient-derived tumour spheroids in place of cell lines, potentially allowing a personalised medicine approach to drug screening. Also, as <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based model technology becomes more evolved, 3D-UHU-TU with such patient material could serve as a tool to help further understand the disease at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199626-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d80aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the UCL Therapeutic Innovation Networks and the Rosetrees Trust for funding the project.
