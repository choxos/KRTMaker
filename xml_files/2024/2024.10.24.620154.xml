Here we sought to resolve this contradiction by inducing the neuropathology commonly observed in individuals with compulsive disorders, specifically by causing neuroinflammation in the dorsomedial striatum of rats. We found that this caused rats to be excessively goal-directed, acquiring and maintaining goal-directed actions under conditions that would otherwise produce habits. Immunohistochemical findings suggested that these behaviours were a result of astrocytic proliferation and its effects on neuronal activation. We therefore investigated the role of striatal astrocytes specifically, demonstrating that chemogenetically activating the Gi-pathway in astrocytes altered the firing properties of nearby medium spiny neurons and modulated goal-directed action control. Together, results suggest that striatal neuroinflammation is sufficient to cause excessive goal-directed action control through the dysregulation of astrocyte function suggesting that individuals with striatal neuroinflammation are excessively goal-directed rather than habitual, information that could be used to direct future interventions and/or treatments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Individuals with compulsive disorders perform actions repetitively, often against their desires and despite negative consequences. This, coupled with observations of aberrant neural activity in the cortico-striatal-thalamic loops that underlie action control, has led to widespread speculation that compulsions arise from a disruption in the balance between goal-directed actions and habits. However, there is debate regarding the proposed direction of this disruption, with some researchers arguing that disorders like substance use disorder (SUD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are best characterised as an overreliance on habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), whereas others argue that they reflect excessive goal-directed control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Here we address this question in a causal manner by inducing the neuropathological changes associated with disorders of compulsion (including SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and OCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), but also Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases which often feature compulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)) and examining the consequences for action selection. Specifically, we first investigated whether regionally-specific striatal neuroinflammation in rats disrupted the balance between goal-directed and habitual action control, then investigated the astrocyte-specific mechanism of that disruption.</p><p id="P4">The neural circuit of goal-directed and habitual actions has been extensively investigated over the last three decades and has been found to have considerable homology between rodents, primates, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Foundational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) revealed that goal-directed and habits actions are controlled by distinct but parallel circuits in the cortico-striatal network, with lesioning or inactivating structures within one circuit producing a shift from one action control system to the other, mirroring the behavioural changes seen in individuals with compulsive disorders. However, the experimental approaches above do not adequately mimic the neural circuit disturbances in individuals with compulsive disorders, who do not exhibit widespread neuronal silencing or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and if they do, it usually emerges long after symptoms appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Therefore, it remains an open question how shifts in action control emerge in such individuals. Interestingly, both post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have reported increased markers of neuroinflammation in the striatum and other regions in such individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Accordingly, we aimed to mimic this neuropathology in rats so that we could examine the causal consequences of this treatment for goal-directed and habitual action control.</p><p id="P5">Neuroinflammation was achieved by stereotactically injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5mg/mL, n=16; Sham controls, n = 14), an endotoxin and neuroinflammatory mimetic, into the striatum. We targeted the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>) because it is the rodent homologue of the caudate, a region that is known to exhibit abnormal neural activity and elevated neuroinflammatory markers in individuals with substance use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and OCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In rodents, pDMS is considered the neural locus of action control, as it is the only brain region known to be involved in both the learning and performance of goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Because we recently showed that neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of mice increased neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) we expected a similar effect in the pDMS. We further anticipated that this increased activation would enhance the typical function of pDMS to produce ‘excessive’ goal-directed action control, which we defined as animals exerting goal-directed control when expected not to. Therefore, for the first series of experiments we adopted experimental parameters under which we expected our Sham animals to show impaired action selection, by feeding them a standard laboratory chow that is relatively high in fat and protein (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental methods and Table 1</xref> for details) on a mild deprivation schedule (approx. 90% of their initial body weight) to induce low levels of hunger and arousal.</p><p id="P6">We first tested action selection under the guidance of stimuli using the specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. Rats were trained to associate two conditioned stimuli (CSs; a white noise or clicker) with two unique outcomes (sucrose solution or pellet), then to press a left and right lever for the same outcomes. On test, rats were presented with the clicker and noise together with the levers for the first time, but no food. We expected Sham animals to respond equally on each lever regardless of the stimulus presented (due to the mild deprivation conditions) but expected LPS animals to be excessively goal-directed and respond selectively on the lever that had earned the ‘same’ outcome as the stimulus being presented. That is, the pellet-associated stimulus should elicit presses on the pellet lever more than the sucrose lever, and the sucrose stimulus should elicit presses on the sucrose lever: Same &gt; Different. This prediction was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). That is, despite entries into the food magazine and lever press responses not differing between Sham and LPS groups during any phase of acquisition (largest F(1,28) = 1.085, p = 0.362, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1A-C</xref>), on test there was a group x transfer interaction, F (1,28) = 5.710, p = 0.024, which was explained by a significant simple effect of transfer (Same &gt; Different) for group LPS, F (1,28) = 15.996, p = 0.000, but not Shams (Same = Different), F &lt; 1.</p><p id="P7">Next, rats were tested for goal-directed action control in the absence of stimuli using the outcome devaluation design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. Rats were retrained to press the two levers for their distinct outcomes, then given a choice test in which both levers were presented without any outcomes delivered. Immediately prior to this test, we reduced the value of either pellets or sucrose using sensory-specific satiety. If goal-directed, animals should prefer the lever associated with the still-valued outcome and avoid the lever associated with the devalued outcome, demonstrating that their actions were motivated by a) the current value of the outcome, and b) the contingency between the action and outcome: the two criteria of goal-direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Again, due to the mild deprivation conditions we again predicted that the devaluation effect (Valued &gt; Devalued) would be attenuated for group Sham and intact for group LPS. This prediction was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) indicated by a group x devaluation interaction, F (1,28) = 4.878, p = 0.035, composed of a small but significant, simple effect for group Sham, F (1,28) = 7.445, p = 0.011, and a larger effect for group LPS, F (1,28) = 31.060, p = 0.000. This difference was confined to the instrumental response because entries into the food magazine did not differ between groups, F &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) and nor did consumption during pre-feeding, F &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Following a day of instrumental retraining, rats were tested for outcome-selective reinstatement as again illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. For this test, responding on each lever was extinguished for 15 min, followed by two unsignalled presentations of each outcome. These presentations typically reinstate responding selectively on the lever that had earned that outcome during training, i.e. sucrose presentations elicit presses on the sucrose lever and pellet presentations on the pellet lever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Because selective reinstatement is a measure of action selection that is not goal-directed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we expected that it would remain unaffected by both the mild deprivation conditions and pDMS neuroinflammation. This was confirmed, as reinstatement was intact (Reinstated &gt; Nonreinstated) for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) supported by a main effect of reinstatement, F (1,28) = 67.951, p = 0.000, that did not interact with group, F &lt; 1.</p><p id="P9">To assess whether group differences persisted under moderate deprivation conditions, we switched rats to a lower fat, lower protein laboratory chow and increased the deprivation schedule to maintain rats at approximately 85% of initial body weight (i.e. the standard approach for these kinds of studies, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental methods</xref> for details). After brief retraining, we retested the rats using the same transfer, devaluation, and reinstatement tests. This time, performance did not differ between groups on any test. Indeed, on the transfer test both groups responded more on the Same relative to the Different lever: main effect, F (1,28) = 30.605, p = 0.000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), interaction with group, F &lt; 1. Likewise, on devaluation both groups pressed the Valued more than the Devalued lever; main effect, F (1,28) = 12.378, p = 0.000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>), which also did not interact with group, F &lt; 1. Finally, reinstatement was again intact for both groups (Reinstated &gt; NonReinstated); main effect (Reinstated &gt; Nonreinstated), F (1,28) = 57.780, p = 0.000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>), and no interaction with group, F &lt; 1.</p><p id="P10">We next tested whether these effects were regionally specific by injecting LPS into the nucleus accumbens core (NAc core; n=14 LPS, n=14 Sham controls, a ventral striatal region involved in the performance of goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)). This time, all training and testing occurred under the moderate deprivation/hunger schedule (lower fat/protein chow at 85% bodyweight) because a pilot study revealed that neuroinflammation in the NAc core was unlikely to produce the same increased propensity for goal-directed control. LPS in the NAc core did not affect instrumental responding during any stage of training or test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1G, Fig. 1O</xref>,) but did increase the number of entries rats made into the food magazine during Pavlovian conditioning, as revealed by a main effect of group, F (1,25) = 6.962, p = 0.014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1N</xref>), and during devaluation testing, as indicated by a group main effect, F (1,26) = 6.02, p = 0.021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1P</xref>). Again, this difference was not due to any influence of LPS on feeding or appetite, because outcome consumption during prefeeding did not differ between groups (F &lt; 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Q</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Pavlovian conditioning and devaluation testing were the two phases of the experiment for which lever pressing was absent (during Pavlovian conditioning) or low (during devaluation testing, due to rats being prefed to satiety). This pattern of results therefore suggests that NAc core neuroinflammation increased the propensity for Pavlovian responding, but that this effect was masked when response competition from lever pressing was present (i.e. lever pressing and magazine entries compete because rats cannot perform both at the same time). Because an enhanced propensity to respond to Pavlovian cues is also claimed to contribute to compulsive-like tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), if translatable, these results suggest that differential distributions of neuroinflammation throughout the striatum could be a multifaceted source of compulsivity.</p><p id="P12">Following confirmation that the effects of pDMS neuroinflammation on goal-directed action are region-specific, we aimed to determine whether it could also produce excessive goal-directed control under moderate deprivation conditions, specifically when using experimental parameters that have been reliably shown to produce habits (Valued = Devalued) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). To achieve this, we trained a naïve cohort of rats (n=23 LPS, n=18 Sham) to press a single lever for sucrose on an interval schedule whilst being maintained at approximately 85% of their initial body weight on the low fat/low protein chow described.</p><p id="P13">We then administered a progressive ratio test to determine whether pDMS neuroinflammation had altered motivation <italic>per se</italic>, followed by another devaluation test which was performed after half of the animals were subjected to taste aversion training (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Specifically, the Devalued group received 3 x pairings of sucrose with lithium chloride injections to induce malaise, whereas the Valued group received saline injections. We expected Sham animals to show evidence of habits (Valued = Devalued) and group LPS to remain goal-directed (Valued &gt; Devalued).</p><p id="P14">Once again, there were no group differences during lever press acquisition, although the LPS group did appear to lever press marginally more than Shams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), main effect of group F(1,39) = 3.36, p = 0.074. Importantly, however, the number of action-outcome pairings did not differ between groups, F &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). During progressive ratio testing, animals with pDMS neuroinflammation took longer than Shams to reach ‘breakpoint’ (i.e. 5 minutes without responding) despite the number of lever presses required to earn a sucrose outcome increasing by 5 each time. There was a main effect of group, F (1,39) = 15.15, p = 0.0004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) that remained even after data was corrected for slightly higher lever presses in group LPS at baseline, F (1,39) = 6.243, p = 0.0168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">As expected, when rats should have been habitual pDMS neuroinflammation produced goal-directed action control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). There was a group x devaluation interaction, F (1,37) = 4.373, p = 0.043 consisting of intact devaluation in group LPS (Valued &gt; Devalued), F (1,37) = 20.198, p = 0.000, and not Shams (Valued = Devalued), F (1,37) = 1.417, p = 0.241.</p><p id="P16">These findings show that pDMS neuroinflammation increases motivation <italic>and</italic> causes excessive goal-directed control, which is perhaps unsurprising given the high interdependence of the two processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Most importantly, however, they reinforce the notion that pDMS neuroinflammation produces goal-directed control that is excessive, because it prevented the formation of habits which, under non-pathological conditions, are adaptive automated behaviours that allow for more rapid and efficient action execution. Indeed, the inability to form habits has been argued to underscore several cognitive deficits in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Our final aim was to investigate why pDMS neuroinflammation might cause excessive goal-directed control. We turned to the results of our immunohistochemical analyses for clues and found that, although intensity levels, proliferation, and various morphological measures of both the astrocyte marker glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) and microglial marker ionised-calcium binding adaptor molecule (IBA1) were elevated in LPS rats relative to Shams (see Supp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> for full results), only levels of GFAP significantly correlated with action selection on the tests for which performance differed between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-I</xref>, although breakpoint responding which also correlated with IBA1 levels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>, suggesting that that more microglia were associated with motivation but not the selectivity of actions). Moreover, and consistent with our findings in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), neuronal activation was increased by pDMS neuroinflammation, as evidenced by higher levels of the activation marker and immediate early gene c-<italic>fos</italic> co-occurring with NeuN in LPS groups relative to Shams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3N-O</xref>). These levels also significantly correlated selectively with action selection on tests for which group differences were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J-M</xref>).</p><p id="P18">These immunohistochemical results point to pDMS neuroinflammation causing excessive goal-directed action control by altering the interactions between astrocytes and neurons. To gain a more detailed understanding of how this might have occurred, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to determine whether LPS injections in pDMS altered the firing properties of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). For this study, we once again bilaterally injected LPS (5mg/mL, n = 4) or saline (n = 3) into the pDMS of rats, then removed recorded from the pDMS in acute brain slices 6 weeks after injection. Recordings were first taken at resting membrane potential (RMP, data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>) then repeated while cells were voltage-clamped at -80mV, consistent with the reported <italic>in vivo</italic> RMP of MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). MSNs classification was based on action potential profiles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental methods</xref> for details). LPS MSNs displayed a more depolarised action potential (AP) threshold following a depolarising current steps protocol when voltage-clamped at -80mV (t20.49 = 2.46, p = 0.023, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). No changes were seen for average or instantaneous frequency or interspike interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-D</xref>). Analysis of the first AP showed changes in the AP profile with increased rise time (t37.34 = 3.21, p = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>), and decreased amplitude (t31.31 = 2.72, p = 0.011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>) in LPS MSNs. Furthermore, LPS MSNs showed a significantly more depolarised afterhyperpolarization (AHP) peak (t28.37 = 3.40, p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). No changes were seen in rheobase, latency to first spike, half-width or AHP position (data not shown).</p><p id="P19">Together, these firing patterns suggest that LPS-affected cells were less likely to be activated overall. Taken together these data suggest that LPS produces changes in pDMS circuits that disrupts goal-direct action control; given that goal-directed control requires a precise mix of excitatory and inhibitory responding. For example, performance on an outcome devaluation test requires animals to respond selectively on the valued lever whilst inhibiting any previously-learned tendency to press the devalued lever.</p><p id="P20">We next turned our attention to astrocytes. Consistent with increased GFAP and c-Fos/Neun expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), a previous study that chemogenetically activated hM3Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) on astrocytes in DMS found that this led to excessive goal-directed control (albeit in mice and using slightly different behavioural procedures). Thus, we sought to extend these findings by employing a procedure that would reveal information about how pDMS astrocytes might contribute to goal-directed control when in their homeostatic form. Based on evidence that Gi g-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)s are highly expressed on striatal astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and that activating these receptors has been shown to ‘correct’ a number of Huntington-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and compulsion-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) deficits in mice, we employed astrocyte-specific hM4Di DREADDs to investigate the consequences of activating the Gi pathway on neuronal firing and on action selection.</p><p id="P21">Although prior studies have investigated the activation of astrocytic Gi-GPCRs in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), they have primarily focused on the dorsolateral striatum. Our brief fiber photometry study highlighted the importance of regional specificity to astrocyte function within the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), because it showed that the activation of astrocytic hM4Di-DREADDs in the pDMS produced a different profile of calcium transient activity than it did in the NAc core, as measured by relative increase in fluorescence. Specifically, in pDMS, i.p injections of the DREADD agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ) increased the number but not amplitude of calcium peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>), whereas it increased the amplitude of these peaks but not their frequency in the NAc core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Thus, to establish the effects of astrocytic hM4Di activation on neuronal firing properties, we again employed <italic>in vitro</italic> whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. After bilateral injection of GFAP-hM4Di-DREADD into the pDMS, with recordings for each cell (n=7 cells from n=2 animals) taken firstly in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and then repeated following bath application of hM4DI-DREADD agonist DCZ (1μM). Following the application of DCZ, RMP was significantly more depolarised (t6.00 = 4.14, p = 0.0118, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>) shifting cells closer to AP threshold. Then, following the same depolarising current steps protocol used in LPS electrophysiology experiments, AP threshold was lower at RMP (t6.00 = 3.57, p = 0.012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>) further narrowing the range between RMP and AP threshold. Rheobase was also significantly reduced following DCZ application (t6.00 = 4.86, p = 0.003 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). No other changes were seen in AP profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4E-L</xref>) or firing properties (data not shown) with DCZ application at either RMP or while cells were voltage-clamped at -80mV.</p><p id="P23">This profile of MSN firing is in direct contrast to that produced by LPS injection, and also contrasts with the effects of hM3Dq-transfected astrocytes on MSNs observed by Kang et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), which reduced EPSPs and IPSPs in both direct and indirect pathway MSNs respectively. Thus, given that both LPS and hM3Dq activation on astrocytes facilitated goal-directed action control whilst producing an opposite profile of neuronal firing, we hypothesised that the activation of Gi receptors on pDMS astrocytes would have the opposite effect and abolish it. Although this prediction may seem counterintuitive, given prior findings that lesioning or otherwise inactivating this structure also abolishes action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), recent findings paint a more nuanced picture of the precise conditions necessary for goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In particular, these studies have suggested that spatial-based neuronal ensembles within the striatum must behave in a precise and complementary manner (so-called “behavioural syllables”) to produce accurate action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Our electrophysiology results suggest that activating the Gi pathway in pDMS astrocytes disrupts this precision, an effect that would be expected to disrupt the behavioural selectivity necessary for goal-directed action control.</p><p id="P24">Behavioural experiments employing chemogenetics were conducted under moderate (standard) deprivation conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and the bottom left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> show the representative placements of AAV transfection in the pDMS. The bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> shows a high degree of co-localisation of GFAP and AAV-hM4Di-GFAP-mCherry, and the top panel shows lack of overlap with NeuN, suggesting specificity of transfection for astrocytes. Pavlovian and instrumental training were conducted in the absence of DCZ administrations and proceeded without incident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5A-C</xref>, all Fs &lt; 1). Animals did, however, receive vehicle or DCZ injections 25-30 mins prior to each test. Activation of the astrocytic Gi pathway in pDMS prevented transfer, which was impaired (Same = Different) for animals that received both the active virus and DCZ (hM4Di+DCZ; n=12) but was intact (Same &gt; Different) for both vehicle (mCherry or hM4Di+Veh; n=8) and DCZ-only (mCherry+DCZ; n=11) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). There was a group x transfer effect, F (1,28) = 4.947, p = 0.034, consisting of intact transfer simple effects for groups mCherry+DCZ, F (1,28) = 5.995, p = 0.021, and hM4Di+Veh, F (1,28) = 11.731, p = 0.002, but not group hM4Di + DCZ, F &lt; 1. It also prevented outcome devaluation, which was intact (Valued &gt; Devalued) for controls, and abolished (Valued = Devalued) for group hM4Di+DCZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). The group x devaluation interaction, F(1,28) = 5.494, p = 0.026, consisted of intact devaluation simple effects for groups hM4Di + Veh, F(1,28) = 16.464, p = 0.000, and a marginal simple effect for mCherry + DCZ, F(1,28) = 4.063, p = 0.054, and no effect for group hM4Di + DCZ F &lt; 1. Finally, and consistent with our prior LPS findings, performance on selective reinstatement was intact for all groups; main effect (Reinstated &gt; nonReinstated) F(1,28) = 67.965, p = 0.000, interaction F &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). This latter finding demonstrates that the activation of the Gi pathway in pDMS astrocytes doesn’t simply replicate the behavioural results observed following a pDMS lesion or inactivation, which have been shown to abolish reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) as well as devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Rather, these findings demonstrate a distinct role for astrocytes in moderating the neuronal activity that is necessary for intact goal-directed control.</p><p id="P25">Altogether, the results presented here show that pDMS neuroinflammation in the posterior dorsomedial striatum is sufficient to cause excessive goal-directed control, and that it does so because it disrupts the homeostatic function of astrocytes. If translatable, this implies that individuals with neuroinflammation in this brain region, including individuals with compulsive disorders, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, might struggle to exert adequate control over their actions due to an overreliance on goal-directed control.</p><p id="P26">The specificity of this effect to the pDMS does, however, raise the possibility that individuals with more neuroinflammation in their ventromedial striatum (specifically nucleus accumbens core) might struggle to exert control over their actions due to enhanced responding to Pavlovian cues, rather than effects on goal-directed control per se. It is also possible that individuals may have neuroinflammation in both regions, leading to either type of aberrant action control depending on the relative excitation of each based on the pattern of cortical/thalamic inputs. Overall, then, findings indicate that the alterations to action control experienced by individuals with compulsive disorders cannot be reduced to a single mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), but rather are multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and likely operating differently between individuals, or possibly even within the same individual at different times.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199671-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d74aAcZbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tom Burton (UNSW) for his help analysing the fibre photometry data.
