However, the existing efficient ABE, while catalyzing A-to-G conversion, will bring more A and C bystander editing and off-target events, which poses safety concerns for their clinical application. Here, we developed ABE10 (ABE8e with TadA-8e A48E) for efficient and accurate editing of As in YA motifs with YAY&gt;YAR (Y=T or C, R=A or G) hierarchy through structure-oriented rational design. Compared with ABE3.1, currently the only motif (YAC) preference ABE version, ABE10 exhibited A-to-G editing efficiency improvement with an average up to 3.1-fold in indicated YA motif while maintaining reduced bystander Cs editing and minimized DNA or RNA off-targets. Also, we showed ABE10 corrected pathogenic mutation with high efficiency and precision in human cells. Moreover, by ABE10, we efficiently and precisely generated hypocholes-terolemia and tail-loss mouse models mimicking human associated disease and mouse <italic>PCSK9</italic> base editing in vivo for hypercholesterolemia gene therapy, indicating their great potential in broad applications for and disease modeling and gene therapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">About 60% of hereditary disease are caused by single base mutations, 48% of these are caused by single C-to-T base conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The treatment of such hereditary diseases needs safe and effective genome editing tools. Traditional CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination as tools to repair these pathogenic point mutations were very inefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, which leads to the new generation of gene editing tools- base editors, especially the A-to-G base editing tool (ABEs), providing an attractive platform for the treatment of single base mutation diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Current popular base editors are cytidine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs), which can convert C•G-to-T•A and A•T-to-G•C, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They can be used to correct disease-causing point mutations that account for 48% and 13% of genetic diseases, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The application of gene editing in clinical treatment often requires accurate and efficient base editing tools. In recent years, scientists around the world have made significant progresses on the accuracy and efficiency of base editing. For CBEs, a series of accurate and effective CBEs have been developed, such as structure-oriented design of cytosine deaminase to construct motif-specific CBEs (T<underline>C</underline>, C<underline>C</underline> and WR<underline>C</underline>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>; Engineering cytosine base editors with only 1-2nt editing windows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>; Re-evolving TadA-8e transformed ABEs into more accurate and less off-target CBEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> etc. For ABEs, some progresses have also been made, such as rational design of accurate ABE9 for only editing A<sub>5</sub> or A<sub>6</sub> positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, limitations of ABEs are still present for current ABEs, takingABE3.1 as an example, the only motif (YAC) preference ABE version, while has low efficiency and induced more bystander Cs editing within editing window and off-targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, ABEs that could efficiently catalyze A-to-G conversion in specific motifs without introducing more bystanders within editing window and off-targets still in urgent need.</p><p id="P5">Here, we obtained ABE10 with YA motif sequence preference through structure-oriented rational design of ABE8e mutant. Compared to ABE8e, ABE10 can precisely edit YA sequences with minimized bystanders. More importantly, compared with ABE3.1, the only motif (YAC) preference ABE version, ABE10 exhibited A-to-G editing efficiency improvement with average up to 3.1-fold in indicated motif while maintaining reduced bystander Cs editing and minimized DNA or RNA off-target. We also demonstrated that ABE10 can effectively correct disease-causing point mutations without introducing detrimental mutations in human cells. Moreover, by injecting ABE10 mRNA and sgRNA targeting splice donor of mouse <italic>PCSK9</italic> and <italic>TBXT</italic> into zygotes, the loss-of-function of PCSK9 mouse models for hypocholes-terolemia, and short-tailed mouse models for simulating mouse evolution were efficiently produced, respectively. Finally, we delivered lipid nanoparticle–packaged ABE10 mRNA and a sgRNA targeting the GT splice donor site of PCSK9 in mice, high base editing efficiency for PCSK9 and substantial reduction the expression of Pcsk9 and LDL-C in plasma were observed.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure-based evolution of TadA-8e for YAC motif sequences preference</title><p id="P6">The earlier reported ABEs with YAC motif preference was ABE3.1<sup>2</sup>, but its A-to-G editing efficiency was low (1.2-31.1%) and induced more C bystander editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Efficiency-wise, ABE8e is currently considered the more efficient version of ABE. However, ABE8e not only has higher editing activity and a wider editing window making it tend to induce more bystander edits and off-targets, but also lose its sequence preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation, we designed a series of mutants of ABE8e at the binding and catalytic sites of TadA-8e as well as DNA substrates based on the crystal structure of ABE8e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and screened for ABEs to restore its YAC motif sequence preference while maintaining high editing activity. A human endogenous target site (HEK2) with A<sub>3</sub>C<underline>A</underline><sub>5</sub>C<underline>A</underline><sub>7</sub>A<sub>8</sub> sequence was selected for testing. Among these mutations, ABEs that could edit A<sub>5</sub> while had reducing or no editing efficiency of A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>7</sub> and A<sub>8</sub> were selected as candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). After co-transfected ABE8e mutants and HEK2 sgRNA for 72h in HEK293T cells, we collected genomic DNA of cells for amplicon high-throughput sequencing (HTS). HTS data showed that almost all ABE8e mutants can edit both A<sub>5</sub> and A<sub>7</sub>, only ABE8e A48D exhibited reduced A<sub>7</sub> base editing activity without sacrificing on-target A<sub>5</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), indicating A48 maybe the key amino acid of TadA-8e that influences its motif sequence preference. In order to further identify the TadA-8e mutant that can minimize bystander editing, we saturated the mutant A48 amino acid and further tested it with the same target in HEK293T cells. HTS data showed that ABE8e A48E maintains comparable editing activity at A<sub>5</sub> while minimizing bystander editing activity at A<sub>7</sub> (a 3.0-fold decrease) compared to ABE8e A48D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We named ABE8e A48E as ABE10.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of ABE10</title><p id="P7">To unbiasedly profile the characteristics of ABE10, 23 endogenous targets were tested in HEK293T cells with ABE8e, ABE9 and ABE3.1 as control. Among these targets, they almost cover NAN (N=A, T, C and G) and some targets contained NCN (N=A, T, C and G) within its editing window. After analyzing the A-to-G editing efficiency of the most highly edited A in each target across all 23 target sites, we found that the efficiencies of ABE8e were 43.8-90.9%, which were significant higher than all other ABEs treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The efficiencies of ABE10 were 1.4-90%, whichwere significant higher than that of ABE9 (0.7-78.7%) and ABE3.1 (0-75.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Through analyzing the A-to-G editing efficiency of each protospacer of all tested targets, we found ABE8e can efficiently edit almost all As without motif preference at major editing window (A<sub>3</sub>-A<sub>8</sub>) and even edit As outside of the major window (A<sub>2</sub> or A<sub>10</sub>-A<sub>13</sub>) with considerable efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). ABE9, ABE3.1 and ABE10 have a similar editing window that was narrower than that of ABE8e, suggesting they are all accurate versions of ABE, suitable for precision gene therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). We further analyzed the motif preference of these base editors and no motif preference for ABE8e and ABE9 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Notably, ABE3.1 has YAY motif and ABE10 has YA motif preference with YAY&gt;YAR hierarchy (Y=T or C, R=A or G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,d</xref>). Moreover, the average A-to-G efficiencies of ABE10 at A<sub>4</sub>, A<sub>5</sub>, A<sub>6</sub> and A<sub>7</sub> were 34.4%, 58.4%, 35.7% and 16.6%, respectively, far higher than the corresponding efficiencies of ABE3.1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Since ABE8e has been reported to have cytosine deaminase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we further analyzed the C editing of ABE10 at 12 targets. The results showed that ABE10 induced lower or near background C-to-D editing activity compared to ABE8e. At <italic>FANCF</italic>-sg5, ABE10 decreased the editing efficiency of C induced by ABE8e by up to 10.4 times, which was comparable to ABE9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). ABE10 also induced no more indels than that of ABE8e and ABE3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Together, ABE10 is highly efficient at YA motif preference with significantly reduced adenine and cytosine bystander editing effects.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Off-target evaluation of ABE10</title><p id="P8">Next, we performed off-target assessment of ABE10 in three ways: sgRNA-dependent DNA off-target, sgRNA-independent DNA off-target and whole-transcriptomic RNA off-target. 17 off-targets from in silicon prediction or Cas9 known off-targets were used to evaluate the sgRNA-dependent DNA off-target. The results showed that 4/17 off-target were observed for ABE8e and no sgRNA-dependent DNA off-target for both ABE10 and ABE9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Modified R-loop assay was used to evaluate the sgRNA-independent DNA off-target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. HTS data showed that ABE10, similar to ABE9, induced no sgRNA-independent DNA off-target, which were far fewer than that ABE8e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).

The results showed that ABE10 induced 5 times lower the off-target rate than that of ABE8e, though slightly higher than that ABE9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In summary, ABE10 is a highly efficient base editing tool with high specificity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Introduction of therapeutic mutation with high precision using ABE10 in human cells</title><p id="P9">To further validate ABE10’s potential for gene therapy with high precision and efficiency, we generated stable HEK293T cell lines with 2 pathogenic mutations (<italic>GLAT</italic> c.413C&gt;T, Transferase Deficiency Galactosemia; <italic>OTC</italic> c.533C&gt;T, Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) adjacent to bystander mutations that are deleterious in Clin Var database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

However, ABE8e also induced deleterious no-desired base mutation with high efficiency, such as A<sub>3</sub> in <italic>GALT</italic> and A<sub>3</sub> in <italic>OTC</italic> which bring the possibility of additional disease. In contrast, ABE10 have far lower or no editing efficiency at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We further counted these pathogenic mutations with the presence of additional As or Ts (the disease-causing As or Ts were on the complementary strand of its DNA) that may present a risk of disease in the ClinVar database. The results showed that there were 12751 pathogenic mutations surrounded by As or Ts with potential security risk in ABE8e’s editing window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). Among those mutations, 8783 and 1841 pathogenic mutations could be precisely corrected by ABE10 and ABE9, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and Supplementary Table 4, 5). When PAM was further expanded from NGG to NG, the number of precise disease treatment events was further expanded to 21622 for ABE10 and 6033 for ABE9, respectively (Supplementary Table 4, 5). These data suggested that ABE10 have great potential in precisely targeting specific base for future clinical gene therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Generation of disease associated mouse models with high precision using ABE10</title><p id="P11">Base editors have been applied for making disease animal models that is essential for basic medical research. When the base editor is used to make the animal model of disease, it induces not only the target base conversion but also the bystander base editing which potentially perturb the analysis of the relationship between the mouse disease phenotype and base mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used ABE10 to generate mouse model to minimize the occurrence of bystander events. We first targeted proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) to generate hypocholesterolemia mouse models by the zygotes microinjection of ABE10 mRNA and sgRNA targeting the splice site of PCSK9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The results showed ABE 10 and ABE8e induced efficiently base editing in pups, with ABE 10(17/18) and ABE8e (9/11), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, only ABE10 induced precisely A-to-G conversion of the opposite DNA strand of GT splice site with minimized bystander editing in pups.

The phenotype of the pups carried precise target base editing by ABE10 were further confirmed by the detection of PCSK9 and LDL-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These data suggest that ABE, especially the highly efficient version of ABE, enabled efficiently base editing in embryos to produce homozygous mouse with disease phenotype.</p><p id="P12">However, for some other disease-causing genes that are lethal with homozygous mutations, the highly efficient version of ABE is not suitable. For example, <italic>TBXT</italic>, a gene that influences the evolution of the mouse tail and single exon6-skipped transcript is sufficient to induce a tail-loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We designed a sgRNA targeted the opposite of GT splice site of the <italic>TBXT</italic> that its disruption may possible cause exon6 skipping. By co-microinjection ABE8e or ABE10 with sgRNA into mouse zygotes, 8 (8/8) pups were edited in ABE10 treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Heterozygous mice (#BT03, #BT04) displayed almost no tail phenotype and mice with less editing efficiency (#BT02) showed short-tailed phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). However, we found no pups were born in ABE8e group (Data not shown) and the probable cause is that homozygous editing by ABE8e in mice leads to complete exon6-skipped and thus death in utero. These data suggest that ABE10 hold great potential in generation of disease model.

Compared to the efficient ABE version - ABE8e, ABE10 has YA motif preference and a narrower editing window, while reducing bystander A and C editing and DNA/RNA off-target. ABE3.1, currently the only sequence-specific ABE version, has unpredicatable C editing and RNA off-target. For ABE10, it not only effectively alleviates the limitations of ABE, but also has the advantages of high efficiency and small size. Compared with the current accurate ABE-ABE9, ABE10 not only has the same editing efficiency as ABE9 at A<sub>5</sub> and A<sub>6</sub>, but also has higher editing efficiency at A<sub>4</sub> and A<sub>7</sub> sites, where ABE9 cannot edit. Therefore, ABE10 is an elegant adenine base editor with high efficiency, precision and small size. However, although ABE10 has high accuracy, it also sacrifices the editing efficiency of on-target. Therefore, it is necessary to further engineer deaminase in the future to improve its efficiency while maintaining its accuracy. For cytosine base editors, TC, CC, WRC motif preference cytosine base editors have been reported, while similar ABE tools are still lacking, and future further exploration is needed to enrich ABE’s toolbox.</p><p id="P15">Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that ABE10 can be effectively used to correct disease-causing point mutations in human cells, especially in editing windows where there is A mutation with safety risk.

When PAM was further expanded from NGG to NG, the number of precise disease treatment events was further expanded to 17722, suggesting that ABE10 have great potential in precisely targeting specific base for future clinical gene therapy. Finally, ABE10 can be used to precisely target YA motif to generate animal models with disease phenotypes and to treat hypercholesterolemia without off-target events.</p><p id="P16">In summary, ABE10 is a highly efficient and specific base editing tool, which have great potential in animal model making and disease gene therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods" specific-use="print-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="P17">The research was conducted in accordance with all relevant ethical regulations.
