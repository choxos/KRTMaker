Despite this commonality, synucleinopathies display divergent disease phenotypes that have been attributed to disease specific three-dimensional structures of <italic>α</italic>-synuclein fibrils, each with a unique toxic gain-of-function profile. The Hsc70 chaperone is remarkable in its ability to disassemble pre-existing amyloid fibrils of different proteins in an ATP and co-chaperone dependent manner. We find however, using six well-defined conformational polymorphs of <italic>α</italic>-synuclein fibrils, that the activity of the Hsc70 disaggregase machinery is sensitive to differences in the amyloid conformation, confirming that fibril polymorphism directly affects interactions with the proteostasis network. Amyloid conformation influences not only how efficiently fibrils are cleared by the Hsc70 machinery but also the preferred pathway of disaggregation. We further show that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the active processing of fibrils by the Hsc70 machinery inadvertently produces seeding competent species that further promote protein aggregation. Amyloid conformation thus is an important feature that can tilt the balance between beneficial or detrimental protein quality control activities in the context of disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd><kwd>polymorphism</kwd><kwd>disaggregation</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>molecular chaperones</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of amyloid-type aggregate deposits of signature proteins in patient brains. In synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA), it is the intrinsically disordered protein <italic>α</italic>-synuclein (<italic>α</italic>-syn) that aggregates into such amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Spillantini <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wakabayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).

It has been suggested that conformational differences in the amyloid structure adopted by <italic>α</italic>-syn, so called polymorphism, underlie the observed differences between synucleinopathies. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the amyloid structure found in MSA patients is distinct from that of Lewy Body diseases, DLB and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schweighauser <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The resulting differences in surface exposed residues can alter the interactions with cellular factors, leading to different modes and degrees of toxicity and spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Shahnawaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bousset <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Van der Perren <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barker &amp; Williams-Gray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Peelaerts <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hoppe <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">As guardians of cellular proteostasis, molecular chaperones play an important role in preventing and reversing protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wentink <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">De Mattos <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hipp <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The human constitutive 70kDa heat shock protein, Hsc70, and its co-chaperones, the J-domain protein DnaJB1 and the Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor, Apg2, have been shown to efficiently resolubilise preformed amyloid fibrils of <italic>α</italic>-syn, the exon 1 of Huntingtin and different isoforms of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scior <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Duennwald <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nachman <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wentink &amp; Rosenzweig, 2023</xref>). In this process, DnaJB1 identifies the amyloid fibrils as target via multivalent interactions with repeated low affinity binding sites in the flexible tails protruding from the amyloid fibrils and initiates the recruitment of Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wentink <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ayala Mariscal <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Substrate recognition by DnaJB1 is important to efficiently cluster several Hsc70s on the fibril in functional cooperation with Apg2, generating an entropic pulling force that destabilises the fibril, leading to disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Faust <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wentink <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beton <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). An important binding site for DnaJB1 in <italic>α</italic>-syn is located in the C-terminal tail, while Hsc70 binding sites are present primarily in the N-terminus of the <italic>α</italic>-syn sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Redeker <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wentink <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nury <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In the context of different polymorph structures, these distinct binding sites might be buried or sterically occluded. This raises the question if different fibrillar <italic>α</italic>-syn polymorphs show differences in susceptibility to disaggregation by the chaperone machinery.</p><p id="P4">An Hsc70 mediated disaggregation mechanism based primarily on depolymerization, by monomer extraction from fibril ends, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beton <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Franco <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, the formation of smaller fibrillar fragments during the disaggregation of <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils has also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beton <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). This mechanistic distinction is important as the extraction and accumulation of <italic>α</italic>-syn monomers is likely beneficial, whereas shorter fragments or oligomeric species produced as a result of fragmentation could constitute novel seeds for further amyloid aggregation and favour the propagation of <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology in a prion-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Marrero-Winkens <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tittelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Woerman &amp; Bartz, 2024</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> studies further highlight this ambiguity in the role of the Hsc70 chaperone machinery in synucleinopathy progression: both the overexpression and knockdown of the Hsp110 co-chaperone have been reported to protect against pathological <italic>α</italic>-syn aggregation and associated toxicity in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Taguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tittelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Knockdown of the DnaJB1 co-chaperone in reporter cell lines similarly reduced the seeding capacity of some, but not all amyloid conformations of <italic>α</italic>-syn(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tittelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Variation in chaperone mediated disaggregation kinetics and the resulting products among amyloid polymorphs may therefore contribute to the differences that are observed in disease progression and phenotypes in synucleinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">McCann <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hoppe <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tittelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we use <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregated fibrillar polymorphs of human WT <italic>α</italic>-syn to investigate how the Hsc70 disaggregase accommodates differences in amyloid structure, independent of amino acid sequence differences. These polymorphs are homogenous populations of structurally well-defined <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils with distinct features such as a rigid or flexible <italic>α</italic>-syn N-termini and differences in the periodicity of twist, fibril length, width or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gath <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bousset <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Makky <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Landureau <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Such <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregated polymorphs are therefore a suitable model to experimentally explore how the disaggregation activity of the human Hsc70 chaperone system is affected by differences in amyloid structures on a biochemical level. We find that fibril conformation profoundly alters the ability of the Hsc70 chaperone machinery to recognize the substrate and consequently disaggregate <italic>α</italic>-syn amyloid fibrils. Polymorphs that were more resistant to chaperone action were more frequently fragmented during disaggregation, producing highly seeding competent species. The presence of a specific amyloid conformation can thus fundamentally alter the ability of the cell’s quality control machinery to respond to this threat, which may have profound implications for the onset and progression of disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>α</italic>-synuclein fibrillar polymorphs show different susceptibility to disaggregation by the human Hsc70 chaperone machinery</title><p id="P6">Recombinant monomeric <italic>α</italic>-syn protein was aggregated under various buffer conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Material and Methods</xref>), resulting in five homogenous, structurally distinct amyloid polymorphs of full-length WT <italic>α</italic>-syn (FM, Ri, F65, F91 and XG) and one C-terminally truncated mutant (F110) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gath <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bousset <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Makky <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Landureau <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). To test the susceptibility of the polymorphs to chaperone action, the preformed <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils were incubated with the Hsc70 based disaggregase machinery, composed of the constitutively expressed Hsp70 family member Hsc70 (HSPA8), and two essential co-chaperones DnaJB1 and Apg2 (HSPA4/HSPH2). After 16 hours, the remaining insoluble fibrils were separated from re-solubilized <italic>α</italic>-syn by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). The sedimentation assay shows that the XG polymorph was efficiently disaggregated by the Hsc70 machinery in an ATP-dependent manner, with 40% of the total <italic>α</italic>-syn protein recovered in the soluble fraction. For the F65, FM and F91 polymorphs, 20-30% of <italic>α</italic>-syn protein was found in the supernatant, while Ri and F110 showed no release of soluble <italic>α</italic>-syn protein over the 16-hour incubation period.</p><p id="P7">We next compared the kinetics of disaggregation by time-resolved Thioflavin T (ThT)-based disaggregation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). ThT is a fluorescent dye that shows enhanced fluorescence intensity upon interaction with <italic>β</italic>-sheet rich structures such as amyloid fibrils and can therefore be used to track the dissolution of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Biancalana &amp; Koide, 2010</xref>). Since ThT shows differential reactivity to the polymorphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1B</xref>), the fluorescence intensity during disaggregation was expressed as a ratio of non-disaggregated fibril intensity (-ATP) to facilitate comparison between the polymorphs. Based on ThT intensity, both XG and F65 polymorphs were efficiently disaggregated by the Hsc70 machinery within 16 hours, with ThT intensities reduced by 55% and 65% respectively. FM and F91 fibrils showed only moderate disaggregation, with a 15-25% reduction in ThT fluorescence. The reaction kinetics of the disaggregation of the F65 fibrils were noticeably faster in the first hour (1.5 fold) than that of the XG polymorph despite reaching a similar end point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The kinetics and endpoint of disaggregation of the FM and F91 polymorphs were comparable, and slower than both XG and F65. In contrast, for ribbons (Ri) and the C-terminal truncated F110 <italic>α</italic>-syn polymorphs the ThT-signal remained constant over 16 hours, indicating resistance to disaggregation by the human Hsc70 chaperone machinery.</p><p id="P8">Overall, the six <italic>α</italic>-syn polymorphs can thus broadly be divided into three categories: efficiently disaggregated (F65, XG), moderately disaggregated (FM, F91) and resistant to disaggregation by the Hsc70 chaperone machinery (Ri, F110). Since all fibrillar polymorphs (except for F110) are composed of WT <italic>α</italic>-syn, the specific conformation of the fibrillar substrate thus directly affects the efficiency of chaperone mediated disaggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Differences in polymorph structures perturb interactions with the chaperone machinery</title><p id="P9">The differences observed in chaperone mediated disaggregation efficiencies may be explained by differences in the thermodynamic stability of the different fibril conformations, or the (in-)ability of chaperones to engage the substrate in a productive manner.</p><p id="P10"><italic>α</italic>-Syn fibrils exhibit differential stability at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ikenoue <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bousset <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), where hydrophobic interactions are weakened, thus allowing to discriminate fibril conformations based on their thermodynamic stability. The relative stability of the polymorphs, based on their persistence at cold temperatures, serves as a broad discriminator between conformations that could or could not be disaggregated by the Hsc70 machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 2A-C</xref>), with the F110 and Ri conformations both most persistent at 4 °C and resistant to chaperone mediated disaggregation. However, resistance to cold temperatures did not readily explain the differences in disaggregation efficiency observed for the F65, XG, FM and F91 polymorphs.</p><p id="P11">A stronger correlation was observed between the affinity of the co-chaperone DnaJB1 for the different <italic>α</italic>-syn polymorphs, determined by fluorescence anisotropy, and the disaggregation efficiency, with the Ri conformation as notable outlier (r = -0.97, excluding Ri) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). The affinity of the initial recognition of the amyloid substrate by DnaJB1 was found to differ up to 6-fold between <italic>α</italic>-syn fibril conformations, ranging from 200 nM to 1.5 μM. The efficiently disaggregated XG and F65 polymorphs clustered at the lower end of this range while DnaJB1 showed a reduced affinity for the more disaggregation resistant substrates FM, F91 and F110.</p><p id="P12">We next asked whether reduced recognition by DnaJB1 resulted in compromised recruitment of Hsc70 to the fibrils. Dissociation constants for DnaJB1-induced binding of Hsc70 to <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils, determined by fluorescence anisotropy, spanned one order of magnitude, ranging from 140 nM for F65 to 1.5 μM for F110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). The correlation between Hsc70 binding affinity and disaggregation activity was however less pronounced than for DnaJB1 (r = -0.88, excluding Ri). While the extremes in affinity corresponded to the fibril polymorphs most efficiently disaggregated (F65) and resistant to disaggregation (F110), Hsc70 affinity alone could not explain the differences in disaggregation efficiency between the FM and XG polymorphs.</p><p id="P13">To test whether the differences in disaggregation efficiency observed reflect simply a lower chaperone occupancy of some of the polymorphs (due to lower chaperone affinities) under our experimental conditions, the ThT based disaggregation assay was repeated with 2-fold higher concentrations of chaperones. While increasing chaperone abundance accelerated the rates of the disaggregation reactions, it did not result in a lower endpoint ThT fluorescence for any of the <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrillar polymorphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus, the resistance to disaggregation of the F110 and Ri polymorphs, or the poor performance of the Hsc70 chaperone machinery on the FM and F91 polymorphs, cannot be surpassed simply by increased chaperone abundance. Rather, the reduced chaperone affinity for these conformations appears to reflect differences in the binding mode or positioning of the chaperones, resulting in chaperone machineries that are less conducive to disaggregation.</p><p id="P14">The three-dimensional structure of the <italic>α</italic>-syn amyloid polymorphs is thus likely to alter the accessibility of preferred chaperone binding sites in <italic>α</italic>-syn, resulting in differences in chaperone affinities and assemblies that are more, or less, efficient at generating the forces required for amyloid disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wentink <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">De Los Rios <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goloubinoff &amp; De Los Rios, 2007</xref>). In other instances, such as for the Ri conformation, it is likely that the inherent stability of the amyloid fibrils prevents disaggregation even when the Hsc70 machinery can successfully engage the substrate.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Polymorph structure influences the pathway of Hsc70 mediated amyloid disaggregation</title><p id="P15">Recent studies have proposed different pathways of Hsc70 mediated disaggregation of <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Franco <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beton <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Time resolved AFM and microfluidic diffusional sizing experiments indicated that disaggregation primarily proceeds via cooperative extraction of monomers from fibrils end, resulting in bursts of depolymerization.

We hypothesize that these conflicting findings may be explained by differences in the amyloid structure of the fibrils studied. We therefore set out to characterize the reaction products formed during the disaggregation of the different <italic>α</italic>-syn amyloid conformations to document the preferred disaggregation pathway for each of the <italic>α</italic>-syn polymorphs.</p><p id="P16">Fluorescently labelled fibrils were incubated with the active chaperone machinery for 20 min, 2 hours or 16 hours and the reaction products analysed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to determine the composition of products at different timepoints of the disaggregation reaction. Introduction of the fluorophore, post aggregation, did not change the morphology or efficiency of disaggregation of the fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3A-C</xref>), and labelling efficiencies were kept purposefully low (around 5% of <italic>α</italic>-syn monomers in the fibrils) to avoid fluorescence quenching in the fibrillar state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3D</xref>). Fluorescence intensity can thus be used as a quantitative read-out for the abundance of <italic>α</italic>-syn protein in the various fractions of the sucrose density gradient.

This peak thus likely corresponds to shortened fibrils, smaller fibril fragments or oligomers produced during Hsc70 mediated disaggregation. The fluorescence signal in fractions 3-10 is reduced with increasing reaction times, with a corresponding increase in fluorescence intensity in the monomer fractions 0-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), indicating a conversion of the shortened fibrils/oligomers to monomers as the disaggregation reaction proceeds.</p><p id="P18">The polymorphs FM, XG and F91 display similar trends, with a decrease in fibril peak intensity concomitant with a rapid conversion into shorter <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrils/oligomers and monomers over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3H</xref>).

The main products of chaperone mediated disaggregation of the FM and F91 polymorphs, found in fractions 3-10, are thus likely to be fibril fragments, produced as the result of fibril fragmentation. Such fragments would retain ThT binding capacity and sediment upon centrifugation, explaining the apparent poor disaggregation efficiencies detected by previous experiments. The Hsc70 machinery can thus in fact process the FM and F91 <italic>α</italic>-syn fibrillar polymorphs efficiently but relies on a disaggregation pathway dominated by fibril fragmentation.</p><p id="P20">In contrast, the distribution of reaction products of the F65 polymorph are consistent with a disaggregation mechanism driven primarily by depolymerization of monomers from fibril ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Franco <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beton <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), with a gradual reduction in the fibrillar fraction over time and the appearance of monomers at early timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

The XG fibrils display an intermediate behaviour, with rapid processing of the initial fibril material into smaller oligomeric species followed by relatively efficient conversion to monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting a disaggregation pathway that combines depolymerisation and fragmentation.</p><p id="P21">Fibril conformation can thus alter the preferred pathway of amyloid disaggregation by the Hsc70 machinery, with depolymerization dominating the disaggregation of F65, and fragmentation contributing significantly to the disaggregation of FM and F91.

The prior disaggregation of F65 and FM fibrils for 16 hours did not reduce the seeding capacity further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This is surprising as the ATP driven disaggregation activity of Hsc70 processes 75% and 40% of the starting material, respectively, over 16 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and a corresponding drop in the seeding capacity might be expected if the residual unprocessed fibrils were the only source of seeds in these reaction mixtures.

This fraction contains a mixture of released monomers and fibril fragments primarily the result of fibril shortening by depolymerisation.
