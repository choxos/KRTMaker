We utilised a ubiquitin- activity based probe (Ub-Dha) to capture active components of the ubiquitin conjugating machinery during asexual blood-stage development. Several E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, the E1 activating enzyme, and the HECT E3 ligase PfHEUL were identified and validated through in vitro ubiquitination assays. We also demonstrate selective functional interactions between PfHEUL and a subset of both human and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> E2s. Additionally, the Ub-Dha probe captured an uncharacterized protein, PF3D7_0811400 (C0H4U0) with no known homology to ubiquitin-pathway enzymes in other organisms. Through structural and biochemical analysis, we validate it as a novel E2 enzyme, capable of binding ubiquitin in a cysteine-specific manner. These findings contribute to our understanding of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> UPS, identifying promising novel drug targets and highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of the Ub-proteasome system in this parasite.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ubiquitin is a small (8.6 kDa) post-translational protein modifier that, when conjugated to proteins, modulates their activity, fate, and localisation within the cell. The machinery that mediates ubiquitination and deubiquitination of substrates is complex, highly regulated, and functionally conserved across eukaryotes. During the blood-stage of malaria infection, the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite relies on ubiquitin-driven protein turnover to progress through its life cycle. This process ensures the timely removal of stage-specific proteins, which is essential for parasite development and survival.. Additionally, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of misfolded proteins have been shown to maintain homeostasis during heat shock induced by host fever spikes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). More recently, this modification has garnered increased attention due to its involvement in frontline drug resistance. Artemisinin causes oxidative damage to parasite proteins whose clearance is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As such, interference with the ubiquitin pathway by ways of proteasome inhibition, augments artemisinin toxicity. Exploiting this synergy could be particularly useful in the context of resistance whereby co-administering a ubiquitin pathway inhibitor could reestablish the potency of artemisinin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The groups of enzymes which constitute the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) possess specific conserved domain motifs and architectures that facilitate their function and allow for <italic>in silico</italic> identification from genomic sequences. Despite the substantial divergence between Apicomplexa and model eukaryotic organisms, there are recognisable homologs to all groups of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) enzymes in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, i.e. E1 activating, E2 conjugating, E3 ligating and deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. Two activating enzymes have been identified in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, PF3D7_1225800 is found in the cytoplasm and PF3D7_1333200 in the apicoplast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, there are 12 putative E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, 4 HECT E3 ligases, 2 types of cullin-RING ligases, 42 putative RING family E3 ligases, and 28 putative deubiquitinating enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Yet, there are approximately 1,500 proteins with unknown function and domain composition in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteome and several hundred million years of evolutionary divergence between <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and model organisms. Therefore, there are likely to be highly divergent and novel enzymes with roles in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> UPS that have not yet been identified.</p><p id="P4">Within the UPS, the points of entry (E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme) and exit (the proteasome and DUB enzymes) have been experimentally demonstrated to be essential for parasite survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the enzymes and processes between these events that confer specificity and regulation to this pathway through differential substrate recognition and ubiquitin chain formation have, to date, been largely overlooked as potential therapeutic targets. Given greater sequence and likely functional divergence of E2 and E3 enzymes between <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and the human host, the identification and characterisation of these enzymes would provide novel targets and enable species-specific therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="P5">Activity-based probes (ABPs) are biochemical tools that have been developed to delineate component interactions and interdependencies within the UPS, allowing insight into the spatiotemporal organisation and dynamics of the ubiquitin network. ABPs consist of three parts, each performing a different function: a reactive group whose chemistry allows for covalent bond formation with the desired targets’ active sites in a physiological environment; a recognition element that drives the protein-protein interaction specificity with the desired target; and a reporter tag that allows for identification of the ABP-substrate conjugate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The Ub-Dha probe demonstrates specificity to ubiquitination machinery through its requirement for ATP-mediated activation by the E1 activating enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. It achieves ubiquitination enzyme capture by either reacting natively through its C-terminal carboxyl group with the active site cysteine of a ubiquitination enzyme, or through its dehydroalanine (Dha) group which results in the formation of an irreversible thioether-linked adduct. The stochasticity of these reactions results in a cascade whereby either the Ub moiety can transverse the ubiquitination pathway by successive transthiolation reactions or at any given step can covalently trap an enzyme by 1,4-addition.</p><p id="P7">Here, we interrogate the active ubiquitin machinery of asexual, erythrocytic stage <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> using a Ub-Dha activity-based probe (ABP) for protein capture, enrichment, and identification by mass spectrometry. We identify the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> E1, several E2 enzymes, a HECT E3 ligase, and a highly enriched unknown protein. We validate these enzymes as bona fide UPS components and determine which E2s serve as functional partners of the identified HECT, PfHEUL, an enzyme that has been implicated in parasite virulence in mouse model systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.

These bands may represent degradation products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Functional validation of the E2 enzymes was achieved through in vitro ubiquitination assay in the presence of ATP, HA-tagged ubiquitin, and the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ubiquitin activating enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The banding pattern resulting from protein conjugation was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualised by western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This phenomenon has been observed with characterised human E2 enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. This banding pattern can arise through the multi-monoubiquitination of the E2 enzymes, the extension of a monoubiquitinated site to a polyubiquitin chain, or a combination of both. PF3D7_092100, which demonstrated the most distinct ubiquitin conjugate pattern, possesses only 8 lysine residues, and therefore the &gt;10 bands visible at approximate 10 kDa distance must include polyubiquitin chain linkages. Although, the same is not necessarily true for PF3D7_1033900 and PF3D7_1356300 which contain 14 and 20 lysine residues, respectively. A band consistent with free di-ubiquitin (approx. 17 kDa) was also observed except in the case of PF3D7_0527100. This is suggestive of the formation of a polyubiquitin chain linkage at the catalytic cysteine of the PfE2 enzymes which was subsequently released. Conjugation to PF3D7_0527100 was limited to two bands of sizes amounting to approximately the enzyme plus 1 and 2 ubiquitin modifiers, which may indicate the inability of this enzyme to undergo polyubiquitin chain formation.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>PfHEUL HECT domain functions with a subset of human and P. falciparum E2 enzymes</title><p id="P31">The essential ligase PfHEUL was also identified as part of the Ub-Dha screen, under the statistically significant threshold, but demonstrating its presence and functionality during the asexual life cycle stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The sequence of this protein was submitted to bioinformatic analysis by HMMER and BLAST to investigate its function through domain architecture and identification of homologs in model organisms. Owing to the large size of PfHEUL (8591 amino acids, approximately 1 MDa), HMM searches were performed on the N-terminal and C-terminal halves separately. The C-terminal search identified the HECT domain, while the N-terminal search identified a domain of unknown function 908 (DUF908) between residues 176-478. Known DUF908 and HECT domain containing proteins include the homologous HUWE1 E3 ligase (a.k.a. MULE, ARF- BP1, Lasu1, HECTH9) in humans, UPL1/2 in plants, and TOM1 in yeast.

Human E1 and E2 enzymes were mixed with PfHEUL HECT as indicated and incubated at 25 C for 1 hour, in the presence of ATP. Following co-incubation, SDS-PAGE and western blot showed human UBE2D1, UBE2D2, UBE2D3, and UBE2L3 transferred ubiquitin to the PfHEUL (PF3D7_0826100) HECT domain. This was evidenced by banding patterns of approximate 9 kDa spacing which represented the conjugation of multiple ubiquitin proteins onto the HECT domain itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The expression and purification procedures for this mutant protein were identical to the wild type protein. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to assess the folded state of the mutant protein relative to the wild type. The acquired spectra were averaged across five measurements, and the resultant curve was smoothed and normalised by protein concentration.

In catalytically active E2s, the active site generally contains an acidic residue, usually aspartate, or a phosphorylatable serine, known as the conserved E2 serine/aspartate (CES/D) site. Together with the catalytic cysteine and the His-Pro-Asn (HPN) motif, this CES/D motif forms a defining fingerprint of the E2 superfamily, crucial to their role in the ubiquitination cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. For instance, in the human E2, Ube2I, key residues such as Asn85 of the HPN motif, along with Tyr87 and Asp127, are essential for lowering the pKa of substrate lysine, facilitating its nucleophilic attack on the E2Ub thioester bond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. While active E2s are regulated by phosphorylation at their catalytic site, inactive members, like UEVs, lack this conserved catalytic cysteine. However, families 5 and 13, classified as Noncanonical Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzymes (NCUBE), show unique structural reorganisations around the catalytic cleft and do not consistently maintain the HPN motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">In our study, we identified a novel active E2 enzyme that lacks the HPN motif, the CES/D site, and other typical E2 features, making it unlike any E2 characterised to date.

Although the presence of a catalytic cysteine has been reported in a few DUF containing proteins such as DUF62<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, its presence within the DUF2009 domain is unprecedented and could provide new insights into E2 enzyme function, suggesting that similar E2s may exist in other organisms. This discovery also marks the first identification of an entire active site within a DUF2009 domain, opening avenues for further study of this protein family. From an evolutionary perspective, the high similarity of Pf3D7_0811400’s DUF2009 domain in many B-box proteins, particularly in certain fungal parasites, suggests that the active site within this domain has been evolutionarily conserved. In contrast, the protein-protein interaction site at the N-terminus appears to have undergone significant evolutionary shifts. It has likely transitioned from a metal-binding B-box domain to coiled helices as an interaction interface, adapting the protein’s function to meet the specific requirements of the parasite under natural selection pressures. This highlights the evolutionary flexibility of E2 enzymes, enabling them to respond to environmental and functional demands.</p><p id="P52">The results detailed in this study demonstrate the applicability of ubiquitin probes for the identification and study of (de)ubiquitination machinery in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.
