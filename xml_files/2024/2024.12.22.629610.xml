Characterizing early B cell differentiation stages after antigen encounter is thus crucial to target and prevent unwanted antibody formation. Here, we unravelled in-depth antigen-specific B cell responses longitudinally after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in healthy individuals using multiparameter spectral flow cytometry. The early antigen-specific B cell response was dominated by spike-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> activated B cells (ActBCs), previously assigned as germinal center-derived and DN2 extrafollicular B cells. Within the early IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC compartment, six distinct clusters were identified with specific contraction dynamics, whereby some of these clusters were more closely related to pre-ASCs and others more to long-lived MBCs. Some of the highly contracting ActBC clusters expressed CD11c, a marker previously used to define atypical B cells. The transient presence of different ActBC clusters could also be observed in total B cells when gated in an antigen-independent manner. Our results thus delineate the early stages of the antigen-specific B cell response, with a further dissection of the CD71<sup>+</sup> ActBC compartment. Detection of ActBC clusters early after antigen encounter in total B cells opens avenues for future evaluation of their potential to serve as a proxy for antigen-reactive B cells in autoimmunity or other unwanted B cell responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>B cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>CD11c<sup>+</sup> Activated B cells</kwd><kwd>mRNA vaccination</kwd><kwd>immunological memory</kwd><kwd>germinal center</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Vaccination is an important strategy to battle infectious diseases by inducing long-lasting cellular and humoral immune responses. Antibodies protect against new and recurring pathogens and are generated by antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) induced by <italic>de novo</italic> naïve B cell differentiation or upon reactivation of memory B cells (MBCs). Both T cell-independent or T cell-dependent B cell differentiation routes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Unfortunately, antibody responses can also be detrimental in the context of autoimmunity, alloimmunization or reactivity against therapeutic biologics. Once established, long-lived ASCs and MBCs are difficult to eradicate. Therefore, identification of ASC and MBC precursors is warranted and knowledge on their differentiation status is much desired to design strategies to optimize vaccination responses or, conversely prevent unwanted antibody formation.</p><p id="P5">Upon primary vaccination, a first rapid antibody response is induced. The extrafollicular (EF) pathway is a fast response that leads to formation of short-lived plasmablasts (PBs) and early MBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Besides this EF response, germinal centers (GC) are formed in secondary lymphoid organs where antigen-stimulated B cells proliferate and undergo class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the dark zone and repeatedly cycle to the light zone, reencounter antigen and receive renewed T cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This eventually allows for selection of B cells with improved BCR affinity for the antigen and leads to generation of long-lived MBCs and ASCs. From the latter, long-lived plasma cells (PCs) are established upon migration to the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Using high-output techniques, recent studies have identified diverse subphenotypes of circulatory MBCs based on different surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, to what extent these different phenotypes share developmental trajectories or reflect different subfunctions, especially in the context of vaccination responses, requires further in-depth research. In addition, the exact decision point and B cell stage in which bifurcation between MBC or ASC phenotype occurs remains to be elucidated. Recent studies into this subject have investigated activated B cells (ActBCs), a population of antigen-specific B cells leaving the GC, which are phenotypically and functionally different from ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Ellebedy and colleagues identified CD71 as a marker for recently activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Lau and colleagues defined low expression of CD21 as a marker of CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells that recently emigrated from the GC and are potential PC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). So-called ActBCs peak in circulation shortly after immunization or infection and drop again over time, while at the same time circulating MBCs start to expand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Based on their phenotypic definition, we recently reported that ActBCs may exhibit diverse fates with some feeding the resting MBC compartment and others sustaining the long-lived ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Both classical ASC and MBC subsets have been widely studied in context of vaccination and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, a deeper understanding and characterization of the ActBC compartment is lacking and much needed to monitor early stages of B cell differentiation after antigen exposure and to interfere with it before ASC and MBC formation has occurred in cases of unwanted B cell responses.</p><p id="P6">In recent years, the EF B cell response has acquired more attention, with a specific focus on Tbet<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD21<sup>-/lo</sup> cells, commonly referred to as atypical B cells, in the context of autoimmunity, chronic infections or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The heterogeneous nature of this population and its contribution to both normal and aberrant immune responses have led to inconsistencies in its classification and nomenclature. CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells are mainly categorized by presence or absence of CD27 expression: IgD<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> ‘activated-naïve’ B cells and IgD<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> ‘double-negative 2’ B cells (DN2), identified as part of the EF response, and CD27<sup>+</sup> ‘age-associated B cells’ (ABCs), which formation also remains unclear as they could have an EF origin or be GC-derived an acquire CD11c upon reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Both populations, DN2 and ABCs, are thought to be poised for ASC differentiation, although their specific role and contribution within the B cell differentiation process remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Although Tbet<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD21<sup>-/lo</sup> B cells comprise only a small part of the total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell compartment, this population expands vastly after vaccination in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We recently reported DN2 and ABCs to be among the early B cell responding populations after antigen exposure and even to be main contributors to the S (Spike)-specific response seven days after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination while contracting over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). It remains to be established how CD27<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD21<sup>-/lo</sup> B cells and IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs relate to each other and to MBCs versus PC formation.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we performed in-depth characterization of antigen-specific B cells to investigate the dynamics and early stages of human B cell differentiation in COVID-19 naïve individuals after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccination. We studied the kinetics of S- and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific B cell populations and compared this to antigen-specific Influenza hemagglutinin (Influenza-HA), fusion glycoprotein from Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV-F) and Tetanus Toxoid (TT) B cell populations which were encountered longer ago. ActBCs and EF B cells could be identified early after vaccination followed by establishment of resting MBCs six months after antigen exposure. Overall, several distinct ActBC phenotypes were identified, characterized by two clear dynamics: a pronounced and significant contraction between day seven and six months post-vaccination in contrast to clusters showing no significant contraction and more inter-donor variation in contraction dynamics. Remarkably, a major proportion of the highly dynamic ActBC clusters expressed CD11c, which underlines that the distinction between EF and GC-derived B cells remains to be redefined. The dynamic IgG<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters were identified in total CD19<sup>+</sup>B cells without the use of antigen probes shortly after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="P8">This study is part of a prospective observational cohort study in the Netherlands, called the Target-to-B!

Of note, during the period of sampling, influenza and RSV infections were uncommon due to lockdown and TT (DTP) revaccination was unlikely due to travel restrictions. S- and RBD-specific B cells made up on average 0.4% and 0.1% of total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, respectively, at day seven and remained constant up to six months following vaccination, albeit with a declining trend for RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B-C</xref>). Over time, an increase in S/RBD ratio was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), indicating a shift of the SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell receptor repertoire over time towards non-RBD epitopes, in line with previously reports by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To capture the phenotypic complexity of the antigen-specific B cell response, uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction was used to visualize all SARS-CoV-2 (S, RBD) and other (TT, RSV-F, HA) antigen-specific CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, and subsequently FlowSOM clustering was performed on a selection of core markers (CD20, CD21, CD27, CD138, CD38, CD24, CD45RB, CD11c, IgM, IgA, IgG, IgD) on all antigen-specific B cells. Clustering analysis revealed 38 distinct clusters that could be manually grouped into 16 overarching B cell populations, or metaclusters, based on expression of 25 surface markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). Among the 16 main populations, transitional B cells, naïve B cells, MBCs, ActBCs and ASCs were identified. The naïve compartment (IgD<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>), as visualized in the UMAP, contained two different populations based on CD45RB and CD73 expression. Of note, the naïve compartment is not truly naïve and could be better defined as antigen-reactive. Adjacent to the naïve B cells in the UMAP, IgD/IgM<sup>+</sup> MBCs and ActBCs (CD27<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup>) were identified. The upper area of the UMAP depicts the IgG compartment, including IgG<sup>+</sup> MBCs, ActBCs (CD27<sup>+/lo</sup> CD38<sup>lo</sup> CD21<sup>lo</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>hi</sup>), IgG<sup>+</sup> DN2 (IgD<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>), and IgG<sup>+</sup> DN3 (IgD<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup>) B cell populations. Additionally, MBCs, ActBCs and DN2 populations were also observed for the IgA isotype. Lastly, the ASC compartment, annotated based on low CD19 and CD20 and high CD38 expression, represented all three BCR isotypes. Seven days after second vaccination, the majority of the S- and RBD-specific B cell response comprised of IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs, followed by IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> ASCs and IgG<sup>+</sup> DN2. After six months, IgG<sup>+</sup> MBCs dominated the S- and RBD-specific B cell response while ActBCs, DN2 and ASCs had contracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F-G</xref>). Given the fragility of ASCs and since frozen cells were used, it is likely that we underestimated the frequency of the ASC compartment, although we were able to identify eight different clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The IgG<sup>+</sup> ASCs consisted of PCs (CD27<sup>hi</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup>), PBs (CD27<sup>hi</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup>) and early PBs (CD27<sup>lo</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup>) clusters, with IgG<sup>+</sup> PB as the most abundant cluster. All clusters demonstrated similar dynamics of expansion early after vaccination and contraction six months after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, a minor IgG<sup>+</sup> CD20<sup>+/int</sup> CXCR4<sup>+</sup> CD30<sup>+</sup> cluster 36 was identified. Similar to pre-plasmablast clusters, cluster 36 was CD38<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>lo</sup> and had high CD269 expression, but was unique in high CD30 and intermediate CD20 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Together, these data show that the ActBC, DN2 and ASC compartments dominated the antigen-specific response seven days after second vaccination and contract six months after, while the MBC compartment is dominant six months after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Classical memory B cells can be subphenotyped beyond CD27 expression using CD21, CD73 and CD45RB</title><p id="P18">To further explore the dynamics and phenotypic relationships of S-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells after vaccination, the IgG<sup>+</sup> B cell compartment was further investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This compartment consists of classical MBCs, ActBCs and DN B cells. Classical IgG<sup>+</sup> MBCs are generally defined as CD27<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>-</sup> B cells. However, in our clustering, the absence of CD38 and CD71, reflecting a non-activated phenotype, were the main discriminative markers as CD27 showed an intermediate expression. Among classical MBCs, three different clusters (cluster 12, 13 and 14) could be distinguished based on unique dynamic frequencies over time. Cluster 12 and 13 dominated the S-specific response six months after second vaccination, while cluster 14 expanded less between day seven and six months after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). We further analysed these different memory phenotypes in the HA-, TT- and RSV-F-specific B cell compartments, which have been established months to years ago. Cluster 13 dominated the HA-, TT- and RSV-F-specific B cell compartment, while cluster 12 and 14 were only marginally present, suggesting that cluster 13 is the most long-lived resting MBC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Cluster 13 expresses CD21, CD45RB and also a vast majority of the cells expresses CD73, in line with previous observations by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). CD73 is a marker for metabolic quiescence in resting MBCs, which further substantiates cluster 13 long-lived characteristic. Regarding CD45RB, in our data, it does not show a significant discriminative power between two branches of MBCs as it has been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Although cluster 12 showed a similar resting dynamic as cluster 13 and both clusters were CD21<sup>+</sup>, cluster 12 expressed low levels of CD27, CD73 and CD45RB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, since cluster 12 was not dominant in the TT-, HA- and RSV-F-specific compartment, this cluster appears less long-lived compared to cluster 13. Alternatively, cluster 12 could be a specific MBC phenotype for vaccination responses. Lastly, cluster 14 was CD45RB<sup>+</sup>but CD73<sup>-</sup> and displayed a more activated phenotype, concomitant with low CD21 expression. This phenotype in combination with less profound expansion between days seven and six months after vaccination compared to cluster 12 and 13, suggests that cluster 14 may be a more intermediate population between ActBCs and MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To conclude, expression of CD73, CD21 and CD45RB defines the most long-lived resting MBC compartment (cluster 13). Cluster 12 and 14 are dynamically and phenotypically related to these cells, but exhibit reduced longevity as they are much less present long after antigen exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>The IgG Activated B cell compartment is a heterogeneous population with diverse dynamics similar to both DN B cells and the MBC compartment</title><p id="P20">Considering the enrichment of the S-specific B compartment with IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and DN B cells early after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), we looked deeper into the phenotype and dynamics of these compartments following vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The overall IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC compartment was defined based on CD27 and high CD71 expression and low expression of CD21 and CD38, whereas DN B cells were characterized by lack of CD27, CD21 and IgD. FlowSOM clustering identified six different IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters (cluster 22 and 27), based on differences in CD45RB, CD24 and CD11c expression, reflecting a high level of heterogeneity in this compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Additionally, clustering revealed three different DN clusters distinguished by CD11c and CD24 expression, two defined as IgG<sup>+</sup> DN2 (cluster 29 and 30) and one IgG<sup>+</sup> DN3 (cluster 28) population. ActBC clusters 25, 27 and 22, although prominently present seven days after second vaccination, contracted almost completely six months after, indicative of an early, activated phenotype that is not maintained over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). ActBC cluster 26 also contracted over time, but less significantly. Remarkably, cluster 25 and 27 expressed CD11c, defining an antigen-specific ActBC population co-expressing CD71 and CD11c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). IgG<sup>+</sup> DN2, which also express CD11c but lack CD27 and CD21 expression, displayed similar dynamics over time following vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, ActBC cluster 22 expressed low levels of CD27 and was located closely to the DN B cells in the UMAP. On the other hand, ActBC clusters 23 and 24 did not contract significantly over time, with even expansion of these clusters in some individuals, reflecting strong inter-donor variation, between day seven and month six after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Fitting with the less contracting profile over time, cluster 23 was located closely to the long-lived MBC compartment in the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, cluster 23 moderately expressed CD21, indicative of an intermediate phenotype between ActBCs and MBCs, as also previously suggested for cluster 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, CD24, a marker recently described by our group to be expressed on activated MBCs in their trajectory to become resting MBCs, was expressed in the more dynamic cluster 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). IgG<sup>+</sup> DN3 B cells, which resemble DN2 in their CD27- CD21- phenotype but lack CD11c expression, were less dynamic over time and were located near both, dynamically active ActBCs but also near the more stable ActBC cluster 24 and the pre-PB cluster 36 in the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, both cluster 24 and the DN3 showed less CD20 expression than other B cell populations. Collectively, these findings suggest that IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and DN B cells show a partial phenotypic overlap and are established early after antigen exposure, while quickly contracting in peripheral blood over time.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Activated B cell heterogeneity is also evident for B cells expressing IgM or IgA</title><p id="P21">To further understand the activation profile of the antigen-specific B cell compartment after vaccination, we investigated whether the activation markers identified for the IgG<sup>+</sup> B cell compartment were also indicative of IgA<sup>+</sup> or IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell activation. Overall, as expected, IgA<sup>+</sup> B cells were less abundant than IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells in the S-specific response following vaccination, but were similar in phenotype and dynamic behavior. The IgA<sup>+</sup> B cell compartment included MBCs, ActBCs and DN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). FlowSOM clustering identified two IgA<sup>+</sup> MBC clusters (cluster 9 and 10), which were mainly present later in the vaccination response. Similar to IgG<sup>+</sup> MBC cluster 13, IgA<sup>+</sup> MBC cluster 10 exhibited a CD21<sup>+</sup> CD73<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup> phenotype, corresponding with the long-lasting MBC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, two IgA<sup>+</sup> ActBCs clusters (cluster 15 and 16) were identified. Both clusters peaked at day seven and contracted six months later, but differed phenotypically in CD45RB, CD24 and CD11c expression. IgA<sup>+</sup> cluster 15 was CD45RB<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup>, which phenotypically resembled cluster 23 in the IgG compartment. However, this cluster was short-lived as opposed to cluster 23. IgA<sup>+</sup> cluster 16 was with CD45RB<sup>-</sup> CD24<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> expression phenotypically similar to IgG <sup>+</sup> cluster 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>), indicating that both IgG <sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> ActBCs can concomitantly express CD71 and CD11c.</p><p id="P22">In addition to IgA, we identified three IgD<sup>+</sup> and/or IgM<sup>+</sup> CD21- CD27- B cell clusters, located next to the naïve compartment but displaying similar dynamics to IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and DN2 B cells: high induction at day seven and contraction at six months. The three clusters additionally expressed CD24 (cluster 19), CD71 (cluster 20) or CD11c (cluster 21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref>).

For many B cell-mediated diseases, the (auto)antigen is unknown, but tracking the active B cell response is of great importance to assess disease activity, as a marker of relapse and treatment efficacy. We have previously shown by manual gating that around 20% of S-specific B cells were CD27<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Therefore, we investigated if the unique phenotypic profiles of highly dynamic ActBC populations could also be employed to track active B cell responses in total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, without the need of antigen labelling. We focused on the transient ActBC clusters 22, 25, 26 and 27 together to track the early B cell response after vaccination. Total ActBCs were manually gated from bulk CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells by selecting for IgG<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+/lo</sup> CD38<sup>lo</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We were able to identify a significant expansion of IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs at day seven after second vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). To further explore this compartment, we first gated on CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>+/-</sup> and CD11c<sup>lo</sup> CD24<sup>-</sup> to be able to detect the transient dynamic observed for clusters 25, 26 and 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that the highly dynamic ActBC subpopulations were expanded at day seven after second vaccination and also significantly reduced six months after, indicating that this combination of markers can be used to detect activated B cell responses without the use of antigen-specific probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Cluster 22 also showed a transient dynamic after vaccination, so we then gated on CD27<sup>lo</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and also confirmed this dynamic of early expansion and significant contraction between day seven and six months after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>). Approximately, 38% of the IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC expansion seven days after second vaccination was S-specific compared to 0.2% at baseline and 11% six months after vaccination, indeed showing that shortly after exposure the ActBC compartment is enriched for B cells specific for the recently encountered antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Overall, our findings reveal deeper insights into the transient phenotypes of ActBC compartment. Within this compartment, we identified, in total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, four distinct clusters that expand early and rapidly contract over time based on the marker combination of CD11c, CD24, CD45RB and CD27. These clusters represent the most promising candidates for tracking autoreactive B cells, highlighting their critical role in early immune responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Although recent advances have been made in characterizing the phenotypic diversity of the different B cell stages following antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), better insights in the different populations that occur early after antigen exposure in the immune response will support further understanding, monitoring and possible intervention in the B cell response differentiation. In this study, we have built a comprehensive and dynamic atlas of B cell populations present at different stages during an active immune response by performing deep immune profiling of antigen-specific B cells in a longitudinal cohort study following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in healthy individuals. We have demonstrated a higher level of complexity of the antigen-specific B cell responses than was previously acknowledged, specifically within the early arising ActBC compartment where we identified six ActBCs phenotypes, including CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> ActBCs. Furthermore, examining these populations at both an early and later timepoint after vaccination allowed us to investigate their dynamics over time, providing a deeper understanding of their contribution to an active B cell response after antigen encounter.</p><p id="P27">Classical CD27<sup>+</sup> MBCs are the B cells generically used to measure the size of the memory B cell compartment after antigen-experience. They are generally defined as a homogenous population of long-lived antigen-experienced B cells. Recent advances have been made, however, driven by high-throughput approaches, in defining different subphenotypes of circulatory MBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Characterizing the different MBC subphenotypes and their longevity holds great value, especially for optimizing vaccination responses and for detecting undesired MBC responses as in the context of autoimmunity. Both S-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup> CD73<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup> MBCs were present most prominently six months following vaccination. In addition, it was the most dominant IgG<sup>+</sup> B cell cluster observed for HA-, TT- and RSV-F-specific antigens that were encountered longer ago in our cohort at this time of sampling. This suggests that the CD21<sup>+</sup> CD73<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup> marker combination for CD27<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sup>+</sup> MBCs characterize a truly long-lived resting MBC compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). MBCs expressing CD45RB, CD73 and CD95 have recently been defined as the most ‘advanced’ naïve-distal MBC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Functionally, CD73 is used as a marker for metabolic quiescence in naïve B cells and might be relevant for long-lived properties of resting MBCs in circulation as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Our data also showed CD27<sup>lo</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup>CD73<sup>-</sup> CD45RB<sup>-</sup> MBCs to be strongly expanded six months after vaccination, however they did not contribute to the long-lasting memory compartment of previously encountered antigens. This cluster resembles CD27<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>+</sup> resting MBCs observed by others one year after Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), and may reflect a more immature, less long-lived MBC population. Lastly, the smallest observed MBC population (CD21<sup>-</sup> CD73<sup>-</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup>, cluster 14) might resemble the naïve-proximal MBC population also described by McGrath and colleagues given its expression of CD45RB and absence of CD73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, the low expression of CD21, together with a less profound expansion between day seven and six months after vaccination, suggests a more complex phenotype and may indicate that this cluster is an intermediate population between ActBCs and MBCs. Together, our data and that of others show that the CD21<sup>+</sup> CD73<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>+</sup> marker combination, seems to be the phenotype that marks long-lived IgG<sup>+</sup> MBCs.</p><p id="P28">Upon identification of the early B cell compartment, we found that IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs dominated the S-specific response, together with ASCs and DN2 (CD27<sup>-</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>) at day seven after vaccination, consistent with findings reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). ActBCs have been identified as GC-experienced B cells, which are present early after antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Inconsistencies between different studies in defining and naming ActBCs has made comparisons between populations challenging, ActBCs are generally defined as CD27<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>-</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), while others refer to them as activated MBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Here, we defined the ActBC compartment as CD27<sup>+/lo</sup> CD38<sup>lo</sup> CD21<sup>lo</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>hi</sup> B cells, combining absence of CD21 with expression of CD71 and CD95 as also employed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). From this definition and from our clustering analysis, CD71 was the best discriminative marker to capture the ActBC compartment. ASCs also express CD71, but this compartment can be discriminated by being CD19<sup>-/lo</sup> and no longer in B cell stage. Notably, we found that the ActBC compartment was CD38<sup>lo</sup> while others define it as CD38<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This likely can be explained by the fact that these studies looked at the relative CD38 expression within the B cells, excluding the CD38<sup>hi</sup> ASCs. In our study, all CD38hi CD71<sup>+</sup> were confined to the ASC compartment.</p><p id="P29">Deep profiling of the IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC compartment allowed us to subdivide it into six clusters based on differential expression of certain markers and distinct dynamics, together providing a higher resolution of the ActBC compartment. The six clusters could dynamically be divided in two groups, with both groups arising early after antigen exposure, but one group contracting faster than the other in the long term. Clusters 23 and 24 arose early after antigen encounter, but did not contract in all individuals over time. It is tempting to speculate that the prolonged presence of these clusters six months after vaccination may suggest that they were induced during a longer period in GC-reactions, in line with the persistent GC after mRNA vaccination and the suggested GC-experienced nature of IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The early arising ActBC clusters 22, 25, 26 and 27 contracted between day seven and month six after vaccination One of our most striking findings was co-expression of CD71 and CD11c in the IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters 25 and 27. Indeed, our previous findings revealed by manual gating that around 20% of S-specific B cells were CD11c-expressing CD27<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>-</sup> B cells, referred to as age-associated (atypical) B cells, seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, while CD71 expression was not regarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). IgG<sup>+</sup> DN2, which lack CD27 and CD21 expression but express CD11c, also arose early and contracted to pre-vaccination levels six months after vaccination. DN2 are thought to be part of the EF B cell response and have been extensively studied in the context of chronic infections and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Current unsupervised analysis and previous manual gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) indicate that besides ActBCs, DN2 cells are also a relevant antigen-specific compartment of the active vaccination response. The similar dynamics of the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ActBCs with DN2 and the finding that they contract more in comparison to the other ActBC (clusters 23, 24) populations, may indicate that CD11c<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and DN2 could share an EF origin. However, the similar dynamics in contraction with the CD11c<sup>-</sup> ActBC cluster 22 does not support that hypothesis. This unclarity is underscored by a recent study showing plasticity between human CD21<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> resting and CD21<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> activated MBCs and DN2 (CD21<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup>) during SARS-CoV-2 recall response, also revealing clonality relationships between the different MBC subsets and DN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Future analysis of the level of SHM and clonal relationship will shed light in the relatedness of these populations. All in all, the position of CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters in EF- or GC-derived B cell differentiation remains to be elucidated by further research. Future analysis of the level of SHM and clonal relationships between these clusters and the long-lived MBCs are needed to define how these populations relate to each other and which clusters are precursor stages of GC-derived long-lived MBC.</p><p id="P31">In addition to investigating the relationships between ActBCs, long-lived MBCs and EF B cells, several studies have aimed to address whether certain subsets of ActBCs contribute to the resting MBC pool or are poised for transition to ASC lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In our data, in the ASC compartment, cluster 36 might represent a pre-ASC B cell stage, as it still expressed CD20 and was located in a phenotypic continuum between IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBCs and IgG<sup>+</sup> ASCs in the UMAP. In addition, this cluster was high in CD30 expression, in line with recent assignments of CD30 expression to a pre-plasmablast GC-derived populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). It is important to highlight that cluster 36 is in a phenotypic continuum with the DN3 cluster and the IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC cluster 24. As these clusters have lower expression of CD20 compared to the other ActBCs, they may represent good candidates predisposed for ASC differentiation. Further research on isolated subsets involving scRNAseq and analyses of clonal evolution over time are needed to identify the decision point between MBCs and ASCs.</p><p id="P32">Finally, our data demonstrate that an increase in transient IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters early after antigen exposure can be detected in the total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell compartment by gating on IgG<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+/lo</sup> CD38<sup>lo</sup> CD21<sup>-</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> B cells in combination with CD11c, CD24 and CD45RB. Detection of early activated B cells, correlating with recent antigen exposure, without the use of antigen-specific probes offers the potential to monitor recently activated B cells with unknown antigen specificity. For many detrimental B cell responses, for instance in the context of autoimmunity, the autoantigens that drive the B cell response are unknown. This hampers investigation and identification of the autoreactive B cell compartments. Consequently, monitoring of the autoreactive B cell compartment before therapy and effects of therapy on this compartment cannot be executed. As the right gating strategy now allows the identification of transient IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters in total B cells, it now becomes feasible to assess if these clusters can be used as a proxy for autoreactive B cells having recently encountered auto-antigen, for instance in the case of autoimmune diseases of acute onset like myasthenia gravis or encephalomyelitis. Next steps would be to assess if effective therapy would diminish the size of this compartment and if so, if the specific transient IgG<sup>+</sup> ActBC clusters would also have potential to identify patients prone to relapses before onset of actual clinical symptoms.</p><p id="P33">To conclude, this study provides a detailed and dynamic map of the antigen-specific B cell compartment after antigen exposure. The revelation of different ActBCs clusters with different phenotypes and contraction dynamics, brings us closer to understanding B cell differentiation trajectories towards either MBCs or ASCs. The possibility of tracking an active immune response without the use of antigen labeling offers new opportunities to explore early B cell differentiation in response to unknown antigens as in the context of autoimmune diseases. This information lays the framework for future research on identifying factors regulating human B cell differentiation. Further investigation of the ActBC compartment may allow identification of long-lived ASC or MBC precursors that could be potentially targeted in the context of unwanted antibody formation or for improving vaccination strategies against existing and emerging pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS202320-supplement-Supplementary_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS202320-supplement-Supplementary_figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary tables 1_2_3</label><media xlink:href="EMS202320-supplement-Supplementary_tables_1_2_3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d38aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS202320-supplement-Supplementary_Legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all donors who participated in the study, the Sanquin COVID-19 cryo and biobank facility for processing of samples.
