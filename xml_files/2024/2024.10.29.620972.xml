Mechanisms driving the formation of this pathology and relationship with SNc dopamine neuron health, are yet to be fully understood. We applied proteomic mass spectrometry and synchrotron-based biometal quantification to post-mortem brain tissues from the SNc of Parkinson disease patients and age-matched controls to uncover key factors underlying the formation of wild-type SOD1 pathology in this disorder. We then engineered brain copper deficiency and upregulated SOD1 protein levels in a novel mouse strain, termed the SOCK mouse, to verify their involvement in the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and their impact on dopamine neuron health. Soluble SOD1 protein in the degenerating Parkinson disease SNc exhibited altered post-translational modifications, which may underlie changes to the enzymatic activity and aggregation of the protein in this region. These include decreased copper binding, dysregulation of physiological glycosylation, and atypical oxidation and glycation of key SOD1 amino acid residues. We demonstrated that the biochemical profile introduced in SOCK mice promotes the same post-translational modifications and the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology in the midbrain and cortex. This pathology accumulates progressively with age and is accompanied by nigrostriatal degeneration and dysfunction, which occur in the absence of Œ±-synuclein deposition. These mice do not exhibit weight loss nor spinal cord motor neuron degeneration, distinguishing them from transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse models. This study provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that mismetallation and altered post-translational modifications precipitates wild-type SOD1 misfolding, dysfunction and deposition in the Parkinson disease brain, which may contribute to SNc dopamine neuron degeneration. Our data position this pathology as a novel drug target for this disorder, with a particular focus on therapies capable of correcting alterations to SOD1 post-translational modifications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>Superoxide dismutase 1</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>Parkinson disease</kwd><kwd>copper deficiency</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>substantia nigra pars compacta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Parkinson disease is the fastest growing neurological disorder worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], with a global prevalence of over 8 million individuals that is expected to double by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The availability of disease-modifying treatments will be critical to effectively manage this disorder, however to date, no such interventions have been approved for clinical use. Movement dysfunction in Parkinson disease primarily results from the progressive death of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which is thought to result from a complex confluence of molecular changes. Amongst these, the abnormal misfolding and deposition of key cellular proteins represents a driving factor, with atypical Œ±-synuclein protein constituting a focal point in the search for protein-based biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and disease-modifying therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. However, despite a clear role for Œ±-synuclein in Parkinson disease, deposition of Œ±-synuclein is not present in all Parkinson disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], nor is it restricted to degenerating brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. It is therefore likely that additional deleterious molecular pathways contribute to the selective vulnerability of SNc dopamine neurons in this disorder, suggesting exploration of complementary disease targets and approaches is required.</p><p id="P4">Our group discovered the accumulation of structurally-disordered, immature forms of another protein, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), in post-mortem brain tissues from idiopathic Parkinson disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. These alterations are not associated with <italic>SOD1</italic> gene mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], unlike well-documented mutant SOD1 pathology underlying neurodegeneration in rare inherited forms of another neurological disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Wild-type disordered (dis)SOD1 is reported to compromise neuron health <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and is restricted to degenerating regions of the Parkinson disease brain, including the SNc, where it is found during the earliest (pre-clinical) stages of this disorder when cell death is most rapid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Collectively, these findings indicate that wild-type disSOD1 protein may be associated with the selective death of SNc dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease. Here we characterize atypical molecular changes in SOD1 in the human Parkinson disease brain and demonstrate that the development of wild-type disSOD1 in the SNc results in progressive age-dependent dopamine neuron death in a novel mouse model expressing this pathology. Our data suggest the development of disSOD1 in the SNc plays a role in Parkinson disease etiology and may represent a novel drug target for modifying the course of Parkinson disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Post-translational modification of SOD1 is altered specifically in the degenerating Parkinson disease SNc</title><p id="P5">Superoxide dismutase 1 is a ubiquitously-expressed antioxidant protein that is responsible for detoxifying damaging superoxide radicals produced by mitochondrial respiration and other essential cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Nascent, unfolded human SOD1 is structurally disordered and lacks antioxidant activity, while mature SOD1 constitutes one of the most thermodynamically-stable cytosolic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Maturation of the immature protein to enzymatically-active, mature SOD1 occurs via a series of stabilizing post-translational modifications (PTMs), including the binding of two copper and two zinc ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated an accumulation of immature disSOD1 conformers in the post-mortem SNc of idiopathic Parkinson disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], which we posit reflects decreased SOD1 copper binding consistent with our observation of a 65% decrease in copper within this brain region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Here, we quantified metals bound to SOD1 dimers isolated from post-mortem brain tissues of Parkinson disease patients and age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1, 2</xref>), in whom the absence of <italic>SOD1</italic> gene mutations had been confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Metallation analyses were performed according to our published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], which combines size-exclusion chromatography and native isoelectric focusing to enrich soluble SOD1 protein &gt;99-fold in human post-mortem tissue extracts. SOD1-bound copper and zinc are then quantified using highly-sensitive synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) analysis. Dimeric SOD1 purified from both the SNc and occipital cortex (OCx) of control cases contained copper and zinc in an almost exact 1:1 ratio, consistent with the theoretical ratio of these elements bounds to mature SOD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. By contrast, this ratio was significantly lower (0.83 copper: 1 zinc) in the degenerating SNc of Parkinson disease cases compared with controls, but was unchanged in the OCx, a non-degenerating brain region in Parkinson disease (1.08 copper: 1 zinc)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This indicates decreased copper binding to SOD1 specifically within the Parkinson disease SNc, which we speculate results from the combination of lower bioavailable copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and higher SOD1 protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] we reported within this region. These data align with the copper:zinc ratio reported within SOD1 aggregates in the Parkinson disease SNc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], supporting a mechanism of SOD1 self-assembly driven by metal-deficient soluble protein isoforms.</p><p id="P6">Given the importance of copper binding for SOD1 structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], we next measured the isoelectric point (pI) of enzymatically-active SOD1 protein in the Parkinson disease SNc to evaluate the impact of decreased copper binding on SOD1 protein conformation. Changes in pI reflect altered amino acid solvent exposure, which can influence the aggregation propensity of SOD1, as well as the electrostatic guidance of superoxide towards the protein‚Äôs active site. Decreased SOD1 copper content was correlated with lower SOD1 protein pI in the SNc of Parkinson disease patients but not age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating that conformational changes in SOD1 protein structure resulting from altered metallation are proportional in severity to the magnitude of copper deficiency in Parkinson disease. Collectively, these data suggest that decreased SOD1 copper binding may contribute to the accumulation of disSOD1 in the Parkinson disease SNc.</p><p id="P7">In addition to metal binding, the chemical modification of key amino acid residue side chains within SOD1 regulates structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), maturation, metallation, subcellular localization and antioxidant function of the protein under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Recognizing that disSOD1 pathology may result from either the disruption of these modifications or the introduction of atypical PTMs, we employed proteomic mass spectrometry to profile the post-translational fingerprint of SOD1 protein immunoprecipitated from the post-mortem SNc and OCx of Parkinson disease patients and age-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. While the SNc exhibits significant neuron death and disSOD1 pathology in Parkinson disease, neither of these features are abundant in the OCx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], hence the inclusion of this brain region in PTM analyses enables the distinction of specific changes to SOD1 that may contribute to these factors in vulnerable brain regions. We identified 81 individual PTMs to 43 residues (28%) of SOD1 protein (154 amino acids) across both brain regions and diagnostic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), which were classified broadly as either of physiological significance (56 PTMs; acetylation, succinylation, phosphorylation, deamidation, ubiquitylation, glycosylation, acetylglucosamination) or being atypical modifications (25 PTMs; oxidation, nitration, glycation). These classifications were made based on their abundance in the healthy mammalian brain, with physiological PTMs being in high abundance and pathological PTMs being in low abundance, as well as their reported impact on SOD1 protein structure and function <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Among physiological SOD1 PTMs, we observed a striking decrease in SOD1 O- and N-glycosylation and acetylglucosamination across 4 serine and asparagine residues (1.6-to-79.1-fold decrease) in the SNc of Parkinson disease patients compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), which would be expected to negatively impact nascent SOD1 protein folding and trafficking in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. By contrast, significant increases (1.9-to-6.8-fold) in 8 atypical SOD1 PTMs were identified in the SNc of Parkinson disease patients compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), all of which have been shown to induce structural disorder and aggregation of the protein <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Importantly, none of these atypical alterations was identified in the non-degenerating Parkinson disease OCx, suggesting they are specific to degenerating brain regions in Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). On the contrary, SOD1 glycosylation (13 residues; 1.9-to-6.7-fold increase) and deamidation (5 residues; 1.6-to-2.9-fold elevation) were upregulated in the OCx of Parkinson disease patients compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 5</xref>), which likely act to suppress the accumulation of disSOD1 in this brain region by improving protein folding, trafficking and turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. It is unlikely that increased deamidation in this brain region induces structural disorder in SOD1 protein, as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], given we previously identified minimal disSOD1 in the Parkinson disease OCx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Overall, we have identified a range of atypical post-translational modifications likely to impact the structural and functional integrity of SOD1 within the degenerating SNc in postmortem Parkinson disease brain, which have the capacity to underlie the selective accumulation of disSOD1 pathology in this region.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A functional model of wild-type SOD1 pathology in the Parkinson disease brain</title><p id="P9">Cellular models cannot fully replicate the environment of the aged brain and neither misfolded SOD1, nor dopamine neuron death, can be quantified in the living human brain. Further, while transgenic SOD1 mice expressing mutant forms of the protein have been developed, they cannot be applied to study SOD1 pathology in Parkinson disease, which occurs in the absence of <italic>SOD1</italic> gene mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To further study the relationship between wild-type disSOD1 pathology and nigral dopamine neuron health and function, we engineered a novel mouse strain expressing biochemical changes observed in the Parkinson disease SNc that we believe underlie the development of this pathology; decreased CNS copper levels and increased wild-type SOD1 protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Nigral copper deficiency in Parkinson disease patients is associated with a down-regulation of the cellular copper import protein Ctr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], hence our novel mouse model was created by crossbreeding mice expressing half the normal level of Ctr1 (termed <italic>Ctr1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice), with transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type SOD1 (termed h<italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).

Although the regional specificity of dopamine neuron death within the SNc of SOCK mice does not completely align with that observed in Parkinson disease patients, occurring largely in the dorsomedial SNc rather than the ventrolateral SNc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], it is notable that genetic changes were engineered into these mice globally for the primary purpose of interrogating mechanisms resulting in disSOD1 pathology. Specific restriction of tissue copper deficiency and SOD1 protein overexpression to the SNc in future studies would better reflect the distribution of these changes in the Parkinson disease brain.</p><p id="P31">Importantly, the lack of significant body weight loss and spinal motor neuron degeneration in 12-month-old SOCK mice clearly distinguishes them from transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse models used to study ALS, which exhibit robust weight loss from 3 months-of-age following progressive spinal motor neuron degeneration and muscle wasting (‚àº5%/week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]). This is particularly interesting given that mutant and wild-type SOD1 pathology in ALS and Parkinson disease exhibit common structural characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], yet the global expression of human mutant SOD1 aggressively impacts spinal motor neurons, whilst the global induction of human wild-type SOD1 pathology results in nigral dopamine neuron death in the absence of spinal motor neuron degeneration. It must be acknowledged, however, that little-to-no attention has been paid towards nigrostriatal function in mutant SOD1 mice, hence we cannot discount the possibility that SNc dopamine neurons are also impacted by mutant SOD1 transgene expression, albeit likely to a much lesser extent. We posit that the ability of this pathology to underlie the degeneration of such distinct neuron populations may derive from the mechanisms of its formation. In SOCK mice, disSOD1 deposition was induced using biochemical alterations that characterize the Parkinson disease SNc, whilst similar pathology in ALS mouse models is induced by the introduction of known ALS-associated <italic>SOD1</italic> gene mutations.</p><p id="P32">In addition to nigrostriatal degeneration, previous studies have linked disSOD1 with the second pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease; Œ±-synuclein deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. These studies demonstrated a cross-seeding interaction between pathological forms of the two proteins in human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], whereby mutant or aggregated Œ±-synuclein promoted disSOD1 aggregation. However, these studies did not reciprocally examine the impact of disSOD1 on the subsequent development of Œ±-synuclein pathology. We provide the first evidence that disSOD1 accumulation promotes higher Œ±-synuclein S129 phosphorylation but not significant Œ±-synuclein deposition, reinforcing findings which suggest that the co-deposition of these proteins within Lewy pathology in the Parkinson disease brain is more likely initiated by aggregated Œ±-synuclein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>].</p><p id="P33">The contribution of Parkinson-like disSOD1 pathology to progressive nigrostriatal degeneration identified in this study adds to mounting data suggesting that this pathology may constitute a novel therapeutic target for Parkinson disease.

However, while many approaches capable of mitigating mutant SOD1 pathology in <italic>SOD1</italic>-linked ALS rely on the complete ablation of SOD1 protein using gene silencing technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], we propose that such approaches would be less effective in Parkinson disease where <italic>SOD1</italic> mutations are absent and oxidative stress is already rampant. We consider therapies capable of restoring the physiological maturation of SOD1, through improved metallation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] or stabilization of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>], to possess greater potential in mitigating nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson disease by simultaneously ameliorating SOD1 pathology and combating oxidative stress. Importantly, the low rate of success in translating potential disease-modifying therapies from animal models into the clinic across biomedical research is often attributed to differences between disease pathology in models and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. The high degree of similarity in disSOD1 pathology between the SOCK mouse midbrain and Parkinson disease SNc highlights the suitability of this model as a drug screening tool for identifying therapies capable of slowing nigral dopamine neuron death by mitigating disSOD1 pathology.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P34">This study provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that mismetallation and altered post-translational modifications drive the development of wild-type SOD1 misfolding, dysfunction and deposition.

Furthermore, the direct association between disSOD1 pathology and age-dependent, progressive nigrostriatal degeneration in SOCK mice highlights a role for wild-type disSOD1 in the death of SNc dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease, advocating for the exploration of this pathology as a novel drug target for this disorder.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Human post-mortem tissues</title><p id="P35">Fresh frozen human post-mortem brain tissues from Parkinson disease patients (<italic>n</italic> = 19) and age-matched controls (<italic>n</italic> = 23) were obtained from the MRC London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank (6 Parkinson disease, 10 control; King‚Äôs College, London, UK), the Parkinson UK Brain Bank (4 Parkinson disease; Imperial College, London, UK) and the Sydney Brain Bank (9 Parkinson disease, 13 control; Sydney, Australia).

A 60√ó magnification oil immersion lens was used to image those regions of interest at 1024√ó1024 pixel resolution with 0.3Œºm Z-step through the entire tissue thickness. A negative control was run by substituting the primary antibody with normal serum where no positive immunolabelling was detected, thus validating the absence of non-specific fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Quantification of SOD1 in nigral dopamine neuron soma</title><p id="P50">Confocal microscope images of brain tissue sections stained using SOD1 U√üB, TH, and DAPI, were converted from ND2 format to 3DTIFF using Fiji (NIH, v1.53J). Images were loaded on Avizo‚Ñ¢ 3D (2021.2, ThermoFisher Scientific) and a subvolume of the image was extracted for downstream analysis. Segmentation of TH<sup>+</sup> neuron cell bodies was performed by manually tracing a region of interest on every second slice and interpolating the remaining slices based on the traced regions of interest. All slices were visually checked to ensure the region of interest was captured correctly. Slices interpolated inaccurately were corrected using the brush tool or repeated with an increased number of manually segmented regions of interest. A threshold intensity for SOD1 was assigned to analyzed images to identify nd quantify SOD1 aggregates. Variable illumination and image intensity between images required an individual threshold for each image. Threshold intensities for SOD1 were individually assigned for each captured region of interest. Separate images for the TH<sup>+</sup> neuron cell bodies and SOD1 protein threshold were exported in a 3DTIFF format. A Python script was subsequently applied to all analyzed images to extract 3D measurements of SOD1 aggregate volume and its proportion inside and outside TH<sup>+</sup> neuron cell bodies. This script is publicly-available on GitHub (owner: Richard Harwood, repository: image_analysis_SOD1).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Lumbar spinal cord motor neuron stereology</title><p id="P51">Mouse lumbar spinal cord sections (50 sections/mouse on average) for motor neuron stereology were immunostained for the motor neuron markers choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and Islet-1 (ISL-1) and imaged using an Olympus VS200 virtual slide scanner (Olympus, Japan) at 40x magnification using the maximum intensity projection function. Spinal cord sections were confirmed as being from the lumbar region using anatomical features identified in an atlas of the mouse spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. Once images were obtained, left and right grey matter horns that were ventral to the spinal canal were then converted to .tiff files separately using QuPath (v0.5.1) software. Ventral motor neurons that were considered positive for both ISl-1 and ChAT were then segmented for counting by manual and automated methods using FIJI imaging software. Briefly, automated segmentation was performed via a FIJI software script that imported the multiplex images into FIJI and split them into single channel images. Nuclei that were immunopositive for ISL-1 (488nm channel) were then pre-processed using enhanced contrast (saturation: 0.2%, normalize histogram) and background subtraction (rolling ball radius:100 pixels), before image thresholding applied using the yen method, which was chosen as the most appropriate of 17 methods trialed. Fill holes and erode were applied to binary masks followed by segmentation using analyze particle analysis (size: 0.5- infinity, circularity: 0.1-1). To confirm double staining of motor neurons, segmented ISL-1 nuclei were then overlayed on ChAT immunopositive staining (647nm channel, min and max intensity: 50- 700) and each ISL-1 nuclei particle expanded proportional to its respective feret diameter. Average 488nm and 647nm intensities and area measures were recorded in overlap zones, while background 647nm intensity was measured as a 500x 500-pixel box overlayed over areas of background on a subset of the data (30% images). Positive motor neurons were counted when they had both ISL-1 nuceli segmentation and proximal ChAT staining above background. Counts were then normalized to a 1mm length of spinal cord by dividing the counts by the combined length of spinal cord comprised by the sections counted (e.g. 50 sections of 30Œºm thickness = 1.5mm length of spinal cord). Manual segmentation of ventral spinal cord motor neurons was performed on 10% of the dataset to confirm reliability of the automated data produced, whereby motor neurons that were positive for both ISL-1 and ChAT staining were counted in the extracted images. Manual counting demonstrated excellent reliability for the automated segmentation (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ±= 0.985 n= 75).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Quantification of striatal dopamine levels and turnover</title><p id="P52">Fresh-frozen striatal mouse tissue was homogenized by pulse sonication (30% duty cycle, output 2, 2 √ó 30 second intervals) in a solution of 150 mM phosphoric acid and 500 ŒºM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Total protein concentration of the tissue homogenate was assessed using the bicinchoninic acid assay according to manufacturer protocol (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4 ¬∞C and the remaining supernatant was spun in 3 kDa cut-off Amicon¬Æ centrifugal filter tubes (Merck Millipore) at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 90 min at 4 ¬∞C.

Both detector and column were maintained at 40 ¬∞C. Twenty microlitres of prepared samples were injected via a Prominence autosampler (Shimadzu Prominence SIL-20A, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase consisted of 0.01 M sodium phosphate monobasic (84% (v/v)) and methanol (16% (v/v)) containing 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.65 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid and 0.5 mM triethylamine. Mobile phase was adjusted to pH 3.8 using 1 M hydrochloric acid and filtered through 0.22 Œºm Whatman¬Æ filter circles then pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Calibration curves prepared from starting concentrations of analytical standards of dopamine (1 ŒºM), DOPAC (0.5 ŒºM) and HVA (3 ŒºM) were run at the beginning of each day to quantify any variability in the HPLC system. The Shimadzu integrated workstation LabSolutions software (Version 5.57; Shimadzu) was used to calculate the area under the curve for each peak of interest, and data subsequently normalized to the total protein concentration of each sample. Dopamine turnover was calculated as the ratio of HVA to dopamine.

We first identified optimal dilution factors required to bring total and pS129 Œ±-synuclein levels in extracts to within the linear dynamic range of the total and pS129 assay (25-fold for pS129 assay, 125-fold for total assay). Extracts were then diluted in assay lysis buffer to their optimal dilution factors and applied to total and pS129 Œ±-synuclein assays. Total Œ±-synuclein concentration in samples was calculated using a standard curve generated by measuring serial dilutions of purified wild-type Œ±-synuclein (RP-009; Proteos, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) using the total Œ±-synuclein kit. The concentration of pS129 Œ±-synuclein in these samples was calculated using a standard curve generated by measuring serial dilutions of purified pS129 Œ±-synuclein (RP-004; Proteos) using the pS129 Œ±-synuclein kit. Concentrations in diluted samples were then multiplied by their dilution factors and expressed as ng/mg total protein to account for differences in protein concentration in the original extracts. The proportion of Œ±-synuclein phosphorylated at S129 was calculated by dividing ng pS129 Œ±-synuclein/mg total protein by the ng total Œ±-synuclein/mg total protein, expressed as a percentage.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Animal weight and locomotor function</title><p id="P55">At each age of interest, animal weight was recorded prior to the assessment of motor function using the rotarod test according to published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>].

Mature SOD1 is dimeric, with each monomer comprising an eight-stranded Œ≤-barrel (grey) that binds one Cu (orange) and Zn (cyan) ion. The electrostatic loop (blue) guides anionic superoxide towards Cu in the active site using a series of charged and polar residues. Zinc coordination is facilitated by three histidine residues and one aspartic acid residue (cyan) within the metal-binding loop (green), whilst copper coordination is mediated by four histidine residues (orange). The disulfide loop (yellow) is a substructure within the metal-binding loop, containing one of two cysteine residues that form an intramolecular disulfide bond within SOD1 protein (yellow). The Greek key loop (pink) forms a plug at one pole of the Œ≤-barrel and contributes to dimer interface stability. <bold>d</bold>.
