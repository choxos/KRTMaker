These disruptions cause the intestine to act as a reservoir for VRE that seed difficult-to-treat infections. Patients would benefit from new treatments that prevent or treat VRE intestinal colonisation. However, the factors that drive VRE growth in the gut are poorly understood. We demonstrated that multiple antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation increased the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decreased the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites. We found significant but incomplete suppression of VRE growth by individual short chain fatty acids that were decreased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes. However, we showed that mixtures of short chain fatty acids provided complete or near complete suppression of VRE growth. We also showed that VRE could use most nutrients increased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes as carbon or nitrogen sources to support their growth. <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> had some common and some distinct preferences for use of specific nutrients that were enriched in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes. Finally, we showed that <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> occupied overlapping but distinct nutrient-defined intestinal niches that promoted high growth when cultured with each other and when cultured with carbapenem-resistant <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (another group of multidrug-resistant pathogens). Our results demonstrated that VRE occupy distinct intestinal niches in the antibiotic-treated intestine, defined by their abilities to utilise specific enriched nutrients and their abilities to grow with reduced concentrations of inhibitory microbial metabolites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens and a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These hospital-acquired pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge as they have intrinsic resistance to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and have also acquired resistance to many available antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> are responsible for 75% of enterococcal infections and are commonly associated with hospital outbreaks of invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was more virulent and more prevalent in healthcare-associated infections than <italic>E. faecium</italic>, however, the prevalence of <italic>E. faecium</italic> is increasing due to the rise of vancomycin-resistant and lactam-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>E. faecium</italic> has higher levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance than <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, where 80% of <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolates are vancomycin-resistant compared to 10% of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> has gained attention as the World Health Organisation classified it as a high priority pathogen due to its unfavourable rankings in several criteria, including mortality, trends of resistance, transmissibility, preventability, treatability, and pipelines for new medicines and diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The intestine is a major reservoir for VRE that seed difficult-to-treat invasive infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. VRE can be acquired from other patients, hospital rooms, or healthcare workers in acute and long-term healthcare facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Patients exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics (that significantly disrupt the gut microbiome) are highly susceptible to intestinal colonisation and domination by VRE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Conversely, healthy individuals have intact colonisation resistance, where their gut microbiomes protect them from VRE intestinal colonisation. To develop targeted and effective therapies to restrict VRE intestinal colonisation we must first understand what drives VRE colonisation in an antibiotic-disrupted gut microbiome.</p><p id="P5">Currently, we have an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of colonisation resistance that protect the host against VRE intestinal colonisation. However, a few studies have provided some insights. Previous work demonstrated that antibiotic treatment downregulated the expression of RegIIIγ, a C-type lectin that kills VRE in the small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Another study demonstrated that a gut commensal strain of <italic>Blautia producta</italic> can produce a lantibiotic that can reduce VRE growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Finally, another study demonstrated that lactulose treatment in patients with severe liver disease increased <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> growth, increased the production of microbial metabolites, acidified the gut lumen, and reduced the incidence of systemic infections and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, we lack information on how broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation impact nutrient competition and inhibitory metabolite production by the gut microbiome, and how this in turn impacts VRE growth.</p><p id="P6">Pathogens must have access to nutrients that they can utilise to support their growth and colonise the intestine. In a healthy gut microbiome, commensal microbes compete intensely for nutrients, resulting in nutrient depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, antibiotic-induced killing of gut commensals reduces nutrient competition, making the nutrients available to support pathogen growth. We have a very poor understanding of VRE nutrient utilisation in the antibiotic-treated gut. A previous study demonstrated that vancomycin-treated mice had increased fructose in their caecal contents compared to antibiotic-naïve mice, and vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> could use fructose as a carbon source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, this study used a targeted metabolomics approach that likely missed changes in other nutrients that were increased with vancomycin treatment. Moreover, this study only tested one antibiotic, whereas there are multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics used clinically that can promote VRE intestinal colonisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It is important to understand how other broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation affect the availability of nutrients that support VRE growth.</p><p id="P7">Microbiome therapeutics designed to restrict VRE growth based on nutrient utilisation profiles will not be effective unless they deplete all available carbon and nitrogen sources that support VRE growth. Otherwise, VRE can switch to using other available nutrients to grow. We previously demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote the intestinal colonisation of carbapenem-resistant <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CRE) caused an increase in the concentration of a wide range of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As our previous study demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics had a severe impact on the gut microbiota, in this study we hypothesised that broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation would also increase the concentration of a wide range of nutrients in the intestine, increasing the availability of many nutrients that could support VRE growth.</p><p id="P8">It is also not clear how VRE occupy intestinal niches in antibiotic-treated gut microbiomes. A previous study by Caballero and colleagues proposed that vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> and carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> occupied distinct but overlapping intestinal niches, as they showed that growth of each strain was not impaired when they colonised the mouse intestine simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Shared bacterial niches have also been observed in humans, as patients can be co-colonised with both CRE and VRE simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of how VRE and CRE occupied the antibiotic-treated intestine was not shown. Therefore, we hypothesised that VRE and CRE occupy distinct but overlapping nutrient-defined intestinal niches, where VRE share the utilisation of some nutrients with CRE, but also has its own distinct nutrient utilisation abilities.</p><p id="P9">In the healthy gut microbiome, nutrient utilisation results in the production of microbial metabolites, some of which can inhibit pathogen growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, VRE must be able to grow in the presence of microbial metabolites to successfully colonise the intestine. We previously demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote CRE intestinal colonisation decreased the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites in the gut microbiome, and several of these metabolites highly inhibited CRE growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Another study from our group demonstrated that antibiotic treatment promoted <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> growth and decreased the concentration of valerate in the gut microbiome, and that valerate inhibited <italic>C. difficile</italic> growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, we do not understand how microbial metabolites may impact VRE growth in the intestine. Therefore, we also wanted to determine whether microbial metabolites that are found in healthy gut microbiomes and decreased with antibiotic treatment could suppress VRE growth.</p><p id="P10">VRE are high-priority pathogens that are included in the “ESKAPE” group of pathogens, and urgently require new treatments, including new therapies to prevent VRE intestinal colonisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These therapies would remove a reservoir of VRE, thereby significantly reducing the subsequent development of VRE invasive infections and patient-to-patient VRE transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the nutrient and metabolite landscapes encountered by VRE in a gut microbiome treated with multiple different antibiotics that are known to promote VRE intestinal colonisation. Moreover, we wanted to define the niche that VRE occupied in an antibiotic-treated gut microbiome, how distinct these niches were between <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and how different these niches were compared to niches occupied by other multidrug-resistant pathogens. The results from this study will inform the rational design of a new microbiome therapeutic that can occupy the same niche as VRE to displace them from the intestine.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Antibiotics altered the nutrient- and metabolite-defined intestinal niches in a manner that supported VRE growth</title><p id="P11">We performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> faecal culture experiments to determine how antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation killed gut commensals, altered nutrient availability, and altered the presence of microbial metabolites. In these experiments, faeces from healthy human donors were cultured in a gut growth medium that was supplemented with water or an antibiotic known to promote VRE intestinal colonisation: metronidazole (MTZ), clindamycin (CLI), vancomycin (VAN), ceftriaxone (CRO), or piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP), at concentrations mimicking those found in human faeces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Samples were analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to measure changes in bacterial taxa and by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy to measure changes in nutrients and metabolites.</p><p id="P12">Antibiotic-treated faecal culture samples were compared to water-treated faecal culture samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots showed separation between antibiotic-treated and water-treated faecal culture samples along the first principal component, which corresponded to antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>). Faecal cultures treated with antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation had significant decreases in many bacterial families, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>. <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> were decreased in all the antibiotic-treated groups, while decreases in other bacterial families varied depending on the antibiotic tested. We found that there was some heterogeneity in the responses of specific bacterial families to antibiotic treatment in faecal cultures inoculated with faeces from different donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figs. S2 and S3</xref>). Antibiotic-treated faecal cultures also had significant decreases in taxa at the phylum, class, and order levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Antibiotic treatment also significantly altered the abundances of nutrients and metabolites that would be encountered by VRE in an antibiotic treated faecal microbiome. Antibiotic treatment resulted in a significant increase in a wide range of nutrients, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acids, uracil, and succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Monosaccharides increased with antibiotics included arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, glucose, mannose, ribose, xylose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Disaccharides increased with antibiotics included maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. Amino acids increased with antibiotics included alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. Antibiotic treatment also resulted in a decrease in a wide range of microbial metabolites, including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate), carboxylic acids (lactate and 5-aminovalerate), isobutyrate, and ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, isovalerate increased in CLI-treated and VAN-treated faecal cultures. We found that there was less heterogeneity in the responses of nutrients and metabolites to antibiotic treatment in faecal cultures inoculated with faeces from different donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We performed another set of faecal culture experiments to confirm whether vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> were able to grow in these antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes that had increased nutrient concentrations and decreased metabolite concentrations. First, MIC assays confirmed that the <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains were resistant to all the antibiotics tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> were also grown in pure cultures in the presence of the antibiotics at concentrations found in human faeces. Both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> were able to grow axenically in faecal concentrations of MTZ, CRO, CLI, and VAN, however, these strains were killed with faecal concentrations of TZP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6</xref>). Therefore, TZP was not tested further in the faecal culture experiments.</p><p id="P15">Faecal culture experiments were performed by spiking vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> or <italic>E. faecalis</italic> into antibiotic-treated faecal cultures as described above. We demonstrated that MTZ, CLI, VAN, and CRO-treated faecal cultures promoted the growth of <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, while water-treated faecal cultures restricted <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1c and 1d</xref>). We also found that there was a significant difference in VRE growth in some of the antibiotic-treated faecal cultures compared to others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In summary, we demonstrated that antibiotic treatment killed gut commensals and promoted VRE growth. This reduction in gut commensal abundance resulted in an increase in the concentration of nutrients (including monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acids, uracil, and succinate) and a decrease in the concentration of microbial metabolites (including SCFAs, lactate, 5-aminovalerate, isobutyrate, and ethanol).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Vancomycin treatment caused an increase in nutrients and a decrease in metabolites in mouse faeces and promoted vancomycin-resistant E. faecium <italic>growth</italic></title><p id="P17">We used a mouse model to demonstrate that antibiotic treatment altered nutrient availability and metabolite production <italic>in vivo</italic>.

A previous study demonstrated that mice exposed to VRE following the cessation of TZP treatment had high levels of VRE intestinal colonisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In this study we demonstrated that TZP-treated human faecal cultures had a similar change in nutrients and metabolites as CRO-treated faecal cultures. We concluded that antibiotics could promote pathogen intestinal colonisation by disrupting the gut microbiome, and colonisation could occur during a course of antibiotics if VRE is resistant to the antibiotic, or shortly after stopping a course of antibiotics (prior to recovery of the gut microbiome) if VRE was susceptible to the antibiotic. This emphasises the need to study VRE growth promotion in an antibiotic-treated faecal microbiota over the course of antibiotic treatment and following cessation of antibiotics.</p><p id="P49">We demonstrated that antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation caused a significant decrease in the abundance of a wide range of bacterial families, including <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> (which were significantly decreased with all antibiotics tested).

This heterogeneity may be due to differences in the presence of different antibiotic-resistance genes in bacterial species in the gut microbiotas from different donors. Finally, because certain bacterial families were found in some donors but not others, changes in these families did not reach statistical significance, even though they appeared to change in faecal cultures from donors that possessed these bacterial families.</p><p id="P50">It is difficult to understand the impact of antibiotic treatment on the abundance of specific gut commensals without first understanding the functions that these bacteria perform in the gut microbiome. Therefore, we measured changes in nutrients and metabolites directly to define the nutrient and metabolite landscape that VRE encounter during antibiotic treatment. We found that antibiotic treatment enriched for a wide range of nutrients and depleted a wide range of microbial metabolites, and that changes in nutrients and metabolites were less heterogeneous between different donors than changes in bacterial families. This may be due to shared functional redundancy between gut commensals, where different bacterial taxa possess genes that perform similar functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">We showed that the antibiotics which promoted VRE intestinal colonisation killed gut commensals that produced a wide range of microbial metabolites.

However, there were some differences in the susceptibility of VRE strains to each metabolite. At high concentrations the growth of all <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains were suppressed by propionate, butyrate, and valerate, while the growth of two <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains were suppressed by acetate. At high concentrations the growth of all <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains were suppressed by propionate, the growth of two <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains were suppressed by acetate and butyrate, and the growth of one <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain was suppressed by valerate.

Therefore, development of a mixture of SCFAs as a new therapeutic could be beneficial to restrict the growth of both VRE and CRE in the intestine.</p><p id="P52">Although individually acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate significantly suppressed <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> growth at high concentrations, growth was not fully suppressed. Therefore, we were also interested in whether a mixture of these metabolites showed synergistic or additive effects, where the metabolite mixture provided higher growth suppression than each metabolite provided individually. We showed that the APBV and PBV mixtures provided complete or near complete suppression of <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> growth at pH 6. The additive effects of these metabolites suggests that they act through a similar mechanism. A previous study by Sorbara and colleagues demonstrated that acetate, propionate, and butyrate inhibited antibiotic-resistant <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> growth through intracellular acidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

Both butyrate and valerate have also been demonstrated to promote intestinal barrier function which may help to prevent dissemination of VRE from the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Further dose testing is required to determine the optimal concentration of each metabolite within this inhibitory metabolite mixture. However, this metabolite mixture shows potential for the use to restrict VRE growth when administered to a patient with VRE intestinal colonisation or when administered to a patient as a prophylactic treatment (e.g. during antibiotic treatment when the patient is susceptible to VRE intestinal colonisation).</p><p id="P53">We investigated the ability of each metabolite to individually suppress VRE growth at physiologically relevant concentrations, where we tested each metabolite at their low, average, and high concentrations measured in healthy human faeces. However, metabolite concentrations vary along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. SCFA and branched chain fatty acid concentrations are high in the caecum and ascending colon and progressively decrease in the transverse and descending colon, with a small increase in the sigmoid/rectum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, microbial metabolites may provide greater suppression of VRE growth in different regions of the intestine.</p><p id="P54">Another mechanism of colonisation resistance involved in restricting VRE growth is nutrient competition. We demonstrated that killing gut commensals with antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation resulted in an increase in a broad range of nutrients that contained both carbon and nitrogen sources (including monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acids, uracil, and succinate). Our group recently demonstrated that antibiotics that promote CRE intestinal colonisation had a similar increase in the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decrease in the concentration of microbial metabolites in human and mouse faecal microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This observation is consistent with the literature, which showed that VRE and CRE intestinal colonisation are both promoted by broad-spectrum antibiotics – for example, both CRO and TZP promote the intestinal colonisation of VRE and CRE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote VRE and CRE intestinal colonisation resulted in an increase in the availability of similar nutrients, and we conclude that this may be a broader phenomenon that may apply to other intestinal pathogens that have their growth promoted in the intestine following antibiotic treatment.</p><p id="P55">Microbes with similar or “overlapping” nutrient utilisation abilities will compete for similar intestinal niches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In this study we demonstrated that <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> occupy distinct but overlapping intestinal niches. <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> can both use monosaccharides (fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, ribose, N-acetylglucosamine) and disaccharides (maltose, sucrose, trehalose) as carbon sources, and can use amino acids (arginine, glutamate, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, tryptophan, valine) as nitrogen sources under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. However, there were some differences in the utilisation of specific nutrients between <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.

Therefore, identification of gut commensal strains that can deplete these nutrients will allow us to develop novel microbiome therapeutics that can deplete these nutrients to re-establish colonisation resistance and restrict VRE intestinal growth. However, we demonstrated that both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> can utilise a wide range of nutrients, and this flexibility in nutrient utilisation suggests that microbiome therapeutics targeting VRE must contain several gut commensals that together can deplete all the nutrients that VRE can use to grow.</p><p id="P56">A previous study by Lebreton and colleagues found that the hospital-associated <italic>E. faecium</italic> lineage lost pathways related to complex carbohydrate utilisation (found in the community-associated <italic>E. faecium</italic> lineage), which were replaced by pathways on mobile elements that were related to the utilisation of amino sugars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

However, other nutrients that were not used when tested individually were used when VRE were cultured in a mixture of nutrients. For example, we showed that <italic>E. faecium</italic> (NCTC 12202) was not able to use sucrose as a sole carbon source but was able to use sucrose when grown in a mixture of nutrients. In contrast, some nutrients that were used in the individual nutrient utilisation assays were not used by VRE when cultured in the mixture of nutrients. For example, we showed that <italic>E. faecium</italic> (NCTC 12202) highly used threonine when tested in the nitrogen leave-one-out assay, but did not use threonine when grown in a mixture of nutrients. Therefore, nutrient utilisation and preferences in mixtures of nutrients are complex and it is not always straightforward to translate the utilisation of nutrients as single carbon or nitrogen sources to their utilisation in mixtures that VRE would encounter in the intestine <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nutrient utilisation may also be context dependent, meaning that VRE nutrient utilisation and preferences may change under different environmental conditions. For example, future studies should investigate VRE nutrient utilisation and preferences in the context of different host diets, or in different host microbiomes that vary in terms of composition and antibiotic-resistance profiles. Therefore, the best approach to restrict VRE growth may be to deplete all nutrients that are elevated due to antibiotic treatment, so there are no alternative nutrient sources for VRE to utilise.</p><p id="P58">We demonstrated that antibiotics that promote VRE and CRE intestinal colonisation enriched for a similar broad range of nutrients, and depleted a similar broad range of microbial metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, it was not clear whether VRE and CRE occupied distinct intestinal niches, which may impact the design of microbiome therapeutics to restrict the growth of these pathogens. A previous study demonstrated that vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> and carbapenem-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> occupied distinct but overlapping intestinal niches, however, the mechanism of how these pathogens occupied their intestinal niches was not defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that VRE growth was promoted in an antibiotic-treated faecal microbiome because VRE were able to occupy a distinct nutrient-defined intestinal niche from CRE. Compared to our previous study of CRE nutrient utilisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that VRE and CRE had an overlap in the utilisation of many, but not all nutrients. Under anaerobic conditions both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could use arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose as carbon sources and could use arginine as a nitrogen source. However, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could also use xylose as a carbon source and could use aspartate as a nitrogen source. <italic>E. faecium</italic> could also use ribose as a carbon source and could use glutamate, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine as nitrogen sources. Under aerobic conditions both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could use arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, ribose, N-acetylglucosamine, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose as carbon sources and could use arginine, aspartate, glutamate, and uracil as nitrogen sources. However, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could also use xylose, alanine, proline, and glutamate as carbon sources, and could grow more highly on alanine as a nitrogen source. <italic>E. faecium</italic> could also use tryptophan and leucine as carbon sources, could grow more highly on glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, and methionine as nitrogen sources, and could also use phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine as nitrogen sources. These differences in nutrient utilisation between <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> support the observations from our co-culture experiments where both strains were able to grow to high levels in the presence of these nutrients.</p><p id="P59">VRE and CRE also had different preferences for nutrients that they could use. For example, although both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> can use aspartate, arginine, lysine, and ribose, <italic>E. faecium</italic> prefers to use arginine and ribose while <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> prefers to use aspartate and lysine. It is also possible that CRE and VRE may be able to share nutrients to simultaneously grow together. For example, each species may only need one of the many carbon sources that are available in the intestine following antibiotic treatment to support its growth. Therefore, although similar nutrient- and metabolite-defined landscapes are generated in the intestine with broad-spectrum antibiotics that promote VRE and CRE intestinal colonisation, the niches that these pathogens occupy in the intestine are different. This highlights that VRE have different strategies for utilising nutrients to colonise an antibiotic-treated gut microbiome compared to other multidrug-resistant pathogens, which may have implications for the design of new microbiome therapeutics to decolonise pathogens from the intestine.</p><p id="P60">The results from this study can be used to inform the rational design of microbiome therapeutics that can re-establish colonisation resistance to restrict VRE intestinal growth. A novel microbiome therapeutic could be composed of a cocktail of live gut commensals that can together deplete nutrients that were enriched with antibiotic treatment and restore the production of microbial metabolites that were decreased with antibiotic treatment. Another option could be a mixture of microbial metabolites that can restrict VRE growth, such as the APBV or PBV mixtures tested in this study. Finally, these two new therapeutics could also be combined, such that we could administer the cocktail of live gut commensals and the mixture of metabolites simultaneously, or we could administer the mixture of metabolites while the patient is on antibiotic treatment and then administer the cocktail of live gut commensals after antibiotic treatment is completed.</p><p id="P61">More research is required before we can design effective microbiome therapeutics to restrict VRE growth. Gut commensals that are killed by antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation may be important candidates to reintroduce into the intestine to restore colonisation resistance. We need more information on the nutrient utilisation abilities and metabolite production abilities of these gut commensals (both individually and together as mixtures) to determine how they would grow in a nutrient-enriched and metabolite-depleted intestinal environment following antibiotic treatment. We also need more information about the impact of host diet on VRE and gut commensal intestinal colonisation.</p><p id="P62">There are some limitations in this study that highlight additional areas that require further research. Faecal samples are more commonly used than small intestine samples to investigate VRE intestinal colonisation in both humans and mice, and as such this study investigated VRE intestinal colonisation in the context of the faecal microbiome, which is more reflective of the large intestine microbiome than other regions of the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. VRE colonises the antibiotic-treated large intestine to higher concentrations, however VRE can also colonise the antibiotic-treated small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. It would also be important to investigate nutrient availability and microbial metabolite production in other regions of the intestine that VRE can colonise (such as the small intestine) to design microbiome therapeutics that can restrict VRE growth at all intestinal regions. Moreover, we have only tested <italic>vanA</italic> VRE strains in this study as <italic>vanA</italic> type resistance is the most dominant genotype worldwide, <italic>vanA</italic> shows higher levels of overall antibiotic-resistance compared to <italic>vanB</italic>, and <italic>vanA</italic> strains were the most commercially available stains to test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. However, future studies should investigate whether there is a difference in nutrient utilisation and metabolite inhibition of other non-<italic>vanA</italic> type resistant VRE.</p><p id="P63">In this study we used a mouse model to confirm that our <italic>ex vivo</italic> results held up in an <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal environment. However, like all experimental models, mice have their limitations. For example, humans and mice have some differences in the bacterial species that compose their gut microbiome, and humans and mice consume different diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, it is not possible to perform pathogen intestinal colonisation experiments in humans due to ethical limitations, and as such mice are often used in these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Humans and mice with healthy gut microbiomes have intact colonisation resistance, where both humans and mice are resistant to VRE intestinal colonisation. Moreover, like humans, mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics become highly susceptible to VRE intestinal colonisation, where VRE intestinal growth reaches high densities. In both our <italic>ex vivo</italic> human faecal culture experiments and our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse experiments we showed that antibiotic treatment caused an enrichment of nutrients (such as sugars and amino acids) and a depletion of metabolites (such as SCFAs, isobutyrate, lactate, and ethanol). Therefore, despite differences in the gut microbiome composition and diets between humans and mice, our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse results were supportive of our <italic>ex vivo</italic> human faecal culture results.</p><p id="P64">In summary, we demonstrated that VRE take advantage of the nutrient-enriched and metabolite-depleted intestinal niches that are generated during antibiotic treatment to colonise the intestine. We demonstrated that several antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation changed the abundance of many nutrients and metabolites. We showed that individually acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate partially suppressed VRE growth, but a mixture of these metabolites provided complete or near complete suppression of VRE growth. Healthy gut microbiomes depleted nutrients through nutrient competition, however in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes killing of gut commensals enriched for nutrients. VRE can use most of these nutrients as carbon or nitrogen sources, where <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> have some similar and some different preferences for these nutrients. Finally, we showed that <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> occupied overlapping but distinct intestinal niches that permit high simultaneous growth with each other and with CRE. Therefore, designing a microbiome therapeutic consisting of gut commensals that deplete these nutrients could restore colonisation resistance and restrict or prevent VRE intestinal colonisation. Removing an intestinal reservoir for VRE would lead to a reduction in the development of invasive VRE infections. Our study also suggested that designing a microbiome therapeutic consisting of a mixture of gut commensals that can deplete nutrients that were enriched with antibiotic treatment and restore the production of microbial metabolites that were depleted with antibiotic treatment could be used to restrict both VRE and CRE growth.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p id="P65"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref> lists the reagents and oligonucleotides used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Bacterial isolates</title><p id="P66">Vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> (NCTC 12202 and NCTC 12204) and vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (NCTC 12201 and NCTC 13779) were purchased from the UK Health Security Agency.

Growth of each isolate was measured with 6 replicates in two independent experiments. Comparison of <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> monoculture growth to co-culture growth was made using an unpaired t-test (two-sided). Comparison of VRE strain and CRE strain monoculture growth to co-culture growth was made using ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. * = P ≤ 0.05, ** = P ≤ 0.01, *** = P ≤ 0.001, **** = P ≤ 0.0001. Data are presented as mean values ± SD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202014-f010"/></fig></floats-group></article>
