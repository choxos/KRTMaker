Eps15 plays a key role through interactions of its three EH domains with Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of other endocytic proteins. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we investigate the interaction between Eps15’s EH domains and a highly disordered Dab2 fragment (Dab2<sub>320−495</sub>). We find that the EH domains exhibit binding promiscuity, recognizing not only the NPF motif of Dab2 but also other phenylalanine containing motifs. This promiscuity enables interactions with Eps15’s own IDR (Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>), which lacks NPF motifs, suggesting an self-inhibitory state that promotes liquid-liquid phase separation. Despite competing for the same EH domain binding sites, Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320−495</sub> can bind EH123 simultaneously, forming a highly dynamic interaction network that facilitates the recruitment of Dab2<sub>320−495</sub> into Eps15 condensates. Our findings provide molecular insights into the competitive interactions shaping the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major pathway for cargo uptake into the eukaryotic cell often with transmembrane receptors as cargoes. The important cellular process requires a complex network of interactions, which finally results in the formation and uptake of a clathrin coated vesicle. During the early phases of the process that takes roughly one to two minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) of the endocytic initiators play a major role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. While folded proteins mainly exist in one stable conformation, IDRs inter-convert rapidly between many different conformations due to their relatively flat energy landscape. IDRs often recognize their folded partner proteins through small interaction regions of only a few residues, also called linear motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This is also the case in CME, where IDRs of endocytic initiators interact with, for example, the major adaptor protein complex AP2 or clathrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, allowing them to establish a robust multivalent interaction network which allows for rapid rearrangement of the different protein members. Eps15, together with FCHo1/2 proteins, counts among the first proteins to arrive at the endocytic pit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. It has three N-terminal Eps15 homology domains (EH domains), which share the common fold of two helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands) spaced by a short β-sheet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The EH domains are followed by a central coiled-coil domain, through which Eps15 dimerizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and a large IDR of around 400 residues in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Eps15 tetramers, formed by two anti-parallel Eps15 dimers have also been observed, seemingly requiring interaction between the EH domains and the IDR from opposite dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. FCHo1/2, which also forms dimers, use their C-terminal µ homology domain (µHD) to interact with the multiple Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF) motifs contained in Eps15’s IDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The multivalent interaction network between Eps15 and FCHo1/2 enables formation of liquid-like protein droplets, which has been proposed as a process to catalyze the early steps of CME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The EH domains of Eps15, for example, can bind to Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, such as Epsin1, Stonin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or Dab2 (disabled homolog 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. While interactions between EH domains and both Epsin1 and Stonin2 have been characterized at molecular detail, the nature of Dab2’s interaction with EH domains remains to date elusive. Dab2 has an N-terminal folded phosphotyrosine interacting domain (PID), which it uses to anchor itself to the membrane and transmembrane cargo, followed by a large IDR of around 500 residues in length, which comprises both DPF as well as NPF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Both Eps15 and Dab2 belong to the class of clathrin associated sorting proteins (CLASPs), which regulate cargo sorting during the early phases of CME and usually rely on downstream factors, such as the major adaptor protein complex AP2 or clathrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Dab2 has special properties as a CLASP since it can lead to successful CME of specific cargoes even in the absence of AP2. These cargoes, for example integrin β1, are specifically recognized by the Dab2 PID. Importantly, binding of Eps15 to Dab2 is required for the AP2 independent internalization of these protein cargoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, highlighting the importance of understanding the communication between Eps15 and Dab2.</p><p id="P3">Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we investigate the region of Dab2 that is predicted to be most disordered, residues 320-495 (Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>), its conformational sampling, as well as its interactions with the EH domains of Eps15. All EH domains interact preferentially with the only NPF motif within Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, but EH2 and EH3 demonstrate a high level of binding promiscuity towards other phenylalanine containing motifs. This promiscuity is maintained for the combined EH domains, comprising EH1, EH2 and EH3 (EH123), and surprisingly enables Eps15’s own IDR (Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>), which does not possess any NPF motifs, to bind to EH123 and thereby partially occupy the binding pockets of the different EH domains. We provide a detailed molecular characterization of these intra-molecular interactions within Eps15, which are likely key to liquid-liquid phase separation of Eps15 in the absence of other endocytic proteins. Our NMR results indicate that both Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> can bind EH123 simultaneously, but partially compete with each other. In line with this, we observe that Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> is recruited into liquid-like condensates formed by full length Eps15. Our results provide a detailed description of the multivalent and promiscuous interactions between Eps15 and Dab2, which appear to be key to a dynamic protein network that can phase separate and evolve over time, which is required in the early stages of CME.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> is an IDR with mild helical propensities</title><p id="P4">The around 500 residue long IDR of Dab2 comprises a central region, which is predicted by IUPred2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to be significantly more disordered than the remainder of the IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We designed a construct encompassing this region, reaching from residue 320 to 495 (Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>). This region contains 2 putative binding sites for clathrin (DLL/DLF) and one NPF motif, prone to bind to EH domains contained in Eps15. We expressed and purified the construct, and assigned the NMR backbone resonances of a <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C labeled sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We were initially not able to assign two small regions within Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, for which we designed two new stretches (Dab2<sub>328-360</sub> and Dab2<sub>358-390</sub>), whose <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum overlaid well with the one of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), enabling the transfer of assignments from Dab2<sub>328-360</sub> and Dab2<sub>358-390</sub> to Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. As predicted, Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> appears to be disordered along its entire length, testified by secondary chemical shifts (SCSs) close to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, calculating a conformational ensemble on the basis of chemical shifts using a combination of the statistical coil generator flexible meccano<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and the selection algorithm ASTEROIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> revealed three regions with mild helical propensity as compared to random coil: 339-354, 454-460, and 486-490 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Around the NPF motif, no particular structural propensity could be observed. In agreement with this, <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation rates (R<sub>1ρ</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, {<sup>1</sup>H}-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear Overhauser effect - hetNOE) are reminiscent of those of an intrinsically disordered protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), with increased rigidity, testified by increased R<sub>1ρ</sub> and hetNOE rates, apparent around the transient helix between residues 328 and 360 (helix<sub>N</sub>). This helix is connected with the remainder of the disordered chain by a few amino acids of more rapid mobility. The more C-terminal transient helices are also characterized by slightly increased R<sub>1ρ</sub> and hetNOE rates, although less pronounced than those of helix<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EH1 binds selectively to NPF motifs, while EH2 and EH3 are promiscuous binders</title><p id="P5">We then titrated the different Eps15 EH domains (EH1, EH2, or EH3) into <sup>15</sup>N Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and recorded <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra at the different titration steps. While small chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) are observed very locally upon addition of EH1, the spectrum of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> is more significantly perturbed when EH2 and EH3 are present at comparable concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5, 6</xref>). Plotting the CSPs of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> upon interaction with the different EH domains along its sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1D-F</xref>) clearly illustrates that EH1, EH2, and EH3 have different binding patterns: EH1 is the most selective of all Eps15 EH domains, binding mainly to the NPF motif of <sup>15</sup>N Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, while very small CSPs occur around residue F366 only at 200% EH1. EH2 and EH3, on the other hand, were able to interact with multiple small stretches on Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, revealing a high degree of binding promiscuity. This binding behavior is also mirrored by decreased peak intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) and increased R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates around the respective interaction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2A, B</xref>). Since a spin-lock field of 1500 Hz was used in the R<sub>1ρ</sub> experiments, effectively quenching contributions of intermediate exchange to the relaxation rates, the observed increases in R<sub>1ρ</sub> reflect the slowed rotational tumbling times of the interacting residues when in contact with the respective EH domain. Residues in between the interaction sites have R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates similar to those of the unbound Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, suggesting that the different interaction sites act independently from each other. Even though the largest CSPs were observed around the NPF motif when EH2 and EH3 were added, also residues around DYF, WPF, DLF, and DIF motifs were in contact with those two EH domains at higher EH:Dab2 ratios. Common to all motifs is the phenylalanine residue, suggesting an importance for this residue type in the binding to EH2 and EH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E, F</xref>). Interestingly, most of these motifs are located in the regions with increased helical propensity of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> motifs were furthermore observed to bind to the EH domains with different dynamics. For example, V399, just next to the NPF motif, showed only mild peak broadening upon interaction with EH1, justified by the slowed rotational tumbling times when in complex. Upon interaction with EH2, however, significantly stronger broadening was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). The other interacting regions show very little broadening and are mainly characterized by CSPs. These differential behaviors prompted us to record Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> to investigate the possibility of intermediate exchange in the microsecond to millisecond regime between the bound and unbound states in the presence of EH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These experiments confirm that the NPF motif binds EH2 in intermediate exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale. Surprisingly, many residues throughout the helix<sub>N</sub> also displayed dynamics on the intermediate timescale upon binding. The remaining motifs were concluded to bind in fast exchange.</p><p id="P7">In order to quantify the affinity of the interaction between Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and the EH domains, we attempted to extract dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) for the different Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> interaction motifs. Even though fitting of CSPs as a function of EH domain concentration was difficult due to the low affinities and peak broadening (especially around the NPF motif upon interaction of EH2), they can be estimated to be in the high micromolar to millimolar range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Analysis of the CPMG relaxation dispersion curves of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> upon interaction with EH2 revealed a K<sub>D</sub> value in a similar range (196 μM), whereby the dispersion in the helix<sub>N</sub> and around the NPF motif were fit together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> binds to the main hydrophobic pocket of EH1, EH2, and EH3 and a second binding pocket of EH2</title><p id="P8">We wondered whether differences in the EH domains could explain the distinct interactions observed with the different motifs of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. We thus set out to determine the binding pockets on each of the EH domains that engage in interaction with Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. Even though NMR assignments of the three EH domains exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, we assigned all three EH domains under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 8-10</xref>). From the carbon SCSs, we calculated secondary structure propensities (SSPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> which are in agreement with previously determined NMR structures of the proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>1ρ</sub> relaxation rates reflect small folded domains with flexible N- and C-termini as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). We then titrated Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> into the different <sup>15</sup>N labeled EH domains and recorded <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) spectra of the EH domains at the different titration steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3</xref>). The largest CSPs can be observed around the previously identified binding pockets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and are comparable between all three EH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). An additional binding region, previously shown to bind a second NPF motif in Stonin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, is clearly visible in EH2. The region seems to participate in binding also within EH1 and EH3, albeit in a less pronounced way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). R<sub>1ρ</sub> relaxation rates systematically increase throughout all residues when Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> is titrated into the <sup>15</sup>N EH domains, likely reflecting mildly increased tumbling times resulting from the motional drag that the bound IDR exerts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The full EH-domain containing region (EH123) shows increased binding promiscuity</title><p id="P9">Since the different EH domains are normally not isolated, but expressed in row in the context of Eps15, we investigated the interaction between Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and the full EH-domain containing region (EH1-EH2-EH3, also called EH123) by titrating increasing concentrations of EH123 into <sup>15</sup>N Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. As expected from the interactions of the individual EH domains, both CSPs and R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates reveal that EH123 is able to interact with the same regions of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> as observed for EH2 and EH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A, B</xref>). Interestingly, the R<sub>1ρ</sub> relaxation rates of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> in the presence of EH123 show increased relaxation not only of the residues of the five Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> binding regions, but the residues located in between the binding motifs also show mildly increased rates. This is particularly evident for the residues located between the first three binding motifs (DYFDQQF, WPF and NPF) and suggests an overall stiffening of the chain, potentially due to binding of the motifs to different EH domains within the same EH123 molecule.</p><p id="P10">While CSPs around the NPF motif remain the largest upon interaction with EH123, the difference between the interaction of EH123 with the NPF motif and the other motifs appears smaller than for interaction with the individual EH domains. Indeed, R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates increase much more significantly around these promiscuous sites, albeit part of the increase should be attributed to the larger size of EH123 relative to the individual domains. Nonetheless, binding affinities approximated from the CSPs for EH123 binding are significantly higher than those of the individual EH domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). This suggests that once one EH domain within EH123 is bound to Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, the two other EH domains of the same molecule remain available for (preferential) binding to other motifs, an effect reminiscent of avidity, effectively increasing the total level of binding promiscuity. A much higher concentration of individual EH domains (3x as many) is needed to partially recover the chemical shift differences and R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> in the presence of EH123 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>All EH domains within EH123 engage in interaction with Dab2</title><p id="P11">To investigate whether Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> binds to the same sites on the EH domains when they are expressed in row rather than independently, we also aimed to characterize the interaction between Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and EH123 from the side of EH123. We therefore produced <sup>15</sup>N labeled EH123 and recorded a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectrum. If the different EH domains were unaffected by being connected to each other, we would expect this spectrum to overlay perfectly with those of the individual EH domains. However, small CSPs were observed for all three EH domains, and the peaks of EH2 and EH3 appeared broadened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), revealing that each EH domain is affected by the presence of the two additional domains potentially due to intra-molecular interactions. Despite the changes in the spectrum of EH123 compared to those of EH1, EH2, and EH3, the assignments from the individual domains could be fully transferred to the combined construct. In order to examine the broadening of the peaks originating from EH2 and EH3, we recorded <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation of EH123 (R<sub>1ρ</sub> and hetNOEs). All R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates of EH123 were significantly increased as compared to the individual EH domains which was expected for this larger protein construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14C</xref>). The rates of EH2 and EH3, however, were significantly higher overall than those from EH1. Indeed, the increased R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates were similar for EH2 and EH3, suggesting that EH2 and EH3 tumble together as one entity, while EH1 can move independently within EH123. HetNOEs, which are sensitive to motion in the picosecond range, and thus faster motion than R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates, show quite similar values all along EH123, reflecting the similar fold and internal dynamics of the individual domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14C</xref>). Only the linker between EH1 and EH2 displays much lower hetNOE values, demonstrating that this linker is undergoing much more rapid motion than the rest of the protein construct, also compared to the linker connecting EH2 and EH3, in very good agreement with EH2 and EH3 tumbling together within the EH123 construct.</p><p id="P12">When Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> was added to <sup>15</sup>N EH123, we observed CSPs for all three domains, similar to those of the individual EH domains when interacting with Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that the binding sites on all EH domains are available also within EH123, despite the fact that EH2 and EH3 tumble together within EH123. R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates increased throughout EH123 when Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> was added, and the rates of EH1 remained lower than those of EH2 and EH3, suggesting that the overall conformation of the EH domains within EH123 is preserved upon binding of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Eps15’s own IDR interacts with EH123</title><p id="P13">The remarkable binding promiscuity towards phenylalanine containing motifs observed between EH123 and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, prompted us to investigate whether EH123 could also interact with Eps15’s own IDR (Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>). Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> does not contain any canonical NPF motifs, but contains 14 DPF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), which have previously been suggested to interact with Eps15’s own EH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. When we added equimolar amounts of Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> to <sup>15</sup>N EH123, CSPs were observed throughout the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectrum of EH123, confirming the interaction and further suggesting that all EH domains bind to Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Upon interaction, most peaks of EH2 and EH3 were severely broadened, likely because of the motional drag the long Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> exerts on EH123. As a consequence, many of the signals were too weak to calculate CSPs and extract relaxation rates for EH2 and EH3 within EH123 upon interaction with Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>. However, the CSPs originating from EH1 within EH123 were all smaller than those in presence of the same amount of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, indicating that EH1 interacts less well with Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> than with Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, in agreement with EH1 being the least promiscuous of the domains, binding more selectively to NPF motifs than EH2 and EH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>EH123 interacts with DPF clusters and other phenylalanine containing motifs in Eps15<sub>IDR</sub></title><p id="P14">In order to further characterize the interaction between Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and EH123, we assigned the backbone resonances of <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C labeled Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>.

This is likely because these residues (481-504) are part of the coiled-coil domain as predicted by AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, giving rise to weak peaks in the 3D assignment spectra. Low R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>1ρ</sub> relaxation rates and SCSs around 0 for both Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and the smaller stretches agree well with a disordered protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>).

These regions, 620-680 and 700-730, are characterized by a high density of phenylalanines. While the first region is enriched in DPF motifs, which have previously been proposed to bind to EH123, the second region is characterized by fewer DPF motifs and contains multiple other small linear motifs with phenylalanine, underlining the promiscuity of the EH domains. Moreover, small CSPs and increases in R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates are observed around three smaller regions indicating additional interaction sites for EH123: residues ~800-809 and ~820-827 containing DPF(s), and residues ~843-846 containing phenylalanines.

We therefore conducted a competition experiment, acquiring a spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N EH123 with equimolar amounts of both Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. The resulting CSPs of EH123 showed that in the presence of both Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>, the CSPs of EH1 were similar to those in presence of Dab2 only and accompanied by slightly increased R<sub>1ρ</sub> rates, while the peaks of EH2 and EH3 were broadened severely similar to when only Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). While it is difficult to disentangle the individual contributions of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> binding to the spectral changes, this suggest that both IDRs may bind EH123 at the same time. To further investigate this, we recorded a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and added first EH123 and then Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>.

Taken together, the competition experiments conducted from the side of each binding partner (EH123, Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>, and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>) suggest that both Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> can bind to EH123 at the same time, even though they are competing for the same EH domain interaction sites. This could be possible due to a fast on and off rate of the low affinity interaction motifs, thereby creating a complex and dynamic interaction network allowing both IDRs to bind EH123.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> enters into Eps15 protein condensates</title><p id="P17">Eps15 has recently been shown to form liquid-like droplets, and interactions between the EH domains and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> were proposed to contribute to droplet formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The seemingly simultaneous interactions of Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> with EH123 observed here, made us question whether Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> could be recruited to Eps15 condensates. We therefore expressed and purified full length Eps15, from here on just called Eps15, and labeled its cysteines with the fluorophore Alexa 594. In order to fluorescently label Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, which does not contain any cysteines, we created a single cysteine mutant (S328C Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>), and labeled it with Alexa 488. We first examined if we could achieve liquid-like droplet formation of 7 µM Eps15 under our experimental conditions. Indeed, upon addition of 3% PEG, we observed droplet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Unlike Eps15, Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> was not able to form any droplets on its own under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a prime example for a process that comprises many of those short linear motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, leading to the formation of a complex interaction network. Known examples are the α and β2 appendage domains of the major adaptor protein AP2 that interact with DPF/DPW and FxDxF motifs (x = any amino acid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, the clathrin heavy chain terminal domain that interacts with DLL/DLF motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> or the EH domains found in Eps15, which interact with NPF motifs of diverse IDR partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Although extensive studies have identified these consensus sequences, it has meanwhile become clear that additional binding sites are yet to be discovered and that this requires a strategy by which focus lies on studying long endocytic IDRs. This has recently allowed identifying a particularly long interaction site between the neuronal AP180 and the AP2β2 appendage domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, many endocytic IDRs seem to bind to the same partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and understanding how the different binding modes synergize or compete with each other is crucial for a molecular comprehension of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p id="P19">In this study, we shed light onto those partially competitive interactions by investigating binding of a large intrinsically disordered region stemming from the CLASP Dab2 (Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>) and its interactions with Eps15 EH domains, as well as its competition for binding with Eps15’s own IDR (Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>). In line with the previous literature and extensive peptide screens to assess binding patterns of Eps15 EH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, all three EH domains of Eps15 (EH1, EH2 and EH3) prefer to bind to the only NPF motif within the sequence of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In the presence of EH2, significant exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time scale is observed around the NPF motif and an N-terminal transient helix in Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (helix<sub>N</sub>), allowing to estimate a dissociation constant between Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (NPF motif and helix<sub>N</sub>) and EH2 on the order of hundreds of micromolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). These affinities are in agreement with affinities of other small linear motif interactions determined in the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, but orders of magnitudes weaker than those observed between Stonin2 and EH2 (KD in the nanomolar range)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Although the EH domains bind preferentially to the NPF motif of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, as it is expected from the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, the atomic resolution provided by our NMR experiments also points toward additional, slightly weaker binding sites including DYF, WPF, DLF, and DIF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Such sites will certainly play a role in the crowded environment of the endocytic pit, and these motifs further testify to an extremely promiscuous binding behavior of EH2 and EH3. This is in line with the observation that other EH domains, such as the EH domain of EHD1 or of POB-1 can bind to the motif xPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. By investigating the EH domain interactions with small linear motifs from the side of a bona fide IDR, we can conclude that the promiscuity of EH2 and EH3 is even larger than previously anticipated, binding to most phenylalanine containing motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Even though some proteins contain individual EH domains, this is not the case for Eps15, which contains EH1, EH2 and EH3 sequentially at its N-terminus. Unexpectedly, we observe that EH2 and EH3 move together as one entity in a construct comprising all three EH domains (EH123, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting a potential interaction between EH2 and EH3. EH1, on the other hand, tumbles independently from the other two EH domains. Nonetheless, EH123 makes all EH domain binding sites available for interaction with Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. From the side of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, binding to EH123 is strikingly different than binding to the individual EH domains. While the same NPF and promiscuous motif interactions maintain, the non-NPF interactions seem to gain importance, possibly enhanced through avidity effects of the three EH domains in close spatial proximity compared to the individual domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The present promiscuity of interactions, particularly in the context of the full EH123 construct, suggests that the EH domains might bind to Eps15’s own IDR, which has also been suggested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Addition of Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> to <sup>15</sup>N EH123 indeed led to CSPs and increased <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>1ρ</sub> relaxation rates confirming this intramolecular interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). While this interaction has previously been proposed to occur through DPF motifs contained in Eps15<sub>IDR</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, our data recorded on <sup>15</sup>N labeled Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> shows that EH123 binds to all phenylalanine containing regions of Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> highlighting the promiscuity of EH123 also observed in the binding to Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While one would expect that an NPF containing IDR, such as Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, might replace Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> from EH123 due to the preferred interaction of EH domains with NPF motifs compared to more promiscuous binding sites, this seems not to be the case. When both Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> are added to <sup>15</sup>N labeled EH123, the spectrum and corresponding relaxation rates show signatures of binding to both proteins, although the individual contributions cannot be disentangled due to their similar interaction sites on EH123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A similar behavior is observed when a sample containing all three proteins is detected from the side of <sup>15</sup>N Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> or <sup>15</sup>N Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>. Only few regions within the spectra of Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> slightly revert towards their unbound state when both EH123 and the respective other IDR (Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> or Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>) are added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D, E</xref>), suggesting that both Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> can bind EH123 at the same time.</p><p id="P22">How is this possible when Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> occupy the same binding sites on EH123? Key to this question is likely the multivalency by which both IDRs interact with EH123, such that, while some motifs of Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> might be displaced from EH123 in a dynamic fashion when Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> is added – or vice versa - others maintain, thereby creating a dynamic trimeric (or even higher order) complex. Which of the motifs remain bound to EH123 and which get displaced is certainly a function of the individual motif’s affinities. This is easiest visualized as a dynamic equilibrium where motifs in Dab2 are competing with Eps15’s own IDR for binding to the EH domains, forming a complex and dynamic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The fact that neither Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> or Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> can effectively outcompete the other, suggests that the strengths of the individual interactions between EH123 and Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> or Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> are not vastly different. This further argues for a physiological relevance of the interactions seen between the EH domains and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> and the competition effects observed.</p><p id="P23">While binding of EH domains to an intrinsically disordered linker of the same protein has been observed for the EH domain contained in EHD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, the interaction network established by Eps15 is certainly remarkable, since so many interactions take place and compete with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This has implications for all other binding partners of Eps15, whether binding to the EH domains or Eps15’s IDR, since any binding partner will be competing with these intramolecular interactions. Indeed, the interactions observed between Eps15 EH domains and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> could constitute some kind of auto-inhibitory mechanism, such as recently described for WW domain proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, which could be (partially) released by other interaction partners, such as Dab2. In this context it should be noted, that the interactions between EH123 and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> could be both intramolecular within one Eps15 molecule and intermolecular between different Eps15 molecules. Indeed, Eps15-Eps15 interactions have previously been suggested to drive Eps15 phase separation in the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For example, based on previous literature on the interaction between the EH domain of POB1 and DPF motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, which are also contained in Eps15<sub>IDR</sub>, interaction between Eps15 EH domains and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> have been suggested to be important for liquid-liquid phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. While our molecular data show that not only DPF motifs, but also other F-rich protein regions are involved in this interaction, other interactions of similar strengths between Eps15 and its binding partners, may drive this partner into the liquid-like droplets, such as it has been observed for FCHo1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> or ubiquitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Of note, phenylalanines have been identified as critical ‘stickers’ to promote weak interactions in liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Usually, they are thought to interact with phenylalanines in other IDPs, thereby creating a dynamic interaction network. In the case of Eps15, we have observed phenylalanines to contact small folded domains (EH domains) – interactions that may also drive Dab2<sub>320-495</sub> into Eps15 droplets. In good agreement with this hypothesis, we observe that Dab2<sub>320-495</sub>, which does not form droplets on its own, also enters liquid-like droplets of Eps15, likely due to the weak multivalent network between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore, while current literature point to Eps15 as the main initiator of condensate formation during the early phases of CME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> our data suggest that Dab2 may be recruited into such condensates also in the cellular context, illustrating the role of a complex, promiscuous and multivalent interaction network to recruit downstream adaptors in endocytosis. Indeed, it will be interesting to see, whether the interactions between EH domains and Eps15<sub>IDR</sub> are maintained also in the presence of proteins containing multiple NPF motifs, binding with higher affinities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and what consequences this has on liquid-liquid phase separation at the endocytic pit and thus progression of productive endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Cloning</title><p id="P24">Eps15-pmCherryN1 was a gift from Christien Merrifield (Addgene plasmid # 27696 ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:27696">http://n2t.net/addgene:27696</ext-link> ; RRID:Addgene_27696)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.
