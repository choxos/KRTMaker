The transmembrane protease MT1-MMP plays a key role in localized matrix degradation, and its overexpression promotes cancer invasion. In this study, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP is trafficked to the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes, and subsequently released from cells on exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicle that can be retained to the surface of the originating cell by the anti-viral restriction factor, tetherin. While tetherin overexpression is linked to increased cell migration and invasion in various cancers, its role in these processes remains unclear. Our findings reveal that expression of tetherin by breast cancer cells promotes the retention of MT1-MMP-positive exosomes at their cell surface, while tetherin loss enhances exosome escape and impairs ECM degradation. Thus, tethered exosomes promote the retention of MT1-MMP at the surface of cells, aiding the degradation of the ECM and promoting cancer cell invasion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During metastasis, cells must degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) to create a path away from the solid tumor. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are a family of soluble or membrane-bound enzymes that cleave components of the ECM. MT1-MMP, also called MMP14, is a transmembrane domain-containing protein that plays a key role in regulating metastasis. MT1-MMP itself can cleave numerous ECM substrates, including collagen, fibronectin, laminin and gelatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ohuchi et al., 1997</xref>), and can also process and activate other MMPs, including MMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sato et al., 1994</xref>) and MMP-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Knäuper et al., 1996</xref>), further enhancing its ability to drive invasion.</p><p id="P3">ECM degradation by cells is promoted by the formation of podosomes (dendritic cells, macrophages, osteoclasts) or invadopodia (cancer cells) − actin-rich membrane protrusions that act as the focal point for MMP-mediated ECM cleavage. Following biosynthesis and traffic to the plasma membrane, MT1-MMP is efficiently internalized by clathrin-mediated and caveolar endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Poincloux et al., 2009</xref>) before being trafficked to late endosomes where it accumulates. Endosomes provide a reservoir of MT1-MMP that ensure focal delivery of MT1-MMP to the invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Marchesin et al., 2015</xref>). Dysregulation of endosomal trafficking machineries, including the retrograde components SNX27 and retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>), the ESCRT-0 component Hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">MacDonald et al., 2018</xref>), or the endosomal Arp2/3 activator Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and Scar homolog (WASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Monteiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">MacDonald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Marchesin et al., 2015</xref>) all impair MT1-MMP delivery to the cell surface, and subsequently impair ECM degradation.</p><p id="P4">Endosomes are dynamic intracellular organelles that play crucial roles in protein sorting within cells. Cargos at the limiting (outer) membrane of endosomes can be redistributed, and endosomes are subject to extensive remodeling. Cytosolic tubules or vesicles transfer content to and from endosomes, and vesicles can bud into the lumen of the endosome. These internal vesicles, known as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), are formed through ESCRT-dependent or ESCRT-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Babst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">van Niel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baietti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>) and endosomes containing ILVs are termed multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVE/MVBs). MVEs can fuse with lysosomes to form endolysosomes - catalytic organelles where substrates are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, MVEs can fuse with the plasma membrane, where their released ILVs become termed ‘exosomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Raposo et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A proportion of MT1-MMP recycles from late endosomes to invadopodia through the formation of endosomal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Marchesin et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, exogenously expressed tagged-MT1-MMP rather localizes to ILVs of MVEs and not to the limiting membrane of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rossé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wenzel et al., 2024</xref>). Consistent with MT1-MMP localizing of ILVs, MT1-MMP has also been found on exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hakulinen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wenzel et al., 2024</xref>). Indeed, MT1-MMP and other MMPs have been found on other types of extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Shimoda and Khokha, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Thuault et al., 2022</xref>). MT1-MMP positive extracellular vesicles maintain the ability to both cleave collagen and convert pro-MMP-2 to active MMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hakulinen et al., 2008</xref>). However, the relationship between MT1-MMP on ILVs/exosomes and invadopodia is not well understood.</p><p id="P6">Invadopodia act as critical docking and secretion sites for exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hoshino et al., 2013</xref>) and impairing invadopodia formation reduces exosome release from cells. Similarly, exosomes appear to promote the formation and maintenance of invadopodia through a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hoshino et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Exosomes and extracellular vesicles can shape the tumor microenvironment. Once exosomes are released from a cell, they can be transferred to other cells, or can interact with the ECM to remodel its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Karampoga et al., 2022</xref>). Whilst many studies focus on exosomes being released away from cells, exosomes can also remain associated to their cell of origin. We previously demonstrated that expression of the anti-viral restriction factor, tetherin, retains exosomes at the surface of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Edgar et al., 2016</xref>). Tetherin plays an analogous role in the tethering of enveloped virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kaletsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mandana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stewart et al., 2023</xref>) and midbody remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Presle et al., 2021</xref>). Tetherin is a type II integral membrane protein, that forms homodimers through conserved cysteine residues within its extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ohtomo et al., 1999</xref>). Tetherin expression correlates with poor survival in invasive breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mahauad-Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>) and promotes the invasiveness of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mahauad-Fernandez et al., 2014</xref>), although the mechanism linking tetherin and invasion is not well understood.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we aimed to determine how endogenous MT1-MMP is trafficked to EVs, and to analyse whether tetherin expression regulates the retention and release of MT1-MMP positive EVs. We found that endogenous MT1-MMP localizes predominately to ILVs, rather than to the limiting membrane of endosomes, and that MT1-MMP is retained at the surface of cells by tethered exosomes. Loss of tetherin enhances MT1-MMP positive exosome release and reduces the ability of cells to degrade the ECM. Together, these data highlight tethered exosomes as a contributor to ECM degradation, and detail how tetherin expression promotes invasiveness by cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MDA-MB-231 cells release sEVs/exosomes bearing MT1-MMP</title><p id="P9">MDA-MB-231 cells are triple negative breast cancers that form invadopodia and express endogenous MT1-MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Monteiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pedersen et al., 2020</xref>). To elucidate the endosomal trafficking of endogenous MT1-MMP we performed confocal microscopy of MDA-MB-231 cells stained for endogenous MT1-MMP and the following endosomal markers: EEA-1 for early endosomes, CD63 for multivesicular and late endosomes, Rab7 for late endosomes, LBPA for late endosomes and endolysosomes, and LAMP-1 for late endosomes, endolysosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Co-localization analysis showed that MT1-MMP localizes throughout the endosomal pathway (from early endosomes to lysosomes), but is enriched in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes, as suggested by higher levels of colocalization with CD63 and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>) and confirming previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Williams and Coppolino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Planchon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pedersen et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed co-localization of MT1-MMP with the retromer complex subunit VPS35 and the sorting nexin SNX27 that have been previously shown to facilitate the recycling of MT1-MMP from endosomes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Nevertheless, while MT1-MMP positive endosomes mostly appeared as “filled circles”, VPS35 and SNX27 staining appeared as “empty circles” (“donut shape”). Line scan analysis of endosomes positive for MT1-MMP and VPS35/SNX27 confirmed that VPS35 and SNX27 mostly decorate the outer profile of endosomes, while MT1-MMP appears enriched in the lumen of such endosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Cryo immunogold transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides sufficient resolution to determine antigen localization between subdomains of endosomes, including differentiating labelling to the outer membrane and ILVs, so we employed this method to further determine the sub-organellar localization of MT1-MMP. Immunogold TEM revealed a significant enrichment of MT1-MMP on ILVs of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Cargos trafficked to ILVs are degraded if the MVE fuses with the lysosome, or alternatively MVEs can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their ILVs in the extracellular space, where secreted ILVs are termed ‘exosomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Raposo et al., 1996</xref>). To assess the capacity of MT1-MMP to undergo lysosomal degradation, as also suggested by the colocalization of MT1-MMP with LBPA and LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), we treated cells with the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin for 2 or 4 hours. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed a small increase in MT1-MMP levels in leupeptin treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>). Confocal microscopy confirmed the accumulation of MT1-MMP in LAMP-1 positive compartments upon treatment with leupeptin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). A similar accumulation was observed when cells were treated with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of the V-ATPase (required for lysosomal acidification and degradative function) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>). Overall, these observations demonstrate that, at least a fraction of MT1-MMP is trafficked to lysosomes where it undergoes lysosomal degradation. We also stained cells with MagicRed, a live fluorescent reporter for Cathepsin B activity, that can be used as a marker of degradative endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly to CD63, MT1-MMP was found to only partially colocalize with MagicRed, confirming the presence of MT1-MMP in endosomes with degradative capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, G and H</xref>). MT1-MMP was also observed in MagicRed negative (non-catalytic) organelles, supporting the idea that a fraction of MT1-MMP might escape lysosomal degradation and be fated for exosome release.</p><p id="P11">To assess the capacity of MDA-MB-231 to release endogenous MT1-MMP on EVs/exosomes, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hakulinen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hoshino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beghein et al., 2018</xref>), we isolated small EVs (sEVs) using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), allowing the “EV enriched fraction” to be separated from the “soluble protein enriched fraction”. Transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>) and Flow Nano Analyzer (NanoFCM) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1J</xref>) confirmed the presence of sEVs in the “EV enriched fraction”. Western blot analysis of the two fractions confirmed the presence of sEVs markers (CD63, ALIX (ALG-2-interacting Protein X), syntenin) and the absence of the ER marker calnexin in the “EV enriched fraction” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). We also identified the full-length form of MT1-MMP in the sEV enriched fraction and its absence in the soluble protein enriched fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), confirming that a catalytically active transmembrane form of MT1-MMP is released through sEVs.</p><p id="P12">Treating cells with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) specifically increases the release of exosomes (derived from the endosomal system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Edgar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mathieu et al., 2021</xref>). Electron microscopy of BafA1 treated MDA-MB-231 cells showed the presence of enlarged endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1K</xref>), consistent with our immunofluorescence microscopy observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>). NanoFCM analysis confirmed that BafA1 treatment induced an increase of exosome release in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that CD63, syntenin and MT1-MMP levels were increased in sEV fractions upon BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F and G</xref>), suggesting that MT1-MMP positive sEVs originate in the endosomal system (exosomes). In contrast, CD9 levels in sEVs were not affected, suggesting that CD9 positive vesicles might originate mostly from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F and G</xref>), in agreement with recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mathieu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of live cells expressing CD63 tagged with a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein (pHluorin) has been previously used to quantify the dynamics of MVEs - PM fusion (hence exosome release) (Verweij et al., 2018). As we observed the presence of MT1-MMP on sEVs/exosomes we decided to compare the dynamics of CD63-pHluorin release to those of MT1-MMP-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">video 1</xref>). Additionally, we compared them with the dynamics of VAMP-2-pHluorin, a SNARE protein that inserts in the plasma membrane upon fusion of endosomes with the plasma membrane. We observed that the signal duration of both CD63- and MT1-MMP − pHluorin were significantly longer than that of VAMP-2-pHluorin, suggesting that, as for CD63, the secretion of MT1-MMP-pHluorin corresponds to an event of exosome release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">video 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Overall, these observations showed that MT1-MMP is enriched in ILVs of MVEs and can be released in the extracellular environment through exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MDA-MB-231 cells express tetherin and tether MT1-MMP-exosomes to the cell surface</title><p id="P15">Exosomes that are released in the extracellular space by donor cells can diffuse and be taken up by distant recipient cells.

These vesicles appear as clusters of exosomes on the surface of donor cells.</p><p id="P16">As breast tumors and triple-negative human breast cancer cell line such as MDA-MB-231 have been previously shown to express high levels of tetherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mahauad-Fernandez et al., 2014</xref>), we decided to investigate the capacity of these cells to tether exosomes. Western blot analysis of MDA-MB-231 cell lysates confirmed that these cells express high levels of tetherin and tetherin was also found on exosomes isolated by SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that tetherin localized abundantly to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, A and B</xref>). Moreover, tetherin colocalized strongly with MT1-MMP in punctate organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>), consistent with endosomal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Similarly to MT1-MMP, tetherin accumulated intracellularly upon treatment with BafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>), specifically in LAMP-1 positive compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). The levels of tetherin in EV-enriched fractions were also increased upon BafA1 treatment, suggesting that tetherin positive EVs are exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of non-permeabilized cells (surface staining) showed the presence of tetherin on the cell surface, which became less uniform upon treatment of cells with BafA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">However, as confocal microscopy does not allow one to definitively observe tethered EVs at the cell surface of cells, we performed conventional electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Only a few small EVs were observed in proximity of the cell surface of control cells, hence, to better analyze MDA-MB-231 cells, we induced exosome release using BafA1 as this increased the frequency of tethered exosome clusters at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).

Confocal microscopy and co-localization analysis of MT1-MMP with endosomal markers did not show any major change in MT1-MMP localization in Bst-2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A and S3B</xref>).

These data confirm that loss of tetherin impacts EV release of at least some EV subpopulations. As sEVs isolated from the cell culture media represent a heterogenous mix of vesicles with different origin whose release might or might not be affected by tetherin expression, we decided to specifically study the release of endosome derived exosomes using CD63-pHluorin and of MT1-MMP positive exosomes using MT1-MMP-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">video 2 and 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22">While the number of MVE-PM fusion events (identified by CD63 or MT1-MMP-pHlourin activity) was not affected by tetherin expression, the duration of the fusion events was decreased in Bst-2 KO cells.

In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to being delivered to the plasma membrane, MT1-MMP is also present on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)/exosomes, which are anchored to the surface of migrating cells via tetherin. The loss of tetherin from cells reduces the abundance of MT1-MMP-positive exosomes at the surface of cells, and exosomes are instead released to the extracellular environment, with a concomitant decrease in the invasiveness of cells.

Using cryo immunogold electron microscopy we demonstrate that MT1-MMP is localized to ILVs, rather than the limiting membrane or tubules of endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This traffic to ILVs is likely to preclude MT1-MMPs availability for traffic to invadopodia via endosomal tubules. Fusion of CD63 positive compartments with the plasma membrane releases exosomes (Verweij et al., 2018) and we confirm that MT1-MMP-positive extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-G</xref>) are exosomes that originate in the endosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Several pieces of evidence indicate that the balance of MT1-MMP traffic to ILVs/exosomes versus the limiting endosomal membrane/plasma membrane is an important determinant of MT1-MMP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Thuault et al., 2022</xref>), although the precise molecular mechanisms governing MT1-MMP sorting to ILVs and exosomes remain unclear and warrant further investigation.</p><p id="P32">Mono-ubiquitination of MT1-MMP at Lys<sup>581</sup> alters MT1-MMP trafficking, enhancing its presence at the surface of cells and promoting cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Eisenach et al., 2012</xref>).
