We previously identified that missense and splicing mutations in the MAPT gene, causal for frontotemporal dementia, result in nuclear envelope deformation and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport in human neurons. This is most likely due to microtubule mechanical stress, similar to that observed in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). A small molecule inhibitor of the acetyltransferase NAT10 has been shown to correct nuclear membrane defects in HGPS by modulating microtubule dynamics.

Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding MAPT are causal for a highly penetrant form of frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-tau), with more than 50 missense and intronic MAPT mutations identified as causal for FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Creekmore et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ghetti et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of missense mutations are in and around the microtubule-binding region, promoting protein aggregation, whereas the intronic mutations alter splicing of the repeat-encoding exon 10, increasing the amount of 4-microtubule binding repeat (4R) form relative to the 3-repeat (3R) form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Creekmore et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Previously, we reported that both intronic (MAPT IVS10+16) and missense (MAPT P301L) MAPT mutations are associated with abnormalities of the nuclear membrane in human neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>).

Tau-mediated disruption of the nuclear pore complex has been proposed as the pathogenic mechanism altering nucleocytoplasmic transport in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eftekharzadeh et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of tauopathy also exhibit nuclear abnormalities, with accumulation of mRNA in and around nuclear invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cornelison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Frost et al., 2016</xref>), together with disrupted heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Frost et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The occurrence and effects of the neuronal nuclear abnormalities observed in AD and FTD – nuclear lamina disruption, alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and changes in global heterochromatin – are similar to those identified in Hutchison-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a rare inherited laminopathy characterized by accelerated aging of non-neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pollex and Hegele, 2004</xref>). HGPS results from a mutation in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene that impairs the correct processing of prelamin A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pollex and Hegele, 2004</xref>). This leads to the accumulation of a shorter and toxic form of lamin A, known as progerin, causing disruption of nuclear membrane integrity and a characteristic cellular phenotype of nuclear blebbing. In cellular models of HGPS there is a disruption of cytoskeletal and microtubule dynamics as well as alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balmus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Larrieu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2014</xref>). In HGPS cell models, we found that the small molecule Remodelin, an inhibitor of the NAT10 acetyltransferase, corrects both nuclear shape abnormalities and the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Larrieu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, both Remodelin treatment and haploinsufficiency of NAT10 increased health and lifespan in a mouse model of HGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balmus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Given the similarities in the cellular phenotypes in human FTD-MAPT neurons and HGPS fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of inhibiting NAT10 in human tauopathy models <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> tauopathy model <italic>in vivo</italic>. We find that inhibition of NAT10 corrects nuclear invaginations in human iPSC-derived FTD-MAPT neurons and reduces microtubule elongation and mechanical stress on the nuclear envelope, improving nucleocytoplasmic transport.

These phenotypes are very similar to those observed in non-neural cells in the premature ageing condition, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), which are corrected by a small molecule inhibitor of the NAT10 acetyltransferase, Remodelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Larrieu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we first investigated whether nuclear lamina defects in human FTD-MAPT neurons are affected by NAT10 inhibition.</p><p id="P8">To do so, cortical excitatory neurons were generated from iPSCs derived from two different individuals carrying the pathological MAPT IVS10+16 mutation (MAPT IVS10+16-A and MAPT IVS10+16-B), an isogenic corrected line (MAPT IVS10+16 B-isogenic) and an unrelated, independent non-demented control line. Ninety (90) days from the initiation of neuronal differentiation, neurons were treated with the NAT10 inhibitor Remodelin for 48 hours and the frequency of nuclear lamina invaginations in neurons scored based on Lamin B1 staining (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for details).</p><p id="P9">Consistent with our previous data, FTD-MAPT neurons had a higher frequency of nuclear invaginations compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

Disruption of the nuclear lamina and chromatin reorganization have previously been reported in adults expressing pan-neuronal human MAPT R406W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Frost et al., 2016</xref>), which also shortened their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Wittmann et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To determine whether inhibition of NAT10 with Remodelin corrects nuclear membrane defects <italic>in vivo</italic>, MAPT R406W-expressing animals were maintained on food containing either vehicle or 100μM Remodelin, the highest concentration without developmental toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Frost et al., 2016</xref>), pan-neuronal expression of MAPT R406W resulted in neuronal nuclear lamina invaginations in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

Acute treatment with the microtubule-destabilizing compound, nocodazole, restored nuclear shape, demonstrating that nuclear membrane deformation is a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether NAT10 inhibition with Remodelin impacts microtubule dynamics in both control and FTD-MAPT neurons.</p><p id="P14">To do so, we introduced a construct driving expression of the microtubule tip-binding protein, EB3, fused to GFP and driven by the neuron-specific promoter, Synapsin1 (<italic>pSyn1</italic>:EB3-GFP) into control and FTD-MAPT human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Neuronal expression of GFP was observed within one day, and most cells were positive within three days. Single-plane videos of EB3-GFP were captured enabling microtubule growth to be tracked and analyzed in individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">FTD neurons exposed to Remodelin for 24 hours demonstrated a reduction in EB3-GFP track duration, whereas Remodelin had no effect on EB3 track duration in isogenic and unrelated non-demented control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). EB3-GFP track duration is a measure of microtubule growth. A reduction in track duration indicates an overall reduction in microtubule elongation within FTD neurons following NAT10 inhibition. This decrease in microtubule elongation, which accompanies the correction of nuclear lamina defects, is consistent with our previous observation that nocodazole treatment rectifies nuclear lamina defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that NAT10 inhibition corrects nuclear lamina defects by modulating microtubule dynamics, reducing mechanical stress on the nuclear membranes of FTD neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in FTD-MAPT neurons are reversed by inhibition of NAT10</title><p id="P16">Impaired nuclear membrane integrity and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport are significant pathologies in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and ALS-FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kim and Taylor, 2017</xref>). More recently, disruption of nuclear pore complexes and aberrant nucleocytoplasmic transport have been found in ALS due to <italic>C9ORF72</italic> expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eftekharzadeh et al., 2018</xref>) and FTD-MAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>). In the latter study, we found that the aberrant nucleocytoplasmic transport in human FTD-MAPT neurons was corrected by acute exposure to the microtubule depolymerizing small molecule nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Therefore, we tested whether the correction of nuclear lamina defects by NAT10 inhibition and the reported effect on microtubules was accompanied by an improvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport. To do so, we carried out fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in iPSC-derived neurons expressing Shuttle-tdTomato, a NLS-NES-tagged TdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) that dynamically moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm. As expected, Shuttle-tdTomato was enriched in the nucleus of infected iPSC-derived neurons, with a less in the cytoplasm and neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our working hypothesis was that increased nucleus-cytoplasm diffusion in FTD-MAPT neurons that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>) would result in a faster recovery rate of tdTomato signal after photobleaching within the nucleus, compared to healthy control neurons.</p><p id="P18">To test whether this is the case, and if it could be corrected by inhibition of NAT10, neurons expressing Shuttle-tdTomato were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or Remodelin for 24 hours before FRAP analysis in neuronal nuclei. Vehicle-treated FTD-MAPT neurons showed a faster recovery of nuclear tdTomato signal compared to either NDC or MAPT IVS10+16B isogenic control neurons, indicating aberrant nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, C and E</xref>), consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>). Inhibition of NAT10 by treatment with Remodelin for 24 hours slowed the recovery of nuclear tdTomato in FTD-MAPT neurons, such that the rate of FRAP was indistinguishable between NAT10-treated FTD-MAPT, isogenic and unrelated NDC control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, D and F</xref>). Therefore, NAT10 inhibition with Remodelin corrects nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in MAPT-FTD neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Reduction of NAT10 protein corrects nuclear lamina defects in human FTD-MAPT neurons</title><p id="P19">To confirm that the effects of Remodelin in human neurons are via its known target, NAT10, we sought to generate NAT10 loss of function FTD-neurons. Consistent with evidence that NAT10 is an essential gene for development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balmus et al., 2018</xref>), we could not successfully generate NAT10 knockout human iPSCs by CRISPR-mediated gene targeting (data not shown).</p><p id="P20">As an alternative strategy, we acutely knocked down NAT10 in neurons using siRNAs (NAT10 KD). Following siRNA delivery, NAT10 mRNA and protein were both reduced by over 60% in neurons, without impacting neuronal viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 A-C</xref>). NAT10 KD corrected the frequency of nuclear lamina defects in FTD-MAPT neurons compared to a scrambled control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), and to a comparable degree as Remodelin inhibition of NAT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, acute loss of NAT10 function, or small molecule inhibition of its acetyltransferase activity, corrects nuclear lamina defects in human FTD-MAPT neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> NAT10 haploinsufficiency corrects nuclear defects and extends lifespan in an <italic>in vivo</italic> tauopathy</title><p id="P21">We tested whether reducing NAT10 <italic>in vivo</italic> corrects tauopathy phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAPT-R406W model. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of NAT10, l(1)G0020 (dNAT10) shares 53% homology with human NAT10, and the acetyltransferase domain of dNAT10, the likely target of Remodelin, is conserved between the species. The dNAT10 mutant line (l(1)G0020(1)/FM7c ; + : +; Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center #11474) is homozygous lethal: only balanced males (FM7c/y) and heterozygous or homozygous balanced females (l(1)G0020/FM7c or FM7c/FM7c) emerge as adults. This is consistent with our results that NAT10 KO iPSCs are not viable, and with the previously reported lethality of homozygous NAT10 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balmus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Therefore, to investigate the effects of reducing NAT10 function in tauopathy model animals, we generated heterozygous dNAT10 mutants expressing R406W MAPT (tau).

Furthermore, MAPT-R406W; heterozygous dNAT10 mutant animals had increased lifespan compared with MAPT-R406W alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Furthermore, microtubule dynamics were only altered by NAT10 inhibition in FTD-MAPT neurons, with no effect on non-demented and isogenic control neurons. The widely accepted canonical function of tau protein is to stabilize axonal microtubules, however tau can also promote microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Drubin and Kirschner, 1986</xref>). The findings presented here suggest that accumulation of tau in FTD-MAPT neurons results in a gain-of-function effect on microtubule dynamics, promoting microtubule formation in the neuronal cell body, altering their elongation and enabling transfer of mechanical forces to the nuclear membrane, deforming the nuclear lamina. Abnormal neuronal cell body microtubule dynamics, promoted by tau accumulation, may disrupt the nuclear membrane directly via LINC complex-mediated microtubule-nuclear envelope interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kalukula et al., 2022</xref>). However, interactions between tau protein aggregates and the nuclear pore complex have been detected both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eftekharzadeh et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, another possible mechanism for tau’s disruption of the nuclear membrane is via tau-mediated coupling of microtubules to the nuclear pore complex.</p><p id="P27">How NAT10 inhibition and loss of function correct microtubule-mediated nuclear membrane disruption in FTD-MAPT neurons is currently unclear.

We have previously confirmed that can NAT10 acetylate tubulin, and that this can be inhibited by Remodelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Larrieu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus NAT10 may directly enhance microtubule stability via tubulin acetylation, a modification that promotes microtubule flexibility and overall stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ed et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that microtubule acetylation in the cell body is reduced by NAT10 inhibition, combined with microtubule deacetylation by one or more of the known microtubule deacetylases, including HDAC6 and SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Naren et al., 2023</xref>). In this case, reduced microtubule flexibility and stability would relieve the deforming forces on the nuclear envelope, as we have previously observed with acute microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Paonessa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Overall, this study highlights the importance of nuclear lamina integrity and microtubule dynamics in the pathology of FTD and other tauopathies, and it proposes a novel therapeutic approach to target these cellular processes. Further research is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which Remodelin exerts its effects and to explore its potential as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by tau pathology. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of Remodelin treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> and investigate whether these cellular improvements translate into functional benefits and neuroprotection in other animal models of tauopathies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Human iPSC lines</title><p id="P29">MAPT IVS10+16-A and MAPT IVS10+16-B mutant iPSCs were as reported in (Sposito et al., 2015).
