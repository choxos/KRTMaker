It is involved in endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptors, β1-integrin and membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease and in mitochondrial-derived vesicles. Its BAR-PX domain binds phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) and its SH3 domain interacts with dynamin and N-WASP to stimulate Arp2/3 complex actin polymerization during vesicle scission. Recent complexities have arisen in SNX9’s lipid specificity and its involvement both endocytic and filopodial membrane topologies. Here we use biolayer interferometry, cell-free reconstitution and superresolution microscopy to analyse the activities of SNX9. We find that more SNX9 binds membranes that contain PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3)P compared with PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, despite having similar affinity, suggesting SNX9 can assemble into different macromolecular arrangements depending on the composition. Actin assembly requires the wider protein and lipid network provided by PX-BAR and SH3 interactions. 3D direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy on filopodia-like reconstitutions shows that SNX9 and related protein Transducer of Cdc42 activation-1 (TOCA-1) are competent to form both tubular and plaque-like organizations with the actin machinery. Finally, using cryo-electron tomography we show that SNX9 assembles both branched and bundled actin filaments demonstrating its multifunctional nature.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9) is a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>), actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gallop et al., 2013</xref>), and membrane remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hicks et al., 2015</xref>). SNX9 is also involved in the formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) for mitochondrial quality control and cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Todkar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Towers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zecchini et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">SNX9 expression is increased in metastatic breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bendris et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">2016a</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tanigawa et al., 2019</xref>) and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shukla et al., 2023</xref>), amongst others. In metastatic breast cancer, elevated SNX9 levels are associated with enhanced endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor, which drives aggressive cell signaling pathways that promote tumor growth, survival, and invasion. SNX9 expression can also be decreased in primary tumors indicating a context-dependent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bendris et al., 2016a</xref>). In colorectal cancer, SNX9 is upregulated, particularly in advanced stages, correlating with poor prognosis and influencing integrin trafficking, which is essential for cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tanigawa et al., 2019</xref>). In the immune response, SNX9 localizes to the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ecker et al., 2022</xref>) and has been implicated in T-cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Trefny et al., 2023</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ish-Shalom et al., 2016</xref>) as well as mutations upstream of the SNX9 gene being implicated in increased propensity to developing long Covid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Taylor et al., 2023</xref>). Because SNX9 deletion in mice has little effect on development or physiology in healthy conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), SNX9 may represent a disease-relevant target despite its ubiquitous expression across cell types. Like orthologs SNX18 and SNX33, with which it is partially redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Park et al., 2010</xref>), SNX9 contains conserved PX (phox homology) and BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domains, which enables it to sense and induce membrane curvature and facilitate vesicle trafficking events. The BAR domain of SNX9 forms a crescent-shaped dimer and the combined BAR-PX domain forms higher order oligomers that can bind a wide variety of phosphoinositide lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Yarar et al., 2008</xref>). The SH3 domain of SNX9 binds Neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP), linking the phosphoinositide lipid binding of SNX9 to guanosine triphosphate-bound cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42•GTP) and Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). SNX9 also interacts with endocytic proteins dynamin and Adaptor Protein-2 (AP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Soulet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lo et al., 2017</xref>). SNX9 interacts with dynamin, a GTPase essential for vesicle scission, via its proline-rich motifs, allowing SNX9 to coordinate the final steps of vesicle fission through the formation of tight constriction at the vesicle neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). Binding of clathrin adaptor AP-2 to SNX9 derepresses an autoinhibitory conformation of SNX9, where AP-2 outcompetes the PX-BAR domains in binding to a low-complexity linker region to ensure accurate control of membrane remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lo et al., 2017</xref>). Given that around half of clathrin-mediated endocytic events involve N-WASP and actin recruitment in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>), actin polymerization linked to endocytosis, scission and subsequent vesicle trafficking represents a key downstream effector function of SNX9.</p><p id="P5">SNX9 has been reported to bind to a range of phosphoinositide lipids, but which interactions are functionally important is less clear. While the SNX9 PX-BAR domain was reported to bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> similarly, the inclusion of additional PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding proteins in computational simulations of endocytosis led to a selectivity of SNX9 for PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, although the possibility of other PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> effectors being present was not considered in the models (Schöneberg et al., 2017). Although SNX9 is responsible for a 5-fold increase in actin polymerization to membranes containing a coincidence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gallop et al., 2013</xref>), it has not been determined how the binding of SNX9 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3)P compares to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. SNX18 and SNX33 also bind well to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3)P and mutations in the BAR domain reduces SNX9 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and mutations in the PX domain to PI(3)P respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with a functional role for PI(3)P, reducing the levels of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (INPP4A) that hydrolyses PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(3)P reduced endocytosis in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>) and an auxilin conjugated-PI(3)P probe localizes to endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">He et al., 2017</xref>). Either PI(3)P or PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> can alleviate the inhibition in endocytosis caused by reducing the levels of class II phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), again supporting a functional role for PI(3)P, though a role during endocytosis for the relevant 4-phosphatases INPP4A/B that could produce PI(3)P from PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is not as clear as its later role at endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The picture of how SNX9 operates in cells is complicated by the involvement of SNX9 in negative membrane curvature scenarios. The BAR-PX domain bends membranes in positive (endocytic) directions yet <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> uses SNX9 to increase viral spread by filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ford et al., 2018</xref>), finger-like protrusions from the cell surface comprising a bundle of actin filaments surrounded by highly negatively curved plasma membrane. This suggests that SNX9 can play important roles at sites of actin polymerization regardless of the apparent curvature preference of the BAR-PX domain, perhaps due to actin forces overriding this preference. Consistent with this, overexpression of SNX9 causes filopodial protrusion in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hicks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bendris and Schmid, 2017</xref>) and endogenous SNX9 localises to filopodial tips in cultured cells and a subset of <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jarsch et al., 2020</xref>). Other positively curved BAR domain proteins, including transducer of Cdc42- dependent actin assembly protein 1 (TOCA-1), localise to filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Saengsawang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blake et al., 2024</xref>) and it is not known how the BAR domain curvature is reconciled with the local membrane curvature at these sites. SNX9 is linked to the formation of branched actin via N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, while TOCA-1, also interacts with Drf3, Ena and VASP to promote linear actin bundles. It is not clear whether SNX9 can contribute to making bundled actin, as implied by its filopodia localization.</p><p id="P7">We recently found that our cell-free system of filopodia-like structures (FLS) requires SNX9, and that metabolism of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> through PI3K activity to PI(3)P was essential for its involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jarsch et al., 2020</xref>). This system uses <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, subjected to a high speed centrifugation step, which give a complex cytosolic environment without endogenous membranes. When applied to supported lipid bilayers enriched with 10% mole fraction PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, these extracts reconstitute filopodia-like structures that grow up from the glass coverslip. They are visualized using fluorescently labelled G-actin, or other fluorescent probes added into the extracts, and spinning disk confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we sought to shed light on how SNX9 functions in complex environments by comparing the response of purified SNX9 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, and by examining the role of SNX9 domains, interaction partners and topologies of the actin and membrane structures associated with SNX9 in the cell-free system.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The binding characteristics of SNX9 to membranes of different composition implies different multimeric arrangements</title><p id="P8">SNX9 is frequently described as a PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> binding protein (Posor et al., 2013; Schöneberg et al., 2017). Similar binding of purified SNX9 to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> as to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> has been seen by surface plasmon resonance (Schöneberg et al., 2017), similar to earlier sedimentation assays that showed promiscuous SNX9 binding to different phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Yarar et al., 2008</xref>). However, for its activities in actin polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic>, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with PI(3)P is the far superior lipid combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gallop et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). Phosphoinositide lipids can be interconverted, which complicates data interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To address these contradictions, we compared the binding of SNX9 to membranes of different composition using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry (BLI). We used a membrane composition similar to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. To maximise membrane integrity we used 60-70% phosphatidylcholine (PC, rather than phosphatidylethanolamine) and 30% phosphatidylserine to retain a representative level of plasma membrane negative charge. We then substituted PC for the phosphoinositide lipids. Liposomes comprised of 70% PC/30% PS were included in each experiment and the trace subtracted from the phosphoinositide lipid-containing liposome trace. Occasionally the PC/PS trace was aberrantly high, and in that case if the phosphoinositide runs had been consistent with previous observations, we used the average of 9 other control runs for background subtraction.</p><p id="P10">Using 1 μM full-length SNX9, the presence of both 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and 1% PI(3)P together in the liposomes gives substantially increased SNX9 binding compared with PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, by SPR, recapitulated with BLI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Binding increases over the first 600 s and reaches a near-plateau by 2000 s. Little dissociation is observed in any condition. We found that BLI was less complicated to implement as in SPR the injection needle frequently clogged in the absence of detergents. Therefore, we continued with BLI. To assess the relative contribution of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3)P, we titrated the mole fraction of either PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PI(3)P whilst keeping the other constant. Existing binding models were a poor fit to the data so we quantified the overall response by taking the average response in the last 20 s of the association phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, with the original background-subtracted traces in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1A-C</xref>). In the absence of PI(3)P, the binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> alone is no greater than binding to the PC/PS background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, orange line, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1A</xref>). Addition of 1% PI(3)P leads to increases in binding across 1%, 4% and 10% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, green and magenta lines, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, a further increase to 4% PI(3)P decreases binding, suggesting that there is an optimum density of PI(3)P for the SNX9 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> magenta line compared with green line, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1C</xref>). As BAR domain proteins form multimeric protein arrangements on the membrane surfaces, this suggests that the SNX9 protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions involved can be disrupted by different balances of phosphoinositide lipid interactions.</p><p id="P11">We then measured binding at progressive concentrations of SNX9 at the different key membrane compositions (summary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, original traces <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1D-G</xref>). Taking PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/1% PI(3)P as our reference, we measured the response to increasing SNX9 at 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, 1% PI(3)P and 5% PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Overall, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> / PI(3)P gives more binding at all SNX9 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The behaviours are also complex as the shapes of the original traces show differences between lipid compositions and the nature of the binding changes with protein concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1E-G</xref>). The binding curve to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3)P alone first rises quickly and then continues a slow rise and does not complete binding over 2000 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1D,F</xref>). In contrast, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3)P rise quickly and have a smooth transition to a phase of gradually increasing binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1E, G</xref>). While 1 μM SNX9 gives a plateau when interacting with 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> / 1% PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1G</xref>) at higher SNX9 concentrations binding continues to rise, showing a trend towards a plateau with PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> at 10 μM SNX9 and not with the others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 1E</xref>). In all cases, there is little dissociation, suggesting a strong matrix of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions.</p><p id="P13">The response of SNX9 binding to protein concentration to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is quantitatively similar to previous measurements using the BAR-PX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lo et al., 2017</xref>; Schöneberg et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>). The slightly higher half maximal binding we observe (2.5 μM SNX9 compared to 1.5 μM in previous work) could arise from the autoinhibitory interaction between the SH3 domain and the BAR domain because we used full-length protein. The data indicate that SNX9 binds to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plus PI(3)P with the same affinity as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> alone, but interestingly, with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plus PI(3)P the extent of SNX9 binding is much greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together with the distinct shapes of the binding curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1D-G</xref>), we think this indicates that there is a different multimeric arrangement of SNX9 taking place on membranes of different composition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Within a cytosolic environment PI(3)P increases actin assembly and SNX9 recruitment to actin sites whereas PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> does not</title><p id="P14">To visualize the contributions of PI(3)P concentration to SNX9 activity at actin superstructures, we used the cell-free system of FLS that nucleate on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-enriched supported lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). We visualized actin using Alexa488-conjugated rabbit actin and labelled SNAP-SNX9 with chemical fluorophore Alexa Fluor-647 <italic>in vitro</italic>, titrating it into the extracts at low levels that did not affect FLS growth. FLS have the advantage that while the actin is dynamic, the membrane clustered complex of proteins is anchored near the glass and the proteins that cluster to the actin sites can be quantified.</p><p id="P15">We examined the dose-dependent response to PI(3)P by adding it in the presence and absence of wortmannin, which will inhibit phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). As described previously, wortmannin treatment eliminates FLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jarsch et al., 2020</xref>). We saw a dose-responsive increase in FLS with increasing mole fraction of PI(3)P in the presence of wortmannin, suggesting that the presence of PI(3)P is the limiting component. Without wortmannin no further activation or inhibition is observed suggesting that native levels of phosphoinositide conversion in the extracts are making the PI(3)P already (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). These results also suggest that the inhibition by PI(3)P observed at high levels by BLI may not be relevant in a more complex protein milieu where SNX9 is binding other proteins and other proteins will also be binding the PI(3)P. Higher levels of PI(3)P increased SNX9 intensity at FLS while the fraction of FLS with SNX9 present above background intensity levels stayed at approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We have previously observed that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> does not functionally rescue in the presence of wortmannin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we compared the supplementation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, by comparison to PI(3)P in native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). There is a significant decrease in FLS length with additional PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> compared with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> alone or supplemented PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In liposomes adding PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> let to a decrease in polymerization when no PI(3)P was present by pyrene actin measurements as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). Both supplemented conditions slightly decrease the numbers of FLS forming on the membrane, perhaps due to other binding proteins being recruited to the membrane, occluding possible sites of FLS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To visualize the locations of added phosphoinositide lipids in this experiment we employed PI(3)P binding probe mCherry-2xFYVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>) and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> binding probe eGFP-PH2x(TAPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dowler et al., 2000</xref>; Posor et al., 2013). The intensity of 2xFYVE detected in the supported bilayers under FLS is increased with both PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, as well as the proportion of FLS with 2xFYVE localization, showing that PI(3)P can be produced at FLS from the added PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The intensity of 2xTAPP is low in native conditions and increases in both intensity and proportion of FLS when additional PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is added and a small decrease when PI(3)P is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is not being made from PI(3)P. The SNX9 intensity and proportion of labelled FLS remained similar across the supplemented conditions again confirming that native levels provided by the extract enzyme activities are sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Overall, our data indicates that in the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3)P stimulates both SNX9 recruitment and resulting actin polymerization whereas PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is inhibitory, despite its similar binding affinity to SNX9.

To do this, we immunodepleted SNX9 from the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and added back purified full-length SNX9 with point mutations in the BAR domain (K511E/K517E), PX domain (Y276A/K302A) or SH3 domain (W42K) (the protein purification gels are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

All three mutated proteins are unable to restore either FLS number, length or base area compared to re-addition of wild type SNX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 C-E</xref>). This demonstrates that all three interactions of the BAR domain with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the PX domain with PI(3)P and the SH3 domain with N-WASP and other binding partners are essential for its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">It is known that immunodepletion of N-WASP inhibits FLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). As well as N-WASP, the SH3 domain of SNX9 notably interacts with dynamin which is implicated in bundling actin independently of its role in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We found that dynamin localizes to FLS similar to previous data with <italic>Listeria</italic> actin comets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-C</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lee and Camilli, 2002</xref>)), whereas endocytic proteins endophilin and clathrin do not co-localize with actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is likely because there are no transmembrane proteins within the supported lipid bilayers. To test the functional role of dynamin we used dynole compounds, where 34-2 is active and 31-2 an inactive chemically related compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hill et al., 2009</xref>). Dynole 34-2 inhibits FLS formation and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-E</xref>) and also prevents SNX9 and dynamin recruitment to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F-G</xref>).

To visualize the topology of SNX9 clusters at FLS we used 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope fitted with a cylindrical lens to assign positions in the z-axis. FLS were visualized in parallel with Alexa Fluor-488 actin imaged by wide field illumination. We subjected the field of view to repeated switching of the Alexa 647 fluorophore labelling either SNX9 or TOCA-1 and reconstructed STORM images.</p><p id="P22">Typically 6-7 SNX9 foci underneath actin-rich FLS could be seen in any one field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). While by TIRF microscopy the foci are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), by STORM three broad types of SNX9 arrangement could be seen: flat, plaque-like clusters that do not elevate in the z-axis (a, b), tubule-like with a lumen empty of SNX9 localizations (c, d, e) and a hybrid of both (f, g). An elevation of 500 nm is typically observed, which was within the calibration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The x-y width of the tubules is around 1 μm with the plaques typically wider, so overall a similar membrane area may be covered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). To test whether a related protein at FLS shows similar arrangements, we examined F-BAR domain protein Transducer of Cdc42 activation 1 (TOCA-1) and saw equivalent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-H</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We wondered whether the tubule structures could be caused by liposomes remaining on the supported bilayer surface, leading to nucleation of the FLS. To test this we labelled PLCδ PH domain, applied it to the supported bilayers without frog egg extract and performed a STORM experiment. No vesicles or elevations similar to those seen with SNX9 could be observed (Sup. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Adding both PLCδ PH domain and TOCA-1 again failed to lead to tubule or plaque formation, which were only formed when extracts were added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

The presence of tubules and plaques was independent of the TOCA-1 concentration added in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figure 4</xref>). To test the contributions of the extracts, we used different concentrations. At higher extract concentrations, FLS are shorter and wider, presumably due to differences in the balance between disassembly and assembly factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

While tubules and plaques are both still evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), the surface area and height covered by the localizations is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-D</xref>). The number of localizations of SNX9 has a strong reduction in the presence of LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The TOCA-1 foci present form both tubule and plaque morphologies and there is less effect of LatB on the z-extent or cluster diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F-G</xref>). There is also less reduction in TOCA-1 localizations consistent with previous observations showing TOCA-1 remains on the membrane with LatB treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dobramysl et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H-J</xref>). The data indicates that BAR domain proteins collaborate with multiple other proteins present in the extracts to assemble into either tubules or plaques on the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> supported bilayers. In addition, the actin-driven network is important for SNX9 recruitment (consistent with the SH3 domain mutant result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Both branched actin comets and unbranched parallel actin bundles can arise downstream of SNX9 activity</title><p id="P25">Given the role for two Arp2/3 complex activators at filopodia tips (TOCA-1 and SNX9) as well as the tubular/endocytic types of morphologies we saw in STORM, we sought to verify the previous electron microscopy result that FLS are comprised of elongated and bundled actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). FLS have previously been visualized by electron microscopy using phalloidin stabilization and formaldehyde fixation followed by negative stain, that showed the actin filaments tightly apposed and where they collapse and fray slightly, long, unbranched actin filaments are revealed. This agrees with the presence of fascin through the FLS shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). With the recent progress in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) methods, we took as less invasive a protocol as possible. To preserve FLS in their native form, we simply scratched the surface of the glass after 25 minutes of FLS growth on the supported bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>) and pipetted them onto EM grids. No branched actin comets were visible in any of our FLS tomograms. The resulting tomograms verify the bundled architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B-C</xref>). To look at bundling more closely, we examined the FLS in transverse sections, where we saw areas with the characteristic hexagonal packing of fascin-bundled filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>, insets a-b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref> inset a).

In stark contrast to FLS, this actin is highly branched, with the branching maintained throughout the length of the network that originates from the liposome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F-G</xref>, inset a shows a closeup of the branching indicated with yellow arrows).

Our data shows that the presence of long, bundled actin filaments is dependent on a unique feature of FLS growing from a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> supported bilayer. This actin morphology is not recapitulated by liposomes, despite the essential contribution of SNX9 to both, and presence of PI(3)P and curved SNX9/TOCA-1 intermediates at FLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">We have shown that while half maximal binding concentrations of SNX9 for different phosphoinositide-containing liposomes is similar, the coincidence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3)P allows more SNX9 to bind the liposome surface. This suggests that different multimeric arrangements of SNX9 are attained with different membrane composition. The difference in SNX9 binding to different membrane compositions is particularly acute at low SNX9 concentrations, which is the situation in cells, where SNX9 is present at approximately 120 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>). We have shown that SNX9 recruitment to sites of actin polymerization is driven by lipids, its SH3 domain interaction partners and actin itself. This suggests that there is a cooperative network of membrane and actin regulators that centres around SNX9 organization. At FLS where SNX9 is involved in assembling actin, it can be present in either tubular or plaque-like morphologies, and we show evidence that actin and other factors in the extracts collaborate to bring about membrane deformation. SNX9 recruitment is reduced more than TOCA-1 in the presence of LatB, in agreement with previous data that TOCA-1 is an early protein to arrive at sites of FLS formation and its early role in nucleating filopodia themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dobramysl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blake et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Our work cannot distinguish whether the force provided by actin or BAR domains is the critical factor in membrane deformation.

The comparison of the actin superstructures by light microscopy and cryo-ET highlights the inability of light microscopy to distinguish actin bundling status. Both PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3)P are present at both the supported lipid bilayers (by addition and conversion from the extracts) and in the small liposomes (by addition) and in both cases there is a SNX9 dependent activation of the Arp2/3 complex.

Eluents were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis to identify pure fractions before being aliquoted with 10% glycerol, snap-frozen and stored at -80°C.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining of protein purification and western-blot analysis of immunodepletions</title><p id="P42">30 μL of affinity purified, gel-filtered eluate, or 1:10 dilution of lysate/ depleted lysate with 1x Sample buffer was boiled at 95°C for 2-5 minutes. Samples were loaded on NuPAGE bis/tris 4-20% precast gels (BioRad). Electrophoresis was done for 40 minutes at 185 V. Polyacrylamide gels for Coomassie stained were incubated for 30-minutes or overnight with Coomassie stain. After incubation the gels were destained overnight with distilled water. For western blot analysis, 2 μg of extracts (either depleted, mock or untreated) were diluted with 1x sample buffer, 10 μL of which was used for gel0electrophoresis. After run, polyacrylamide gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot 2 Dry Blotting system (for 7 minutes at 20V). After transfer, membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST. Incubation with primary antibody (polyclonal anti-SNX9 antibody) diluted in 1% milk in TBST overnight at 4°C. This was followed by washing 3 times with PBST. Secondary antibody incubation was done for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing 3 times in TBST.

All experiments were conducted using Aminopropylsilane (APS) biosensors (Sartorius). APS sensors were washed in baseline buffer: HBS-N buffer supplemented with 2 mM DTT. Liposomes were immobilised onto the APS surface for 1500 s, after which the sensor was washed with baseline buffer. The surface was then blocked with 0.5% BSA for 600 s, succeeded by another wash step. The baseline was allowed to stabilise before studying protein binding. The probe was moved to well with protein, allowing for protein to bind to liposomes (association step) which continued for 2000 s, after which the probe was moved into a buffer only well for 1500 s to promote dissociation of proteins. All binding curves were corrected with a PC/PS only control and were then corrected to the baseline preceding the association phase.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Surface Plasmon Resonance</title><p id="P44">A manual SPR run was conducted using BIAcore T200 using a Series S L1 chip (Cytiva). Liposomes were individually immobilised (~25 minutes) with a flow rate of 2 μL/ min. Post immobilisation, all channels in the chip were washed for 30 s with HEPES-buffer saline (HBS-N) pH 7.4, to remove unbound liposomes. SNX9 was subsequently injected over all 4 channels at 2 μL/ min for 10-minutes. Dissociation of SNX9 was allowed to occur over 30-minutes, following which, the final 30 s wash (2 μL/min) with HBS-N was conducted before, the dextran matrix was regenerated with a 2x 30 s 50 mM NaOH/ isopropanol (2 μL/ min).

The glass in the resultant wells was passivated with 5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 90 minutes. The wells were washed three times with 1x XB. Wells were left in 1x XB until they were ready for use. Liposomes for the actin formation on LUVs were filtered to 100 nm and comprised of 65% PC / 30% PS / 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/ 1% PI(3)P. For the assay, liposomes were diluted: 3 μL / 25 μL in 1x XB after which they were added to the well. These were allowed to settle for 10 minutes, after which a 25 μL ‘actin-mix’ was added including 2 mM DTT, 3.6 mg / mL <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, and 1x Energy mix.

For actin comets on LUVs, data collection was performed at the London Consortium for Cryo-EM (LonCEM) facility using a Titan Krios G3i microscope operating at 300 keV equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector. Tilt series were collected in K3 super-resolution mode using a dose-symmetric protocol with a dose of 2.96 e<sup>-</sup>/tilt and a step size of 3° starting from 0° and progressing to ±60°. The defocus range was set between -2.5 μm and -5 μm, with a physical pixel size of 3.33 Å. For FLS, data were collected at the Birkbeck facility on a Titan Krios microscope operating at 300 keV with a K3 detector in super-resolution mode. Tilt series were collected using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme, starting from 0° and incrementing by 3° up to ±60°. A physical pixel size of 3.4 Å was used, and the defocus range was set between -3.0 μm and -7.0 μm. Fiducial-less tilt series alignment was performed with AreTomo v1.4.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>) followed by Wiener-filtered tomogram reconstruction in either RELION-4 (with binning factor of 4, final pixel size of 13.3 Å) (Kimanius et al., 2021) or RELION-5 (with a binning factor of 6, final pixel size of 20.4 Å) (Burt et al., 2024) for the actin comets or FLS datasets respectively. Representative images were created in IMOD software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). To determine the inter-filament distances, the tomogram was rotated in the slicer window of IMOD to identify a section with a cross-section through the actin bundle. One actin filament was centered in the field of view as a reference point and the centres of neighbouring filaments identified by clicking ‘Q’ on keyboard to read out the distance. These distances were reported in nm and plotted using GraphPad (Prism).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Preparation of FLS for super-resolution imaging using direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM)</title><p id="P48">FLS were stabilized by adding 20 μM unlabeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, no. P3457) for 5 min. FLS were carefully washed with XB buffer twice to remove any loose actin floating in solution and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for at least 60 min. Fixed FLS were washed three times with XB to remove the formaldehyde. Stock solutions of STORM buffer components were mixed together at a ratio of 30 μL, 500 μL, and 60 μL: enzyme mix [20 μg/ml catalase (Sigma), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma)], glucose solution [100 mg/ml D-Glucose (Sigma) in ddH<sub>2</sub>O], and reducing agent [1M cysteamine mercaptoethylamine (MEA, Sigma) in ddH<sub>2</sub>O] prior to adding to FLS and imaging. 20 μM of Latrunculin B in DMSO (Lat B; Merck, no. 428020) was incubated in the FLS reaction mixture for 5 min, before the mix was added to the lipid bilayer. The brightness/contrast range of the protein Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) images were adjusted uniformly in ImageJ/Fiji (National Institutes of Health; Schindelin et al., 2012), and the local maxima was identified using the <italic>Find Maxima</italic> function.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>dSTORM data acquisition</title><p id="P49">A Nikon STORM (N-STORM) system as used with an Agilent laser bed with 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 647 nm lasers. The emitted light was collected through a CPI Plan Apo 100X 1.49 NA objective, filtered by a bandpass filter (for Alexa Fluor 525/50; for Alexa Fluor 568: 600/50; for Alexa Fluor 647: 705/72; for mEos and multi-color imaging: NSTORM QUAD 405/488/561/647) and imaged onto an iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera (Andor). The setup was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements AR software version 4.50 with N-STORM module. A reference TIRF image of the protein of interest and actin was acquired using a widefield Z stack. The cylindrical lens and condenser lens were inserted into the light path, and the focus was. Movies of typically 30,000 frames (size 256×256 pixels, equivalent to 39.9×39.9 μm as 1 pixel = 0.16 μm) were acquired using 647 nm illumination at 2-3 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 19 ms exposure times, once the fluorophores had transitioned into a sparse blinking pattern. For samples of low fluorescence intensity, 405 nm laser power with an automated feedback loop was adjusted to keep a constant number of localizations per frame.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>dSTORM analysis</title><p id="P50">Coordinates of localization points were obtained and used to create 3D reconstructions using the N-STORM module in NIS-Elements AR software. Sample drift and chromatic aberration was corrected for using the 3D bead calibration sample. To exclude camera noise, the peak detection threshold was set to 4,000-5,000 gray levels. FLS tips which showed co-localization of actin and the labeled protein of interest by TIRF and a length of actin growing at least 2 μm in the z-axis were selected. Histograms of localization positions in Z were also obtained and normalized to the mean Z positions to compare over multiple FLS. Substructures of SNX9 and TOCA-1 were classified into plaques, tubules or hybrid structures according to how their 3D geometries appeared. Tubules were identified as circular objects with apparent Z height rising above the membrane, most often with more localizations on its periphery than in its core. Plaques were identified as flatter structures with ridged edges. Hybrid structures were identified as intermediate structures that displayed both properties within the same tip regions, for example a tubule-like structure seemingly emerging from a part of the plaque-like platform. The Z-extent and diameter measurements were also measured for each of these subgroups, to quantify the differences in their properties.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199037-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Astrid Walrant, Thomas Blake, Mary-Pia Jeyarajasingham and Laura Machesky for valuable discussion and reading the manuscript.
