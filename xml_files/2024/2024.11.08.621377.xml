Its minimally invasive collection procedure makes it ideal for studies in pediatric populations. Saliva is a heterogenous tissue composed of immune and buccal epithelial cells (BEC). Amongst the many epigenetic marks, DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most studied in human populations. Given DNAm’s integral role to cellular differentiation and maintenance, DNAm profiles are often highly cell type (CT)-specific and CT composition can drive salivary DNAm associations with environments or health as well as epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), discrepancy between chronological age and biological age derived from DNAm. To address this, reference-based CT deconvolution and statistically adjustment with estimated CT in DNAm analyses have become a common practice. However, it remains unclear how different CT reference panels—constructed from adult versus pediatric samples—affect DNAm results. Additionally, whether DNAm and EAA associations in saliva primarily originate from immune cells or BECs, or if they persist across saliva samples despite varying CT proportions, has yet to be examined.</p><p id="P2">The current study used salivary DNAm samples obtained from 529 children (mean age=7.26 years, SD=0.26 years) in a community-based cohort, the Family Life Project. Our results highlighted the impact of estimated CT discrepancies across child and adult reference panels on DNAm associations. Upon stratifying the salivary DNAm samples into three subsamples—primarily BECs, primarily immune cells, and an approximately equal mix of both, we found significantly different EAAs across stratified samples when CT proportions were not accounted for. In both the context of DNAm and EAA associations, we detected stronger effects of cotinine concentrations, a tobacco smoke-exposure biomarker, in the subsample with primarily immune cells. We discussed the implications of our findings for the interpretation and replication of epigenetic research involving pediatric saliva samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric saliva</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>cell type heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>epigenome-wide association study</kwd><kwd>reference-based cell type deconvolution</kwd><kwd>Family Life Project</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Not All Saliva Samples Are Equal: The Role of Cellular Heterogeneity in DNA methylation and Epigenetic Age Analyses with Biological and Psychosocial Factors</title><p id="P3">Epigenetics has gained increasing interest as a potential biological mechanism through which environmental and psychosocial factors can influence health and development. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a key epigenetic modification that is well-characterized and widely studied in humans for its potential to both act as a biomarker and elucidate pathways of risk and resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. DNAm studies are typically conducted using epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify DNAm links to phenotypic and environmental differences. More recently, epigenetic clocks have emerged as a major tool to harness information of the methylome, comparing DNAm-derived biological age of cells to the chronological age of the individual.</p><p id="P4">Irrespective of the epigenetic studies’ approaches, these DNAm association analyses need to contend with the fundamental role of DNAm in cellular differentiation and maintenance. The latter often result in cell type (CT)’s having distinct DNAm profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Given that the majority of human DNAm research involves peripheral bulk tissues, which are often composed of multiple different CTs, it is an important consideration to account for cellular heterogeneity in statistical analyses. To address this issue, CT proportions can be quantified by cell count or bioinformatically estimated from CT reference panels of sorted cells’ DNAm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Oral samples, including saliva, are often preferred in biosocial and epidemiological research involving children as the collection methods are minimally invasive and more readily accepted by parents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, samples can be collected at home and mailed at room temperature, resulting in lower technical demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These unique strengths of saliva samples have generated considerable opportunities in pediatric DNAm investigations, yet its high CT heterogeneity presents an analytical challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure rigorous DNAm analyses and downstream interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Saliva is composed of both buccal epithelial cells (BECs) and immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Its cellular composition is highly variable across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, which can be attributed to wide ranging factors, including social exposures, oral hygiene, salivary collection methods, and, most importantly, age. Therefore, estimating CT proportions using reference panels trained on samples of different tissues and developmental stages (i.e., pediatric vs. adult) could generate differential outputs. These discrepancies in CT proportion estimation could also impact downstream DNAm analyses and the identification of differentially methylated sites in saliva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Furthermore, deeper investigation of how the heterogeneity in saliva may influence the interpretation and reproducibility of DNAm results is needed. Considering saliva samples with extreme interindividual variation of BEC proportions, one could reason that DNAm associations identified in saliva samples with extremely <italic>low</italic> BEC proportion (and therefore extremely <italic>high</italic> immune cell proportion) will be more similar to that in tissues of primarily immune cell composition, like blood, though these immune cells are oral in origin. In contrast, those with extremely <italic>high</italic> BEC proportion may have DNAm associations more similar to tissues with a largely epithelial composition, such as cheek swabs. Therefore, DNAm associations that can be identified with salivary samples may be highly dependent on the CT compositions in the specific samples and these differential associations may parallel tissue differences. This leads to challenges in the interpretation and replication of DNAm associations found in saliva samples that are considered the same tissue source yet may have highly distinct CT proportions.</p><p id="P8">Some variables of interest may be more likely to have differential DNAm associations across salivary samples of differing primary CT populations, with specific bias towards a particular CT. For example, exposure to tobacco smoke may exhibit stronger associations with DNAm in immune cells than BECs in saliva since it is a major source of oxidative stress and could influence the mucosal immune system and in turn affect systemic immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, samples with higher abundance of immune cells may have higher sensitivity to smoke exposure. This high CT heterogeneity in salivary samples complicates interpretation, replication, and meta-analyses of DNAm results. Nevertheless, such heterogeneity may also serve as an opportunity to elucidate what CTs may underpin salivary EWAS or EAA associations, if any in particular.</p><p id="P9">Relatedly, salivary CT proportions may also influence the biological age estimated by epigenetic clocks trained in specific tissues and populations using DNAm, known as epigenetic age. Indeed, epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) derived from the deviation between epigenetic and chronological age has been shown to be affected by CT proportions in cheek swab samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Given the developmental changes in BEC proportion in pediatric saliva and the previous findings on the association between EAA and BEC proportion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, it is reasonable to expect that saliva samples with differential BEC proportions may show faster or slower epigenetic aging. Thus, it may be pertinent to account for CT proportions when calculating EAA to reduce confounding effects.</p><p id="P10">In the current study, we leveraged salivary samples from 529 7-year-old children in a community cohort with a naturally-occurring highly variable CT proportions, similar to that previously shown in other published samples (i.e., 0-100% estimated BEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and 20-100% from count data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). Given that reference panels may affect estimation of CT proportion and thus DNAm analyses, we characterized and compared CT proportions predicted with the adult and child reference panels and explore its effect on EWAS outcomes. While saliva has been traditionally analyzed together as a whole, we characterized the specific CT populations underpinnings of DNAm associations (both EWAS and EAA) in heterogeneous salivary samples by stratifying these samples based on primary CT. This could help elucidate if DNAm signals observed in saliva originated primarily from immune cells or BECs or can be found across saliva samples despite differing CT proportions. To maximize the applicability of our findings across disciplines, and to illuminate the importance of choosing an appropriate reference for DNAm analysis, we chose three variables that are commonly of interest in biosocial research, spanning across the spectrum of biological to social. These included biological sex, a variable of primarily biological influence; salivary cotinine concentration, which is indicative of tobacco smoke exposure and represents a combination of biological and social influences, and socioeconomic status (SES), a variable of primarily social influence. These variables have been widely studied in the context of DNAm across disciplines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

Our initial focus was to test the performance of existing adult and child reference panels to estimate CT proportions in saliva. With both reference panels, BEC proportions were estimated to be the highest and the most variable among all CT proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>; Supplementary Figure S2). The estimated proportion of immune cells, primarily neutrophils, had a significant and strong negative correlation with estimated BEC proportion, <italic>r</italic>(527)=-0.93, p&lt;2.2e-16). Therefore, estimated BEC proportion was likely to capture most of the variability of estimated CT proportions in saliva and were used in our remaining analyses.</p><p id="P24">The estimated BEC proportions were significantly correlated across reference panels (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>=0.950, <italic>p</italic>&lt;2.2e-16). The child reference panel estimated a lower median of BEC proportion (51.34%) and higher IQR (71.18%) than the adult reference panel (median: 80.46%; IQR: 42.29%). The CETYGO score, with lower score indicating higher appropriateness, of the child reference panel was below 0.1 (mean=0.074, range=0.03-0.09), while the CETYGO score of the adult reference panel was above 0.1 (mean=0.15, range=0.05–0.20), suggesting that the child reference panel is a more appropriate panel for pediatric samples than the adult reference panel. Therefore, all downstream analyses were conducted with the child panel.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Reference panels produced different outcomes for an EWAS of SES and similar results for biological sex and cotinine</title><p id="P25">We then tested whether the observed discrepancies in estimated CT proportions from the two reference panels influenced EWAS results. First, we note that a larger number of DNAm associations were identified with biological sex than cotinine concentrations and SES with both references. Second, across references, EWAS for sex and cotinine concentration had high overlaps in statistically significantly associated sites (FDR&lt;.05 and |Δβ|&gt;.035, 92% and 100%, respectively) and comparable model fits for estimations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>; Supplementary figure S3).

Thus, we stratified the samples into three groups and repeated the analyses on these subsamples, herein described as high, mid, and low BEC subsamples, which contained primarily BEC, primarily neutrophils, or an approximately even mix of both. We characterized the three subsamples by comparing their demographic characteristics using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and confirmed that the three stratified subsamples were not different at the demographic level, including child sex, age, parent-reported race, SES, and cotinine concentration based on one-way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic>s=0.38-0.97.</p><p id="P28">EWAS for biological sex performed in the high and low subsamples, showed an increased number of significant associations (n associations=3,007 and 1,980, respectively), compared to the full sample (n associations=1,780) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>; Supplementary Figure S5a). However, the medium BEC subsamples, despite having the largest sample size, had the least number of sites associated with sex (n associations=1,422). We observed 11.9% overlapping significantly associated sites (559 sites) across the three stratified subsamples of different levels BEC proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). To compare the extent to which these differential EWAS outcomes across stratified subsamples may be akin to tissue effect, we leveraged the matched buccal and PBMC samples from GECKO, our validation cohort.

Capitalizing on the high heterogeneity nature of saliva, we investigated whether there are CT-specific associations in BEC or immune cells in DNAm and EAA associations using a stratification approach while adjusting for estimated CT proportions calculated with the appropriate reference panel. Overall, our study demonstrated that a pediatric-specific saliva reference panel provided more appropriate CT proportion estimations than an adult reference and stratifying samples by BEC proportion enhanced sensitivity in detecting DNAm and EAA associations in multiple variables of interest. These findings provide critical guidance for improving the interpretability and rigor of epigenetic analyses using pediatric saliva samples.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Reference panel choice influenced estimated BEC proportions, having differential impact on DNAm associations with biological and social variables</title><p id="P39">Our CT estimation results were highly comparable with findings from the previous study that generated the pediatric saliva reference panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, showing lower and more variable estimated BEC proportions than the adult reference. The wider range of estimated BEC proportions with the child reference compared to the adult reference is likely reflective of natural biological variation of pediatric saliva as indicated by a highly variable CT proportion observed with actual cell count data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that discrepancies in CT estimation differentially impacted the outcomes of statistical models investigating high dimensional DNAm associations with variables that span across the biological and social spectrum. Specifically, we found that EWAS results of a social variable, SES, was the most impacted by the estimated CT discrepancies across references. Although the current analyses could not empirically differentiate true positive from false positive findings, it is tempting to speculate that adjusting for potentially more appropriate CT estimations generated in data of a similar tissue and age range was able to better capture variability of DNAm associated with CT and increased the power to detect significant associations with SES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Yet, it is unclear why such impact was only observed with the most biologically distal and socially proximal variable in our study. Future investigations on other social variables are needed to scrutinize the effect of the CT estimation discrepancy. Nonetheless, our findings add to the growing body of literature creating awareness around the considerations of CT proportions in DNAm analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Stratified samples by BEC proportion allowed detection of tissue-specific effects in EWAS</title><p id="P40">Interpreting and replicating DNAm findings from an extremely heterogenous tissue like saliva is challenging as it is unclear which CT is contributing to the identified DNAm associations. We addressed this question with a stratification approach based on CT composition and our findings could have implications on informing future research design (e.g., what tissue type may be more sensitive to certain variable of interest), hypothesis formations for tissue or CT-specific effect, and replication of DNAm findings. Overall, our results showed that stratifying samples by BEC proportions for EWAS had differential effects across variables of interest, such that a larger number of significant DNAm associations were detected with both biological sex and cotinine concentration in stratified samples than full sample, but not with SES.</p><p id="P41">We showed that sample stratification allowed for detection of differential sex associations across CTs. However, the differential associations with sex across the three saliva subsamples were not as prominent as across matched blood and buccal samples in an independent cohort. Despite this, the DNAm sites consistently observed across BEC subsamples overlapped with all five CMRs that were previously reported to be associated with sex across multiple tissues, including buccal and blood tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Hence, the concordance across stratified salivary samples parallels that of cross-tissue similarities.</p><p id="P42">We identified three significant DNAm associations with cotinine concentrations in our full sample, out of which two (cg05549970 and cg14588422 annotated to the <italic>C4orf50</italic> and <italic>PARD3</italic> genes, respectively) have been reported to be associated with first-hand smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. After stratification by BEC proportions, we identified significant DNAm associations with salivary cotinine concentrations only in the low BEC subsample. Despite a smaller sample size, low BEC subsample, which had a more homogeneous and immune-focused CT composition, showed a larger number of significant cotinine-DNAm associations than that identified in the full sample, reflecting potential CT-specific effects of cotinine on DNAm.</p><p id="P43">We did not find significant DNAm associations with SES at any site after stratification, yet the directionality and strength of effects at the significant sites identified in the full sample were strongly correlated in stratified samples. Therefore, a possible explanation for the absence of significant findings in CT-stratified samples is that with a smaller effect size than biological variable, the reduction of sample size may have decreased the power to detect the subtle effect. Furthermore, unlike cotinine, SES may not have a strong immune CT effect in saliva samples, or required further CT specificity than could be achieved by stratification. However, past studies have found differential associations across tissues with sociodemographic variables. For example one study comparing DNAm associations in buccal and blood samples indicated that blood DNAm had stronger associations than buccal DNAm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In our saliva samples, the low BEC subsample, which has the highest immune cell proportion, had the smallest sample size and therefore, the least power to detect significant SES-associations if they were present. As such, it is unclear whether the lack of significant SES-associations in the low BEC subsample was due to the small sample size or the inherent difference between blood and saliva with high immune cell proportions given the differences in oral immune cells, which cannot be tested with our current sample but should be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Differential EAA associations with variables of interests when considering BEC proportions in EAA calculations or stratifying samples by BEC proportions</title><p id="P44">Both PedBE, specifically trained in pediatric cheek swab samples, and Horvath Skin-blood clocks, trained in adult cells and samples including saliva, showed significant differences in EAA across stratified samples by BEC proportions. Specifically, children with lower BEC proportions had higher EAA. These EAA differences with the same directionality have been reported in previous studies on EAA in pediatric cheek swab samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and are now extended to pediatric saliva samples in our current study. This could be in part due to the computational approaches used to create epigenetic clocks that may select DNAm sites that are informative to age-related cell-type differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, these differences became non-significant in both clocks when EAA calculations accounted for CT proportions, suggesting the reduction of confounding effect and further supporting the existing recommendations to correct for estimated CT proportions when calculating EAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Overall, when we investigated EAA associations with our variables of interest, only PedBE, but not Skin-blood, EAAs produced significant findings. It is tempting to speculate that PedBE is more sensitive to signals in children than Skin-blood due to its training samples matching with our sample’s developmental stage.</p><p id="P45">Sex differences in PedBE EAAs were robust across methodological approaches—in both full and stratified samples as well as when EAAs were calculated accounting for CT proportions or not. Specifically, we found lower PedBE EAA in boys than girls, which is consistent with previous EAA findings in pediatric cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. It is important to note that the effect sizes of these sex differences became larger after stratification, potentially due to the reduced CT heterogeneity.</p><p id="P46">Extending our immune-specific cotinine-EWAS findings, we further showed that cotinine-EAA associations were also specific to stratified samples containing primarily immune cells. Together, these findings showed converging immune-specific effect across multi-modal DNAm analyses. The lower EAA associated with higher cotinine levels in the low BEC subsamples may seem counterintuitive given that higher biological aging is often found in adult smokers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, the interpretation of pediatric EAA is much less clear that adult EAA; more consistent links between higher EAA and aging phenotypes including disease and mortality has been established in adult literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Due to the relative scarcity of pediatric EAA studies, it is still unclear how slower pediatric EAA is linked to the spectrum of developmental outcomes. However, early psychosocial adversity is linked with lower gestational and pediatric EAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. It is possible that any deviation, regardless of faster or slower EAA, can be indicative of non-normative development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P47">When CT proportions were accounted for in EAA calculation, its associations with SES were amplified and became statistical significance; specifically, lower SES were associated with higher EAA. Previous literature has shown that early childhood SES were linked to higher EAA in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and our finding demonstrated that such association may emerge early in life. Again, aligning with our EWAS on SES findings, no significant associations were found after stratification, yet similar trends were identified in both low and mid BEC subsamples. It is tempting to speculate that EAA associations with SES may be consistent across saliva samples regardless of CT compositions and hence stratification may not provide further insight to CT-specific SES associations.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Limitations &amp; Recommendations</title><p id="P48">The findings from the current study should be interpreted while acknowledging its limitations. First, our study did not include cell count data to compare the accuracy of CT predictions across reference panels. Our investigation focused on the impact of differential CT predictions on downstream analyses and how stratification based on these estimated CT proportions could illuminate interpretation. Given the heterogeneity in saliva samples across cohorts, it is crucial to first assess the degree of CT heterogeneity in the given saliva samples; with lower levels of CT heterogeneity, stratification of samples may not be as informative. We note that alternative approaches, such as CellDMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and eFORGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, are also available to unpack the origin of DNAm signals in heterogeneous samples. However, given our saliva samples are primarily made up of BEC and immune cells and with clear subsamples based on primary CTs, we opted for a stratification approach to provide more interpretable results. Second, some of our samples had salivary cotinine concentrations that were too low to be reliably measured by the assay, which led to missingness in our data. This was not unexpected given the young age of our sample. Importantly, our main findings were supported by sensitivity analyses that used imputed cotinine concentration for samples with censored, indicating the robustness of our findings. Given that the main objective of the current study was to examine how different methods might affect DNAm analyses using cotinine concentrations as an example, we did not intend to draw conclusions from the significant DNAm sites identified in this study. Lastly, our study employed stringent QC to ensure high-quality DNAm samples for our investigation, which removed a substantial portion of samples. However, the QC process is cohort-dependent and can be influenced by many factors, including the extent to which child participants were able to follow instructions during sample collection and their oral health conditions, such as tooth decay, tooth loss, and cold sores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Despite these challenges, saliva still presents a wide range of strengths in epidemiological research including its minimally-invasive sampling methods and opportunities for interdisciplinary research ranging from stress hormones to immune markers, from oral analytes to microbiome, in addition to genetics and epigenetic research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">To inform future epigenetic research using pediatric saliva, we summarized the implications of our approaches with respect to the high CT heterogeneity in saliva in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. In conclusion, CT references built on a population and tissue matched with the targeted samples produced more accurate estimations and the discrepancies in CT estimations had differential effects on DNAm associations with commonly investigated variables in the field. Further, stratification of samples by CT proportions illuminates the CT populations most sensitive to DNAm and EAA associations for suitable variables of interest. The current study contributes to future pediatric DNAm research by offering practical guidance to leverage this complex yet highly accessible biological sample in children.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kaitlin Smith, Hillary Piccerillo, Tatum Stauffer, and Andrew Huang for technical assistance with salivary biospecimen testing.
