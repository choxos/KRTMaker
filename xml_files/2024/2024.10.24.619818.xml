Madagascar. Over 12 months, weekly Malaise trap samples were collected at 203 locations within 100 sites in Sweden and at 50 locations within 33 sites in Madagascar; this was complemented by soil and litter samples from each site. The field samples comprise 4,749 Malaise trap, 192 soil and 192 litter samples from Sweden and 2,566 Malaise trap and 190 litter samples from Madagascar. Samples were processed using mild lysis or homogenization, followed by DNA metabarcoding of COI (418 bp). The data comprise 698,378 non-chimeric sequence variants from Sweden and 687,866 from Madagascar, representing 33,989 (33,046 Arthropoda) and 77,599 (77,380 Arthropoda) operational taxonomic units, respectively. These are the most comprehensive data presented on these faunas so far, allowing unique analyses of the size, composition, spatial turnover and seasonal dynamics of the sampled communities.

An estimated 70-85% of insect species still remain unknown to science <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and for the large majority of those described, we know little about their biology, distribution, or population trends <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Recent studies have indicated a decline in terrestrial insect biomass and diversity during the last decades <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but the data are often limited in taxonomic, geographic and/or temporal scope, hindering comprehensive conclusions to be reached <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. It is clear that existing data on insect biodiversity provide only fragmented insights into how many insect species there are, how they are structured into communities and how these communities contribute to healthy ecosystems.</p><p id="P7">Comprehensive longitudinal sampling across and within regions is urgently needed to close this knowledge gap. However, setting up such long-term monitoring projects faces many challenges, from financial constraints, complex management and coordination hurdles to methodological limitations in the processing and identification of collected material. Indeed, a significant barrier has been the absence of cost-effective methods for the comprehensive inventorying of insect faunas. For example, one of the most ambitious countrywide insect inventory projects to date, the Swedish Malaise Trap Project (SMTP), collected an estimated 20 million specimens at 50 sites over a three-year period <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Sorting the material into 350 taxonomic fractions suitable for specialist processing took 15 years. During this time period, only 0.85% of the specimens had been identified to species, despite a substantial effort from numerous taxonomists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Fortunately, in recent years, the traditional insect inventorying methods relying on morphological identification by taxonomic experts have been complemented by considerably faster and more cost-efficient methods for processing and identifying insect samples, relying on DNA metabarcoding. This has revolutionized our capacity to comprehensively study and effectively monitor insect faunas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">In the Insect Biome Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.insectbiomeatlas.org/">www.insectbiomeatlas.org</ext-link>) project, we used DNA metabarcoding of an extensive set of community samples to characterize the terrestrial arthropod faunas of Sweden and Madagascar, and their associated microbiomes, in unprecedented detail. Sweden and Madagascar were chosen because they represent two countries of approximately the same size but with completely different biogeographic and geological history. The Swedish fauna has been assembled by independent migration from different refugia after the last glacial maximum, some 20,000 years ago <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, the Madagascar fauna has largely evolved in place, and in isolation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The environmental factors also contrast sharply: Sweden is characterized by a northern temperate climate and an elevational gradient running mainly from the east coast to the Scandinavian mountains in the west, whereas Madagascar is marked by a tropical climate and a significantly more complex topographical setting. Thus, any similarities between Sweden and Madagascar clearly represent non-random structuring of the faunas, while the differences between them illustrate much of the range of global variation one might expect among faunas.</p><p id="P10">Over a period of 12 months in 2019-20, weekly Malaise trap samples were collected at 100 sites (203 locations) in Sweden and 33 sites (50 locations) in Madagascar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Sites and trap locations were selected to provide a representative sample of Swedish habitat types. In brief, sites were stratified across the habitats in rough proportion to the relative coverage of habitats in the Swedish landscape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In Madagascar, only forests (National Parks) were targeted due to logistical constraints. A hierarchical design involving both single-trap and multitrap sites was used to allow more powerful analyses of spatial turnover. The Malaise traps were maintained by citizen science volunteers in Sweden and park rangers in Madagascar. This approach not only substantially mitigated sampling-related challenges but also engaged a diverse range of stakeholders in the scientific process.</p><p id="P11">To further characterize soil arthropods and soil microbiomes, we complemented the Malaise trap samples with soil and litter samples. In addition, we collected environmental data and data on ecosystem functions at each site. In total, the project yielded 4,753 Malaise trap samples, 188 soil samples and 189 leaf litter samples from Sweden and 2,566 Malaise trap samples and 190 leaf litter samples from Madagascar.</p><p id="P12">Samples were processed using mild lysis or homogenization, followed by DNA metabarcoding of COI (418 bp) on the NovaSeq6000 platform using optimized protocols developed in the project <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. A novel pipeline for processing the metabarcoding data - developed in the project - was used for quality filtering and taxonomic characterization of the samples based on these data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This pipeline utilizes the extensive amounts of samples collected in the project to provide data of significantly improved quality and accuracy compared to the current state of the art.</p><p id="P13">Here we present the key datasets resulting from the project. The data on ecosystem functioning and arthropod biomass have been published elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and the data on soil microbiome (bacterial 16S and fungal ITS2) and microbiome associated with the arthropod communities in Sweden will be presented separately.</p><p id="P14">The COI data presented here comprise 698,378 non-chimeric sequence variants from Sweden and 687,866 from Madagascar, representing 33,989 and 77,599 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively, after filtering and cleaning. The Swedish OTUs were distributed across 11 phyla, 26 classes and 97 orders. Of the OTUs, 79%, 50%, 34% and 60% were classified at the level of Family, Genus, Species and BOLD BIN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, respectively. The low annotation success at the species level compared to the BOLD BIN level is partly due to name resolution problems for BOLD BINs—such as several synonyms being in active use, or the same species being placed in different genera by different annotators—and partly due to failures of CO1 barcodes in accurately circumscribing closely related species. Distinguishing between these cases would require detailed analysis on a case-by-case basis. For Madagascar, the OTUs were distributed across 9 phyla, 21 classes and 90 orders, with 28%, 4%, 2% and 9% of OTUs classified at the level of Family, Genus, Species and BOLD BIN, respectively. For both datasets, the phylum Arthropoda accounted for ≥99.5% of total reads and &gt;97% of OTUs. Calibration curves relating biomass to the number of specimens suggest that the analyzed Malaise trap samples comprise around 7.0 million insects from Sweden and 1.7 million insects from Madagascar.</p><p id="P15">The datasets we present here offer profound insights into the diversity, composition and structure of the terrestrial arthropod communities of Sweden and Madagascar. They also provide an invaluable baseline against which to gauge future changes in these faunas. While the Insect Biome Atlas project focuses exclusively on Sweden and Madagascar, we expect that it will serve as a template for similar studies in other regions. We also hope that it encourages a wider interest in comprehensive studies of insect faunas and in establishing long-term monitoring of insect populations globally.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Site selection</title><p id="P16">In Sweden, sampling sites were selected following a stratified design based on the major landscape types as identified by the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden - NILS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. A total of 203 Malaise traps were deployed within six major habitats across 100 sites: 102 traps in forests, 33 in croplands, 26 in wetlands, 16 in grasslands, 14 in alpine and 12 in urban areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The proportion of Malaise traps by habitat is representative of the contribution of each habitat type to the overall Swedish landscape (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), with down-weighing of the most common habitat (forests, that account for 60% of the landscape according to NILS) and some up-weighing of the remaining, sparser habitats (croplands and wetlands, which account for 8% of the landscape each; and urban sites and grasslands, which each account for 3% of the landscape). At 21 of the 100 sampling sites, we implemented a hierarchical design by deploying up to 6 Malaise traps instead of one. In Sweden there were 12 multi-trap sites with between 2 and 6 traps, and in Madagascar there were 9 multi-trap sites with between 2-4 traps. Distances between Malaise traps at these multitrap sites ranged from 90 to 1200 meters, sampling two different habitats when possible (three Malaise traps per habitat). In Madagascar, sampling sites were associated with forested habitats located within protected areas only. In total we deployed 50 Malaise traps across 33 sites: 27 Malaise traps in rainforests (16 sites) and 23 Malaise traps in dry forests (17 sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). At eight of the 33 sites, we implemented a hierarchical design by deploying 3 traps within a single habitat. Distances between Malaise traps at these multitrap sites ranged from 100 to 4700 meters. Malaise traps were set up by a team of fieldworkers together with the trap managers at each site: 150 volunteers in Sweden and 107 local community members and park rangers in Madagascar. At the time of setting up the Malaise traps, trap managers were trained on how to set up and maintain the trap, retrieve the samples from the trap and collect metadata associated with the sampling event.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Standing characteristics and other abiotic data</title><p id="P17">At each Malaise trap location in Madagascar we measured a set of standing characteristics. To assess tree density we set up four 10 m long transects, one on each side of the trap, and measured the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees with its roots or stem within 10 cm of the transect. For multi-stemmed trees, we measured only the DBH of the largest stem. We included measurements for trees, lianas (L), palms (P) and ferns (F). We also measured the circumference of all trees with a DBH larger than 30 cm within a 10 m radius of the Malaise trap. Finally we measured canopy cover at each Malaise trap location by taking five photographs of the canopy at 2 meters height straight up to the canopy. One photograph was taken at the center of the Malaise trap and the other four photographs were taken five meters away from the trap, one on each side of the trap. Each photograph was analysed with ImageJ software to get a percentage of canopy cover.</p><p id="P18">At each Malaise trap location for both Sweden and Madagascar we also measured soil nutrients and soil pH. Topsoil (0-20cm) was sampled at 5 sites around each Malaise trap: one soil core (6 cm diameter) at the center of the trap and one soil core on each of the four “sides” of the trap, five meters away from the trap. Soil samples were taken as composite samples from the five locations. At each site, prior to taking the soil cores, we measured leaf litter depth using a ruler and soil humidity with the SM150 soil moisture kit. Soil samples from Sweden were sent to Eurofins to measure the following macronutrients: AL-extractable P, K, Mg and Ca; NH<sub>4</sub>; NO<sub>3</sub>; K/Mg ratio and mineral N (Nmin). The concentrations of soil nutrients are presented as mg·100 g<sup>-1</sup> air-dry sieved soil (&lt;2 mm). Soil samples from Madagascar were sent to the Laboratoire des Radioisotopes to measure the following macronutrients: organic C (g/Kg), total N (g/Kg), total P (g/Kg), exchangeable K (cmol/Kg), exchangeable Ca (cmol/Kg) and exchangeable Mg (cmol/Kg).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Sampling for biotic characterization</title><sec id="S6"><title>Malaise trap samples</title><p id="P19">Arthropods were collected in individually barcoded bottles pre-filled with 400 mL of 95% ethanol attached to each Malaise trap. To facilitate the recording of metadata associated with each sampling event, trap managers used a mobile application specifically designed for the project. The app allowed scanning the individually barcoded Malaise trap and sample bottle at the time of collection so that each sampling event was automatically associated with a specific trap. When the barcode of each sample was scanned, the app automatically registered the GPS coordinates and the date and time of the collection event in addition to any other metadata manually inserted by the user, such as the trap condition at collection. In Sweden, Malaise traps were active between January and December 2019. Samples were collected every week during spring and summer (March/April to September/October depending on latitude) and monthly or bi-weekly in the autumn and winter (October/November to March/April, depending on latitude), resulting in 4,753 insect community samples. In Madagascar, Malaise traps were active between August 2019 and July 2020. Samples were collected every week throughout that period, resulting in 2,566 insect community samples. Every fourth sample from each trap location (638 samples in total, roughly one sample per month), was left at the Madagascar Biodiversity Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.madagascarbio.org/">https://www.madagascarbio.org/</ext-link>) to help build a natural history collection of Malagasy insects in the country of origin.

Leaf litter arthropod communities were sampled by collecting a total volume of 1 L of leaf litter from five different sites around each Malaise trap, 2.5 meters away from the nearest extremity of the trap. Soil arthropod communities were sampled using soil cores (5.5 cm diameter) with a depth of 10 cm at exactly the same five sites where litter samples were taken. The five soil core samples from each Malaise trap location were pooled and mixed by hand immediately after collection, then stored in a cool place. Within 48h after collection, living arthropods were extracted from soil and litter samples over a period of 96 hours using funnel extractors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To cause the arthropods to exit the substrate before being trapped in the dried-out structure, we gradually increased the temperature over the first 24 hours to a temperature of 52 °C. This temperature was then held constant for the remaining 72 hours. Arthropods were collected directly into 100 mL plastic bottles filled with 95% ethanol. Leaf litter arthropod communities were also sampled at each Malaise trap location in Madagascar. Here we collected four samples in each direction of the Malaise trap (back, front, left and right), five meters away from it. Leaf litter sampling involved sifting and concentrating 2 L of leaf litter from a 1 m<sup>2</sup> square using a Winkler-sifter. Before sifting, the leaf litter was minced with a machete to dislodge any insects hiding in the twigs or decayed logs. After sifting, the leaf litter was stored in a cloth bag before extracting the arthropods. Within 12 hours of sampling, living arthropods were extracted at ambient temperature overnight into a 100 mL bottle filled with 95% ethanol using a mini-Winkler extractor for a total of 12 hours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DNA extraction</title><sec id="S9"><title>Malaise trap samples</title><p id="P21">DNA was extracted from Malaise trap samples using both non-destructive (mild lysis and preservative ethanol) and destructive methods (homogenization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p id="P22">Mild lysis: DNA was extracted from 6,483 Malaise trap samples (4,560 from Sweden and 1,923 from Madagascar) using a non-destructive mild-lysis protocol (FAVIS protocol, steps 1-17 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>).

For Sweden, we used a 1mm wire-sieve to separate each sample (from soil or litter) into two components based on size: the macrofauna subsample, composed mainly of adult and larval Coleoptera, and the mesofauna subsample, dominated by mites and springtails. To remove debris and dirt accumulated in the mesofauna subsamples, we processed them further using a combination of flotation in distilled water, adapted from the Flotation-Berlese-Floatation protocol in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, followed by vacuum pump filtration (41 μm nylon filter).

This data was then filtered to only keep records annotated as 'COI-5P' and assigned to a BOLD BIN ID. The taxonomic information was parsed in order to assign species names and resolve higher-level ranks for each BOLD BIN ID. Sequences were processed to remove gap characters and leading and trailing 'N's. After this, any sequences with remaining non-standard characters were removed. Sequences were then clustered at 100% identity using vsearch. This clustering was done separately for sequences assigned to each BOLD BIN ID. These steps were implemented in a Python package called coidb, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/insect-biome-atlas/coidb">https://github.com/insect-biome-atlas/coidb</ext-link>. Taxonomic assignments obtained from the kmer-based SINTAX classifier were refined using phylogenetic methods. Specifically, ASV sequences classified as Insecta or Collembola (class) but unclassified at order level by SINTAX were reassigned by phylogenetic placement with EPA-NG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> into an insect phylogeny <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, followed by taxonomic assignment with gappa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Assignments obtained this way were used to update the SINTAX taxonomy, but only at the order level, leaving child ranks with the ‘unclassified’ prefix.</p><p id="P34">Following taxonomic assignments ASVs were further processed to remove chimeras with uchime <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and the remaining non-chimeric sequences were clustered using Swarm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> (v3.1.0) with setting ‘-d 15’. Taxonomic assignments for ASVs within clusters were resolved to the cluster level by an abundance-based consensus approach. For each cluster, starting from the lowest rank (BOLD BIN here), each unique taxonomic name was weighted by the sum of reads across samples and ASVs with said name. These sums were then normalized to percentages. If a single taxonomic name made up at least 80%, then that name was assigned to the cluster, including the assignments of parent ranks. If no single name reached the 80% consensus threshold, the process was iterated for the parent rank. Ranks for which no consensus could be reached were prefixed with ‘unresolved.’ followed by the name of the most resolved consensus taxonomy. For each cluster, the ASV sequence with the highest median of normalized read counts across samples was selected as representatives of the cluster. Ties were broken by taking the ASV with the highest mean.</p><p id="P35">The clustered data was further cleaned from NUMTs and other types of noise using the NEEAT algorithm, which takes taxonomic annotation, correlations in occurrence across samples (‘echo signal’) and evolutionary signatures into account, as well as cluster abundance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We used default settings for all parameters in the evolutionary and distributional filtering steps, and removed clusters unassigned at the order level and with less than three reads summed across each dataset. Additionally we removed clusters present in more than 5% of blanks.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Biomass and count data</title><p id="P36">To allow an assessment of how the biomass of a Malaise trap sample translates to the number of specimens, we counted all the specimens for 24 Malaise trap samples from Sweden. We complemented these data with biomass estimates and specimen counts for 224 Malaise trap samples from a separate Swedish Malaise trapping campaign in 2018–2019, the Swedish Insect Inventory Project (SIIP).</p><p id="P37">The data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) show that the number of specimens is only approximately proportional to the biomass of a sample (linear model without intercept, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 0.81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Specifically, there is a slight tendency for the larger samples (in terms of biomass) to contain more specimens than if the relation was strictly proportional, as shown in a log-log model (R<sup>2</sup> 0.79, regression coefficient 1.09 ± 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Fitting a linear model with intercept does not support the alternative explanation of a constant amount of alcohol residue causing this (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 0.69, intercept positive and not negative as expected under the hypothesis). Using the proportional model, the Swedish Malaise trap material is estimated to contain 7.0 M specimens, and the Madagascar material 1.7 M specimens. Accounting for the deviation from proportionality by applying the log-log regression equation to each sample separately, the Swedish material is instead estimated to contain 5.6 M specimens and the Madagascar material 1.2 M specimens.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Data records</title><p id="P38">The raw sequencing data (including the primer sequences) generated in this study are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accession number PRJEB61109.

More specifically, we used negative controls during mild lysis and homogenization ('buffer_blank' and ‘buffer_blank_art_spikes’), DNA purification ('extraction_neg') and library preparation ('pcr_neg'). Negative control samples can be identified in column 'lab_sample_type' in the 'sequencing_metadata' files available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.scilifelab.se/articles/dataset/Amplicon_sequence_variants_from_the_Insect_Biome_Atlas_project/25480681/5">https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.25480681.v5</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P44">NUMTs and other types of noise were removed from the clustered ASV results using the NEEAT-filtering algorithm described above and we examined the median number of OTUs and sum of reads in negative controls and samples before and after this filtering step. For Swedish samples the median number of OTUs was 296 and 191, and the median sum of reads was 665k and 641k before and after filtering, respectively. For negative controls these numbers were 3 and 1 OTUs and 100 and 20 reads before and after filtering, respectively.</p><p id="P45">Samples in the Madagascar dataset had a median of 292 and 146 OTUs, and a median of 490k and 248k summed reads before and after filtering, respectively. Negative controls in this dataset had a median of 3 and 1 OTUs and 831 and 18 summed reads before and after filtering, respectively.</p><p id="P46">As part of data clean-up, it is usually advised to remove ASVs present in negative controls, or the maximum number of reads for those, from the entire dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. However, after careful inspection of our negative controls, we noticed that only a few ASVs were persistently showing up in control samples. The majority of ASVs seemed to be arthropod sequences that were present in the bulk samples, and also sporadically present in negative controls in relatively small numbers. This was presumably due to DNA spreading between samples through tiny droplets during sample processing, or to low-level of “index hopping”, leading to incorrect assignment of reads during sequencing, despite the use of double-unique indexes in library preparation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Overall, this type of contamination was small and appeared random, leading us to the conclusion that removing all ASVs present in negative controls would impoverish the results without significantly improving quality. To ensure that we removed only true contaminants, we decided to filter out only those ASV clusters that showed up in more than 5% of negative controls that were successfully sequenced.</p><p id="P47">For Sweden, only seven clusters fit these criteria. Five of these were yeasts or bacteria; the remaining two were <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (assigned to <italic>H. neanderthalensis</italic> due to GBIF removal of human data), and <italic>Salticus scenicus</italic> (zebra spider, a jumping spider). The latter is common in the building where samples were processed.</p><p id="P48">For Madagascar, 23 clusters fit the criteria. In addition to bacteria, yeasts, a plant (wheat or barley) and <italic>Homo sapiens,</italic> there were 14 arthropod clusters: <italic>Allacma fusca, Entomobrya sp., Orchesella flavescens, O. cincta</italic> and <italic>Lepidocyrtus</italic> sp.

This record has been deleted from BOLD after our custom reference database was constructed.</p><p id="P51">After removal of OTUs present in &gt;5% of negative controls, as well as the <italic>Z. gillii</italic> OTUs, the median number of OTUs and median sum of reads in negative controls for both Sweden and Madagascar was 0. Samples in Sweden had a median of 189 OTUs and 640k total read counts, respectively. For Madagascar, samples had a median of 145 OTUs and 248k total read counts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P52">To assess whether the sampling and sequencing design was sufficient to characterize insect diversity at different levels, we performed three separate analyses. We performed analyses to assess (i) whether sequencing depth was sufficient to detect most species present in an individual sample (ii) whether the number of traps per site was sufficient to characterize the site-level community, (iii) whether the number of sites was sufficient to characterize the fauna of the region (i.e. the entirety of Sweden, or all forests of Madagascar). To answer these questions, we used functionality from the ‘vegan’ R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, specifically the ‘rarecurve’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a-b</xref>) and ‘specaccum’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c-f</xref>) functions.</p><p id="P53">To address the first question, we performed sample-level rarefaction on the sequencing depth of 10 random samples from both countries. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a and Figure 4b</xref>). This allowed us to examine whether the number of sequences was sufficient to detect all species within a sample. As all curves level off before 500,000 reads, the average of 1.24 million reads per sample (median=1.09) was more than sufficient to detect the vast majority of species.</p><p id="P54">Within-site sampling efficiency was assessed using samples from sites that contained more than one trap (multitrap sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To achieve this, we iteratively increased the number of traps representing each site and constructed species accumulation curves from samples pooled across all sites. For each iteration, we randomly sampled 20 permutations of <italic>N</italic> traps from each site (N = 1:6 traps per site for Sweden, N= 1:4 traps per site for Madagascar). For example, at the first iteration (N=1) a single permutation consisted of sampling one random trap per site - representing the lowest level of survey effort. In the second iteration (<italic>N</italic>=2), a single permutation consisted of two random traps per site. When <italic>N</italic> was equal to the maximum number of site-level traps (i.e. we were using the full sample), only one permutation was possible. For each permutation of traps, data was pooled and a species accumulation curve was constructed. Within each iteration (i.e. for each level of survey effort), the mean of the permutation-level curves were then taken to find the average species detection rate across sampling intensities. This analysis allows us to examine if, on average, more site-level sampling (i.e. traps) results in increased species detection. If lower within-site survey effort produces fewer species detections, we would expect lower intensities to produce less steep accumulation curves. The close proximity and trajectories of each species accumulation curve in panels 4C and 4D suggest that, on average, a single trap per location was generally sufficient to detect the same total number of species as higher sampling intensities.</p><p id="P55">Finally, at the country level, our analyses show that for Sweden, the total number of surveyed sites was bordering on sufficient to fully capture species richness across the country, as the curve begins to level off at higher sampling site numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, for Madagascar, the analysis suggests that 33 sites were still not sufficient to fully capture nation-wide species richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P56">In terms of taxonomic composition, the Malaise trap datasets are distinctly different from the soil and litter samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Malaise trap samples are dominated by Diptera and Hymenoptera in both countries, even though the Diptera are more prominent and the Hymenoptera less so in Madagascar. These orders are followed by the remaining three major insect orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera). Other arthropods constitute a relatively small proportion of the diversity. In the soil and litter samples, mites and spiders constitute a larger fraction of the diversity, particularly in Sweden. Among the insects, the bristletails (Entomobryomorpha and Poduromorpha) are also considerably more prominent than in Malaise trap samples. These patterns largely agree with expectations and suggest that the data properly reflects the diversity of the sampled faunas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P57">The precision and accuracy of the Swedish data are evaluated in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>as part of the methods development effort, and in more detail for Swedish Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Thanks to a long tradition of naturalists and the relative completeness of the reference libraries, the Swedish insect fauna permits powerful tests of the quality of the data from the Insect Biome Atlas project.</p><p id="P58">The 1,705 Lepidoptera OTUs found in Swedish Malaise trap samples (using version 1 of the data processing pipeline on lysates only) matched 1,535 unique species previously known from Sweden and included a number of tentative new species records <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. This suggests an over-splitting rate of less than 10%. The data covered 51% of the species ever recorded from the country, and 57% of the permanent resident species; the coverage was roughly the same across Lepidoptera families. Full-length barcoding of individual specimens representing 10 of the clusters that did not match known Swedish species confirmed that eight of them represented new species for the country or to science, or new and previously unknown CO1 variants at genetic distances that typically signal unique species.</p><p id="P59">Similar analyses across all families of Swedish insects also indicate good accuracy and precision of the processed IBA data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. After chimera removal, clustering with swarm had a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.91 when assessed against the species annotation of the ASVs. That is, the clusters were highly consistent with taxonomy, but there was a slight tendency towards over-splitting as shown by the lower recall values. A considerable amount of this over-splitting disappeared after noise removal with the NEEAT algorithm. In the cleaned data, the vast majority of well-known Swedish insect families are represented by fewer clusters than described species, with only a few instances apparently representing substantial over-splitting. Many families are represented by slightly more than half of the recorded number of species, suggesting that the quality of the data is similar to that of Lepidoptera. The over-splitting of Orthoptera, an order notorious for its rampant NUMTs, is considerably lower in the IBA data than in comparable datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Usage Notes</title><p id="P60">The primers used for amplification were not removed from raw sequencing data and are therefore part of the reads deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).

Briefly, paired end reads were trimmed in a series of steps using the program cutadapt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and filtered to retain only sequences that were between 403 and 418 nt in length (in incremental steps of 3 nt) and that did not contain any in-frame stop codons. Preprocessed reads were then denoised using DADA2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> to infer amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The ASVs were then processed using the HAPP pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> to taxonomically annotate the ASVs (using SINTAX classifier and a purposely built CO1 database). Taxonomic assignments obtained from SINTAX were refined using phylogenetic methods with EPA-NG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> into an insect phylogeny <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, followed by taxonomic assignment with gappa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.
