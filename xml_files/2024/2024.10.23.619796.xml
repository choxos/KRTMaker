High Clever-1 expression associates with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and combined targeting of Clever-1 with anti-PD-1 enhances response in refractory mouse tumor models. A Clever-1–targeting humanized IgG4 antibody, bexmarilimab, is investigated in clinical trials as a macrophage-reprogramming therapy to treat solid tumors (NCT03733990) and hematological malignancies (NCT05428969). Here we describe a secreted form of (s)Clever-1 enriched in plasma of cancer patients, that was decreased upon bexmarilimab treatment. With the production of a recombinant sClever-1, mimicking the one found in human plasma, we show that sClever-1 can selectively bind activated T cells and disrupt T cell receptor signalling leading to impaired Th1 expansion. We demonstrate that sClever-1 binds to insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) on T cells via its mannose-6-phosphate modification and further show that sClever-1 contributes to the immunosuppressive properties of macrophage-secreted extracellular vesicles, driving T cell tolerance and impairing anti-PD-1 efficacy. These findings suggest that Clever-1 exerts a systemic immunosuppressive effect independently of the cells it is expressed on, highlighting its potential as a target in cancer immunotherapy and a valuable biomarker for disease detection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>stabilin-1</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>bexmarilimab</kwd><kwd>MATINS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In recent years, the contribution of scavenger receptors to regulating macrophage responses has attracted significant attention. Scavenger receptors form a vital part of host defense and homeostasis by removing extraneous or modified self- and non-self-macromolecules and acting as co-receptors in the priming of effector immune responses when danger signals are detected. Common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor-1 (Clever-1, also known as Stabilin-1 and FEEL-1) is a multifunctional molecule that contributes to scavenging in a subset of some of the most anti-inflammatory macrophages. In these cells, Clever-1 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling, intracellular sorting, and transcytosis of altered and normal self-components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Clever-1 is upregulated when immunosuppression is needed to protect the body. For instance, during pregnancy, the immunosuppressive milieu that prevails in the placenta to support the growing fetus is associated with a high abundance of Clever-1-positive macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Similarly, a growing tumor harnesses the immune system for its own development and is enriched with Clever-1-positive macrophages that support the formation of an immunosuppressive tissue microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Mechanistically, Clever-1 inhibits macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and antigen presentation, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). These observations have led to the clinical development of a humanized Clever-1-targeting antibody (bexmarilimab, FP-1305) to induce macrophage-mediated immune stimulation in various solid tumors (MATINS, NCT03733990) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). A notable immunological finding from the MATINS trial is that anti-Clever-1 treatment induces robust peripheral T cell activation in patients with advanced cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">According to Adachi and Tsujimoto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) there are two isoforms of Clever-1 (FEEL-1), one being the full-length (aa 2570) protein and the other being isoform #2, which has been predicted from cDNA and named soluble FEEL-1 due to lack of a transmembrane domain. The isoform #2 has not been verified to be expressed as protein but its cDNA sequence, ranging from the N-terminal part until the EGF-like domain 5 (aa 803), indicates that bexmarilimab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) would also be able to bind this isoform. While it has been demonstrated that genetic silencing or antibody-mediated blockade of Clever-1 in human monocytes can promote IFNγ production in T cell antigen recall assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) it is still not clear whether Clever-1 itself has direct tolerogenic potential or these effects are mediated via an increase in pro-inflammatory monocyte activity during Clever-1 blockade. Our previous studies using placenta-purified Clever-1 protein show that it can directly bind T and B cells isolated from mouse spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, the ligand for this interaction has not been determined.</p><p id="P4">While monocytes and macrophages are considered the main targets of bexmarilimab-induced anti-tumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), we describe here a secreted form of Clever-1 (sClever-1) in human plasma. In this study we explore the nature of this protein and show that it is enriched in plasma of cancer patients. By producing a recombinant form of a C-terminally truncated half Clever-1 molecule (H1) mimicking sClever-1 we show that it can bind activated T cells via cell surface IGF2R exposed at the same time point as transient phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure during early T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and drive their phenotype towards FoxP3 positive suppressive cells. Furthermore, our data also indicate that immunotherapeutic targeting of Clever-1 by bexmarilimab (Bex) in cancer patients can decrease the release of sClever-1 and reduce sClever-1 engagement with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that was found to be important for the suppressive effect of macrophage-secreted extracellular vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human samples</title><p id="P5">Blood samples were obtained from treatment naïve breast cancer patients prior and three weeks after undergoing mastectomy at the Turku University Hospital between years 2017-2022.

Next, we analyzed sClever-1 levels in the plasma of healthy donors (n = 32 samples from 21 donors across 1 to 3 timepoints, EDTA blood), in patients with treatment-naïve breast cancer (n = 138, EDTA blood, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and in patients with various advanced cancers (n = 193, pre-treatment, Li-He blood) participating in the MATINS trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed a highly significant enrichment of sClever-1 in the plasma of patients with cancer compared to undiagnosed healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis the enrichment showed excellent &gt;0.8 performance discriminating cancer patients from healthy donors with 100% specificity for both cohorts at 48.7 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P61">Since healthy controls had significantly lower age than the patients with breast cancer (ΔAge: 27 years, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), we analyzed whether age correlated with plasma sClever-1 levels. As we found a weak, but significant correlation between ln-transformed sClever-1 and age in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), we next performed multiple linear regression to evaluate the effects of age and cancer on plasma sClever levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). While both age and the presence of cancer were significant predictors of plasma sClever-1, our model predicted the presence of cancer to increase sClever-1 levels as much as 60 years of aging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2, Figure S2C</xref>). In contrast to treatment-naïve breast cancer patients, we did not observe an overall correlation between age and sClever-1 in the MATINS trial patients, which represented ten different advanced cancer cohorts and had variation in previous lines of therapies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, D and E</xref>). Male gender was associated with slightly higher sClever-1 levels in both healthy donors and the MATINS trial patients. However, in regression analyses gender did not significantly explain sClever-1 levels and gender-related differences in sClever-1 levels would only underestimate rather than overestimate the observed effect of cancer on sClever-1 levels in the breast cancer cohort (data not shown).</p><p id="P62">To characterize the secretory profile of sClever-1 for its distribution between extracellular vesicles and a freely soluble form, we fractionated the culture supernatant from Clever-1-expressing acute myeloid leukemia cells (KG-1), human blood and lymph by ultracentrifugation. This approach enabled us to determine sClever-1 levels in fractions containing microvesicles, exosomes and soluble proteins. All the studied fractions showed detectable sClever-1 protein in which lymph had the highest content of sClever-1 in the soluble form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We further assessed the release of sClever-1 in the vesicle versus soluble fraction from various primary human cells and cell lines by Western blot to identify the cell type producing sClever-1 into blood. Different from the full-length ~280 kDa Clever-1 band, the plasma contained a dominant and abundant ~200 kDa sClever-1 species, which was observed in all macrophage subsets and endothelial cells as well as PMA-differentiated KG-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Direct comparison of healthy plasma with MATINS patient’s pre-treatment plasma in the vesicle fraction showed increased abundance of the ~200 kDa sClever-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P63">For validating the Western blot data for sClever-1 we performed mass spec analysis of each gel band containing serum protein immunoprecipitated via biotinylated anti-Clever-1 antibody (Bex and 9-11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). The analysis revealed peptide sequences from full-length Clever-1 isoform #1. Further, whilst there was an abundance of peptides unique to full-length Clever-1 isoform #1, there were no peptides unique to the predicted isoform #2. This was true even for the 60 kDa and 90 kDa bands immunoprecipitated via 9-11 antibody. Thus, it can be deduced that the hypothetical secreted isoform #2 variant of Clever-1 was not obtainable as a protein from serum. An interesting observation from the mass spec analysis was that each species of sClever-1 that was smaller than full-length Clever-1 was heavily truncated at the C-terminus. A confirmatory mass spec was performed from serum where whole pulldowns were directly analyzed without gel excision. The analyses showed an overwhelming peptide coverage for the first half of Clever-1 and little beyond the end of the half-molecule, confirming that the <bold>~</bold>200 kDa species of sClever-1 from serum is the dominant one, and that a recombinant secreted first half of Clever-1 protein would be a good approximation of sClever-1 (data not shown).</p><p id="P64">To further investigate whether the tumor microenvironment was a source of sClever-1 and how the different cell types contributed to the secretion of sClever-1 we modified our ELISA assay to detect mouse Clever-1 and used that to measure sClever-1 in Clever-1 full knock-out (KO) or macrophage-specific Clever-1 KO mice described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Compared to pooled normal mouse serum, tumor-bearing wild type mice showed an increase in sClever-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). As expected, the tumor-bearing full KO mice showed a significant drop in sClever-1, which was not as dramatic in the tumor-bearing macrophage KO mice suggesting that the endothelial cells contribute half to the observed sClever-1 in murine blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). We also measured sClever-1 in the plasma of the breast cancer patients three weeks after their surgery and compared that to their pre-surgical blood sample. Overall sClever-1 dropped ~10% after tumor removal but was not significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), indicating a more systemic source of sClever-1 even though exposure of human primary macrophages to breast cancer cell conditioned medium upregulated sClever-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Importantly, chronic inflammation is reported to induce Clever-1 expression on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and Clever-1 expression on monocytes is rapidly decreased during pre-eclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Thus, we quantified sClever-1 release in macrophage stimulated with IFNγ + LPS or dexamethasone + IL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). Interestingly, IFNγ/LPS-stimulated macrophages released more sClever-1 than the ones stimulated with immunosuppressive factors, and was not due to shedding of Clever-1 from the cell surface as the level remained the same or even increased after IFNγ/LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Similarly, primary human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), which have high expression of Clever-1, adapted to an inflammatory stimulus by increasing the release of sClever-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Recombinant production and quality control of the ~200 kDa sClever-1</title><p id="P65">To investigate the function of the cancer enriched form of sClever-1 we recombinantly produced a half Clever-1 molecule (H1) mimicking the ~200 kDa sClever-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). The amino acid sequence of H1 consists of the first half of full-length Clever-1 and encompasses the peptide sequences identified by the pulldown and mass spec analyses of sClever-1 from plasma, and has a predicted MW of approximately the same size as sClever-1. The secreted protein was subsequently purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography to &gt;95% purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). H1 elutes as a broad, homogeneous monomeric peak with a minor, highly oligomeric fraction present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). The absolute MW of H1 agreed well with the sequence-derived molar mass and further suggested the presence of 18 ± 2% glycosylation by mass.

In non-activated T cells positive binding was observed in a FCS<sup>low</sup> population most likely representing apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, previous reports indicate that Clever-1 mediates PS-dependent clearance of cell corpses in alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However, when the lymphocytes were activated via T cell receptor (TCR) engagement a FSC<sup>high</sup> population became H1 positive, which was more prominent than H1 binding to the FSC<sup>low</sup> population in both non-activated and activated states after 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To verify that the FCS<sup>high</sup> cells were not apoptotic we stained them with Annexin V and FAM-VAD-FMK, which is a caspase inhibitor that blocks apoptosis and because of its carboxyfluorescein can be used to detect early apoptotic cells. As expected, the FSC<sup>low</sup> H1<sup>+</sup> cells produced a high signal for both markers, which was not observed in the FSC<sup>high</sup> H1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Pre-incubation of H1 with the anti-Clever-1 antibodies, bexmarilimab or 9-11, did not block H1 binding to T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), suggesting that the T cell interaction was occurring via a non-competing epitope. Due to the previously identified possible interaction of Clever-1 with PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) we pre-incubated the activated T cells with Annexin V to prevent H1 binding on the cells.

In the presence of H1 the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reached four generations during the six-day incubation period. Hence, no dramatic effect on proliferation compared to control treated cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). When looking at their differentiation based on lineage determining transcription factors T-bet and FoxP3, the H1 treated cells had a significantly higher percentage of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since suboptimal TCR activation has been reported to increase upregulation of FoxP3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) we assessed the early signalling events downstream of TCR. By binding to T cells H1 was able to impair the phosphorylation of Lck at Y394 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, in a Jurkat NFκB reporter cell line, the presence of H1 tended (<italic>P</italic> = 0.091) to reduce reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). FoxP3 is known to suppress the function of NFAT and NFκB, and this leads to suppression of the expression of many genes including IL2 and effector T cell cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Indeed, cytokine profiling of primary T cell cultures showed a significant reduction in IL1β, IL6, IL10 and IL17 among the measured 27 cytokines when incubated with H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These cytokines were not directly indicative of inducing any specific lineage differentiation of the activated T cells, thus we functionally tested how the T cells polarized autologous primary human macrophages. The H1 cultured T cells promoted a polarization change in macrophages seen as a significant downregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas Clever-1 expression on macrophages was upregulated suggesting a more immunosuppressive phenotype induced by the H1-treated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>H1 binds IGF2R on T cells via mannose-6-phosphate</title><p id="P70">Several ligands have been identified to bind Clever-1 such as acLDL, SPARC and chitinase like proteins and recently serum periostin, reelin, and TGFBi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). To identify the counter receptor for sClever-1 on T cells we first screened H1 binding on a HEK293 cell-based Retrogenix platform consisting of 6449 human plasma membrane proteins, tethered human secreted proteins and 397 heterodimer plasma membrane protein complexes. Testing H1 binding on fixed cells by two different staining protocols did not yield any hits. Thus, we next tested H1 binding on Jurkat cells to utilize them in affinity pulldown assays. To our surprise, H1 showed very good binding to all Jurkat cells even without prior TCR-stimulation. The binding was not induced by apoptosis since puromycin treated Jurkat cells did not bind H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Mass spec analysis of proteins pulled down with H1 revealed several hits involved in T cell activation such as IGF2R, TFRC, Zap70, CCT8, CCT6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P71">We have previously identified an interaction of cellular Clever-1 with transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) in primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Thus, we decided to investigate IGF2R in more detail as it was not included in the Retrogenix assay nor would endogenous IGF2R normally be displayed upon the cell surface of HEK293 cells. We observed a similar upregulation of IGF2R on the membrane of primary human T cells after ionomycin stimulation as we observed for Annexin V in primary human T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Indeed, it has previously been published that an increase in cell surface IGF2R is a transient and very early marker of primary T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Pulldown assays with Jurkat and primary human T cells confirmed the interaction of H1 with IGF2R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Using recombinant IGF2R in Octet we were able to validate that H1 bound directly to IGF2R in domains 1-10 but not in domains 11-13 known to bind IGF II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since IGF2R is a cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor we tested whether an excess amount of M6P or removing M6P from H1 by alkaline phosphate treatment would abolish H1 binding to IGF2R. On Octet, H1 binding to IGF2R was completely abolished with M6P manipulation (data not shown). Also, on Jurkat cells H1 binding was decreased with either an excess amount of free M6P or removal of M6P from H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). To fully demonstrate H1 binding on T cells via IGF2R, we knocked out either IGF2R or TFRC from Jurkat cells by CRISPR/Cas9. We were able to achieve a ~30% reduction in the expression levels of both proteins and this was able to decrease H1 binding by ~50% to IGF2R CRISPR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). It is interesting to note that gene silencing of TFRC downregulated IGF2R and therefore reduced also binding of H1 to TFRC CRISPR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). To confirm the interaction of endogenous sClever-1 with IGF2R, we performed Clever-1 pulldowns from serum and used a recombinant IGF2R containing an AviTag as detection reagent. Positive signal was observed with IGF2R when sClever-1 was detected, and was clearly reduced when the pulldowns were performed with Clever-1 depleted serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). In the circulation, IGF2R expressing lymphocytes were detected both in healthy donors (mean 18.6 ±7.6%) and breast cancer patients (mean 22.7 ±12.4) with high PD-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>).

This inhibition can be released by anti-PD1 (e.g. nivolumab) leading to activation of the NFAT-reporter. The gene silencing of <italic>STAB1</italic> with sg1 led to a complete depletion of the Clever-1 protein in both cell lysates and the vesicle fraction, whereas the gene silencing of <italic>STAB1</italic> with sg2 was less robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, in Clever-1 CRISPR macrophages CD206 expression was also substantially reduced. Different from gene silencing, the Clever-1-binding antibodies 9-11 and bexmarilimab did not induce downregulation of Clever-1 in the cells but were able to reduce sClever-1 compared to isotype-control-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, while Clever-1 was not expressed by M1 polarized macrophages (IFNγ and LPS), the extracellular vesicles (EV) released from these cells during polarization showed abundant levels of Clever-1. Hence, EVs derived from both M1 and M2 polarized macrophages reduced nivolumab-induced Jurkat reporter activity. In contrast, EVs derived from Clever-1 silenced M2 polarized macrophages were less suppressive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Of note, Clever-1 silencing nor bexmarilimab treatment per se did not contribute to the number of EVs secreted from macrophages (data not shown). Clever-1 itself was exposed on the EV surface since proteinase K treatment removed Clever-1 from the EV fraction detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P73">Since bexmarilimab is also clinically evaluated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia we silenced Clever-1 from the KG-1 AML cell line and incubated isolated EVs with activated primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

By day 14 sClever-1 was reduced with the most reduction observed with higher doses, although variation between patients occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). When we looked at the MATINS patient blood samples for sClever-1 binding on T lymphocytes at pre-dose and 1-2 weeks after treatment we observed that a subset of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, that initially showed positivity for sClever-1, significantly decreased 9-11 (anti-Clever-1) signal by two weeks on treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). A similar decrease was observed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but not on monocytes/macrophages where 9-11 binds to full-length Clever-1 expressed by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). This suggests that administration of bexmarilimab can reduce sClever-1 levels in cancer patients and thereby decrease sClever-1 engagement with T cells potentially contributing to the peripheral T cell activation observed in the MATINS trial patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that macrophage-derived Clever-1 containing EVs contribute to T cell suppression and anti-PD-1 resistance, which can be inhibited by bexmarilimab treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Elevated sClever-1 levels are linked to resistance against anti-PD-1 therapy</title><p id="P75">To investigate whether sClever-1 levels associate with response to immunotherapy, we obtained a dataset of lung carcinoma and melanoma patients with plasma sClever-1 levels measured before start of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.)

Therefore, we analyzed sClever-1 association with overall survival in these patient subsets separately. The analyses suggested higher sClever-1 levels to be a worse prognostic factor for patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S39" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P77">Clever-1 is known to govern tolerogenic activities on macrophages but it is not clear if it has direct immunosuppressive properties. Here we report the secretion of a truncated form of Clever-1 by macrophages and endothelial cells that bind T cells causing suboptimal T cell activation and promotes the differentiation of suppressive FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We identify secreted Clever-1 to be particularly enriched in the plasma of cancer patients indicating a possible broad systemic immunosuppressive role for this receptor.</p><p id="P78">The reason for elevated sClever-1 levels in cancer is not entirely clear but may reflect pre-existing chronic inflammation often associated with cancer. Indeed, it has been previously reported that breast cancer patients have alterations in several cytokines (both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory), including IFNγ and TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The underlying inflammatory cause for increased sClever-1 is further supported by our data showing the induction of the release by IFNγ/TNFα and the sustained sClever-1 levels after tumor surgery. Thus, the secretion of sClever-1 is most likely not specific to cancer but a reflection of a patient’s inflammatory status even though macrophages exposed to ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cell medium increased secretion of sClever-1. The conditioned medium of T47D cells has been shown to contain IFNγ and TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) possibly explaining the observed results.</p><p id="P79">The precise mechanism of the release of sClever-1 is not understood, but might be a result of its known functions in endosomal recycling and lysosomal release of other proteins such as YKL-39, a monocyte-attracting and pro-angiogenic chitinase-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) or a by-product of lysosomal clearance of its ligands, acLDL and SPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). While full-length Clever-1 is selectively expressed by immunosuppressive macrophage populations the abundance of sClever-1 in M1-derived EVs was surprising. We hypothesize this phenomenon can be a result of inflammation-induced activation of secretory pathways contributing to sClever-1 release. This phenomenon may have two possible biological functions. Firstly, upon M1-polarization, macrophages may need to rapidly eliminate Clever-1 to be able to respond to inflammatory cues. Secondly, the EV-derived sClever-1 may reduce the extent of activation of bystander lymphocytes in the surrounding microenvironment to prevent excessive inflammation. Indeed, several negative feedback mechanisms such as secretion of IL10, IDO1 and TGFβ are induced during immune activation to maintain homeostasis and prevent excessive immune responses that could lead to tissue damage or autoimmune diseases.</p><p id="P80">As most of the protein was found as a significantly truncated ~200 kDa form lacking a transmembrane domain, proteolytic activity in the endosomes may cause Clever-1 truncation. At least we did not observe any signs of alternative splicing of the receptor in its secreted form nor shedding of the receptor on the cell surface. Further, during the process of EV formation and release, PS can be externalized to the outer leaflet of the membrane to which sClever-1 might in theory remain bound to in the circulation. Externalization of PS is a well-known feature of apoptotic cells, where it serves as an “eat me” signal, facilitating the recognition and clearance of dying cells by phagocytes. However, Fischer and colleagues, have identified reversible, transient PS exposure to be a very early surface marker of cell activation in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Also, PS re-distribution has been shown to regulate non-apoptotic signal transduction in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P81">Annexins are known to bind PS and are highly involved in anti-inflammatory processes, adaptive immunity, modulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, as well as protective shielding of cells from phagocytosis. We initially hypothesized that sClever-1 can compete with Annexin V from binding to PS on activated T cells. However, this was not the case as we did not observe a difference in H1 binding after Annexin V pre-incubation. Thus, sClever-1 binding was most likely facilitated by another molecular interaction. To identify the counter ligand, we screened thousands of cell surface proteins by the Retrogenix platform using our recombinant H1 protein mimicking sClever-1. Due to the transient nature of the identified interaction of H1 on T cells it is not surprising that transfected and fixed HEK293 cells did not give any hits even though the quality of H1 was confirmed with extensive characterization showing a pure and stable, highly flexible, monomeric glycoprotein. Hence, biophysical and structural characterisation revealed properties of H1 that were not available in the literature and only hypothesized for class H scavenger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P82">Thus, we concentrated on Jurkat T cells and performed cell membrane pulldowns with H1. Three of the interaction partners strongly and consistently co-immunoprecipitated with H1 (TFRC, ZAP70, and most abundantly, IGF2R) are associated with the regulation of T cell activity. TFRC has been shown to interact with intracellular ZAP70 and can amplify T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). However, we found no direct interaction between H1 and recombinant TFRC, although we were able to measure a direct interaction between H1 and recombinant IGF2R protein on Octet BLI. On the T cell surface, IGF2R expression greatly increases upon T cell activation while CD26 becomes M6P-modified, enabling surface IGF2R to bind to M6P-modified CD26, promoting CD26 internalization and proliferation induced by CD26 co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Indeed, IGF2R is only typically found upon the surface of early activated T cells (not dormant T cells), <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, where free M6P has anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). IGF2R is vital for early T cell activation because it moves Lck into a favourable position with CD45 on the cell membrane, so that CD45 may activate Lck, which in turn may activate ZAP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Selective down-regulation of surface IGF2R improves CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell survival in the context of cell contraction after acute activation (LmOVA bacterial infection), possibly because IGF2R is able to bind and internalize GranzymeB, which is an M6P-modified secreted protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In Tregs, IGF2 enhances regulatory T cell functions via IGF2R stimulation independently of the M6P binding domains of IGF2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) In our experiments, H1 led to a decrease in Lck phosphorylation and increased FoxP3 expression and suppressive characteristics, while H1 bound to IGF2R on the surface of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Jurkat cells in a M6P-dependent manner. Given the increased concentration of circulating sClever-1 in the serum of cancer patients, and because, like H1, endogenous sClever-1 protein from AB serum is also somewhat M6P-modified, it is reasonable to hypothesize our findings may represent a contributing factor towards immunosuppression by Clever-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. According to our data, bexmarilimab does not antagonize sClever-1 binding to T cells, implying that bexmarilimab treatment cannot directly block the immunosuppressive effect of sClever-1. However, our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) shows that bexmarilimab can alter the trafficking of Clever-1 and impair endosomal acidification, which could lead to the observed reduced levels of sClever-1 on EVs. This is supported by our observations that no consistent changes in overall EV yields were detected after bexmarilimab treatment, as determined by protein concentration measurements. Therefore, we do not believe that bexmarilimab affects EV release. Instead, it likely decreases the generation of an EV-associated soluble form of sClever-1, thereby reducing systemic immunosuppression.</p><p id="P83">The cell type that is the greatest source of endogenous immunosuppressive sClever-1, or even M6P-modified plasma membrane-anchored full-length Clever-1, is not yet known and will be difficult to determine, given the variety of Clever-1 expressing myeloid and endothelial cell types (for example, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and phosphatase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We were unable to purify recombinant full length Clever-1 in a way that would allow us to accurately study its potential interaction with IGF2R. However, in our group’s previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), full length IGF2R was not amongst the proteins that were coimmunoprecipitated from M2 macrophage cell lysates by antibodies against Clever-1. While we observed an increase in sClever-1 levels in plasma of cancer patients with early and late-stage cancer, the tumor itself did not seem to be a major source of sClever-1 based on sClever-1 assessment in plasma of breast cancer patients before and three weeks after mastectomy. However, it is possible to envisage an engagement where an activated T cell may be close enough to a macrophage or endothelial cell to receive a suppressive dose of M6P-modified Clever-1, either alone, or in the context of immunosuppressive EVs. We acknowledge the limited characterization of EVs collected from cells and serum in this study but want to point out three studies where Clever-1 protein can be found in microvesicles and exosomes derived from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), in microparticles derived from endothelial cells (HUVEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and in serum exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Whether or not this is a major contributor to the immunosuppressive functions of Clever-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined. But our discovery of sClever-1 upon EVs in human serum, its positive correlation with cancer and negative correlation with anti-PD-1 response, and its reduced levels after bexmarilimab treatment, provide a promising platform to explore the potential of sClever-1 as a cancer prognostic and therapeutic biomarker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental material, figures and tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS199689-supplement-Supplemental_material__figures_and_tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S40"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Teija Kanasuo and Mari Parsama for excellent technical assistance, Blanca Tejeda González and Pieta Mattila for experimental help, the Turku Protein Core, the bioinformatics (J.V.
