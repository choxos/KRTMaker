Active RNR is cytoplasmic but the significance of this localization, away from DNA synthesis, is unclear, particularly as RNR is targeted to the nucleus after DNA damage occurs. We subverted the localization of fission yeast RNR by tagging the large (Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>) and small (Suc22<sup>R2</sup>) subunits with nuclear localization signal sequences. Directing RNR to the nucleus caused a slow S-phase and increased mutagenesis, in spite of predicted constitutive activation of RNR. Defective function of nuclear RNR is also suggested by the formation of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> supramolecular filaments and defective RNR reoxidation. In contrast, constitutively nuclear Cdc22 or Suc22 has little effect on DNA damage repair and in fact suppresses <italic>rad3</italic>Δ-sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. We suggest that there is an inadequate flux of substrate through nuclear RNR for S phase, but nuclear targeting of RNR may facilitate DNA damage repair under some circumstances.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ribonucleotide reductase</kwd><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>aberrant localization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) from ribonucleotides (NDPs). Correct regulation of RNR is vital for maintaining proper dNTP levels in the cell, ensuring high-fidelity DNA synthesis in replication and repair, thus preserving integrity of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bebenek et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chabes et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gon et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Holmberg et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mathews, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moss et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Pai and Kearsey, 2017</xref>). RNR is regulated at a number of different levels, including allosteric control, transcriptional regulation, proteolysis and interaction with small inhibitory proteins (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Guarino et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Holmberg and Nielsen, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2011</xref>)). Upon RNR inhibition, DNA replication slows, leading to activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint, and facilitating preservation of limiting dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alvino et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Koc et al., 2004</xref>). DNA damage leads to upregulation of RNR activity by a variety of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chabes et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Holmberg et al., 2005</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>)), to facilitate DNA synthesis associated with repair. Inability to upregulate dNTP levels by activating RNR during cell proliferation promotes cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bester et al., 2011</xref>), highlighting the importance of RNR in genome stability. Furthermore, inhibitors of RNR such as hydroxyurea, clofarabine and gemcitabine have been successfully employed in chemotherapy of numerous types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bonate et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Shao et al., 2006</xref>). It has been found that the most common base lesion in replicating yeast and mammalian cells is misincorporation of riboNMPs, instead of dNMPs. Thus, another consequence of reduced dNTP levels is likely to be increased riboNMP incorporation into replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yao et al., 2013</xref>), which can lead to genome instability and, if riboNMP removal is defective, autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Reijns et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). While low levels of RNR activity and corresponding low levels of dNTPs are detrimental to genome stability, high dNTP levels also affect DNA replication by reducing proofreading fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mathews, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Buckland et al., 2014</xref>) and by stimulating the activity of low fidelity translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Prakash and Prakash, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sabouri et al., 2008</xref>). During the cell cycle, dNTP levels are down-regulated outside of S phase and in nonproliferating cells, and in mammalian cells this down-regulation may be a strategy to inhibit viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Allouch et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, dNTP synthesis has been found to be facilitated through promotion of MBF gene transcription via Set2-dependent H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pai et al., 2017</xref>) and that maintaining dNTP homeostasis is critical in preventing replication failure in response to CDK-induced replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Eukaryotes use a class I RNR, which is composed of large (R1) and small (R2) subunits. R1 has the catalytic site and two sites for allosteric regulation whereas R2 provides a tyrosyl free radical that is transferred to the catalytic site to effect substrate reduction. The stoichiometry of active RNR is unclear; a tetramer composed of two large and two small subunits appears to be the minimally active complex (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Eklund et al., 2001</xref>)), but evidence suggests that higher order complexes may constitute the active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>). A conserved aspect of active RNR in eukaryotes is its cytoplasmic localization, with transport or diffusion of deoxyribonucleotides to sites of DNA synthesis in mitochondria or the nucleus respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pontarin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Engstrom et al., 1984</xref>), but the biological significance of this localization, away from sites of DNA synthesis, is unclear. In mammalian cells, R1, R2 and p53R2 subunits are constitutively cytoplasmic in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pontarin et al., 2008</xref>). However, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe,</italic> R1 is cytoplasmic or pancellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), while R2 is regulated by cytoplasmic localization, in that it is nuclear outside of S phase, but exported to the cytoplasm during S phase or after DNA damage to activate RNR. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, nuclear import of R2 is promoted by Dif1, and R2 is anchored in the nucleus by association with Wtm1. Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint leads to Dif1 phosphorylation and degradation, and release of R2 from Wtm1 allows formation of active R1-R2 complexes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wu and Huang, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). In fission yeast, upon DNA damage, Spd1 is downregulated, following ubiquitylation by CRL4-Cdt2, abolishing its interaction with R1 (Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>) in the cytoplasm and allowing RNR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Holmberg et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hakansson et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Liu et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Salguero et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In addition to cell cycle changes in RNR subunit localization, there have been several reports suggesting that, after DNA damage, RNR is localized to sites of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Niida et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">D’Angiolella et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>). This may facilitate repair synthesis, particularly at cell cycle stages when dNTP levels are depressed, in a manner which does not require a global increase in dNTP levels. Both large (hRRM1) and small subunits (hRRM2 and p53R2) are translocated to the nucleus after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Xue et al., 2003</xref>). This accumulation requires Tip60-RRM1 interaction and abolishing this interaction sensitizes cells to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Niida et al., 2010a</xref>). Furthermore, Cyclin F and RRM2 physically interact and colocalize to the nucleus in G2, and cyclin F-mediated RRM2 degradation seems to prevent genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">D’Angiolella et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to RNR, thymidylate kinase is targeted to sites of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). In tobacco, the R1a subunit is transiently relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon DNA damage possibly reflecting a role in RNR transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lincker et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, nuclear RNR might have additional functions such as regulation of transcription, especially since RNR-Tip60 complex can be formed even in non-DNA damage conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Niida et al., 2010a</xref>). However, these observations are controversial as other reports have failed to detect nuclear RNR in mammalian cells after DNA damage, suggesting cytoplasmic dNTPs can diffuse sufficiently fast into the nucleus in a manner that is not rate limiting for DNA synthesis or repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pontarin et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> it has been demonstrated that MCM helicase physically interacts with RNR and some of its regulators such as Dun1 kinase occur within small subpopulations of RNR-MCM, independently of their subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yáñez-Vilches et al., 2024</xref>). When these interactions are impaired, Rad52 release from DNA repair foci is disrupted, leading to hypermutagenesis. This highlights the non-canonical role which RNR can play in preserving the genetic stability of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yáñez-Vilches et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this investigation we study the importance of regulating RNR by Suc22<sup>R2</sup> cellular localization and the significance of the cytoplasmic localization of active RNR by directing Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits to the nucleus. Preventing colocalization of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> during S phase and after DNA damage impedes DNA replication but has relatively little effect on DNA damage sensitivity. Forcing the nuclear colocalization of both Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits has little effect on dNTP levels and DNA damage sensitivity but leads to a suboptimal S phase and increased mutation rate and has a different phenotype from when both Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits are cytoplasmic. Our results suggest that the highly conserved cytoplasmic localization of RNR in eukaryotic cells has evolved to optimise the dNTP supply for S phase, but nuclear RNR may not be detrimental and, in some circumstances may facilitate, DNA repair.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Redirecting fission yeast RNR activity to the nucleus</title><p id="P7">We subverted the normal cytoplasmic localization of active RNR by directing single or both large Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and small Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits to the nucleus. The endogenous <italic>suc22</italic> and <italic>cdc22</italic> genes, expressed from their native promoters, were modified so that the protein products have N-terminal NLS-GFP sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, right), and the cellular distribution of these proteins was compared to fluorescently-tagged versions of the proteins lacking NLSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is normally nuclear for most of the cell cycle and shows redistribution to the cytoplasm after inhibiting DNA synthesis with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, top panels). After tagging with NLS-GFP of Suc22 <sup>R2</sup> (henceforth referred to as NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup>), the subunit is constitutively nuclear both in exponentially growing cells and after treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom panels). Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> lacking an NLS is constitutively pancellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, top panels, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2003</xref>)), but after growth in HU, a high proportion of cells show aggregation of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> into cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, top panels). After NLS-GFP tagging of Cdc22 <sup>R1</sup> (henceforth referred to as NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>), the protein is nuclear, but rather than a uniform pan-nuclear distribution, shows accumulation in filaments which can be up to about 3 μm long, spanning the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, and 1E</xref>), and the distribution does not change significantly after arrest in S-phase following treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, bottom panels). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, RNR has been reported to form large supramolecular foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Noree et al., 2010</xref>), and we speculate that the fission yeast nuclear environment or higher local concentration of Cdc22 <sup>R1</sup> may in some way enhance the interaction between Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> subunits, leading to the formation of filament structures.</p><p id="P8">We also constructed a strain where both CFP-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and GFP-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits are localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These cells show similar nuclear distributions of proteins in exponential growth and after treatment with HU, with nuclear filaments, suggesting that the supramolecular structures seen with NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> alone are not affected by NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup>.</p><p id="P9">Each cycle of reduction of NDP by RNR generates a disulphide bond in the R1 active site. It has been proposed that this is reduced by a C-terminal pair of cysteines of another R1 subunit, before the newly formed disulphide bond at the C-terminus is reduced by thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), so we investigated whether Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> filaments seen in NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> might be due to aberrant intersubunit disulphide bond formation. Analysis on reducing gels showed that protein levels are affected by nuclear localization, with Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> levels decreased and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> levels increased compared to non-NLS versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) Colocalization of both subunits to the nucleus did not affect protein levels compared to strains where single subunits were constitutively nuclear. Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions showed additional bands with wild-type Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> at a position corresponding to a Cdc22 <sup>R1</sup> dimer, which is resolved by treatment with a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). With the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain, a high molecular weight smear is seen which is partially resolved by reduction, although in the strain where only NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> is present, this smear is barely visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, although this suggests that some unresolved disulphide bond formation involving nuclear Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and/or Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits leads to formation of high molecular weight complexes, this is unlikely to be responsible for the supramolecular structures seen by fluorescence microscopy, which are equally prominent in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> and NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strains.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Effect of targeting RNR subunits to the nucleus on dNTP levels</title><p id="P10">We used HPLC to determine how dNTP concentrations are affected by nuclear localization of RNR subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). N-terminal tagging of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> with CFP had no effect on dNTP levels compared to wild-type (wt), while similarly tagged Suc22<sup>R2</sup> showed approximately 50% of wt dNTP level suggesting that the tag, while tolerated, may interfere with RNR function.</p><p id="P11">Constitutively nuclear localization of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> would be predicted to increase RNR activity for most of the cell cycle, when Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is also localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Conversely, during S phase, reduced RNR activity would be predicted, since Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is relocalized to the cytoplasm but Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> will remain nuclear. Reduced RNR activity would also be predicted from the lower level of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> in the NLS strain. These opposing effects may account for the measured dNTP level in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain, which is approximately wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Constitutive localization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> to the nucleus would be predicted to lead to low levels of RNR activity, since outside of S phase Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is nuclear anyway, but preventing Suc22<sup>R2</sup> nuclear export during S phase would block formation of active cytoplasmic RNR. However, the measured dNTP concentration in the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain is about the same as in the control GFP-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain. It is possible that the higher level of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> protein seen in the NLS strain may compensate for the reduction in RNR activity expected from prevention of nuclear export.</p><p id="P13">Constitutive localization of both Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> to the nucleus would be predicted to lead to increased RNR activity, since both Suc22<sup>R2</sup> and Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> are in the same compartment for the entire cell cycle, rather than being in separate compartments outside of S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Thus, an elevation of dNTP levels might be expected but the levels are approximately wt. This could be partly due to the reduction in Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> levels seen when the subunit is nuclear-targeted. For comparison, dNTP levels are much more significantly elevated in a Cdc22-D57N mutant, where the dATP allosteric downregulation of RNR activity is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fleck et al., 2013</xref>)). Taken together, these results suggest that blocking the regulation of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> by nuclear export and forcing the nuclear localization of active RNR have minor effects on dNTP levels, perhaps due to other compensatory regulatory mechanisms, and the confounding effects of changed RNR subunit levels.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Constitutively nuclear RNR inhibits growth and S phase</title><p id="P14">We examined growth rate and S phase progression to determine if they are affected by constitutively nuclear RNR subunits. CFP-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and GFP-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> tagged strains show similar growth rates to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). However, strains where one or both RNR subunits are NLS-tagged show a slight reduction in growth rate, consistent with a slightly bigger cell size in NLS-cdc22 NLS-Suc22, NLS-Cdc22 and CFP-Cdc22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>, left panel). Analysis of DNA contents of exponentially growing cells showed that the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strains exhibit slow S phase progression in that there is a &lt;2C shoulder on the histogram, although the NLS-Suc22<sup>R</sup>2 strain shows no such defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>, right panel).</p><p id="P15">Since it can be difficult to see S phase defects by analysing unsychronised cultures, we performed flow cytometry analysis of S phase progression in cells released from a nitrogen-starvation induced G1 block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). S phase in the wt was completed 5 hours after release. Both CFP-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and GFP-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strains showed a slightly slower S phase, but S phase was complete by 6 hours. In contrast, cells expressing NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> came out of the G1 block more slowly, and a G1/S phase population was still present 3-6 hours after release, especially for the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain. This slow S phase can be accounted for by the predicted lowered dNTP levels in S phase, as RNR subunits are directed to different compartments. Although the dNTP measurements show no dramatic reduction, these were made on unsynchronised cells, so significant changes in dNTP levels in S phase may be obscured since this is a relatively short fraction of the cell cycle. However, the fact that these strains are viable indicates that sufficient RNR activation is occurring in spite of NLS tagging. So, in the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain, there is perhaps sufficient nuclear Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, and in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain, a pool of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> may remain nuclear or traffic to the nucleus during S phase, in both cases providing an adequate dNTP supply for DNA synthesis.</p><p id="P16">Targeting both RNR subunits to the nucleus resulted in a faster S phase compared to when either Suc22<sup>R2</sup> or Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> were nucleus-targeted, but still a substantial number of cells were in S phase at 4-6 h following G1 block and release. Paradoxically, RNR activity would be expected to be high in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain, so the slow S phase is unexpected.</p><p id="P17">To analyse whether the slow S phase seen in nucleus-targeted RNR strains is due to reduced dNTP levels, we looked at the effects of deleting the Spd1 RNR inhibitor, which results in an ca. two-fold increase in dNTP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fleck et al., 2013</xref>). We found that depletion of Spd1 does eradicate the &lt;2C profile seen in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain consistent with the notion that low dNTP levels in this strain are constraining S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). We saw no effect of deleting Spd2, consistent with a study showing that this protein is not an RNR inhibitor (Vejrup-Hansen et al., 2014).

Therefore, defective DNA damage repair in the nuclear RNR strains would suggest low dNTP supply problems, while increased resistance to DNA damage could indicate high dNTP levels, possibly enhanced by the nuclear localization of active RNR. Strains expressing either NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> or NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> show similar sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents (camptothecin, MMS, UV, 4-NQO) to control strains, possibly with a slightly increased sensitivity to DNA Double Strand (DSB) formation by bleocin/bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). GFP tagging of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> causes increased sensitivity to HU, but this is suppressed by nuclear localization, possibly because Suc22 levels are higher in NLS-Suc22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, preventing colocalization of RNR subunits in the same compartment does not appear to have a dramatic negative effect on DNA repair efficiency, implying that the local dNTP supply for repair pathways is adequate.

Taken together these results indicated that the DNA repair defects of a <italic>rad3</italic>Δ strain are suppressed by nuclear localization of RNR, but in a wt background there is not marked repair enhancement or deficiency, in contrast to the replication defects seen in these strains. We speculate that the dNTP demands of DNA repair, but not S phase, can be met by nuclear RNR as repair makes less of a demand on dNTP supply compared to replication, and nuclear RNR is compromised for maximum activation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Constitutively nuclear RNR results in an increased mutation rate</title><p id="P22">Correctly balanced levels of dNTPs are critical for high fidelity of DNA replication in S phase. For instance, high levels of dNTPs are associated with reduced fidelity of proofreading and low levels may increase the mutation rate by promoting riboNMP incorporation or polymerase switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Holmberg et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we assessed mutation rates in strains with nuclear RNR to see if this aspect of genome stability was disturbed. Using assays based on acquisition of canavanine resistance and reversion of an <italic>ade6</italic> mutation, we detected the most dramatic (two-to five-fold) increase in mutation rates for the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc222 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, P=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, P~0.05). This strain is predicted to have active RNR in the nucleus in S phase and measured dNTP levels are similar to wt. It is difficult to explain this result on the basis of globally elevated dNTP pools.

One interpretation of these results is that a local nuclear increase in dNTP levels is contributing to the reduced fidelity of DNA replication and this is not detectable in unsynchronized cells. The NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strains show a smaller increase in mutation rate in the CanR assay, which is consistent with the prediction that these strains are compromised in upregulating dNTP levels in S phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study we have addressed the biological significance of the cytoplasmic localization of active RNR and cellular relocalization of the R2 subunit as a regulatory mechanism. Our main findings are that, despite the normal relocalization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> to the cytoplasm during S phase for RNR activation, constitutive targeting of both subunits to the nucleus does not increase dNTP levels, as assessed from asynchronous cells. However, RNR protein levels, S phase progression, and genome stability are misregulated. The presence of CFP-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> filaments is a striking consequence of directing this subunit to the nucleus. When Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> or Suc22<sup>R2</sup> subunits are directed in the nucleus, S phase execution is slowed. When both RNR subunits are targeted in the nucleus, S phase execution is faster compared to the single NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> or NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strains, but still slower compared to a wild-type S phase. None of these effects is dependent on activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. Targeting single or both RNR subunits to the nucleus suppresses DNA damage sensitivity in a <italic>rad3</italic>Δ checkpoint deficient mutant. Finally, targeting Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, Suc22<sup>R2</sup>, or both RNR subunits to the nucleus increases the spontaneous mutation rate. These results indicate that regulation of RNR by subcellular relocalization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is an important but not essential aspect of dNTP control. Furthermore, nuclear localization of RNR is suboptimal for normal S phase execution but apparently not DNA repair. This result may explain why active RNR is evolutionarily conserved in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Altered levels of RNR subunits and filament formation of nuclear-targeted Cdc22<sup>R1</sup></title><p id="P24">Unexpectedly, targeting of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> to the nucleus resulted in a reduction and elevation, respectively, of protein levels, and in addition a high proportion of cells show filaments of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>. Both Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> are stable proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>), so the increase in Suc22<sup>R2</sup> levels is likely to be due to increased expression. Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is upregulated by DNA damage and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fernandez Sarabia et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Harris et al., 1996</xref>) via a mechanism that involves cytoplasmic polyadenylation of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Saitoh et al., 2002</xref>). This upregulation may also be triggered by constitutive nuclear localization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup>. With regard to the nuclear filaments of Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, this is unlikely to be an artifact due to GFP tagging, as filaments are not seen with GFP-tagged Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> in the cytoplasm. The artifactual aggregation was not an issue in a large study of GFP-tagged proteins, which also reported cytoplasmic R1 foci in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that filament formation may lead to the reduced protein level of NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, and S phase defects. Filament formation does not require Suc22<sup>R2</sup>, and we do not observe abundant non-reduced Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> in a strain only expressing NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, suggesting that disulphide bond formation is not involved. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, supramolecular assemblies of gemcitabine-inhibited RNR have been reported, where R14R24 rings interlock to form large catenated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Zimanyi et al., 2012</xref>).

In our case, it is unclear why these structures are only seen with NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, but it is possible that a higher concentration of the subunit in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm could be responsible.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Effect on S phase and DNA repair by inhibiting RNR subunits relocalization to the same compartment</title><p id="P25">In wt cells, relocalization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> to the cytoplasm in S phase is part of the mechanism to activate RNR and dNTP production for S phase, and a similar relocalization occurs after DNA damage. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, S phase levels of dNTPs are about two-fold higher than during the rest of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hakansson et al., 2006</xref>), but cell cycle relocalization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> only partly contributes to this mechanism. Targeting only one of the two RNR subunits to the nucleus is predicted to subvert the activation of RNR in S phase by keeping the subunits in different cellular compartments. In the case of NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, Suc22<sup>R2</sup> will be relocalized to the cytoplasm during S phase, while with the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> strain, Suc22<sup>R2</sup> nuclear export in S phase will be blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, in both these strains, the dNTP supply may be compromised in S phase, and this is consistent with the observed slow S phase and an increased mutation rate. Although measurement of the dNTP level in the NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain shows no difference from wt, the increase in RNR activity outside of S phase (when both NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> and Suc22<sup>R2</sup> are nuclear) may mask a reduction in S phase.</p><p id="P26">After DNA damage, Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is also relocalized to the cytoplasm where it can form an active complex with Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>. This reactivation of RNR is predicted to be blocked in the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> or NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain, with a detrimental influence on DNA repair. In reality, effects on DNA repair are minor, possibly with an increased sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents, consistent with a requirement for upregulation of dNTPs to facilitate DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moss et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Effect on S phase and DNA repair by constitutive localization of RNR to the same compartment</title><p id="P27">In contrast to strains where a single RNR subunit is targeted to the nucleus, targeting both subunits would not be expected to compromise dNTP supply during S phase and after DNA damage, since this mirrors the wt situation with active RNR in the nucleus instead of the cytoplasm.

The effect on S phase is not suppressed by <italic>spd1</italic> Δ, suggesting that it is not due to reduced dNTP levels, but rather a consequence of having active RNR in the wrong compartment. In terms of sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, the NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> strain shows an increased sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents, and a slightly increased resistance to 4-NQO, suggesting that the efficiencies of DSB repair and NER are differentially affected by nuclear RNR, but the effects are relatively minor. Similar to <italic>spd1</italic>Δ, NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> also suppresses the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad3</italic>Δ, presumably as there is no requirement for checkpoint activation to allow upregulation of dNTP supply. In all, these results suggest that the normal cytoplasmic localization of RNR is an important factor for normal S phase.</p><p id="P28">If the effect on S phase is not due to reduced dNTP levels, what could be the explanation? High levels of dNTPs have been reported to delay S phase in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Franzolin et al., 2013</xref>), and also in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> where the loading of Cdc45 during replication initiation is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chabes and Stillman, 2007</xref>). Although dNTP levels are apparently normal in NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup> NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> cells, it is possible that a privileged dNTP pool generated by nuclear RNR does not equilibrate quickly with the bulk dNTP pool across the cell, and a locally high dNTP level has inhibitory effects on S phase. An early study suggested that nuclear and cytoplasmic dNTP levels are not equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Skoog and Bjursell, 1974</xref>) and the observed localization of RNR to sites of DNA damage in mammalian cells is assumed to facilitate DNA repair by providing a local dNTP supply, as if the diffusion rate of dNTPs is a limiting factor if RNR is active only in the cytoplasm. It would be interesting to see how constitutively low dNTP levels such as the ones observed after Wee1 inactivation leading to increased dNTP demand and replication stress through CDK-induced firing of replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pai et al., 2019</xref>) would affect RNR subunits localization.</p><p id="P29">A second possibility is that maintaining dNTP concentration at an optimal level during S phase is less efficient due to an inadequate flux of substrate through nuclear RNR. The pool of dNTPs in S phase is only sufficient for a small fraction of genome synthesis in S phase and RNR must be efficiently upregulated to provide adequate dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chabes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hakansson et al., 2006</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Niida et al., 2010b</xref>). Inefficiencies in this buffering process might not be manifested in measurements of dNTP levels in asynchronous cells. This is less likely to be a factor in DNA repair, as there is not such a demand on nucleotide supply. This explanation could be related to the reactivation of RNR, since every cycle of reduction leads to the formation of a disulphide bond in the R1 subunit, which must be reduced for the next cycle of reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zahedi Avval and Holmgren, 2009</xref>), and conceivably this process is less efficient in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. In support of this notion, we observe high molecular weight complexes on nonreducing gels in cells expressing NLS-Suc22<sup>R2</sup> NLS-Cdc22<sup>R1</sup>, which are partially resolved by reduction. Alternatively, the NDP substrate for RNR, or the conversion of dNDPs to dNTPs may be more limiting in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P30">Overall, these results stress that the rate and fidelity of DNA replication are better supported by cytoplasmic rather than nuclear RNR, which is implied by the evolutionary conservation of RNR localization. RNR activity in the cytoplasm followed diffusion into the nucleus may constitute a buffering mechanism that avoids local high concentrations of dNTPs that might occur if RNR were active in the nucleus. In contrast, nuclear RNR is adequate and in some circumstances beneficial for DNA repair. Subverting the cellular regulation of RNR by blocking the colocalization of RNR subunits in the same compartment is not lethal but is suboptimal for DNA synthesis. This suggests that while the regulation of RNR by cytoplasmic relocalization is an important regulating factor, it is moderated by other regulatory mechanisms, a conclusion also reached by analysis of Spd1 mutants showing that the correct compartmentalization of Suc22<sup>R2</sup> is not required for RNR regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nestoras et al., 2010</xref>). Simultaneous regulation of RNR by a wide range of regulatory mechanisms may together guard against stochastic deviations in dNTP concentrations, analogous to overlapping mechanisms that prevent reinitiation at origins, and contribute to genome stability during DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Strains, constructs and growth conditions</title><p id="P31"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> summarizes the strains used in this study and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> lists the primers used for the construction and verification of the strains.

Chromatography was carried out based on a previously described method on a Waters 2695 system with diode array detection (Waters 2996), monitoring at 254 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pires et al., 2010</xref>).
