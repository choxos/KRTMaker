Unfortunately, we lack the subunit composition for all human protein complexes. To address this gap we integrated &gt;25,000 mass spectrometry experiments using a machine learning approach to identify &gt; 15,000 human protein complexes. We show our map of protein complexes is highly accurate and more comprehensive than previous maps, placing ~75% of human proteins into their physical contexts. We globally characterize our complexes using protein co-variation data (ProteomeHD.2) and identify co-varying complexes suggesting common functional associations. Our map also generates testable functional hypotheses for 472 uncharacterized proteins which we support using AlphaFold modeling. Additionally, we use AlphaFold modeling to identify 511 mutually exclusive protein pairs in hu.MAP3.0 complexes suggesting complexes serve different functional roles depending on their subunit composition. We identify expression as the primary way cells and organisms relieve the conflict of mutually exclusive subunits. Finally, we import our complexes to EMBL-EBI’s Complex Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home</ext-link>) as well as provide complexes through our hu.MAP3.0 web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org/">https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org/</ext-link>). We expect our resource to be highly impactful to the broader research community.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteins are the functional units of the cell yet they carry out cellular functions by self assembling into large macromolecular protein complexes. A more complete understanding of human cells requires a better understanding of the functional complexes in those cells. Major advances in high throughput proteomics and machine learning workflows have allowed both the collection of large datasets and the integration of those datasets into more accurate and complete sets of protein complexes. In particular, experimental workflows based on affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and proximity labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> have been applied to different cells, tissues, and organisms generating a large compendium of proteomics data focused on identifying protein complexes. We have previously integrated several of these datasets using machine learning in our hu.MAP1 and hu.MAP2 resources which have been extremely valuable at identifying candidate disease genes, functionally annotating the proteome’s least characterized proteins, and identifying multifunctional promiscuous proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In total hu.MAP2 placed half of the human proteins (~10,000) into protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Orthogonal approaches, based on co-expression/covariation of proteins in mass spectrometry based datasets across many conditions, have been developed to identify functional modules of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. While these networks are not physical in nature, the efforts have shown subunits of protein complexes are often highly co-expressed and provide a powerful signature for shared co-complex interactions.</p><p id="P4">Here we describe an improved hu.MAP3.0 computational workflow for the integration of high throughput proteomics experiments to identify human protein complexes. Using this workflow we integrate &gt;25,000 mass spectrometry experiments from multiple approaches (i.e. AP-MS, CF-MS, proximity labeling) and identify greater than 15,000 protein complexes for ~70% of the human proteome (&gt;13,700 total proteins). We compare physical complexes identified by hu.MAP3.0 to protein covariation networks and find many complexes have tight co-expression patterns. Additionally, we utilize AlphaFold structural models of protein pairs to identify mutually exclusive proteins (i.e. pairs of proteins that cannot coexist in complex). These are further supported by co-variation networks. In total we identify 511 mutually exclusive pairs which point to potential regulation and functional outcomes of complexes in different cell types, tissues, and organelles. We also analyze our map to identify understudied proteins which physically associate with well annotated complexes. We place 472 understudied proteins, including several disease associated, into complexes providing testable hypotheses as to their function. Finally, we make our identified complexes available through two major resources, a hu.MAP3.0 web resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org">https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org</ext-link>) and EMBL-EBI’s Complex Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">To construct a more accurate and comprehensive set of protein complexes, we use machine learning to integrate published high throughput proteomics experiments. Each experimental dataset targets interactions from different cell types and different parts of the proteome. This therefore provides a broad sampling of human protein complexes as well as multiple lines of evidence for each protein complex. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, we show a schematic representation of the full machine learning pipeline to produce protein complexes. The pipeline consists of 3 major steps: 1) organization and generation of features predictive of protein interactions, 2) training of ML model to generate protein interaction network, and 3) clustering of network to identify complexes. This final step results in 15,326 complexes covering 13,769 human proteins and consisting of 159,451 total scored protein interactions. This set of complexes, which we call the hu.MAP3.0 human protein complex map, considerably increases coverage compared to previous complex maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B-D</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Integration of high throughput proteomics datasets to assemble evidence of protein interactions</title><p id="P6">We first describe our development of the hu.MAP3.0 machine learning pipeline. The initial phase includes organizing evidence features from experimental datasets from CF-MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, AP-MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, Proximity Labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and RNA pulldown experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In our current work, we include a significant number of new experiments from the BioPlex3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> effort which adds ~10k new AP-MS experiments to our workflow. Machine learning features from each experiment were collated into a feature matrix where each feature provides evidence of a protein-protein interaction and is specific to each experiment type. CF-MS features contain similarity measures of pairs of protein’s elution in a biochemical separation (e.g. Pearson correlation coefficient) with high similarity as evidence for potential interaction. Pulldown and proximity features contain metrics of the presence of an individual prey protein identified in a bait protein experiment. These measures provide models for bait-prey interactions. To capture additional evidence of interaction between prey proteins, we reanalyzed AP-MS, RNA pulldown, and Proximity Labeling datasets using our weighted matrix model approach (WMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to identify pairs of proteins seen in these large datasets more often than random (see methods). This feature has been extremely valuable at identifying novel interactions in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Construction of machine learning model to identify protein interactions</title><p id="P7">We next build a machine learning model using evidence features to identify pairs of proteins that interact in a complex. Once we constructed our feature matrix, we label the pairs of proteins with our training set derived from manually curated protein complexes in the Complex Portal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To generate a training and test set, we randomly split protein complexes from Complex Portal and remove any pairs that overlap. We next label our feature matrix as either being previously seen in a training complex together (i.e. positive label), seen in different training complexes (i.e. negative label), or not seen at all (i.e. unknown) (see methods). We then use the feature matrix labeled with training data to build a ML classifier. For this step we use AutoGluon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which automates model and hyper-parameter selection across 13 machine learning models. We empirically evaluated several evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, and F1 score, and identified accuracy as having the optimal performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S1A</xref>). The AutoGluon step builds a weighted ensemble model based on the top performing classifiers. We then generate a network consisting of ~26 million protein pairs where all pairs of proteins are classified using the final weighted ensemble model. The model produces a confidence score for each pair of proteins representing the estimated probability of the pair interacting based on the evidence.</p><p id="P8">We then evaluate our final model using a precision recall analysis evaluated on a leave out test set of protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). We compare our current hu.MAP3.0 protein interaction network against our prior protein interaction network, hu.MAP2.0, as well as the Bioplex3 interaction network. We see our current hu.MAP3.0 outperforms the other networks, increasing in both precision and recall, with an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.68. Bioplex3 and hu.MAP2.0 have an AUPRC of 0.38 and 0.61, respectively. To assess how well the confidence score generated by our model reflects the true precision of the network, we compare the confidence score to precision as determined by the leave out test set. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure S1B-C</xref>, we see the confidence score closely reflects the true precision. We also see the relationship between confidence score and test set label (true or false interaction) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure S1D</xref>. Here we see the majority of true interactions have substantially higher confidence scores and the vast majority of false interactions have very low confidence scores.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of protein complexes within protein interaction network</title><p id="P9">We next cluster the full protein interaction network to identify protein complexes. This is done using a two stage clustering approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). We first use the ClusterOne algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> followed by the MCL algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> which both have free parameters to define. To determine optimal clusters, we test combinations of parameters in both algorithms as well as determine a confidence threshold for the input protein interaction network. We use each parameter combination to generate a set of clusters which are then evaluated against a training set of known protein complexes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the evaluation of all sets of clusters from 1,080 parameter combinations on the set of curated training complexes. Each set of clusters is evaluated using the <italic>k</italic>-clique precision and recall measures which globally compares a set of clusters against a benchmark set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In this evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), we see a tradeoff between precision and recall, where some cluster sets have high precision low recall, other cluster sets have lower precision high recall, and others are not optimized for either. We select six clustering sets along this boundary to combine into our final set of hu.MAP3.0 predicted complexes. We rank each set of clusters according to their precision value, considering the highest precision as “Extremely High” confident, followed by “Very High”, “High”, “Moderately High”, “Medium High”, and “Medium”. The last of which, “Medium” has the highest recall of all other cluster sets. The full set of hu.MAP3.0 complexes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. We then evaluate all six cluster sets and their union on a benchmark of curated leave out test complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). We see that all six cluster sets have a consistent order in terms of their tradeoff between precision and recall, with “Extremely High” clusters having the highest precision and lowest recall, and the “Medium” clusters having the highest recall and lowest precision. Specific complexes were seen multiple times throughout the confidence values. We therefore assigned each final complex the highest confidence level in which the complex was seen. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure S2A</xref> shows the distribution of complex size relative to complex confidence levels. We see complex size increase with lower levels of confidence (i.e. higher recall). This is likely due to core members of complexes being confidently identified in high confidence levels and additional auxiliary subunits added to complexes in lower confidence clusters. Total number of complexes is highest in our highest confidence level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows our highest confidence level has broad coverage of the proteome. We observe the total number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) per confidence level rise as we decrease in confidence, again suggesting that high confidence complexes are smaller representing core subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We also evaluate the union of all cluster sets, and observe it has the highest recall over all the individual cluster sets and see hu.MAP3.0 complexes outperform Bioplex3 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). We also compare the coverage of proteins, protein interactions, and complexes and see hu.MAP3.0 increases comprehensiveness over both Bioplex3 and hu.MAP2.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B-D</xref>). Finally, we observe nearly 40% of complexes are enriched with an annotation including from Gene Ontology (GO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, KEGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, Reactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, CORUM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and Human Phenotype Ontology (HP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Protein covariation provides orthogonal evidence for hu.MAP3.0 complexes</title><p id="P11">Protein covariation analysis, also known as coexpression or co-regulation analysis, identifies proteins exhibiting coordinated changes in abundance across biological conditions. We and others have previously shown that protein covariation analysis is a powerful approach to capture functional relationships between proteins and provide novel insights into proteome organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. For our protein covariation resource, ProteomeHD, we re-processed thousands of mass spectrometry runs that had been manually selected to reflect protein abundance changes in response to various biological perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. For example, typical experimental designs included comparisons of mutant to wildtype cells, and drug <italic>vs</italic> control treatments. We then used a decision-tree - based algorithm to determine likely functional relationships between proteins based on correlated expression patterns. Therefore, hu.MAP and ProteomeHD are conceptually similar. Both approaches integrate thousands of proteomics experiments using machine-learning to infer protein - protein associations in a data-driven manner. However, they are also highly complementary as they rely on fundamentally different types of evidence and raw data. While hu.MAP integrates experiments that determine physical interactions, protein covariation analysis draws on expression data from an entirely distinct set of mass spectrometry experiments, highlighting functional relationships based on covariation rather than physical interaction.</p><p id="P12">Despite these differences, we and others have previously found that many strongly covarying proteins are in fact subunits of the same protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that many complexes have strong covariation signatures. Therefore, we reasoned that protein covariation could provide orthogonal evidence to validate, enrich and annotate our human protein complex map. To test this we combined protein-protein interaction probabilities from hu.MAP3.0 with covariation scores from ProteomeHD.2 (ProHD.2), a recently developed successor of ProteomeHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). In comparison to the first iteration of ProteomeHD, ProHD.2 incorporates a larger number of biological conditions and uses an improved, supervised machine-learning strategy to determine proteins whose abundance covaries across these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (see methods). In total, 15 million protein pairs are covered by both hu.MAP3.0 and ProteomeHD.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S3A</xref>). To assess if the datasets are indeed complementary, we compared them to high-quality, experimentally determined pairwise interactions from the OpenCell project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, which neither hu.MAP3.0 nor ProHD.2 used as input. Indeed, protein pairs with high association scores in both hu.Map3.0 and ProHD.2 are much more likely to be captured by OpenCell than random pairs (29% vs 0.3%, respectively), and significantly more likely than pairs captured by only one of the two approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S3B</xref>). This suggests that protein covariation provides orthogonal evidence to support protein interactions in hu.MAP3.0.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Covariation provides complementary insights into complex biology</title><p id="P13">We next asked what the combined hu.MAP3.0 and ProHD.2 data could tell us about the nature of protein complex expression. We find that complexes show varying degrees of subunit covariation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Some hu.MAP3.0 protein complexes are tightly co-expressed modules with all subunits showing highly coordinated abundance changes, such as the mitochondrial ribosome and a nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Other complexes, such as the nuclear pore and integrator complexes, have weaker but still very clear coexpression signatures. However, many complexes show low subunit covariation. There could be technical explanations for this, such as a failure of ProHD.2 to capture covariation patterns for some proteins (false negatives in ProHD.2) as well as potential complex prediction errors (false positives in hu.MAP3.0). However, we find that the degree of complex covariation correlates only mildly with hu.MAP3.0 confidence levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S4</xref>), suggesting that poor subunit covariation is not simply the result of potential complex prediction errors. Low covariation scores may also be observed for biological reasons, for example if complex subunits have additional, non-overlapping functions outside of the complex. In the case of a hu.MAP3.0 complex consisting of SEC23A, SEC23B, SEC24C and SEC24D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), a low subunit covariation could reflect the fact at SEC23A / SEC23B and SEC24C / SEC24D are paralogues, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, which could potentially form mutually exclusive Sec23-24 dimers. We explore the possibility to use our data to systematically detect mutually exclusive subunits below. Taken together, these results suggest that, while a high covariation score supports physical interaction evidence, a low covariation score is more difficult to interpret and does not necessarily imply a lack of physical interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Protein covariation captures associations between and within complexes</title><p id="P14">Unlike traditional protein-protein interaction mapping, protein covariation can identify functionally associated proteins even when they do not physically interact. This is because proteins involved in related biological processes may exhibit coordinated abundance changes despite the lack of direct physical contact. For example, we have shown that the peroxisomal protein PEX11β covaries with proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Now, we leverage this property to assess inter-complex covariation, determining which complexes display similar expression patterns across the ProHD.2 dataset. This analysis enabled us to construct a map connecting dozens of hu.MAP3.0 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). It identifies associations between functionally related complexes, such as the mitochondrial respiratory complexes NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) and ATP synthase (complex V). However, these two complexes do not co-vary with the mitochondrial ribosome, indicating that the detection of inter-complex associations is function-specific and does not merely capture subcellular localisation. We observe strong covariation between two hu.MAP3.0 complexes enriched in translation initiation factors and proteasomal proteins, respectively. This association may reflect a role of the proteasome in translation quality control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, some inter-complex associations are more difficult to interpret. For example, the proteasome shares a broadly similar expression profile with subunits of the MCM replication factor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We next explored if covariation analysis could reveal substructures within individual protein complexes, using the proteasome as a well-annotated example. The 26S proteasome is a large 30+ subunit protein complex responsible for protein degradation and maintaining protein homeostasis. The full complex is made up of defined subcomplexes including a 20S core and 19S regulatory particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The hu.MAP3.0 complex huMAP3_09656.1 includes these core and regulatory subunits of the proteasome, along with tissue-specific core subunits and several assembly chaperones, activator complexes and other proteins known to associate with the proteasome. The degree of covariation between members of this complex reflects known biological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Subunits from the 20S core and the 19S regulatory particle exhibit strong covariation within their respective subcomplexes, with slightly lower covariation observed between these two substructures. The immunoproteasome-specific subunits PSMB8-10, which replace PSMB5-7 in immune cells, show weaker covariation with other core subunits compared to their canonical counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The two subunits of the PA28αβ activator (PSME1, PSME2) strongly covary with each other and with multiple proteasome subunits, but demonstrate weak covariation with the PA28γ activator (PSME3), which, despite structural similarity, has a distinct biological role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Additionally, the proteasome assembly chaperone PAC3 (PSMG3), which forms a heterodimer with PAC4 (PSMG4), interacts preferentially with the α5 core subunit (PSMA5), as reflected in the higher covariation scores with these proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

We found enrichment in “vesicle-mediated transport”, “cytoskeletal organization”, and “kinase activity”. These align with our highlighted examples above, AP1 complex (vesicle transport), septin interactions (cytoskeleton) and STK38L-MOB1A-MOB2 interactions (kinase activity). Overall this suggests these biological systems reuse core components and alter their function by substitution of modular subunits.</p><p id="P34">Studies of individual complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> as well as systematic investigations in yeast have suggested protein paralogs as mutually exclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup>.

To investigate this, we turned to a recent large-scale study that reported proteomes for 949 human cancer cell lines, derived from 28 tissues and over 40 different cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>. We first examined whether hu.MAP3.0 complexes exhibited differential expression between cancer lineages and identified complexes whose expression most varies across the different cancer lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S7</xref>). Among them, the MCM complex (huMAP3_00154.1), which is upregulated in blood cancer lineages, including leukemias and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S8</xref>). Although from this dataset alone we cannot determine whether MCM upregulation reflects disease progression, upregulation of the MCM complex has previously been associated with poor overall survival in lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">While our analysis revealed that cancer lineages vary significantly in terms of how many complexes are differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S8</xref>), most hu.MAP3.0 complexes do not show lineage-specific expression variation as a unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S7</xref>). We therefore assessed whether individual subunits of these complexes may be expressed in a lineage-specific manner. Specifically, we focussed on potential mutually exclusive subunits. For all subunits of hu.MAP3.0 complexes we calculated a pairwise mutual exclusivity score, which we named ALL-IN (Average cel<underline>L L</underline>ineage co-expressIo<underline>N</underline>) score, as it integrates the following four expression-based features (see methods): (1) correlation of protein abundances across the 949 cancer cell lines; (2) correlations aggregated by lineage; (3) a metric capturing very large expression differences (expression vs non-expression); (4) correlation with other subunits of the complex. To evaluate, we divide the mutually exclusive pairs into two groups based on whether the common subunit is known to form homomultimers (see methods). We anticipate common subunits that homomultimerize provide additional binding sites that can accommodate additional subunits alleviating the conflict of mutually exclusive subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). Indeed, we see pairs with common subunits that are non-homomultimers are much more likely to have a high mutually exclusivity score as opposed to subunits associated with common subunits that homomultimerize. This suggests pairs associated with common subunits that are non-homomultimers are more likely mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). For these protein pairs, we thus provide multiple lines of evidence to support their function as mutually exclusive complex subunits: shared hu.MAP3.0 complex membership, overlapping structural models, and divergent expression in cancer lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). Furthermore, for pairs that are covered by the cancer cell lineage dataset, it may be possible to link context-specific versions of protein complexes to different cancer lineages. For example, the PMSB8 subunit of the immunoproteasome is more abundant in blood lineages than PSMB5, the canonical proteasome subunit it replaces in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>). Similarly, we identified SEPTIN6 and SEPTIN10 as mutually exclusive interactors of SEPTIN5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). It has been previously noted that Septins are distributed differently across cell types, which could suggest expression as a potential regulator of these mutually exclusive interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observe that SEPTIN6 is expressed in blood lineages, but is not detectable in lineages where SEPTIN10 is detected, such as gastric and esophageal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>). Importantly we demonstrate how the ALL-IN score can capture both protein pairs that anti-correlate in their expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>), but also those that are not expressed in specific lineages highlighting their mutual exclusivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">Here we describe our integration of &gt;25,000 proteomic experiments to build a more complete and accurate set of protein complexes.

Second, we evaluate our protein complexes with respect to the protein co-expression network, ProteomeHD.2. Protein co-expression networks demonstrate considerable power in the identification of protein functional modules. Since protein co-expression networks are compiled from separate datasets than datasets used in our construction of a human protein complex map, interactions that agree between the two networks are considered very confident as there are multiple independent lines of evidence for their existence. Third, we developed a workflow to identify mutually exclusive pairs of proteins that likely do not co-exist in a complex based on structural modeling. This set of protein pairs point to potential complexes with multiple functions. As structural models of protein interactions become more widespread, we anticipate to find many more mutually exclusive pairs in protein complexes. Finally, we develop the ALL-IN score which is a prediction score of mutual exclusivity for protein pairs based on protein interactions and expression data. This is a general approach that can be applied to new interaction networks and expression datasets as they become available.</p><p id="P39">Mutually exclusive interactions introduce a conflict for organisms to resolve as two proteins are in competition for a single interface.

Other possible mechanisms for organisms to relieve this conflict include altering the subcellular localizations of mutually exclusive pairs and regulating protein subunits at the level of post translational modifications (PTMs). We see limited evidence for mutually exclusive pairs having altered their subcellular localization compared to structurally consistent pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S6C</xref>).

Post translational modification of individual mutually exclusive subunits is another potential mechanism to activate or deactivate a protein subunit’s membership in a complex. Many interactions are known to be modulated by PTMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>. Although we don’t expect PTMs to play as large of a role as expression, we do anticipate exploring this mechanism further in the future.</p><p id="P40">Another possibility to relieve the conflict of mutually exclusive pairs is protein multimerization. In this work we make the assumption that there is one to one stoichiometry between the common protein’s binding site and a mutually exclusive subunit. However, the cell may relieve the conflict by having multiple binding sites (e.g. multimerize the common protein) to accommodate the two mutually exclusive proteins. For example, proteins that form fibers such as actin can support many proteins binding to the same interface yet at different protein instances along the fiber. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, we explore the possibility of multimerization alleviating mutual exclusive conflicts. We evaluate common proteins that are found to homo-multimerize from those that do not and see those that do not homo-multimerize are more likely to have mutually exclusive binding sites. This suggests multimerization is another avenue for organisms to address the conflict of mutual exclusive interactions.</p><p id="P41">Also implicit in our definition of mutual exclusive pairs is that the pairs are required to sterically hinder each other. An alternative class of mutually exclusive pairs may include those that allosterically alter the common protein surface to restrict the binding of the other protein. Additional modeling of alternative conformations is likely required to identify this alternative class. We also make sensible cut-offs such as quality of models and number of overlapping interface residues to identify mutually exclusive pairs. We therefore anticipate as structural modeling of protein interactions becomes more accurate, we will identify additional mutually exclusive interactions.</p><p id="P42">Finally, we imported the 15,326 hu.MAP3.0 clusters into the Complex Portal and matched at the canonical level to existing manually curated entries. No thresholds were imposed in the minimum number of participants required to make the match. Where the protein components are an exact match to an existing manually curated complex, the entries have been merged and the hu.MAP3.0 accession number retained as a cross-reference in the entry, with the qualifier ‘identity’. Where the hu.MAP complex is a subset of an existing manually curated entry, or entries, again these have been merged and the hu.MAP3.0 cross-reference added, with the qualifier ‘subset’. The remaining complexes were created as novel assemblies into the Complex Portal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and have been publicly released for search and download. The complexes will be priority targets for manual curation based on literature curation and comparison to small-scale interaction datasets in the IMEx Consortium dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup>, and to other curated datasets in resources such as PDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref></sup>, EMDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup> and Reactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>. The use of LLMs to enable rapid curation of these assemblies based on the presence of sets of gene names in a publication is also being evaluated. Overall, we anticipate this to be an extremely valuable tool for the broad research community.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Reagent and Tools table</title><table-wrap id="T3" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle">Reagent/Resource</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Reference or Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MCL Version: 14-137</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://micans.org/mcl/106">https://micans.org/mcl/106</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ClusterOne Version: 1.0</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paccanarolab.org/clusterone/">https://paccanarolab.org/clusterone/</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ProteinComplexMaps Version: bdea06b</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KDrewLab/protein_complex_maps">https://github.com/KDrewLab/protein_complex_maps</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">AutoGluon Version 0.4.0</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/install.html">https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/install.html</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Training of hu.MAP 3.0 with AutoGluon</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KDrewLab/huMAP3.0_analysis">https://github.com/KDrewLab/huMAP3.0_analysis</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EvalMutualExclusivity</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KDrewLab/huMAP3.0_analysis">https://github.com/KDrewLab/huMAP3.0_analysis</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">~10,000 AlphaFold2 structures for mutually exclusive dimer modeling</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.bioinfo.se/huintaf2/humap.zip">https://archive.bioinfo.se/huintaf2/humap.zip</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref></sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Curation of mass spectrometry datasets</title><p id="P43">To build the hu.MAP 3.0 network, we integrated data from more than 25,000 previously published mass spectrometry experiments.

Additionally, complexes greater than 30 subunits were removed to prevent large protein complexes from dominating the test and training sets. Within the test and train sets, pairs of proteins were generated and labeled as positive and negative. Positive pairs are proteins within the same complex; negative pairs are proteins in separate complexes.

Due to expected error in AlphaFold2 models, we considered pairs with &lt;10 and &gt; 0 overlapping interface residues inconclusive. We tracked residue overlap between unique protein chains, regardless of their presence at defined interfaces, to further filter the structurally consistent pairs.

To evaluate the expression similarity across tissues, we used RNA-seq data from Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/rna_tissue_consensus.tsv.zip">https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/rna_tissue_consensus.tsv.zip</ext-link>) and calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient of normalized RNA expression (nTPM) across tissues. We also analyzed tissue specificity scores (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/assays+annotation#classification_rna">https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/assays+annotation#classification_rna</ext-link>) from the Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> and compared the number of pairs across categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S6B</xref>). Lastly, we compared subcellular localization using Jaccard similarity coefficients (0 = no similarity, 1 = identical) between the unique proteins, based on data from the Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/proteinatlas.tsv.zip">https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/proteinatlas.tsv.zip</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S6C</xref>). All of these metrics are annotated within the table of identified mutually exclusive pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Cancer lineage-related protein expression analysis</title><p id="P67">Cancer lineage-specific protein expression data were extracted from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 2</xref> (Protein matrix) of Gonçalves et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>. Log-scale protein intensities were z-scored for downstream analysis, thereby reflecting protein expression changes relative to their mean abundance across all cell lines. We refer to these z-scores as relative protein abundances. These data were used to create the ALL-IN (Average celL Lineage co-expressIoN) score, designed to reflect the likelihood of a protein pair to be mutually exclusive subunits of a protein complex. To create the ALL-IN score we first calculated four separate sub-scores for all protein pairs annotated as part of the same hu.MAP3.0 complex: <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P68">Correlation of protein abundance changes across the 949 cell lines, determined using robust correlation (bicor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref></sup>. Unlike the machine-learning based similarity metrics used for ProteomeHD, correlation metrics can detect anti-correlation (negative correlation), which is expected for mutually exclusive subunits.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P69">Robust correlation of protein abundance changes after averaging protein intensities by cell lineage. By averaging values across lineages, a potential bias in subscore 1 stemming from different lineages having different numbers of cell lines, is removed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P70">A sub-score reflecting very large expression differences. Sub-scores 1 and 2 fail to detect very large expression differences, because it is not possible to obtain correlations for samples where a protein was below the detection threshold. To overcome this, we first subset the dataset to include proteins that were detected in at least 50 cell lines. The vast majority of proteins in the resulting dataset had z-scores between -2 and 2. We then impute missing values by random sampling from a normal distribution centered around -4 with a standard deviation of 0.3. Next, for each protein, we consider the 50 cell lines with the highest and lowest expression levels (including imputed values), respectively. For each protein pair, we then calculate the difference between the average expression level (z-score) of protein A in the top 50 and the bottom 50 cell lines of protein B, and vice versa. We combine the values for protein A and B by averaging. The resulting sub-score reflects the degree of differential protein expression between A and B. Unlike sub-scores 1 and 2 this takes into account missing (imputed) values, i.e. cell lines where one of the two proteins was not detectable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P71">For each subunit, we calculate the average robust correlation to all other subunits of a complex, separately for each lineage. This results in a correlation coefficient indicating how well each protein correlates with the rest of the complex in each lineage. For each protein pair we then correlate these lineage-specific correlations. The rationale of this sub-score is that, for mutually exclusive subunits expressed in a lineage-specific manner, the dominant subunit in a lineage should correlate well with the rest of the complex in that lineage. By identifying pairs which differ in their lineage-specific correlation with the main complex we can pinpoint possible mutually exclusive pairs.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P72">To combine these four sub-scores into the ALL-IN score for mutually exclusivity, each sub-score was z-scored and the sub-scores averaged. Only protein pairs with at least two out of the four possible sub-scores were included. To address how mutual exclusivity might be influenced by the presence of target subunits existing in multimeric states—such as homodimerization of common protein subunits providing multiple equivalent binding sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A,B</xref>) —we annotated whether the common protein is known to homomultimerize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">116</xref></sup> and compare the ALL-IN scores across these groups. Non-homodimeric mutually exclusive protein pairs and their subunit ALL-IN scores can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S8</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Overexpression testing of hu.MAP.3 complexes in cancer lineages</title><p id="P73">Proteins belonging to confidence 1 hu.MAP.3 complexes with more than 3 subunits in the cancer lineage dataset, and with less than 80% missing values, were z-scored as indicated in the previous paragraph.

identifies human protein complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of the hu.MAP3.0 workflow which integrates ~25k mass spectrometry experiments to identify protein complexes. A feature matrix for machine learning classification of protein pairs was constructed using four classes of experimental datatypes (i.e. Cofractionation Mass Spectrometry (CF-MS), Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS), Weighted Matrix Model applied to RNA Pulldown Mass Spectrometry experiments, and Proximity Labeling Mass Spectrometry experiments. A reanalysis of AP-MS and proximity labeling data was performed using a Weighted Matrix Model. The feature matrix was labeled using known Complex Portal interactions and a classifier was trained using the AutoGluon model selection pipeline. A protein interaction network was built by applying the model to ~26 million pairs of proteins that provided a confidence score of co-complex interaction. The protein interaction network was clustered producing complexes of “Extremely High” confidence to “Medium” confidence. Complexes were then analyzed to annotate uncharacterized proteins and identify mutually exclusive proteins.
