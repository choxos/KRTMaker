Lasy-Seq, a type of 3’ RNA-seq, is efficient for obtaining homoeolog-distinguished transcriptomes and can thus overcome this measurement difficulty. This study obtained transcriptome data from the seedlings, second leaves, and root tips of 25 lines from mainly eastern transmitted area using Lasy-Seq. Roots and seedlings exhibited similar transcriptome profiles; however, they were different from those of the leaves. We determined the effects of subgenomes, lines and their interactions with leaves, roots, and seedlings on the expression levels of each homoeolog triad. Of the 19,805 homoeolog triads, 50.9–55.4%, 24.2–29.5%, and 7.7–9.0% showed significant effects on their expression levels from subgenome, line, and interaction, respectively. 51–55% and 24–30% have genetic variation in the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulation. Hierarchical clustering and co-<italic>trans</italic> regulation network analysis of homoeolog triads revealed that the patterns of expression polymorphisms among the lines were shared in different genes. The triads in which the statistical model detected as line effects imply that expression variation between lines is caused by changes in a smaller number of common <italic>trans</italic>-factors. We assigned gene ontology (GO) terms of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> orthologs to wheat homoeolog triads via reciprocal BLAST between common wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, thus improving the percentage of gene-assigned GO terms to all analyzed GO terms from 19.1% to 90.6%. GO term enrichment analysis revealed that GO terms related to each tissue type function were enriched in genes expressed in the leaves and roots. Our information provides fundamental knowledge for the future breeding of plants possessing complex gene regulatory networks such as common wheat.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>common wheat</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Lasy-Seq</kwd><kwd>allohexaploid</kwd><kwd><italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>-regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is widely cultivated and is the major cereal that accounts for approximately 20% of calories consumed worldwide. Unlike other major crops such as rice (diploid with a genome size of approximately 400 Mb), wheat possesses a large genome size (17 Gb) and is allohexaploid (2<italic>n</italic> = 6<italic>x</italic> = 42, AABBDD) and derived from interspecific hybridization. The three gene copies that originated from the parental species are highly similar and are termed homoeologs. Despite the relatively complex genome of wheat, the complete genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">IWGSC 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2018</xref>) and transcriptome references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhu et al. 2021</xref>) have been developed. Using this information, understanding the regulation of gene expression is essential for efficient wheat breeding. A major difference compared to diploid crops is that common wheat possesses a complex gene expression network due to the three subgenomes of allohexaploid species derived from hybridization and genome duplication.</p><p id="P3">Allopolyploidization results in the combination of different genomes, and thus, expression patterns can be inherited and combined to confer broad environmental tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Stebbins 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Shimizu 2022</xref>). Furthermore, this can lead to new interactions between genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hu and Wendel 2019</xref>) and changes in gene expression that have not yet been observed in the parental species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yoo et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Quan et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis and expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS), in which gene expression levels are used as phenotypes, are useful tools for searching for loci that correlate with variations in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gan et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zan et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang et al. 2021</xref>). <italic>Cis-</italic>eQTLs are loci on the same chromosomes as that of the expressed gene and are also located near the expressed gene (often assumed to be within 1 Mb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zan et al. 2016</xref>). In contrast, <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs are loci on different chromosomes from those carrying the expressed genes. Allohexaploid plants such as wheat can be used to distinguish <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs without forward genetic mapping of the gene expression levels. Gene expression bias (homoeolog expression bias) among the subgenomes was most likely caused by <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs that are unique to the subgenome. When there are differences in the average expression levels of all genomes compared to that of multiple lines, <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are likely responsible. Hence, wheat is a powerful tool for detecting homoeolog-specific expression and gene expression regulation due to <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Shi et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yoo et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Paape et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Genome-wide measurement of gene expression-level polymorphisms in wheat is difficult due to similarities among homoeolog sequences.

Root samples exhibited more reads mapped to rRNAs. Possibly, this is due to soil-derived contaminants that reduce stringency during the reverse transcription of root samples.</p><p id="P22">Of the 19,805 homoeolog triads (19,805 triads × 3 subgenomes = 59,415 genes), 32,021 genes were expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). PCA summarizing the gene expression profiles of the three tissue types was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the results indicated that the PC1 and PC2 explained 27.7% and 10.0% of the variation, respectively. The gene expression profiles were grouped into three clusters corresponding to the tissue type, with the seedling profile being closer to the root profile. This was also supported by Pearson’s correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The geometric mean of the total read counts significantly affected the transcriptome correlation in the all tissue types by MRQAP tests (permutation <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0, 2.7×10<sup>-3</sup> and 7.4×10<sup>-3</sup> in leaves, roots and seedlings, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Genetic distance also significantly affected the leaf and seedling correlation (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0178, 0.103 and 0.0343 in leaves, roots and seedlings, respectively).</p><p id="P23">In Chinese Spring, 2,262 DETs (differentially expressed homoeolog triads) between leaves and roots were shared with those between leaves and seedlings. GO enrichment analysis of the 2,262 DETs revealed that 140 GO terms, including plastid- and photosynthesis-related terms, were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Similar results were obtained when 25 lines were pooled for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Analysis using subgenomes and lines as explanatory variables for DETs reveals cis- and trans-regulation</title><p id="P24">We analyzed the effects of the subgenomes and lines on gene expression. The gene expression level of a sample can be explained by the subgenome, the line to which the gene belongs, and their interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-element is expected to affect gene expression near the gene, but it does not affect gene expression in different subgenomes. Thus, DETs among subgenomes were expected to include the effects of factors that affect only certain subgenomes, primarily <italic>cis</italic>-elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>trans</italic>-factors would not necessarily be located near the affected gene but would spread throughout the nucleus and affect gene expression in all subgenomes. Thus, DETs among lines are expected to primarily include the effects of <italic>trans</italic>-factors, as it is unlikely that a particular line possesses <italic>cis</italic>-mutations in all subgenomes. These effects occurred simultaneously. Differences in gene expression between subgenomes were shared across lines but the average gene expression levels differed among lines. In such cases, the statistical model detected both significant effects and no interaction terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). If an interaction is detected, various gene-regulatory mechanisms are possible. For example, when a <italic>cis</italic>-element is present in particular subgenomes of particular lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>) and when a <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-factor interact, this is indicative of gene-regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Here, we present two examples that include <italic>LHCB2.2</italic> and <italic>GIGANTEA</italic> (<italic>GI</italic>). An example of a gene related to photosynthesis is the gene expression of <italic>LHCB2.2</italic> in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), where <italic>LHCB2.2</italic> exhibited significantly different expression in subgenomes, lines, and their interactions (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value = 5.76×10<sup>-83</sup>, 2.60×10<sup>-32</sup> and 3.82×10<sup>-3</sup>, respectively). The expression ratio of subgenome B was lower than that of subgenomes A and D in all but two lines (LPGKU2312 and LPGKU2317, (ii) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), thus suggesting that <italic>cis</italic>-elements that suppress subgenome B expression are common in many lines. When comparing LPGKU2307 and LPGKU2310, the expression ratio between these subgenomes was similar, but <italic>LHCB2.2</italic> is less expressed in LPGKU2307 than it is in LPGKU2310 ((i) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The variation of expression level is expected to occur via <italic>trans</italic>-factors in these lines.</p><p id="P26"><italic>GI</italic> is a circadian clock-controlled gene that promotes photoperiodic flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and possibly in wheat under long-day conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fowler et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Xiang et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li et al. 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The expression of <italic>GI</italic> was significantly depended on the subgenome and line terms (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value = 6.06×10<sup>-19</sup> and 1.30×10<sup>-4</sup>, respectively). This gene was highly expressed in Norin 61 ((iii) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), which is consistent with the early flowering of Norin 61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shimizu et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Based on this idea, we examined the significance of the subgenome, line, and their interaction terms in the expression of 19,805 homoeolog triads.

Conversely, in the case of tissue-specific expressed genes that are not necessarily essential for fundamental cellular processes, differences in expression levels among lines are acceptable. Consistent with these predictions, DETs between leaves and roots exhibited significantly smaller adjusted <italic>P</italic>-values for subgenome and line terms for all tissue types compared to those of the non-DETs (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 9.3 × 10<sup>-53</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).
