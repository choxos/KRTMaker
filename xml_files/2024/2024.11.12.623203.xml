Prior research has shown how attention modulation of sensory contents is flexible and temporally tuned depending on access requirements, but whether the prioritisation of motor contents follows similar flexible dynamics remains elusive. Also uncharted is the degree of co-dependence of sensory and motor modulation, which gets at the nature of both working-memory representations and internal attention functions. To address these questions, we independently tracked the prioritisation of sensory and motor working-memory contents as a function of dynamically evolving temporal expectations. The design orthogonally manipulated when an item location (left vs right side) and associated prospective action (left vs right hand) would be relevant. Contralateral modulation of posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in electroencephalography (EEG) tracked prioritisation of the item location, while contralateral modulation of central mu/beta (8-30 Hz) activity tracked response prioritisation. Proactive and dynamic alpha and mu/beta modulation confirmed the flexible and temporally structured prioritisation of sensory and motor contents alike. Intriguingly, the prioritisation of sensory and motor contents was temporally uncoupled, showing dissociable patterns of modulation. The findings reveal multiple modulatory functions of internal attention operating in tandem to prepare relevant aspects of internal representations for adaptive behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>internal attention</kwd><kwd>temporal expectation</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>neural oscillations</kwd><kwd>alpha</kwd><kwd>beta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Internal selective attention selects and prioritises working-memory contents according to goals, expectations, and other control-related cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nobre, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nobre &amp; van Ede, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Oberauer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Oberauer &amp; Hein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van Ede &amp; Nobre, 2023</xref>). Far from changing randomly, our environment is structured across space, time, and other attributes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nobre &amp; van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>). Internal attention can use the expectations emerging from these regularities to prioritise working-memory contents and, thereby, proactively guide ongoing behaviour.</p><p id="P3">Numerous studies have found that expectations about the sensory qualities of objects (i.e., location, colour, and other stimulus features) can proactively guide internal attention to the relevant working-memory contents thus facilitating subsequent task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Griffin &amp; Nobre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Landman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Oberauer &amp; Hein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Serences et al., 2009</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van Ede &amp; Nobre, 2023</xref>). A growing literature has also highlighted the pragmatic nature of internal attention, demonstrating that it can proactively prioritise action-related contents in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Formica et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">González-García et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Henderson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kikumoto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nasrawi &amp; Van Ede, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rösner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019a). Sensory and action-related contents can co-exist in working memory. When a working-memory item is probed, selection of its sensory- and motor-associated contents starts concurrently (van Ede et al., 2019a). Beyond this initial demonstration, the dynamics of the prioritisation of sensory and motor contents that co-exist in working memory remain elusive.</p><p id="P4">Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a powerful method for independently tracking the prioritisation of sensory- and action-related contents in working memory. The selection of action plans in working memory is mirrored by a relative reduction in mu/beta (8-30 Hz) activity contralateral to the prospective action hand at central electrodes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pfurtscheller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019a). In turn, the selection of visual representations held within the spatial layout of working memory is mirrored by a relative reduction in contralateral alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) activity in posterior electrodes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Myers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Poch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P5">It is increasingly clear that the prioritisation of sensory contents in working memory is highly flexible and dynamic. For example, selecting a sensory item in working memory does not necessarily compromise the representation of other competing items, illustrating the flexible and reversible nature of working-memory content prioritisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Christophel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Vries et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">LaRocque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lepsien &amp; Nobre, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Muhle-Karbe et al., 2021</xref>; Myers et al., 2018a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rerko &amp; Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">van Ede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Van Moorselaar et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the prioritisation of sensory contents, as measured with EEG activity modulations or pupil size, changes according to temporal expectations concerning the likely time of an item to be probed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">De Vries et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">van Loon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, it remains unknown whether the prioritisation of action-related working-memory contents can be similarly reversible and tuned to the temporal structure of the task. Additionally, while sensory- and action-related working-memory contents can be prioritised concurrently (van Ede et al., 2019a), it is unclear whether these two aspects of the representation are functionally bound. Are they two sides of the same integrated internal representation and, therefore, does their prioritisation co-evolve in lockstep according to the dynamic structure of the task? Or are sensory and motor contents in working memory dissociable and capable of separate modulation?</p><p id="P6">To address these questions, we designed a task that zoomed into how temporal expectations guide the dynamic prioritisation of sensory- and action-related contents in working memory. Item location (left vs right side) was orthogonally crossed with required action (left vs right hand). The design thereby enabled tracking the prioritisation of sensory contents (location) and prospective actions independently (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019a). Contralateral-vs-ipsilateral posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) and central mu/beta (8-30 Hz) modulations provided markers of the prioritisation of sensory- and action-related contents in working memory, respectively. To foreshadow the results, the prioritisation of both sensory- and action-related working-memory contents evolved flexibly as a function of dynamically changing expectations. However, their prioritisation was not continuously temporally coupled, suggesting that multiple modulatory functions can operate in tandem – and develop independently – on different aspects of working-memory representations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P7">This study was approved by the Central University Research Ethics Committee of the University of Oxford (R57489/RE006). The sample size of the present study was based on previous studies investigating related questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019a). Thirty-one volunteers participated in two experimental sessions, which took place on different days. All participants self-reported having normal or corrected eyesight.

Participants were shown two coloured, tilted bars and were asked to report the tilt of one of the bars at the end of each trial. Retro-cues that matched or did not match the colour of one of the encoded bars were informative or noninformative regarding the item participants had to report at the end of the trial, respectively. Participants reported the orientation of one of the encoded bars at the end of each trial. Importantly, bar orientation (left vs right) was linked to the response hand (left vs right). Additionally, the location of the bars on the screen (left vs right) and the direction of their orientation (left vs right) were manipulated orthogonally. Therefore, the prioritisation of bar locations and prospective hand actions could be tracked independently using their respective EEG markers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; van Ede et al., 2019b).</p><p id="P10">The experimental script was generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox version 3.0.18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Brainard, 1997</xref>) on Matlab 2022a (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, NA, USA). Participants sat in a dimly lit room, ∼60 cm away from a monitor (Dell U2312HM; 1920×1080 pixels resolution; 100-Hz refresh rate).</p><p id="P11">The display background was grey (#7F7F7F) for the duration of the task. At the beginning of each trial, participants saw the encoding display made of a white central fixation cross (#FFFFFF; 14 pixels) and two coloured, tilted bars shown for 250 ms. One bar was always on the left and the other on the right side of the screen. Each bar was centred 192 pixels (5.2 DVA) away from the central fixation cross, had a length of 192 pixels and a width of 38 pixels. One bar was always tilted leftward and the other rightward. Bar tilts were drawn from one of three possible bins with a uniform distribution of orientations (+/-10-33°, +/-34-57°, and +/-58-80°). To avoid cardinal effects, none of the displayed bars had orientations along the vertical or horizontal meridians. Orientation bins were counterbalanced so that all bins were equiprobably sampled for each participant. Bar location and tilt were orthogonally manipulated, such that leftward- and rightward-tilted bars were equally likely to appear on the left or right side of the screen across trials. The two bars on the encoding display had two different colours out of four possible, highly distinguishable colours: light blue (#00DEFF), orange (#FFAC00), pink (#FF62FF), and green (#00ED82). Colours were counterbalanced across trials such that all possible combinations of colour, location, and tilt were displayed.</p><p id="P12">Following the encoding display, the coloured bars disappeared, and the central fixation cross remained on the screen for 750 ms (first delay; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Subsequently, the colour of the central fixation cross changed for 200 ms (retro-cue). In half of the trials (<italic>informative;</italic> 50%), the colour of the retro-cue matched the colour of one of the two bars displayed previously. In the other half of the trials (<italic>noninformative;</italic> 50%), the fixation cross changed to a different colour that matched neither encoded item on that trial. The cue colour was chosen from the four possible colours detailed above. Cue colour was counterbalanced such that all colours acted as cues in the same number of trials across each block of the task and appeared equiprobably in informative and noninformative trials.</p><p id="P13">In half of the informative and half of the noninformative trials, the response probe appeared 1 s after cue offset (<italic>short</italic> trials; 50%). In the other half of the trials, the response probe appeared 3 s after cue offset (<italic>long</italic> trials; 50%). During the post-cue delay (short and long), only a white, central fixation cross remained on the screen.</p><p id="P14">Crucially, in informative trials, the combination of two pieces of information predicted which of the two bars would be probed at the end of the trial with 100% validity: 1) the colour of the retro-cue and 2) the duration of the delay between the cue and the probe. When the cue was informative (matching the colour of one of the two bars displayed at encoding) and the delay following the cue was short (1 s), participants were prompted to report the orientation of the cued bar at the end of the trial (100% validity). Alternatively, in informative trials with a long delay (3 s), participants were always required to report the orientation of the other (uncued) bar (100% validity). Therefore, participants were encouraged to attend to the retro-cue and to track the duration of the subsequent delay to know which of the two bars they would be asked to report. In informative trials, they could anticipate reporting the item with the cued colour after the short interval. Once the short interval passed, they could shift the focus of attention to the item with the other colour. In noninformative trials, which of the two bars would be probed was unpredictable to participants.</p><p id="P15">Following the delay, the colour of the central fixation cross changed again (probe) prompting participants to reproduce the tilt of the colour-matching bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). To this end, participants used the “F” and “J” keys on the keyboard with their left and right index fingers respectively. Upon response initiation, a grey bar appeared centrally in the vertical position. Pressing the “F” key led to a counterclockwise rotation of the grey bar and pressing the “J” key made it move clockwise. Participants were instructed to release the key when the grey bar reached the desired orientation. The size of the grey bar was the same as that of the coloured bars on the encoding display. The grey bar did not rotate further than 90° in either direction. Therefore, leftward tilted bars could only be reported with the left hand and rightward tilted bars with the right hand. The response key could not be changed once a response was initiated. Participants were instructed to report the orientation as quickly and accurately as possible. They had a maximum of 3 s to respond from probe onset.</p><p id="P16">If participants responded with the correct key (F for leftward-tilted bars and J for rightward-tilted bars), they received visual feedback about the percentage accuracy of their response. If they pressed the incorrect key, they received the message “Wrong target!”. If they did not respond, they saw “Too slow!”. All feedback appeared centrally in white letters and was displayed for 500 ms. Inter-trial intervals (ITIs) followed a beta distribution with a minimum of 3 s, maximum of 10 s, and average of 5.5 s. During each ITI, a white fixation cross was displayed centrally.</p><p id="P17">The present study was divided into two separate sessions in which participants repeated the same task procedure on different days. The two visits allowed participants to become familiar with the task instructions and procedures. The first visit consisted of a behavioural session in which participants completed eight blocks of 32 trials each for ∼1 h. The second visit consisted of an EEG and eye-tracking session in which participants completed 15 blocks with 32 trials each for ∼2.5 h. In the EEG session, participants could rest for 10-15 minutes after every 5 blocks. Before beginning the first session of the experiment, participants were walked through the task instructions and asked to practice the procedure for at least one block.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Behavioural data analysis</title><p id="P18">Behavioural data were analysed using the R statistical programming language (version 4.2.1; R Core Team, 2021) and R studio (version RStudio 2022.07.1; RStudio Team, 2022). Report errors were calculated as the absolute difference between the reported orientation and the orientation of the probed bar. RT was defined as the time from probe onset until response initiation. Trials without a response, trials with RTs faster than 100 ms, trials with RTs slower than three times the SD of the average RT per participant, and trials with report errors higher than three times the SD of the participant-averaged error were excluded from further behavioural analyses. This resulted in an average removal of 2.38% (SD: 0.72%) of trials in the behavioural session and 2.82% (SD: 0.6%) in the EEG session. The average RT and report error per participant and per condition were calculated for each session. Given the equivalent behavioural pattern across sessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>), RT and report errors from both sessions were collapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Additionally, we calculated the average response density as a function of the reported tilt and the tilt of the probed item (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The statistical significance of the dependent variables of interest across participants (report error and RT) was tested using 2 x 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with informativeness (informative and noninformative) and duration (short and long) as factors.

Sixty-four channels were distributed across the scalp following the international 10-10 positioning system. Data were referenced online to a reference channel positioned between Cz and CPz. Another channel (AFz) was used as the ground. Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) were simultaneously recorded using a bipolar system integrated into the cap. Horizontal EOG electrodes were placed on the side of each eye and vertical EOG was positioned above and below the left eye. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was measured with an integrated, bipolar set-up. The upper ECG was placed on the left ribcage, centred above the left chest; the lower ECG was placed on the side of the left ribcage. During set-up, electrode impedance was lowered to below 5 kiloohms where possible and was at least below 10 kiloohms. Data were digitised at 1,000 Hz and filtered at 500 Hz during acquisition.</p><p id="P21">All EEG data were processed and analysed in Python 3.11.9 using MNE-Python (version 1.5.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gramfort, 2013</xref>) and custom-made scripts. First, data were notch-filtered at 50 Hz, and high-pass (0.05 Hz) and low-pass (40 Hz) filtered with a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. Subsequently, the continuous data were visually inspected. Channels deemed “bad” were interpolated using spline interpolation as implemented with the <italic>interpolate_bads</italic> function in MNE-Python. Then, data were downsampled to 250 Hz and re-referenced to the sensor average. An independent component analysis (ICA) identified artifacts related to eye movements and heart-related activity by correlating individual ICs with the EOG and ECG signals. Based on the correlation values and visual inspection of the IC time courses and topographies, ICs capturing eye- and heart-related activity were identified and subtracted from the EEG data. An average of 2.87 ICs (SD: 0.8; range: 1-5) were removed per participant.</p><p id="P22">Subsequently, the raw EEG data were epoched around cue onset and probe appearance (−0.25 s to 1.25 s in short trials and −0.25 s to 3.25 s in long trials), and activity during the baseline period (−0.25 to 0 s) was subtracted from each epoch. A surface Laplacian transform was applied to the epoched data using the <italic>compute_current_source_density</italic> MNE-Python function to reduce the effects of volume conduction and thus increase the spatial resolution and interpretability of the results (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">van Ede, et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Trials included in the EEG analysis were limited to those in which participants had pressed the correct key and RT was higher than 100 ms.

In total, 89.67% (SD: 5.34%) of trials were used in subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>EEG: time-frequency analyses</title><p id="P24">All EEG analyses focused on the period of interest from retro-cue onset until probe onset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). The retro-cue in informative trials was hypothesised to prompt participants to direct attention to the cued sensory (location) and action-related (response hand) contents in working memory. Importantly, it was hypothesised that in long trials, participants would “shift” to prioritising the other stimulus location and response hand after the short interval lapsed. Crucially, given the orthogonal manipulation of bar location and tilt, prioritisation of locations and action plans could be tracked independently with EEG (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>). Specifically, it was hypothesised that EEG alpha-frequency activity (8-12 Hz) at occipital electrodes contralateral to the location of the prioritised item would be modulated. In parallel, it was predicted that EEG mu/beta activity (8-30 Hz) at central electrodes contralateral to the prioritised response hand would be modulated. Alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz) at left (PO7) and right (PO8) visual sensors was used to track sensory-related prioritisation. Mu/beta activity (8-30 Hz) in left (C3) and right (C4) motor electrodes was used to track action-related prioritisation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>).

The 50 ms around the two edges of each epoch were subsequently cropped to remove any edge artefacts related to the time-frequency decomposition. Time-frequency activity in lateralised visual (PO7/PO8) and motor (C3/C4) channels was contrasted between trials in which either the stimulus location or the prospective action hand (related to the tilt), respectively, was contralateral vs ipsilateral to each channel. This was calculated and normalised as follows: [((contra – ipsi) / (contra + ipsi)) * 100], separately for left and right sensors per participant.

To enhance comparability between the signals, the alpha and mu/beta time courses were scaled to range between −1 and 1, respectively. For each participant, the minimum point of alpha and mu/beta attenuation was identified within a pre-defined time window (0.1 to 1 s from cue onset), and the maximum point of alpha and mu/beta was identified in a later window (1 to 2.5 s from cue onset).

Additionally, mu/beta activity contralateral to the prospective action hand was predicted to change together with prospective action selection. We utilised noninformative trials – in which participants could not reliably select sensory or response-related information before the probe – as a baseline for the selection signals in informative trials. Specifically, participant-wise cluster-based permutation analyses of the time-frequency spectra in the contralateral-versus-ipsilateral contrasts of visual and motor selection in informative vs noninformative trials confirmed our hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P40">A pronounced modulation in alpha activity contralateral vs ipsilateral to the selected item location was observed following the retro-cue in informative trials during the early part of the post-cue period, which contained both short and long trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>; first cluster: ***p &lt; .001, time range: 0.27-0.8 s, frequency range: 5-25 Hz, max lateralisation time: 0.54 s, max lateralisation frequency: 11 Hz).

This “shift” in relative alpha attenuation from one hemisphere to the other, pointed to a sequential prioritisation of each working-memory item location in turn. Initially, the cued item that was expected to be probed early was prioritised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>; first cluster: ***p &lt; .001, time range: 0.31-0.81 s).

Strikingly, the time courses of stimulus location and prospective action hand prioritisation subsequently diverged into distinct trajectories. Specifically, the prioritisation of location information was relatively short-lived in both early and late selection phases. Conversely, the prioritisation of the first and then second prospective hand actions was longer-lasting. These differences suggest that, even when sensory and action-related contents co-exist in working memory, their prioritisation can develop independently.</p><p id="P45">Thus, we investigated whether alpha and mu/beta activity modulations evolved in lockstep across the post-cue delay.

Across two sessions, response times were faster when responding to targets at their expected times. Importantly, the speed of responses to previously un-prioritised items was comparable to first-prioritised item responses, highlighting the flexibility and reversibility of internal attention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Vries et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">LaRocque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lepsien &amp; Nobre, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Murray et al., 2013</xref>; Myers et al., 2018b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rerko &amp; Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Van Moorselaar et al., 2015</xref>). Perhaps due to participant over-training, accuracy was exceptionally high in this task and insensitive to attentional selection. Mirroring the behavioural results, the alpha and mu/beta modulation time courses uncovered that the prioritisation of both sensory- and action-related contents in working memory was flexible (i.e., it “shifted” from prioritising the first to the second location/action) and temporally tuned (i.e., both instances of selection of the relevant item/action were temporally specific).</p><p id="P51">The pattern of sensory (alpha) modulation in the present study replicates previous findings that the prioritisation of sensory contents in working memory is flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Vries et al., 2017</xref>, 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">LaRocque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Murray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Myers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rerko &amp; Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Van Moorselaar et al., 2015</xref>) and temporally tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, the short-lived modulation of alpha activity in the first and second selection events points to a transient prioritisation of item locations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Vries et al., 2017</xref>, 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gresch, et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2016</xref>). This has been suggested to reflect that spatial orienting helps activate working-memory contents into a prioritised state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Myers et al., 2017</xref>). In line with what has been previously reported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kuo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sligte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</xref>), spatial selection in this task occurred even when the spatial arrangement of working-memory items was task-irrelevant. In contrast to other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>), here, alpha-frequency activity during the memory delay was not systematically correlated with behaviour. We speculate that this could be related to the absence of a behavioural effect of selection on report error and the smaller magnitude of alpha modulation compared to mu/beta in this study.</p><p id="P52">To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to reveal the flexible, reversible, dynamic, and temporally tuned nature of proactive action-related prioritisation in working memory. Specifically, action-related contents that were deprioritised in the first instance could be re-prioritised later as indexed by a strong mu/beta modulation and behavioural benefits in long trials. Mu/beta modulation persisted well into the second part of the delay, after the time of early probe appearance had passed. This accords with the requirement to respond using the selected effector (left or right hand) at the end of the first or second selection period.</p><p id="P53">Importantly, the extent of mu/beta modulation in the second memory delay correlated with enhanced task performance. Mu/beta modulation was enhanced in faster trials as opposed to slower ones (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boettcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the RT effects in this task may be reflective of differences in motor preparation. Interestingly, despite the insensitivity of report error to cue informativeness, mu/beta-frequency activity during the second part of the memory delay was stronger in precise than imprecise trials, highlighting the importance of motor states in the internal attention process. Together, these findings point to a key role for mu/beta activity in flexibly prioritising motor contents in working memory and highlight its value as a functionally relevant marker of internal attention.</p><p id="P54">A central finding of the current study with important theoretical consequences was the temporally dissociable modulation of sensory and action-related contents in working memory. Their flexible and dynamic prioritisation progressed in tandem but was uncoupled. In the first moments after the retro-cue, sensory and action-related prioritisation started together, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">van Ede, et al. 2019a</xref>; see also Ester &amp; Weese, 2023). However, in contrast to the transient nature of alpha modulation in this task, mu/beta activity showed a longer-lasting motor modulation. The present findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that working-memory contents may undergo a change from a sensory to a motor code as the requirement to respond takes precedence in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">González-García et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Henderson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kikumoto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P55">Crucially, as expectations about the to-be-probed memory representation reversed, the sensory and action-related modulation signals evolved independently. The modulation of sensory and motor systems by internal attention, as measured with alpha and mu/beta activity modulations, did not co-evolve in lockstep. Even though they both showed a clear reversal with time, this reversal developed distinctly for both markers and its exact timing was uncorrelated. Together, these findings suggest that sensory and action-related dimensions of working-memory representations need not be intrinsically bound but instead can be dissociable and susceptible to separate modulatory processes. In turn, this highlights the multiplicity of modulatory processes that can operate on working-memory representations contemporaneously but independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nobre &amp; van Ede, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van Ede &amp; Nobre, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Here, the modulation of location-related activity was transient, while the modulation of motor activity was longer-lasting. The patterns match the changes in when and for how long location- and action-related information was relevant to this task. More generally, we speculate that different attributes of working memory objects may be differentially modulated depending on changing expectations about their relevance. Relatedly, external attention has also been shown to differentially modulate spatial-sensory and motor systems when the purpose of the task emphasises perceptual demands vs speeded responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">van Ede et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P57">In summary, the present study shows that sensory and action-related contents that co-exist in working memory are flexibly and dynamically prioritised and tuned to the moments when they are anticipated to become relevant. This points to a fine temporal organisation of internal attention according to external temporal regularities. Moreover, the prioritisation of sensory and action-related contents that co-exist in working memory was not continuously temporally coupled. This speaks to the relative independence of object dimensions in working memory and the multiplicity of flexible and dynamic modulatory processes that co-occur to prepare internal representations for adaptive behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS200129-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Lola Milton-Jenkins for her invaluable help with data collection, the members of the Brain and Cognition Lab for fruitful discussions, and all the participants who contributed their time and effort to participating in this study.

1</label><caption><title>Task design and behavioural results.</title><p>a) Trial schematic. Two coloured, tilted bars (one on the left and the other on the right, one tilted to the left and the other to the right, with location and tilt being orthogonally manipulated) were displayed at encoding. In half of the trials (informative) a retro-cue matching the colour of one of the two bars was shown; in noninformative trials (50%), a cue with a different colour appeared instead. In informative trials, if the delay after cue offset was short (1 s), participants were probed about the cued item. Alternatively, if the delay was long (3 s), they had to report the other (uncued) item. In noninformative trials, the retro-cue did not match the colour of either bar and the probed item was unpredictable. Reaction time (s) (panel b) and report error (°) (panel c) are plotted in informative and noninformative and short and long trials. Thin grey lines represent individual participants, error bars represent the SEM, light grey represents noninformative trials, and dark grey depicts informative trials. d) Average response density as a function of the reported orientation and the orientation of the reported bar.
