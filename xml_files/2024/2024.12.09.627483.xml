Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, often leading to their demise. Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds cannot sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen. Here, we describe a technological breakthrough in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols found in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated it into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies fed exclusively with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. Incorporating sterol supplements into pollen substitutes using this method will enable beekeepers to rear healthier, longer-lived colonies to meet the growing demands for global crop pollination. It could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources, stemming the decline of wild bee populations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Managed honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) are fundamental to modern agricultural systems and global food security due to the pollination services they provide to crops. Honeybees consume floral pollen, which provides protein, fats, carbohydrate, and micronutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Increasingly, a combination of changes in climate, land use, and agricultural practises leaves honeybees with limited access to sufficient and diverse floral resources2−4. Nutritional deficiencies increase susceptibility to disease and colony collapse, thereby contributing to the growing rate of honeybee colony losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Loss of pollinators, in turn, reduces crop yields and increases the costs of food production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In the past 40 years, beekeepers have adopted the practice of feeding artificial pollen substitutes where natural forage is insufficient, or bees are kept at high densities. However, commercially available pollen substitutes composed of protein flour, sugars, and oils are not nutritionally complete feeds for honeybees. They are missing essential sterols found in floral pollen which are necessary for colony health and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Sterols are a structurally diverse class of tetracyclic triterpenoids that are ubiquitously important for eukaryotic cell function, notably for membrane architecture, hormone biosynthesis and signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Unlike other animals, insects and marine invertebrates have lost the ability to synthesise endogenous sterols, acquiring them instead from diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Most insects produce cholesterol (CHOL) by dealkylating dietary sterols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, honeybees have lost the ability to dealkylate sterols and instead use dietary sterols directly as membrane inserts and as precursors for ecdysteroid hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Most of the pollen sterols used by bees are not available in quantities that could be fed to bee colonies on a commercial scale, making it impossible to create a nutritionally complete feed that is a substitute for pollen.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Honeybees acquire six key sterols from floral pollen</title><p id="P4">Sterols are consumed by nurse-aged worker honeybees from stored pollen (bee bread); these accumulate in their mandibular glands, and are transferred to worker, queen, and drone larvae via glandular secretions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Sterol diversity is high in pollen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, but only a few key sterols appear to be taken up by workers in the gut and transferred to the brood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To quantify the proportions of sterols found in honeybees, we analysed the sterol composition in pupal tissue from each caste; the delta-5 sterol, 24-methylenecholesterol (24-MC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), constituted 60-70% of the corporeal sterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Five other minor sterols were consistently present: beta-sitosterol (SITO), desmosterol (DESMO), isofucosterol (ISOFUC), campesterol (CAMP) and cholesterol (CHOL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The relative abundance of each sterol found in pupae varied among castes (two-way quasi-binomial GLM, sterol*caste, χ<sup>2</sup>(10) = 47.0, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Drone pupae had 11.8% more 24-MC than worker pupae and 2.24-fold more ISOFUC than queen pupae. Worker pupae had at least 1.5-fold more DESMO than queen or drone pupae. CAMP was almost six times more abundant in worker and queen pupae than drone pupae.</p><p id="P5">The total sterol concentration in pupal tissue varied significantly between castes and ranged from 130-260 μg/g fresh tissue (Gaussian GLM, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 91.9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Total sterol concentration in drone pupae was greater than in queen pupae and double that in worker pupae. The concentrations of individual sterols similarly varied between castes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Five of these sterols (SITO, CAMP, CHOL, ISOFUC, and 24-MC) were among the six most common sterols found in pollen (SITO, CAMP, CHOL, ISOFUC, cycloartenol and 24-MC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Using the data of Zu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we found that floral pollen varies significantly in the relative abundance of these sterols (quasi-binomial GLM, χ<sup>2</sup>(5) =61.0, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). SITO had the highest median relative abundance (40.9%), followed by ISOFUC (9.50%) and 24-MC (5.84%); CAMP, CHOL and DESMO were minor sterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

Furthermore, we used a platform strain with improved mevalonate pathway flux towards farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) for increasing sterol precursor supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The platform strain is derived from the wild-type isolate W29, express CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9) for genome editing, and overexpress four genes encoding mevalonate pathway enzymes (<italic>HMG1, ERG12, IDI1, ERG20</italic>), alongside genes involved in acetyl-CoA formation, namely ATP-citrate lyase 1 (<italic>ACL1</italic>) and acetyl-CoA synthase from <italic>Salmonella enterica (SeACS)</italic>. Almost three times more ergosterol (ERGO, 1.95 mg/g DCW) was produced by the platform strain compared to strain W29 (0.659 mg/g DCW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The endogenous ERGO pathway of yeasts can be remodelled to synthesise alternative sterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), but previous attempts to produce non-native sterols in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> have struggled to achieve high specific yield or stereoselectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the latter ERGO pathway genes are nonessential and alternative sterols can be taken up from the environment when ERGO biosynthesis is compromised, such as under anaerobic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, most <italic>non-Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts, such as <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>, lack sterol uptake transporters and do not exhibit flexible sterol auxotrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For this reason, endogenous ERGO synthesis is essential, making deletion of the latter ERGO pathway genes such as <italic>ERG4</italic> (delta-24(28) sterol reductase) challenging in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To overcome this, we employed a sterol surrogate. The previously characterised <italic>STC1</italic> gene from <italic>Tetrahymena thermophilia</italic> encodes a squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase that converts squalene to the pentacyclic triterpenoid tetrahymanol (TET, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), which can substitute for ERGO function in yeasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. TET is not expected to be detrimental to honeybees as pollen also contains diverse sterol intermediates and stanols that do not accumulate in honeybee tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>TtSTC1</italic> was introduced into the platform strain under the weak Pr<italic>GPAT</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> to drive minimal expression and limit diversion of carbon flux away from the sterol pathway. TET accounted for 14% of the sterol in the resulting TET strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). By producing TET in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>, we were able to efficiently manipulate the sterol pathway. The subsequent elimination of ERGO production in our strains may also have helped to remove negative feedback inhibition on sterol biosynthesis.</p><p id="P9">We first engineered <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> to produce the most important honeybee sterol, 24-MC. Redirecting the <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> sterol pathway from ERGO to 24-MC required us to sequentially delete the endogenous genes <italic>ERG4</italic> and <italic>ERG5</italic> (sterol C-22 desaturase) and introduce a heterologous <italic>DWF5/DHCR7</italic> gene (delta-7 sterol reductase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This strain (<italic>erg4Δerg5Δ</italic>) was used to screen heterologous <italic>DWF5/DHCR7</italic> variants identified in the genomes of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. Ten diverse variants were selected and expressed under the strong Pr<italic>TEFintron</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The strain containing <italic>Tetraselmis</italic> (green algal phytoplankton) <italic>DWF5</italic> produced the highest content of 24-MC (42.1 mg/g DCW) and accumulated less TET and ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trienol intermediate than the next highest producing strain expressing <italic>Candidatus</italic> (bacterial pathogen of amoeba) <italic>DWF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The 24-MC strain was subsequently engineered to create a ‘mixed-sterol’ strain that produced small amounts of all the other sterols we observed in honeybees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We first introduced the previously characterised delta-24(28) sterol reductase (<italic>SSR1/DWF1</italic>) from potato <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>, which reduces the 24-MC side chain to produce CAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. By using a heterologous plant variant, we could regulate the expression level with the weak promoter Pr<italic>DGA1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and obtain the C-24α/R epimer of CAMP found in plants, rather than the C-24β/S epimer as in ERGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The resulting two-sterol strain produced 24-MC (19.9 mg/g DCW) and a small amount of CAMP (0.445 mg/g DCW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We then constructed a strain further capable of producing C-24 ethyl sterols, by introducing the C-28 sterol methyl transferase (<italic>SMT</italic>) from quinoa <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic> under the control of the Pr<italic>GPAT</italic> promoter. This four-sterol strain produced ISOFUC (0.396 mg/g DCW) and SITO (0.145 mg/g DCW) in addition to 24-MC (21.6 mg/g DCW) and CAMP (2.42 mg/g DCW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To enable the production of CHOL and DESMO, the delta-24(25) sterol reductase (<italic>SSR2</italic>) from tomato <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> was expressed under the PrGPAT promoter in the four-sterol strain to generate the final mixed-sterol strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Delta-24(25) sterol reductases are typically found in animals and reduce DESMO to CHOL but are also present in Solanaceous plants as part of the glycoalkaloid synthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. When expressed in a 24-MC-producing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain, both DESMO and CHOL are produced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This was similarly observed in our final mixed-sterol strain, which produced 24-MC (24.6 mg/g DCW), CAMP (0.433 mg/g DCW), ISOFUC (1.59 mg/g DCW), SITO (trace), CHOL (0.396 mg/g DCW) and DESMO (0.898 mg/g DCW) during small scale cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The total detected sterol content decreased with each round of engineering from 60.2 mg/g DCW in the 24-MC strain to 28.0 mg/g DCW in the mixed-sterol strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). The mixed-sterol strain was selected for cultivation in bioreactors.</p><p id="P12">We investigated the sterol and biomass production by cultivating the 24-MC strain in fed-batch mode in 250-mL controlled bioreactors (Ambr® 250). The 24-MC content reached 8.72-12.0 mg/g DCW, and the biomass reached 29.0-33.0 g DCW/L after 150 h of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c, d</xref>). To produce biomass for testing in honeybee diets, we cultivated the mixed-sterol strain in fed-batch mode in 5 L bioreactors.

The diets were as follows: a ‘mixed-sterol strain diet’ (MxSt), and three control diets: a ‘TET strain diet’ (Tet), a ‘W29 strain diet’ (WT), and a ‘no yeast base diet’ (Base). Dried yeast biomass was incorporated at 20% w/w into an artificial diet formulation containing additional protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals required by honeybees. Because the mixed-sterol strain contained only trace SITO, all yeast diets were additionally supplemented with commercial phytosterol mix, containing approximately 12.0% w/w SITO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). The Base diet was supplemented with additional commercial phytosterol mix to match the total sterol concentration in the MxSt diet (0.340% w/w).</p><p id="P15">We used a semi-field method with small honeybee colonies to measure the impact of the above diets upon brood production, in the absence of incoming pollen. We conducted feeding trials over three months and monitored diet consumption, sterol composition, colony size and brood status throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">6</xref>). Every 15 days, we counted brood at the egg, larval and pupal (capped cell) stages in each colony, to assess the ability of each treatment to support brood production and development. In the first 45 days, an extreme heatwave resulted in a decline in bees of all ages across all colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Hence, we supplemented colonies with additional nurse bees on days 32 and 45. Nurse bees have endogenous sterols which can be used to feed larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

There were still 10-40 capped brood cells in all but one colony in the MxSt diet treatment group, compared to 1-3 capped brood cells in three colonies in the Base diet treatment group and none in the control yeast diet groups. These data for diets without the required sterols are similar to our observations when colonies are starved of pollen: the rate of brood production is a function of the duration of nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig 8</xref>). Eventually, in all colonies fed with diets lacking the required sterols (Base, Tet, and WT diets), the nurse bees did not have sufficient levels of key corporeal sterols necessary for brood rearing.</p><p id="P18">Although the number of pupae depended on the diet, sterol levels in the surviving pupae varied less than in the nurses and were not significantly different between treatment groups (Gaussian GLMM, diet*time, time: χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 14.9, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005; diet: χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 4.39, <italic>P</italic> = 0.222; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).

Two diets contained the sterol surrogate TET, yet this was not found in the brood. This indicates that bees have selective mechanisms for enriching larval jelly with the key sterols.

We used a mix of pre-existing colonies and newly established colonies, but all were fed pollen for at least one month prior to the start of the experiment and were producing brood.</p><p id="P48">Buckets of water and feeders with 30% w/v sugar solution were distributed inside the polytunnel. Colonies were supplied with pollen or candy patties. Pollen patties consisted of 80% multifloral pollen and 20% high-concentrated sugar syrup (~70% w/v). Candy patties consisted of ~80% beekeeping candy and ~20% maltodextrin, which was added to slow consumption and reduce melting of the patty in the hive. Following a one month feeding period, colonies in treatment groups 1, 2, and 3 were deprived of pollen for the corresponding number of weeks and fed with candy only. The control group (0) was fed pollen throughout. Treatment groups were balanced across hive entrance orientations, colony strengths (bee seams), and position within the polytunnel.</p><p id="P49">We performed a partial assessment every week to measure patty weight and hive weight and estimate bee seams. Every two weeks, a full assessment recorded the presence of the mated queen, eggs, larvae, and capped cells, and the amount of sugar and pollen stores, and every frame was photographed. The photographs were used to count the number of cells with eggs, larvae, and pupae in each hive, using ImageJ (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2089">10.1038/nmeth.2089</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P50">All graph plotting and statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.2.252. Generalised linear models (GLMs) and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted using stats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and glmmTMB5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> packages. Models with non-significant interaction terms were re-run without the interaction term. Post hoc analysis was performed using the car<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and emmeans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> packages with Tukey adjustments for family-wise error rates.</p><p id="P51">The mean relative abundance of each of the major sterols in naturally fed honeybee pupae was calculated as a percentage of the total sterol. We compared sterol relative abundance across pupal castes using a GLM with quasi-binomial distribution (relative abundance ~ sterol type*pupal caste). Sterol concentrations in pupae were calculated from the fresh weights of the pupal tissue. We compared sterol concentrations in pupal tissue across castes using GLMs with Gaussian distributions (sterol concentration ~ sterol type*pupal caste). We compared the relative abundance of sterols in pollen using a GLM with quasi-binomial distribution (relative abundance ~ sterol type). The coefficient of variation for each sterol was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean relative abundance values of each sterol.</p><p id="P52">Counts for each brood type were compared across diet treatment groups using generalised linear mixed models, fitted to counts from t45 onwards, with “hive ID” as a random effect and negative binomial distributions (brood count ~ diet*time + (1|hive ID)). For egg counts, the interaction term was dropped (egg count ~ diet +time + (1|hive ID)).</p><p id="P53">Both the total diet provided to each colony and the total diet consumption by each colony were compared across diet treatment groups by fitting GLMs with Gaussian distribution (diet weight ~ diet). Because hive weight correlated significantly with bee seams and consumption rate correlated significantly with hive weight for all treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), the daily consumption rates within each interval were normalised by hive weight, as a proxy for colony size. The normalised consumption rates were compared across diet treatment groups using a GLMM, with “hive ID” as a random effect and Gaussian distributions (normalised consumption rate ~ diet +time + (1|hive ID)).</p><p id="P54">The weight of each hive was compared across diet treatment groups using a GLMM, with “hive ID” as a random effect and Gaussian distributions (hive weight~ diet +time + (1|hive ID)). The number of bee seams in each hive and the number of frames filled with honey were doubled to give integer values and compared across diet treatment groups using GLMMs, with “hive ID” as a random effect and Poisson distributions (2*bee seams ~ diet +time + (1|hive ID); 2*sugar stores ~ diet +time + (1 |hive ID)).</p><p id="P55">For the sterol contents of nurses, nurse guts and pupae (μg per individual), GLMMs were fitted for each sample type within each sterol, with Gaussian distributions and “hive ID” as a random effect (sterol content ~ diet*time + (1|hive ID)). Interaction terms were not significant in some models (total sterol in pupae, 24-MC in pupae, CAMP in nurses and nurse guts, ISOFUC in pupae, DESMO in pupae and nurse guts) and were dropped as appropriate.</p><p id="P56">We examined the relationships between variables measured during feeding trials by fitting GLMs (response variable ~ predictor variable*diet). All models used Gaussian distributions, apart from when comparing capped brood counts to the total sterol content of nurse bodies from the same colony. In this case a negative binomial distribution was used. Where no significant interaction was found between diet treatment group and the predictor variable, the interaction term was dropped from the models (response variable ~ predictor variable + diet). For each diet treatment group, linear regressions were fitted between the predictor and response variables of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S15"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Chemical structures, names, and formulae of sterols relevant to this study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201859-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The major sterols in honeybee pupae from worker, queen, and drone bee castes and in nurse bees.</title><p id="P57"><bold>a</bold>, Mean concentration of each of the major sterols per fresh weight of pupal tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 5).
