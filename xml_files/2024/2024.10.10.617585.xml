The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits and a wing membrane called <italic>chiropatagium</italic> connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene program including the transcription factors <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic>, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programs during evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Evolution has fueled the emergence of a remarkable variety of phenotypes throughout the animal kingdom. In particular, the vertebrate limb displays many fascinating adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and has long served as a prime example to study the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). An extreme example is the evolution of forelimbs (FL) into wings in bats (order <italic>Chiroptera</italic>), the only mammals capable of self-powered flight. Interestingly, the oldest known bat fossil already presents wing-structured FLs, suggesting that flight originated in the most recent common ancestor of all bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Bat wings are thus a unique and ancient structure, representing an exceptional model for studying limb diversification. Likewise, examining the development of wings can shed light on the mechanisms underlying morphological transformations in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">During development, limb buds arise from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) under the control of three distinct signaling centers: the zone of polarizing activity, the dorsal and ventral ectoderm, and the apical ectodermal ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These centers confer cellular identity along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and proximo-distal axes, respectively. Outgrowth along the proximo-distal axis results in the formation of three distinct elements: most proximally the stylopod, followed by the zeugopod, and distally the autopod, corresponding to humerus/femur, radius-ulna/tibia-fibula and hand/foot, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The bat forelimb is characterized by elongation of all skeletal elements as well as the presence of membranes which form the wing. Changes are most pronounced in the autopod, with extremely elongated digits II-V and an interdigital wing membrane connecting them, known as chiropatagium. In contrast, in bat hindlimbs (HLs) and most other pentadactyl species including humans and mice, the tissue between the digits recedes during development resulting in separate digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Experiments across different species have shown that retinoic acid (RA)-induced apoptosis of interdigital cells plays a central role in digit separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Consequently, one hypothesis for the persistence of interdigital tissue in bats is the suppression of this apoptotic process. Several studies have addressed this hypothesis; however, the results have been inconclusive. Both, pro- and anti-apoptotic markers were found to be expressed in the developing chiropatagium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In addition, several comparative molecular studies have identified genes with altered patterns of expression in developing wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, the molecular and evolutionary bases of wing morphology development remain largely unknown, partially due to the limitations of the available methodologies at the time. Recently, single-cell approaches have provided new tools to investigate cell identity and function at unprecedented resolution in any organism, holding great potential to unravel the basis of evolutionary innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Yet, how cell fates are molecularly determined and sustain the emergence of new morphologies remains one of the big unsolved questions in biology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cellular composition and interdigital cell death are conserved between bat and mouse limbs</title><p id="P5">We collected FLs and HLs for single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) from mice and bats (<italic>C. perspicillata</italic>) covering critical developmental stages of digit separation and wing formation. Samples included an early, morphologically undifferentiated stage (embryonic day (E)11.5 in mice and equivalent to CS15 stage in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)) and a later stage in which the digits form and separate (E13.5 in mice and CS17 in bats); we also included an intermediate time point (E12.5) from mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Using the Seurat <italic>SCTransform</italic> integration tool, we generated an interspecies single-cell transcriptomics limb atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Cells from both species contributed similarly to all cell clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We identified all major cell populations known to be present in developing limbs, including muscle, ectoderm-derived and LPM-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Overall, both the composition and identity of limb cells are largely conserved between the species despite significant morphological differences.</p><p id="P6">As the LPM contributes to the formation of interdigital mesenchyme, cartilage, tendons, and other connective tissues within the limb, we specifically focused on this lineage. The LPM-derived cells were further subdivided into 18 clusters and annotated by performing differential gene expression analysis. Based on the calculated markers and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we identified three main cell lineages: chondrogenic, fibroblast and mesenchymal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The expression of top marker genes per cell cluster was also conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Using this inter-species single-cell atlas, we first sought to address the prevailing hypothesis that chiropatagium development is driven by inhibition or reduction of apoptotic cell death in the interdigital tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We identified a cluster of interdigital cells characterized by high expression levels of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Rdh10</italic>, components of RA signaling. RA is regarded as a pivotal regulator of interdigital apoptosis and its expression pattern has been extensively employed to discern the interdigital tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Cells from this cluster (3 RA-Id) also expressed main pro-apoptotic factors, including <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp7</italic>, highlighting it as a central population of apoptotic signaling in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Within this cluster, we then analyzed the expression of a larger number of genes associated with different cell death processes such as <italic>Bcl2</italic>-, <italic>Bmp</italic>- and <italic>Fgf</italic>-associated signaling and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Our data revealed no significant relative transcriptional differences in pro- or anti-apoptotic factors for the RA-Id cluster between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, genes known to be distinctively expressed in the interdigital tissue of bat wings, including the anti-apoptotic</p><p id="P8"><italic>Grem1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), also did not show a difference in relative expression, suggesting expression in a different cluster.</p><p id="P9">To further confirm the presence of apoptosis in bat FLs, we stained bat limbs with LysoTracker, a marker of lysosomal activity which correlates with cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We found pronounced staining in bat FLs at the edges of all interdigital zones, with no discernable differences to interdigits I-II in FLs or any HL interdigit, which all regress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that cell death in bat wings occurs via an apoptotic process activated by the caspase cascade, as indicated by the positive staining for cleaved Caspase-3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In summary, our analysis revealed that the cell composition between mouse and bat limbs is highly conserved. Furthermore, cell death occurs in interdigital cells in both species.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The developmental origin of the bat chiropatagium</title><p id="P10">Since cell death occurs similarly in both bat and mouse interdigital clusters, it cannot account for the persistence of interdigital tissue. To identify the cells that persist and form the chiropatagium, we independently clustered the mouse and bat datasets and compared them with the integrated results. The clusters showed a good correspondence, with a high correlation of gene expression between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the chiropatagium is not associated to the emergence of a novel cell cluster in the bat wing.</p><p id="P11">To trace down the molecular and cellular nature of the chiropatagium, we performed scRNA-seq from micro-dissected bat interdigital tissues at a later stage (CS18, equivalent to E14.5 in mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We annotated the chiropatagium LPM-derived populations by label transfer using the bat FL LPM data as reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). This revealed that the chiropatagium is primarily composed of three different populations of fibroblast cells, with transcriptional correspondence to clusters 7 FbIr, 8 FbA, and 10 FbI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Differential expression analyses against the whole FL LPM dataset showed that the chiropatagium features high expression of <italic>MEIS2, COL3A1, AKAP12</italic>, and <italic>GREM1</italic> among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Notably, the RA-Id cluster 3 was minimally represented in the chiropatagium (~ 1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), which is consistent with the results of the apoptosis staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Thus, the 3 RA-Id cluster can be ruled out as the cellular source of the chiropatagium.</p><p id="P12">To further elucidate the origin of chiropatagium cells, we inferred developmental trajectories in mouse and bat distal LPM clusters, focusing on non-skeletal cells expressing <italic>Hoxd13</italic>, a <italic>bona fide</italic> marker of the autopodial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Using the RNA velocity tool <italic>scVelo</italic>, as well as the pseudotime tool <italic>slingshot</italic>, we identified independent trajectories that share the same origin and are defined by differential increased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). For example, the 3 RA-Id cluster forms a trajectory with increasing <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, L</xref>). Moreover, in bat FL we identified an independent trajectory of fibroblasts marked by the expression of the transcription factor (TF) <italic>MEIS2</italic>. This trajectory was neither detected in mice nor in bat HLs, suggesting a unique developmental specification for chiropatagium cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2H, M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Overall, these analyses further show that the chiropatagium develops independently from the 3 RA-Id interdigital population. In contrast, this tissue is primarily composed of fibroblast cells expressing <italic>MEIS2</italic>.</p><p id="P13">MEIS2 is a TF that defines proximal identity at early limb stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). To explore its distal role during bat autopod morphogenesis, we first defined the proximo-distal identity for each cell and cluster across all non-integrated datasets. Specifically, we calculated the gene expression ratio between distal (autopod) and proximal markers (<italic>Hoxd13</italic> + <italic>Msx1</italic> vs <italic>Shox2</italic>). Most clusters could be clearly identified as either proximal or distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2P, Q</xref>). <italic>Meis2</italic> was among the marker genes characterizing the proximal non-skeletal cells in all our samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4</xref>). We then quantified the fraction of <italic>Meis2</italic>-positive cells in the distal region by calculating the co-expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and <italic>Meis2</italic>. This analysis revealed that the highest number of cells expressing both factors and highest co-expression levels are found in the bat FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2R, g</xref>reen color, 16.4%). This co-expression pattern specifically highlighted fibroblast cluster 10 (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2R</xref>), followed by cluster 7, each one constituting ~1/3 of chiropatagium cells at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We therefore focused on cluster 10 and, by comparing it against the remaining LPM cells, identified 20 marker genes including the TFs <italic>OSR1, TBX18</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2S</xref>). Given the unusual nature of this cluster, with many cells highly co-expressing distal and proximal markers, we explored the expression of these 20 genes across all samples. Intriguingly, this gene set was found co-expressed at high levels in the proximal fibroblasts (mostly cluster 8 and 9) of FLs and HLs of both species, while its distal co-expression was unique to the bat FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2T</xref>). Similar results were found for the marker genes of cluster 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the chiropatagium consists of fibroblasts that do not derive from the RA-Id cells. Rather, chiropatagium cells display their own differentiation trajectory characterized by a specific set of genes that include <italic>MEIS2</italic>, a TF expressed prominently in the proximal limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2U</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Repurposing of a proximal gene program in the distal bat forelimb</title><p id="P14">Our analyses identified a fibroblast cluster that is unique to the distal bat FL, yet expresses a gene set that is also present in proximal fibroblast cells of mouse and bat limbs. To determine the degree of transcriptional similarity among these clusters, we performed differential gene expression analyses in bat FLs comparing the proximal (8) and distal (10) fibroblasts against the rest of the LPM cells. We found 223 overexpressed genes, 65% of them (144) displaying high relative expression in both proximal and distal clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Nevertheless, a subset of genes was specific to distal or proximal clusters (25 and 64, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, 34 of the shared genes were also highly expressed in mouse proximal fibroblasts, suggesting an evolutionary conserved function for this gene set in limb fibroblasts (triangular points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, C</xref>). Thus, the distal <italic>MEIS2</italic>-positive cluster 10 is characterized by a gene program that shows significant transcriptional overlap with a proximal cluster. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the shared genes revealed distinct functions, including mesenchymal proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and ameboidal-type cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These processes are not only indicative of fibroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), but also represent essential components of interdigital remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and may be highly relevant in the context of wing development. To better understand the relationship and hierarchies of the genes in the program, we performed a gene regulatory network analysis using <italic>SCENIC</italic> for each cell cluster. This analysis placed MEIS2 in the regulon with the highest regulatory score within the bat cluster 10 (RSS &gt; 0.23; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, MEIS2 also appeared as a direct regulator for numerous genes, including several that belong to the shared proximo-distal program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To further elucidate how this gene program is regulated, we generated bulk transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets from distal limbs by physically dissecting them at the level of the wrist (mouse E15.5 and bat CS19 stages) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Differential expression analyses between distal FL and distal HL showed only small differences for mice, while bat distal FLs showed a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to HLs. Among the most upregulated genes we found the TFs <italic>MEIS2, HOXD9, HOXD10, HOXA2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic>, genes known to be early proximal markers and patterning factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Differential enrichment analyses for active epigenomic regions (marked by H3K27ac) revealed a significant number of regions specific to the distal bat FL, enriched in TF binding sites for RFX, ATF, GATA, ATG and, notably, MEIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Since several analyses suggested that MEIS2 plays a critical role in chiropatagium development, we profiled its chromatin binding in distal bat limbs using a dual antibody ChIP-seq assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). As TFs usually bind to several enhancer regions across large genomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), we summed up all MEIS2-bound regions per regulatory domain, defined by genome-wide chromatin interaction maps (Hi-C) from developing bat limbs. We identified a subset of regulatory domains distinctly enriched with MEIS2 binding signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). By intersecting H3K27ac- and MEIS2-binding enriched domains with genes from the distal/proximal fibroblast gene program, we narrowed down the list of candidate genes potentially regulated by MEIS2 to 71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). The top 20 genes displaying the highest overall MEIS2 binding signal in their regulatory domains included genes from the fibroblast gene program, like ECM components and TFs such as <italic>TBX3</italic> and <italic>TBX18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). The striking pattern of chromatin activity profiles (H3K27ac and MEIS2 binding) being constrained within regulatory domains is exemplified for the <italic>TBX3</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J, a</xref>nd TBX2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In addition, we compared MEIS2 binding in the distal bat limb with ChIP-seq data from early (E10.5) mouse embryonic limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), where MEIS1/2 is known to have a crucial role in limb patterning. The limited overlap in bound gene promoters (21 regions) suggests that MEIS2 has a distinct regulatory role and differential genome accessibility at both stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In summary, we identify MEIS2 as a critical TF regulating chiropatagium development, through the pervasive binding at the chromatin landscape of its associated gene program.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Distalization of <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> expression induces developmental processes related to wing formation</title><p id="P16">Our previous analyses positioned <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> as key regulators of the gene program associated with chiropatagium development. To investigate their effects on limb developmental cell states, we induced the distal limb expression of these two TFs in transgenic mice. The sequences of these TFs in both species result in highly similar proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).

We found that the genes of the chiropatagium gene program were significantly overrepresented within the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Both mutants showed a visible increase in the surface volume of the limbs. In addition, all <italic>TBX3</italic> mutants displayed fusion of at least two digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Transversal sections of these limbs confirmed the retention of the tissue between digits II and III, resembling cutaneous syndactyly in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). Quantification analyses of these images revealed a significant increase in the overall autopod volume, cell number and connective tissue content in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J-L</xref>). These results indicate that the expression of <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> in the distal and interdigital mesenchyme can recapitulate essential aspects of bat wing development. This includes increased proliferation and matrix production, resulting in retention of interdigital tissue with consecutive fusion of digits.

Previous studies have attempted to identify the genes and mechanisms behind this fascinating evolutionary adaptation. Candidate gene approaches, for instance, suggested an involvement of pro-apoptotic factors such as <italic>BMPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and their antagonist <italic>GREM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) or a second wave of <italic>SHH</italic> expression in the interdigital space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). More systematic approaches using transcriptional profiling and the integration of regulatory data identified genes of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster as well as components of canonical Wnt-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Yet, these genome-wide studies lacked cellular resolution and therefore much remains elusive. Here, by using scRNA-seq, we were able to assign expression patterns to specific cell populations thereby disentangling previous contradictory observations. Cells expressing pro-apoptotic factors in bats are equivalent to the RA-Id cluster observed in mice, where interdigital regression takes place. In contrast, <italic>GREM1</italic> is expressed in bat fibroblast cells, which originate from a distinct developmental trajectory from the RA-Id cluster and constitute the major component of the chiropatagium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2O</xref>). Nonetheless, besides apoptosis, other mechanisms including epidermal cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and the remodeling of ECM components are involved in interdigital tissue regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). This, together with our results, indicates that apoptosis is not sufficient for sculpting the digits in mammals. Indeed, further analysis of the fibroblast gene program identified an enrichment of genes associated with these processes, i.e. ECM organization, cell migration and proliferation. Alterations in the balance between cell death, and proliferation and migration are likely to change the interdigital cell composition and can result in the retention of interdigital tissue (syndactyly) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P20">A major challenge in comparative single-cell analyses lies in data integration, which risks overcorrection and the consequent masking of biological variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). This was also of concern during our integration of bat and mouse data, where the interdigital distal fibroblasts forming the bat chiropatagium clustered together with other fibroblasts from both species. However, data from micro-dissected chiropatagium revealed that such clustering was not artifactual, but rather reflected the use of similar transcriptional programs. The remarkable similarity we found between cells of such strikingly different limbs raises the question of how this difference is achieved. It is well-documented that during evolution, the same set of genes is often reused through processes like convergent evolution or deep homology conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). For example, the formation of lateral patagia enabling gliding has independently appeared multiple times in marsupials through convergent evolution, where the upstream factor <italic>Emx2</italic> is activated by distinct regulatory elements in different glider species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Here, we identify a gene program that has been repurposed through evolution, where two TFs, MEIS2 and TBX3, appear among the primary regulators. Specifically, we show that MEIS2 is a potential direct activator of many other TFs in bat wings, regulating other downstream genes. Both factors were previously described in different bat species (<italic>Miniopterus natalensis, Miniopterus schreibersii</italic>) as expressed in the distal bat FL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), indicating a conserved function in wing development. <italic>Meis2</italic> has also been previously reported to be expressed in distal E14.5 mouse limbs, based on <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, our quantification based on scRNA-seq demonstrates that the expression levels are low and are present in markedly fewer cells compared to the bat FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2R</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Meis1</italic> and <italic>Meis2</italic> (Meis) homeobox TFs are well known to be robustly expressed early (&lt;E11.5) in the proximal part of the limb, where they determine the identity of stylopod and zeugopod vs. autopod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Accordingly, mutating Meis TFs results in limb shortening due to altering the proximo-distal segmental borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The specification of proximal identity by <italic>Meis</italic> genes is an ancient function conserved across the vertebrate lineage, including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Interestingly, in Drosophila, the <italic>Meis</italic> homologue <italic>hth</italic> is also required for proximal leg development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Tbx3</italic> is a gene expressed in the proximal limb mesenchyme and plays a crucial role during limb patterning in establishing anterior-posterior boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). The importance of <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> in chiropatagium development is supported by our studies in transgenic mice. The gene expression changes observed in mutant limbs, together with the alterations in morphology, cell number and matrix production, reflect key features associated with the gene program of chiropatagium cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, the ectopic expression of <italic>MEIS2</italic> or <italic>TBX3</italic> in interdigital distal cells induces a gene program that partially resembles that observed in bats and leads to tissue retention. It is likely that the expression pattern of <italic>MEIS2</italic> observed in bats requires regulatory changes rendering <italic>MEIS2</italic> susceptible to specific FL autopod signals, such as a FL specific Hox code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). This may encompass the observed activation of 3’ anterior Hox paralogs like HOXA1/2.</p><p id="P22">Phenotypic evolutionary innovations can, in principle, arise from gene duplications or losses. Yet, a genomic comparison of six bat reference genomes failed to reveal expansion or loss of any candidate gene that might play a role in limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Alternatively, already existing genes can be newly recruited into regulatory gene networks (co-option) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), or regulatory changes can modify gene expression within existing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Instead, our data point towards a high degree of similarity in gene expression between species suggesting the reuse of a transcriptional program already existent in the limb but at a different anatomical position. It is probable that the re-use of this gene program occurs within a markedly disparate epigenetic landscape, thereby activating slightly disparate and novel gene sets. A similar scenario has recently been reported for skeletogenic cells found in different parts of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Chondrocytes that originate from different germ layers use distinct sets of regulatory elements for activation of similar gene programs. Like the chiropatagium cells, which are equivalent at the transcriptional level to the proximal fibroblasts but diverge at the gene regulatory level. Thus, even a change as drastic as the development of a wing from individual digits can apparently be achieved by relatively small changes and the repurposing of already existing and active pathways. Following the principle of parsimony, evolution constructed novelty by making minimal modifications to already existing elements.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animal Samples</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice</title><p id="P23">Wildtype mouse embryonic tissues were derived from crossings of CD1 x CD1 or C57BL/6J x 129.

Briefly, IsoSeq data was first analyzed as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) to produce high-quality ORF predictions. Then, we implemented a strategy to classify and filter transcripts-based features such as known canonical splice sites, known non-canonical splice sites, novel canonical-splice sites, and novel non-canonical splices. A small set of transcripts, with suboptimal features were not used as input for the gene annotation. For example, fusion transcripts (chimeras that include more than one gene), intra-priming (transcripts with more than 85% or at least 10 contiguous adenines within 20 bp upstream of the 3’ end), low coverage (transcripts supporting coding regions by less than 3 reads), RT-switching predictions (an exon-skipping pattern due to a retrotranscription gap caused by secondary structures in expressed transcripts), nonsense-mediated decay (premature stop codons), and intron retention were features all identified as suboptimal. However, when possible, some of these transcripts were used to annotate UTRs. Transcript features used for classification were identified using TAMA-GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).

To correct these issues conservatively we used sequence conservation to human (hg19) determined via a one-to-one comparison of both genomes via the alignment software LAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) with the following parameters: lastdb - uMAM8 -R11 -c; last-train --revsym --matsym --gapsym -E0.05 -C2; lastal -m10 -E0.05 -C2.</p><p id="P28">As a prerequisite we lifted human CDS regions to the Carollia genome.

Cells were grown and split into triplicates after reaching sufficient size. One plate was used for DNA harvesting and genotyping of clones. The other two plates were frozen and stored at -80°C for expansion of positive clones.</p><p id="P77">Clones were screened for expression construct knockins by PCR detecting site-specific insertion breakpoints. Copy numbers of the insertions were then assessed by qPCR. Positive clones were selected for tetraploid complementation. All cell lines and genotyping primers can be found in Table 1.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Generation of mutant embryos by tetraploid aggregation</title><p id="P78">For generation of transgenic embryos, selected mutant ESCs were seeded on CD1 feeders, grown for 2 days and then subjected to aggregation by tetraploid morula complementation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Female mice of CD1 strain were used as foster mothers.</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation</title><p id="P79">MEIS2 transgene mRNAs were detected in embryos by WISH using digoxigenin-labelled antisense RNA probes prepared with DIG RNA labelling mix (Roche, #11277073910). Embryos were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS overnight, and dehydrated in a methanol series (25%, 50%, 75% methanol in 0.1% Tween in DPBS) on ice. They were stored in 100% methanol at - 20°C. For staining, embryos were rehydrated in a reversed methanol/PBST series, bleached in 6% H2O2/PBST for 1 hour, treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K in PBST for 5 minutes, and re-fixed in 4% PFA/PBS with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% Tween 20. After washing in PBST, embryos were incubated in L1 buffer (50% deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 1% SDS, 0.1% Tween 20) at 68°C for 10 minutes, followed by hybridization buffer 1 (L1 with 0.1% tRNA and 0.05% heparin) for 2 hours, and then in hybridization buffer 2 (hybridization buffer 1 plus 1.5 µg digoxigenin-labelled RNA probe per embryo) overnight at 68°C. The next day, unbound probe was washed away using L1, L2 (50% deionized formamide, 2x SSC, 0.1% Tween 20), and L3 buffer (2x SSC, 0.1% Tween 20) for three 30-minute intervals at 68°C. Embryos were treated with RNase solution (0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml RNaseA) for 1 hour, washed in PBST, and blocked in TBST 1 (2% FBS, 0.2% BSA) for 2 hours at room temperature. They were then incubated with 1:5000 anti-digoxigenin-conjugated to alkaline phosphatase antibody (Roche, #11093274910) in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Unbound antibody was washed off with TBST 2 (TBST with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.05% levamisole). For staining, embryos were washed in alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.02 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.05% levamisole), then stained with BM Purple AP Substrate (Roche, #11442074). Finally, stained embryos were imaged using a ZEISS SteREO Discovery.V12 microscope with a Leica DFC420 camera. The primers used to generate the transgene MEIS2 probe can be found in Table 1.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Limb 3D Imaging</title><p id="P80">PFA-fixed mouse embryo limb specimens were incubated in a solution of 25 µM DraQ5™, dissolved in PermBlock solution (1% BSA, 0.5% Tween® 20 in PBS), for 12 hours. Following three washes with PBS-T, the stained specimens were dehydrated in increasing methanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 95%, and 99% (v/v) methanol in ddH2O). Subsequently, the specimens were stained in a solution of 1.5 µM eosin Y, dissolved in a 1:1 methanol:BABB (benzyl alcohol:benzoate, ratio 1:2) solution for 4 hours, followed by an optical clearing procedure with BABB solution twice for 4 hours each.</p><p id="P81">After fluorescence whole-mount staining, optically cleared embryo limb biopsies were imaged using the Lightsheet 7 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The stacks were captured with a step size of 2.5 µm and at 5x magnification. The ZEN 3.1 (black edition) software was utilized for the operation of the light sheet microscope and the acquisition of the images. The digital three-dimensional reconstruction of light sheet image stacks was conducted using the IMARIS Microscopy Image Analysis Software (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK).</p><p id="P82">All quantifications were performed using IMARIS Microscopy Image Analysis Software. For the measurement of the volume of the mouse limb, the autopod region devoid of fingers was considered and analyzed using the Volume function in IMARIS for each condition and n=4 independent specimens. The total number of cells was quantified within DraQ5™-positive nuclei of the autopod, excluding the fingers of the limb, using the Spots function in IMARIS for each condition and from n=4 independent samples. For the quantification of connective tissue in the limbs, Eosin Y-positive structures of the limbs were analyzed using the Volume function in IMARIS for each condition and n=4 independent specimens. The differences of the mean were calculated using a Dunnett test following a one-way ANOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199422-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S44"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Asita Stiege and Ute Fisher for their technical support.
