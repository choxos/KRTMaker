While multiple subpopulations persisted during the infection, each subpopulation was observed only intermittently. However, it was unknown whether similar patterns were also present after Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) treatment, where viral populations were often assumed to go through narrow bottlenecks. Here we tested for the maintenance of population structure after DAA treatment failure. We analysed whole-genome next-generation sequencing data generated from a randomised study using DAAs (the BOSON study). We focused on samples collected from patients (N=84) who did not achieve sustained virological response (i.e. treatment failure) and had sequenced virus from multiple timepoints. For each individual, we tracked concordance in nucleotide variant frequencies through time. Using a sliding window approach, we applied sequenced-based and tree-based clustering algorithms across the entire HCV genome. Finally, we reconstructed viral haplotypes and estimated lineage specific within-host divergence rates from the haplotype phylogenies. Distinct viral subpopulations were maintained among a high proportion of individuals post DAA treatment failure. Using maximum likelihood modelling and model comparison, we found an overdispersion of viral evolutionary rates among individuals, and significant differences in evolutionary rates between lineages within individuals. These results suggest the virus is compartmentalised within individuals, with the varying evolutionary rates due to different viral replication rates or different selection pressures. We propose lineage awareness in future analyses of HCV evolution and infections to avoid conflating patterns from distinct lineages, and to recognise the likely existence of unsampled subpopulations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Infections caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are prevalent globally. While around 30% of infections clear spontaneously, the remaining become chronic if left untreated. Up to 30% of untreated chronic infections result in cirrhosis and liver cancer, leading to an increased risk of death, significantly damaging the health of the individual, and burdening health systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">WHO 2024</xref>). In recent years, a range of highly effective Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) has proven effective, with efficacy rates up to 95% in some genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sulkowski et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Feld et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wyles et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kowdley Kris V. et al., 2014</xref>), although access to diagnosis and treatment remains low in many low and middle income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">WHO 2024</xref>). Without an effective vaccine, reinfections are common in highly affected areas and among at-risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dietz and Lohmann 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Similar to other RNA viruses, HCV exhibits complex within-host dynamics. It often maintains a unique population structure, where multiple distinct viral populations coexist but are only observed intermittently across sampling time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Raghwani et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raghwani et al. 2019</xref>). Within-host phylogenies have demonstrated the structured viral population of untreated and interferon-treated chronically-infected HCV patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gray et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Raghwani et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ramachandran et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Riaz et al. 2022</xref>). Many biological mechanisms could support such population structure, including physical barriers such as cirrhotic liver tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sorbo et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Pérez et al. 2017</xref>), or the infection of different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ducoulombier et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gismondi et al. 2013</xref>). HCV also has a very low rate of recombination which acts to prevent the genetic mixing of different subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raghwani et al. 2019</xref>), whilst compartmentalisation would prevent cells from being coinfected with different subpopulations, reducing the effective rate of recombination still further. Segregating populations could lead to differences in replication rates, generation times and/or rates of evolution.</p><p id="P4">Understanding viral disease dynamics is an indispensable part of the road toward the World Health Organisation’s 2030 target of eliminating viral hepatitis. The within-host population structure does not only affect drug resistance mechanisms but could also complicate studies looking at disease transmission, because genetically different populations could be circulating between the time of transmission and the time of sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raghwani et al. 2019</xref>). This phenomenon will inevitably interfere with molecular epidemiology inferences and surveillance efforts, which usually rely on consensus genetic data.</p><p id="P5">Studying subpopulations and compartmentalisation of HCV is not straightforward because most viral genetic data is from blood samples, so subpopulations can be mixed. With longitudinal sampling, it has been found that sometimes a single population circulates the body, while at other times, multiple distinct populations coexist in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Raghwani et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ramachandran et al. 2011</xref>). While compartmentalisation has been proposed as the mechanism underlying these dynamics, it is very difficult to investigate because it requires the isolation of viruses infecting the, yet unknown, compartments. These compartments could be different sections of the same liver or various candidate cell types spread across the body.</p><p id="P6">Without coordinated proactive measures, the high success rates of DAAs may be heavily challenged by emerging viral drug resistance in the future. Moderate to high prevalence of baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to DAAs have been found in publicly available sequences and treatment studies, occasionally coupled with lowered sustained virological response (SVR) rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Childs et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gupta et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">D.

Studies have found that the genetic barriers to DAAs are low across viral genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kliemann et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Patiño-Galindo et al. 2016</xref>). RASs that conferred cross-resistance to multiple DAAs sharing the same target were readily selected <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fernandez-Antunez et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, the detected RASs were naturally inherent to specific viral genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vo-Quang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">D. Smith et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Patiño-Galindo et al. 2016</xref>). Different genotypes and demographics vary in their overall SVR rates with DAA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Childs et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dietz et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vo-Quang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gupta et al. 2019</xref>). Detailed characterisations of RASs, especially in light of within-host population structure, are essential for treatment guidelines in resource limited regions as it will help to avoid an increase in drug resistance prevalence and to achieve high levels of SVR post treatment.</p><p id="P7">An important observation has been the maintenance of viral subpopulations after liver transplantation and treatment with ribavirin and interferon, with distinct subpopulations present prior to transplantation or treatment re-emerging months or years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gray et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Raghwani et al. 2016</xref>). Given the rapid and mass rollout of DAAs, which are highly effective at treating most HCV infections, a key question is whether distinct subpopulations are also maintained in the minority of individuals who fail treatment. To answer this question we analysed short-read whole-genome deep-sequencing data from samples longitudinally collected from patients that failed DAA treatment. We used a variety of analytical methods to identify subpopulations, and if they were present to determine their rates of evolution. As a result of the findings, we suggest the within-host evolutionary analyses of HCV viral populations should be lineage-aware as standard.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Samples, sequencing and bioinformatics</title><p id="P8">Blood samples were collected from participating patients of the BOSON study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Foster et al. 2015</xref>) and permission was granted for the use of samples for further studies.

The BOSON study protocol was approved by each recruiting institution’s review board or ethics committee before study initiation.

A variant position required a minimum depth of 100 reads and a variant allele frequency of at least 10% for at least one time point, to be included in the analysis. After quality filtering and sample availability selection, the variant frequency trajectories were produced for 50 individuals with three or more samples. Variants that were fixed (increased to and remained at above 90%) or purged (decreased to and remained at below 10%) after the first time point were not assessed.

Phyloscanner generated alignments and trees for 210bp sliding windows with 50bp increments across the entire HCV genome. The window width was chosen through visual inspection of analysis results from a random subset of the samples to strike a balance between maximum window width (or read length) and read abundance spanning the window. Next, the k parameter in phyloscanner, determining the routines for identifying contaminant reads and multiple infections was optimised for HCV as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text File</xref> using sequencing reads from 570 patients from the BOSON study. The phyloscanner_analyse_trees.Rscript was used to remove possible contaminants within each sample.</p><p id="P15">After decontamination, fastbaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Tonkin-Hill et al. 2019</xref>), a hierarchical bayesian clustering tool, was applied to divide the sequences into 2 clusters within each phyloscanner window (Dirichlet prior type = ‘optimise.baps’, number of initial clusters = 2). For each individual patient, genomic windows containing a minimum of 2 sequences from at least 2 different samples were assessed. If both clusters contained sequences from the baseline (pre-treatment) sample and sequences from one or more later (post-treatment) samples, the window was deemed to have sequence-based support for a baseline structured population being maintained throughout treatment. To validate the sequence-based support for the maintenance of population structure, Simmonds’ Association Index (SAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wang et al. 2001</xref>), a tree-topology-based statistic for compartmentalisation, was also calculated for the phylogeny constructed for each window. This step took the clusters assigned by fastbaps and tested how stable the clusters were by bootstrapping the phylogenetic trees. A SAI &lt;0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lewis et al. 2013</xref>) indicates strong support for stable clustering.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Subpopulation divergence rate comparison</title><p id="P16">To estimate the neutral rate of evolution, the number of synonymous substitutions was counted for each non-baseline haplotype to its closest baseline haplotype. A maximum likelihood model with a Poisson distribution with one overall rate for all individuals in the study was fitted to the observed synonymous substitutions. To accommodate different rates of evolution among individuals, a second maximum likelihood model with a negative binomial distribution was also fitted. Fitting to a negative binomial distribution relaxed the assumption that rates are identical amongst individuals, instead taking each to be drawn from a gamma distribution.</p><p id="P17">To determine if evolutionary rates vary among subpopulations within the same individuals, we estimated an evolutionary rate per subpopulation. For each individual’s haplotype tree, an exhaustive model comparison analysis was carried out to find the best model of evolutionary rates that explained the distribution of synonymous substitutions across time. Specifically, the non-baseline haplotypes were divided into different hypothetical subpopulations if their closest baseline haplotype and sampling time were different. Linear mixed-effect models were compared for all possible combinations of the hypothetical subpopulations and the best model was determined by the lowest BIC score (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> for example). The sets of subpopulations and their rates were extracted and categorised into individuals with only one subpopulation, individuals with multiple subpopulations where some subpopulations are missing haplotypes from intermediate time points between the first and last time point of that lineage, and subpopulations that were not missing haplotypes from intermediate time points between the first and last time point of that lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S9"><title>Subpopulation frequencies fluctuate across timepoints</title><p id="P18">Since HCV has been reported to have low rates of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raghwani et al. 2019</xref>), we hypothesised that if different subpopulations have genetic variants unique to them, then the dynamics of subpopulations could be observed by tracking frequency changes of within-host variants through time. We first generated frequency trajectories of genomic variants that were below 50% at Baseline, above 50% at Post-Treatment 12 weeks (PT12) and below 50% at Post-Treatment 24 weeks PT24 (top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of these variants were synonymous changes. Similar frequency trajectories were also shown for pairs of variants that are closer than 150bp on the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), further confirming that these frequency concordant variants were on the same genomic background. We then examined the genomic location of these variants (bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The variant distribution across the HCV genome did not show a specific genomic region responsible for segregating the subpopulations, and also supported the lack of recombination.</p><p id="P19">Next, we generated frequency trajectories for all fluctuating variants present in the individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). We observed highly concordant variant frequencies through time, highly suggestive of genetically distinct subpopulations changing in frequency, with different populations represented by unique haplotypes. To explore this further, we reconstructed viral haplotypes for each sample using cliqueSNV, from which we generated haplotype phylogenies for each infection using IQ-TREE2 [see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>]. The variant trajectories were reflected in many individuals’ haplotype trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, patient J, the low frequency lineage was present at around 20% at Baseline, dropped to 0% at 12 weeks post treatment (PT12) and reappeared at around 20% at 24 weeks post treatment (PT24). This low frequency lineage was represented by one baseline haplotype and one PT24 haplotype, with both being on the same branch of the haplotype tree. Similar consistencies of haplotype phylogenies with variant trajectories can be seen in other patients, with examples for patients A and B given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p><p id="P20">However, the correspondence between the allele trajectories and the haplotype trees was not always clear cut, which in some cases may be due to the presence of subpopulations not observed at baseline. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>: patient C, we speculate the long branch leading to the single haplotype at PT24, was a resurrection of a lineage that was present before, but not at, baseline.</p><p id="P21">To visualise if the subpopulations exclusively harboured RASs, we plotted RAV frequency trajectories together with the nucleotide variant frequency trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). In most of the individuals, there was either a consistent presence (frequency above 90%) or absence (frequency below 10%) of most RAVs throughout the sampling period. A median of 24 RAVs [range 5-28, mean 23.34] were present at equal to or above 50% frequency throughout the sampling period for the 50 assessed individuals. A median of 3 RAVs [range 0-14, mean 4.22] were present below 50% frequency throughout the sampling period for the assessed individuals. For some positions in 20 individuals, we observed RAV frequency fluctuations (i.e. frequency changing from below 50% to above 50% or vice versa) suggesting complex resistance mechanisms. Specifically, NS5B: 90A, 150V, 66T, 120R, 180Q and NS3 67V fluctuated in frequency in 4 individuals, NS5B 90A fluctuated in 5 individuals. In several patients, we observed dynamics suggesting a RAV may have been under selection as a result of the treatment, with a minor subpopulation containing the RAV at baseline becoming the major subpopulation after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, patient A-B). However, given the highly dynamic nature of within-host HCV subpopulations and the lack of recombination, we cannot say whether the subpopulation became dominant because it harboured the RAV.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Pretreatment population structure was retained post treatment</title><p id="P22">Although the variant frequency trajectories and haplotype phylogenies were suggestive of highly structured within-host populations, we are essentially assuming that variants of similar frequencies are linked (on the same genome). However, because we are using short-read sequencing data we cannot <italic>a priori</italic> make this assumption since most mutations will be on different reads. To further demonstrate the existence of highly dynamic subpopulations, we tested for population structure using sequencing reads spanning sliding windows along the genome, meaning linkage between variants within a given window is known rather than inferred. The short reads meant low resolution in any given window, however, by scanning the entire genome and considering a large number of windows, we were able to build up an aggregate picture for each individual. We used two cross-validating summary statistics to demonstrate the existence of within-host population structure across the entire genome of HCV.</p><p id="P23">For each window, we first used a Bayesian sequence-based approach (fastbaps) to determine if sequences showed evidence of population structure persisting through the infection. This population structure was then cross-validated using tree topology (SAI). The two summary statistics are very conservative in nature, and therefore a positive result is strongly supportive of population structure, but population structure may be present even if the result is negative. Given that the inclusion of baseline sequences in all clusters was enforced during the analyses, a positive result indicates that population structure was maintained following DAA treatment. Of the 80 individuals with samples that passed the analysis selection criteria, 47 (58.75%) had five or more non-overlapping windows showing evidence of structure, and 23 (28.75%) had five or more non-overlapping windows with the structure validated by both fastbaps and SAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, examples of structured topologies are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Lineages that are only intermittently observed across time are less divergent</title><p id="P24">We have presented multiple lines of evidence supporting the maintenance of subpopulations after treatment in many individuals, and with the relative frequency of observed subpopulations often changing dramatically through time. Although the reconstruction of within-host haplotypes for virus populations can be challenging, the well-segregated subpopulations within HCV infected individuals appear to favour reasonably accurate haplotype reconstruction.</p><p id="P25">The reconstructed haplotype trees in our dataset showed different topologies across individuals. Some individuals had only a single lineage throughout the sampling time frame (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, patient K), whereas others had more complicated structures. For example, in some cases multiple lineages emerged from different baseline haplotypes (e.g. patient B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and often one or more of the lineages were observed at two sampling time points but missing from an intermediate time point (e.g. for patient B, lower lineage is missing time point PT12). We also commonly observed cases where the order of lineage branching was not chronological (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, patient L and additional examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We hypothesised that unobserved lineages may be periodically occupying different niches, and this may in turn affect their evolutionary rates. To test if there was evolutionary rate variation across the individuals, we fitted the number of synonymous mutations between haplotypes in the individual trees to two different expected distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) using a maximum likelihood framework. We used synonymous mutations as these are more likely to be neutral than nonsynonymous mutations, and therefore less likely to be influenced by selection as a direct result of treatment. A Poisson distributed number of synonymous mutations would be expected, at any given time since baseline, if all viral populations evolve at a single shared rate. Taking into account the time of sampling post baseline for all reconstructed haplotypes across all individuals in our dataset, we determined the most likely single mutation rate given the observed number of mutations on each haplotype compared to the most similar baseline haplotype. The expected distribution of mutations using the maximum likelihood rate (Poisson mean: 0.152) was significantly different from the observed distribution of synonymous mutations (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test: p&lt;2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>). We next introduced additional variation into the expected distribution by fitting a negative binomial distribution. (As well as its common interpretation as the distribution of the number of failures in a given number of equal-probability Bernoulli trials, the negative binomial distribution also arises as a mixture of Poisson distributions with gamma-distributed means.) Although this expected distribution generated with the maximum likelihood parameters (shape parameter: 1.296, rate parameter: 6.931) was visually more similar to the observed distribution of synonymous mutations, the two distributions were still significantly different (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test: p=4.135×10<sup>-6</sup>). These comparisons demonstrated a significant overdispersion in evolutionary rates across the individuals in this study.</p><p id="P27">To further investigate the evolutionary rate variation within individuals, we estimated evolutionary rates per within-host lineage using exhaustive model comparison of mixed-effect linear models. For individuals where a single-lineage rate model had the lowest BIC score, one rate was estimated. For individuals where a multiple-lineage rate model was the best model, we separated the lineage rates into ones that were estimated from lineages missing haplotypes from intermediate sampling timepoints and lineages that did not miss haplotypes from intermediate sampling time points. By doing so, we assumed that if the intermediate haplotype was not observed, then the subpopulation it belonged to was at low or undetectable frequency. The estimated rates for the lineages fell within the expected range for HCV neutral evolution reported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raghwani et al. 2019</xref>: 2.05-8.21 ×10<sup>-5</sup> s/s/d, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gray et al. 2011</xref>: 1.11 - 1.13 ×10<sup>-3</sup> s/s/yr), with lineages that had missing observations having rates significantly lower than the lineages not missing observations (Mann-Whitney U test: p = 1.868×10<sup>-5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). These lowered divergence rates suggested that when not present in circulating blood, subpopulations may be subject to lower selection pressures, and therefore there is less opportunity for synonymous mutations to hitchhike with selected-for mutations to high frequency. Alternatively, viruses in these subpopulations might have a longer viral generation time, perhaps due to infecting different cell types. This would reduce the rate at which new mutations are introduced into the population per unit time, resulting in a lower rate of neutral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lythgoe et al. 2021</xref>). The rate estimates from single-lineage individuals were intermediate between the multi-lineage individual rates for lineages with no missing observations, and those with missing observations. This may be because the haplotypes were not well-resolved within these individuals and divergence signals from lineages of differing rates were merged into the single lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Here, we have systematically demonstrated for the first time that HCV pre-existing within-host population structure is often maintained after DAA treatment failure. Moreover, we found considerable variation in evolutionary rates among individuals, and between different lineages within individuals, with lineages that are absent at intermediate time points tending to have lower rates of evolution. To do this we analysed whole-genome short-read virus sequences generated as part of the BOSON study, a randomised control trial to test the effectiveness of different treatment regimens of a second-generation DAA. We used a number of corroborating analyses, including tracking variant frequencies through time, scanning sliding window phylogenies across the genome, and haplotype reconstruction. This work has implications not only for our understanding of HCV biology, but also for how in the future to screen for DAA tolerance or resistance mutations before treatment and after treatment failure, which we argue should be “lineage-aware”.</p><p id="P29">Previous work has also demonstrated the presence of distinct viral lineages during HCV infections, but the question remains whether their existence poses a biological challenge for treatment efforts. Even in patients who ultimately experience viral rebound, DAA treatment induces a large reduction in the HCV viral population size, but not so large that viral diversity is not maintained; for sofosbuvir treatments at least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Foster et al. 2015</xref>). Because the resistance landscape is affected by many environmental factors such as host HLA genotype, INFL4 reactivity, DAA resistance is almost never the result of a single specific drug resistant mutation in the virus that initiated the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dietz et al. 2021</xref>). The genetic resistance mechanism has proven a challenge to tease apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Smith et al. 2021</xref>). While the cure rate of HCV infections by DAA is high, the undisrupted population structure in patients experiencing rebound after DAA treatment is concerning.</p><p id="P30">Others have characterised the mutational spectrum of HCV post DAA treatment and the development of (multi-)drug resistance from pre- to post-DAA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Takeda et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yamashita et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Nakamura et al. 2022</xref>). However, the role that structured populations have in the response to DAA treatment is unknown. It is possible that the presence of population structure makes the viral population more resilient to environmental disturbances caused by immunity or treatment, meaning immune- or drug-sensitive populations could be preserved within the human body, enabling them to re-emerge when immune or treatment pressures ease. One recent study showed differential persistence of RASs after treatment failure among different genotype infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dietz et al. 2023</xref>), where high-level resistant RASs are less likely to persist compared to low- and medium-level resistant RASs. They also observed that RASs could disappear as early as 3 months after treatment failure. If it proves to be the case that population structure facilitates DAA persistence, longer treatment duration and/or treatments that target both observed and unobserved subpopulations may be advisable. If the population structure arises due to compartmentalisation, whether it be physical barriers caused by cirrhotic liver tissues or non-hepatic cells across the body, treatment strategies may need to consider the coverage of all compartments, as another study showed different RASs are present in different compartments in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sorbo et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Consideration of maintenance of HCV within-host population structure after treatment failure may also be critical in efforts to control the virus. In particular, we have seen time and time again that we should never be complacent over the emergence and spread of drug resistance, as witnessed by recent increases of rates of transmitted resistance to antiretrovirals in HIV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Pennings 2013</xref>), after decades where these rates were consistently low and considered relatively unproblematic. For HCV, there is still a large amount that is unknown, but the answers may be critical in our fight for its global eradication, which with the advent of DAAs should be our aspiration. For example, dynamic viral population structures were not seen within all the individuals we analysed, which could be because they did not exist, or because they existed but we did not observe them. Important questions remain: how widespread is within-host HCV population structure, what is the mechanism underlying the structure, why do unobserved populations have a lower rate of evolution, and what role does the viral population structure have in treatment failure and ultimately the spread of drug resistant and tolerant mutations?</p><p id="P32">It would be sensible to hypothesise that the establishment and maintenance of structured populations is complex and dependent on the interaction between host, viral, and environmental factors. Understanding the roles of these different factors could then feed into our decisions on how best to screen individuals for pre-existing virus resistance mutations, treat them, and to follow them up, so as to prevent onward transmission of resistant mutations. As a specific example, relying on the viral genome consensus at a single sampling time point for drug resistance testing risks not capturing resistant genotypes that are present but do not happen to be circulating in the blood or at sub-consensus frequency at the time of sampling. We therefore advocate for lineage awareness in evolutionary analysis of HCV infections.</p><p id="P33">Here, we analysed whole-genome short-read sequencing data. This has the advantage over previous studies looking at the within-host evolution of HCV since it covers the whole genome, rather than just the E1/E2 region that is more typically studied. However, the reliance on short Illumina reads, rather than on longer reads that are often used in this type of analysis, had its challenges because of the difficulties in establishing the physical linkage of mutations on the same genome. This meant we could not rely on the construction of phylogenies alone. We resolved this by using a sliding window approach that scanned across the whole genome, and two cross-validating statistics. This methodology ensured high specificity in the detection of population structure, but does mean there are likely many cases where population structure existed but we did not detect it with high confidence. Moreover, for part of the analysis we relied on a haplotype reconstruction tool, with the resemblance of the reconstructed haplotypes to the true haplotypes dependent on the power of the reconstruction tool and the diversity and composition of viruses within the samples. Using genuine haplotypes directly from long-read deep-sequencing data would be preferable, but while Illumina short-read sequencing is still the norm, our methods provide a roadmap for how to analyse this type of data.</p><p id="P34">Another drawback of our study is that we did not have samples pre-baseline. We therefore assumed that all subpopulations were observed at the first sampling time point. This assumption will inevitably inflate evolutionary rate estimates for lineages that were present but not observed at baseline, but which were then observed later on, since they will have appeared to have diverged a large distance from the observed baseline population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, patient D). Future work may be able to resolve this limitation by incorporating the possibility of absent subpopulations at the first sampling time point.</p><p id="P35">In summary, we have demonstrated that within-host population structure is an important component of HCV within-host evolution in response to treatment, and we therefore advocate for lineage awareness in future evolutionary analysis of HCV. A better understanding of the within-host dynamics of HCV infections would benefit future treatment strategies, drug resistance outlook and transmission mitigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199526-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d68aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research was supported by the Wellcome Trust Core Award Grant Number 203141/Z/16/Z and 222426/Z/21/Z (to PK) with funding from the NIHR Oxford BRC.
