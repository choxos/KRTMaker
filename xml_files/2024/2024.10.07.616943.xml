Although commensal bacteria display host preference, their beneficial impact on their cognate host and mechanisms of species selection by the plant are still unclear. We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>At</italic>) and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> (<italic>Lj</italic>) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of <italic>At</italic> Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolate R401. <italic>Lj</italic>-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas <italic>At</italic>-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. <italic>In vitro</italic> antagonist assays, <italic>in planta</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative. This has implications for the successful development of beneficial microbial consortia for agriculture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas</italic></kwd><kwd>root microbiota</kwd><kwd>SynComs</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>competition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plants establish tight relationships with the microorganisms surrounding them. These diverse microorganisms include viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and nematodes, and are collectively referred to as the plant microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The structure of the microbiota is crucial for plant health and protection against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], where an imbalance is associated with susceptibility and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Plant microbiota diversity and composition is primarily shaped by the environment, i.e., the initial microbial pool in the soil, soil physicochemical properties, geography, and climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The plant host then functions as a filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], especially belowground, where root-secreted compounds such as carbon sources and signaling molecules act as key determinants driving microbial activity and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This so-called rhizosphere effect results in a higher microbial density and lower microbial diversity along the soil-root axis. In addition to these main drivers, host species-specific effects on root-associated bacterial microbiota were shown for plants grown in natural environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], in greenhouse settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and in controlled gnotobiotic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Host-specific microbiota composition is likely explained by a signature cocktail of root exudates, a fine-tuned innate immune system, and specific root architecture of individual hosts. Which plant and microbial factors determine these important host-specific communities, and how they are established and maintained remains an active field of research.</p><p id="P3">The major bacterial taxa in the plant microbiota typically belong to six classes, namely Bacteroidota, Bacillota, Actinomycetota (formerly Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria), and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Notably, both plant beneficial and detrimental bacteria are often found within these groups, and even within the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Although several microbiota members are detrimental in mono-association experiments under specific laboratory conditions, their detrimental activity is often reduced in a community context, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that suppress disease in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. This can be the result of microbe-microbe interactions, in which antagonism, cooperation, and competition shape community composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In addition, host physiology and environmental changes will affect these dynamics. Nevertheless, ecological frameworks predict that diverse communities are more robust against perturbations, which moreover suggests that beneficial microbial traits may only be exerted in a community context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The existence of host species-specific root microbiota and the observation of host preference among commensal bacteria suggest a certain degree of adaptation of the microorganisms to a specific host, i.e., metabolic niche. To what extent the host plant benefits from accommodating distinct yet taxonomically similar strains, e.g., through biotic or abiotic stress alleviation, is unclear.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we addressed if i) the origin of isolation of bacterial communities affects protection against a detrimental strain, ii) how a detrimental strain impacts community composition <italic>in planta</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and iii) if microbe-microbe interactions explain the observed phenomena. We used the previously established bacterial culture collections of isolates from roots of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>At</italic>) (<italic>At</italic>-RSPHERE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]) and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> (<italic>Lj</italic>) (<italic>Lj</italic>-SPHERE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]) to design taxonomically diverse synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their potential to provide protection against the opportunistic <italic>Pseudomonas brassicacearum</italic> strain Root401 (R401) in <italic>At</italic> Col-0 plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We found that low-complexity SynComs protect against R401 independently of their hosts of isolation, and that SynCom protective function can be abolished by R401 via exometabolite-mediated inhibition of SynCom members. We also revealed that within-genus competition between <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> commensals and the opportunistic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> R401 explains SynCom protective success. Therefore, we delineate <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> intra-genus competition as a possible strategy to control pathogen emergence in nature.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>At</italic>-derived and <italic>Lj</italic>-derived SynComs differentially suppress R401-induced disease in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p id="P6"><italic>P. brassicacearum</italic> R401 was originally isolated from <italic>At</italic> Col-0 plants growing in agricultural soil and is part of the <italic>At</italic>-RSPHERE culture collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Upon single inoculation on Col-0 seedlings grown in an agar-based system, R401 causes wilting and disease symptoms ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) that were recently shown to be partially dependent on the production of the lipopeptide brassicapeptin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. To test the potential beneficial effect of bacterial communities on plant performance and resistance, we infected sterile Col-0 seedlings and seedlings co-cultivated with two different SynComs of <italic>At</italic>-derived strains (AtSC5 and AtSC6) of diverse taxonomic composition (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>) with a dilute culture of R401 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig)</xref>. Inoculation of R401 on <italic>At</italic> Col-0 led to a chlorotic and stunted plant phenotype that was mildly alleviated by AtSC5 and AtSC6, indicating that <italic>At</italic>-derived SynComs largely failed to protect plants from R401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A, B</xref>). We also tested two other SynComs derived from the <italic>Lj</italic>-SPHERE collection (LjSC5 and LjSC6) with similar taxonomic structure to AtSC5 and AtSC6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>) and found that both rescued the R401-induced plant growth defect to levels of non-infected control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A, B</xref>). The severity of plant wilting and growth impairment was directly linked to R401 colonization capabilities, since bacterial load was generally greater in roots of mock-treated and AtSC-treated plants compared to those treated with LjSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). These results show that Col-0 can be protected against the detrimental activity of R401 by bacterial communities, and this protection is SynCom-specific.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protective <italic>At</italic>-SynCom function is suppressed by R401 via exometabolite-mediated inhibition of SynCom members</title><p id="P7">The decreased bacterial load of R401 on Col-0 roots in the presence of other bacteria may be a consequence of microbial antagonism. To test whether individual strains display antagonistic activity towards R401, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> pairwise antagonistic assay in which a producer strain that is dripped on top of a solidified medium produces exometabolites that diffuse into the medium and inhibit the in-agar growth of a target strain, resulting in a clear and quantifiable halo of inhibition ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found no profound effect of AtSC6 and LjSC6 strains on in-agar growth of R401, with only one <italic>Bacillaceae</italic> strain (AtRoot131) displaying mild inhibitory activity towards R401 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>). However, in the reverse experiment in which R401 was the producer strain, most commensal bacteria (15/17 AtSC6 strains; 15/17 LjSC6 strains) were severely inhibited based on diameter measurement of the inhibition zone formed around the R401 colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). This result corroborates a recent report identifying R401 as the most antagonistic bacterial isolate of the <italic>At</italic>-RSPHERE culture collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Notably, the same study revealed that &gt;70% of R401 inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> was explained by the production of two molecules, namely the antimicrobial 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and the iron-chelating molecule pyoverdine that restrict the growth of other bacteria via direct antimicrobial activity and competition for available iron, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. When we repeated our inhibition assays using the corresponding R401 Δ<italic>pvdY</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic> double mutant impaired in both pyoverdine and DAPG production (R401mut), we confirmed the significant decrease of antagonism towards <italic>At</italic>-derived and <italic>Lj</italic>-derived commensal bacteria used in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Strikingly, although R401mut retained its detrimental activity on Col-0 plants when mono-inoculated onto the seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A, B</xref>), this detrimental phenotype was now fully rescued by AtSC5 and AtSC6, indicating that <italic>At</italic> SynCom inability to protect against wild-type R401 (R401wt) reported above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) was causally linked to R401 exometabolite-mediated inhibition of AtSC5 and AtSC6 members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A, B</xref>). These results show that protection by <italic>At</italic> SynComs depends on the absence of pyoverdine and DAPG production by R401, whereas protection by <italic>Lj</italic> SynComs occurs irrespective of their presence or absence. Based on these findings we conclude that there are SynCom-specific differences in the ability to restrict R401 root colonization and detrimental activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>R401-induced bacterial community shift is SynCom-dependent and requires DAPG and pyoverdine production</title><p id="P8">To assess R401-induced remodeling of SynCom composition <italic>in planta</italic>, we profiled bacterial community composition in Col-0 roots colonized by AtSC6 or LjSC6 one week after infection with either R401wt, R401mut, or a mock solution. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and subsequent beta-diversity analysis (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) revealed that R401wt-treated root samples differed from mock-treated and R401mut-treated samples, which cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). The R401wt-induced shift in SynCom composition was clearer for the AtSC6 community compared to LjSC6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A and B Fig</xref>; 32.8% with p=0.001 and 12.4% with p=0.12 of variance explained by R401-treatment, respectively, PERMANOVA), suggesting that LjSC6 is less affected by R401wt invasion than AtSC6. This differential impact of R401 on the communities observed <italic>in planta</italic> could be largely recapitulated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment with liquid cultures in which R401 was added either at culture start or to a stabilized SynCom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4 Fig</xref>), revealing that changes in composition were AtSC6-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A and B Fig</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that R401-induced bacterial community remodelling is largely host-independent and is therefore primarily explained by direct microbe-microbe competition.</p><p id="P9">We next calculated the relative abundance (RA) of individual strains within root-associated AtSC6 and LjSC6 and determined those strongly affected by R401. In AtSC6, strains AtRoot83 (<italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic>, log2 FC 2.19), AtRoot935 (<italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>, log2 FC 0.45), AtRoot101 (<italic>Intrasporangiaceae</italic>, log2 FC -0.49), AtRoot68 (<italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic>, log2 FC -0.38), and AtRoot142 (<italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic>, log2 FC 2.85) with RA &gt;1% were significantly affected by R401wt compared to mock treatment (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), and this effect was abolished when R401mut was used. In contrast, none of the LjSC6 strains were significantly affected by either R401wt or R401mut compared to mock-control samples. Inspection of R401 levels based on RA in root samples revealed that R401wt efficiently invaded roots pre-colonized by AtSC6, and this colonization phenotype was partially impaired for R401mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). This indicates that R401 requires production of DAPG and pyoverdine for invading AtSC6 and dominating in roots, consistent with results obtained with a soil-based gnotobiotic system and a different <italic>At</italic>-derived SynCom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, in contrast to these <italic>in planta</italic> observations, R401wt failed to become a stable member when added to already established liquid <italic>in vitro</italic> AtSC6 communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A Fig</xref>), which may suggest that the host environment constitutes a condition that provides a competitive advantage for R401, which, however, can be challenged by more competitive commensals. In contrast, both R401wt and R401mut failed to invade LjSC6 pre-colonized roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Taken together, these data indicate that R401-induced bacterial community shift (enabled through production of DAPG and pyoverdine) is required for R401 invasion, and that LjSC6 fully prevents R401 establishment on the roots likely due to the presence of specific strains competing with R401, thereby blocking its root invasion and preventing disease.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Swapping the <italic>At</italic>-SynCom <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> commensal with the <italic>Lj</italic>-SynCom strain confers protection against R401wt by AtSC6</title><p id="P11">We next aimed to narrow down which commensals of AtSC6 and LjSC6 drive R401 root colonization phenotypes and disease outcome. In the AtSC6 context, the RA of the <italic>At</italic> commensal <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain AtRoot68 was decreased in the presence of R401wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), and the opportunist was abundant and caused plant disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, AtRoot68 remained unaffected within AtSC6 when R401mut was used for infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). In the LjSC6 context, the RA of the <italic>Lj</italic> commensal <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain LjRoot59 was unaffected (<italic>in planta</italic>) or was strongly increased (<italic>in vitro</italic>), while R401wt levels stayed low and plants healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B Fig</xref>). Based on these observations, we suspected that competition between individual strains within the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus may determine the colonization success of R401 within a root-associated community. To test this hypothesis, we swapped the two commensal strains in the SynComs and found that LjRoot59 was indeed necessary and sufficient to drive SynCom protective function against R401wt <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A and B</xref>). Normal plant growth was detected after R401wt treatment when LjRoot59 was present in AtSC6 instead of AtRoot68, and plants wilted when AtRoot68 was present in LjSC6 instead of LjRoot59 or when no other strain was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A and B</xref>). Amplicon sequencing of root samples and quantification of bacterial RA further corroborated that the presence of LjRoot59 prevents R401wt from establishing as part of the community (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7 Fig</xref>). Given that plant performance was significantly better in the presence of LjSC6 even without LjRoot59 compared to axenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>), it is possible that other commensal strains within LjSC6 also contribute to protective activity towards R401 <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p id="P12">These results show that in taxonomically diverse root-associated communities, the colonization success of an opportunistic pathogen depends on the presence of another individual belonging to the same genus.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-mediated protection against R401 is strain-specific</title><p id="P13">Next, we tested 15 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> members of our two culture collections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Table</xref>) to investigate how general or specific the competition between the strains was. <italic>In vitro</italic> halo of inhibition assays showed that the growth of five strains, irrespective of their host origin, was inhibited by R401wt (including AtRoot68 but not LjRoot59), but not or partially by R401mut (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8 Fig</xref>). Conversely, five other isolates inhibited R401wt growth <italic>in vitro</italic> (not AtRoot68 or LjRoot59), and those five plus four more also inhibited R401mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, when plants were co-cultivated with these 15 commensal <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains separately, ten of them exhibited protection against R401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). This protective ability did not correlate with the host of origin of the strains, nor with their antagonism towards R401 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the phylogeny of the strains, which was based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the protection <italic>in planta</italic> (Pearson’s product-moment correlation 0.45, p=0.092; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 Table</xref>). Of note, two of the commensals phylogenetically close to R401, LjRoot54 and LjRoot154, were slightly detrimental on Col-0 based on the shoot appearance, however, not to the same extent as R401, and the disease phenotype did not become stronger upon R401 infection, indicating that they were still able to outcompete R401.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-mediated protection against R401 is predicted to occur via resource competition</title><p id="P14">The variation in the observed competitiveness of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains <italic>in planta</italic> could be a result of strain-specific variation of growth advantage and proliferation.

The number of these CGCs varied between 0 and 4 per compound across the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>).

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that plants benefit from accommodating a tailored subpopulation of micro-organisms. The microbial species may in turn experience an advantage from colonizing a plant species that provides a specific structural and chemical environment. In our study, we investigated if taxonomically diverse SynComs of different host origin were able to provide protection against the detrimental activity of the opportunistic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain R401 on roots of <italic>At</italic> Col-0.</p><p id="P19">We found that within a controlled agar-based growth system, the presence of <italic>Lj</italic>-derived SynComs prevented the plants from wilting after infection with R401, whereas taxonomically equivalent <italic>At</italic>-derived SynComs failed to do this efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). The disease phenotype correlated with a high detectable titer of R401 on the roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), which could be a result of antagonistic activity of the strain towards the commensals, rendering it more competitive and dominant. R401 was originally isolated from healthy-looking Col-0 plants as part of the <italic>At</italic> culture collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Its dominance is possibly more pronounced within the <italic>At</italic> SynCom since it may have developed a competitive advantage among other <italic>At</italic>-associated bacteria. Consistent with that, R401wt-induced remodelling of AtSC6 composition was directly linked to both invasion and disease and requires production of pyoverdine and DPAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Additionally, in a previous study and a similar experimental setup, R401wt root colonization was also only slightly restricted by commensal <italic>At</italic> SynComs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], although these SynComs consisted of only four members and did not contain <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains. However, since R401wt inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of both <italic>At-</italic> and <italic>Lj</italic>-derived diverse bacterial taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> antagonism is not sufficient to predict dominance <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p id="P20">Relative quantification of the bacteria within root-associated SynComs revealed the impact of R401 on the other community members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). A significant effect of R401 on a diverse 18-member SynCom has also been reported for a soil-based system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. In those experiments, however, no other <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain was included, and R401 did not cause wilting symptoms despite high relative abundance. Interestingly, in our system, the abundance of the commensal <italic>At Pseudomonas</italic> strain AtRoot68 was strongly decreased in AtSC6, and the <italic>Lj Pseudomonas</italic> counterpart LjRoot59 stayed unaffected, while R401wt failed to colonize within LjSC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Since here the <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic> members make up at least 30% of the abundance within the communities, we regarded this differential impact of R401wt as important. We suspected that intra-genus dynamics could play a decisive role for R401wt colonization success. Indeed, when testing the protective function of several individual <italic>At</italic> and <italic>Lj Pseudomonas</italic> isolates <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), we found that other <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> commensals were also capable of suppressing the detrimental effect of R401wt on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, this trait was independent of the strains’ origins, phylogeny, and <italic>in vitro</italic> antagonism towards R401wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). These results suggested that, besides the activity of secreted antimicrobial compounds, intra-genus competition may determine colonization success.</p><p id="P21">Besides direct antagonisms, competition for resources contributes to microbial population dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] when the amount of nutrients is limited, or when only certain types of nutrients are available. Organisms with a corresponding resource-usage profile then have a competitive advantage over those with more inapt profiles, and the latter could benefit from cross-feeding on metabolic products secreted by other species. In line with this, it was demonstrated for phyllosphere-associated microbiota members that bacteria-bacteria interaction outcomes <italic>in planta</italic> can be predicted by the carbon source utilization profiles combined with genome-based metabolic modeling of the strains and the overlap of those [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This study found mostly negative interactions between strains <italic>in vitro</italic>, which corresponded to niche overlap. An increase of positive interactions <italic>in planta</italic> (and other aspects not covered by the model) was explained by cross-feeding, additional metabolic preferences, signaling, host immune response, and fluctuating environmental conditions. Moreover, Pacheco-Moreno et al. recently inferred from the different gene sets of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains isolated from the rhizosphere of two different barley cultivars distinct bacterial preferences for primary plant metabolites, and linked those to the abundance of certain metabolites in the root exudates of the plant genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. When we inspected the genomes of our <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates, we found that strains with protective activity against R401 <italic>in planta</italic> possess similar catabolic gene clusters as R401 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 and S6 Tables</xref>), which may be a first prediction for a possible niche overlap also in our microbiota reconstitution system. In future experiments, the presence of the corresponding CGC-related compounds in root exudates and their role in competitive root colonization should be explored.</p><p id="P22">Host involvement in interactions between plants and diverse <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains has also been described for a phyllosphere community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In our study, R401wt and commensal dynamics are affected by the <italic>At</italic> host as well, since R401wt invasion of the root-associated AtSC6 was possible, whereas invasion within an established liquid community failed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>). The relevant plant factors remain to be shown, and likely comprise root-exuded compounds, including nutrients and signalling molecules that affect both the commensals and the detrimental strain, and parts of the plant immune system.</p><p id="P23">Our findings corroborate results from other studies on protective activities of commensal strains against pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria in roots, and this is often linked to microbe-microbe dynamics. For example, several studies with tomato and the bacterial wilt-causing strain <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> demonstrated that microbial competition can lead to the successful exclusion of this pathogen, e.g., correlating with the number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] and diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] of co-inoculated rhizobacterial strains and the number of utilized carbon sources. Using resource competition networks for SynComs of non-pathogenic <italic>Ralstonia</italic> spp., Wei et al. showed that, when all species can use resources similarly, and the resource niche overlaps with the pathogen’s, pathogen titer and thus disease decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Similarly, in the human gut, commensal bacterial strains only protected against pathogenic invaders if they, in combination with others, exhibit a community nutrient utilization profile that is competitive with the pathogen’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. However, if a single strain exhibits such a profile, it may be sufficient for this nutrient blocking. Importantly, our strain-swapping and -dropout experiments showed that LjRoot59 is sufficient to protect Col-0 from being colonized by R401wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). Of note, we cannot exclude that a combination of mechanisms, including resource competition, induction of host immune response, or <italic>in planta</italic> expression of antimicrobials may cause the restriction of R401wt root colonization. Nevertheless, our data indicates that even within a diverse community of different bacterial taxa, one specific strain with relevant properties can outcompete a detrimental one.</p><p id="P24">In addition to R401, other plant opportunistic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains have previously been isolated from healthy plants and other environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], supporting the idea that the microbiota members exert both antagonistic and competitive activities to keep the pathogen titers low in natural environments. For the detrimental strain N2C3 it was shown that, among diverse <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates, only highly related <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains protect <italic>At</italic>, and that they require a functional response regulator ColR that allows for root colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. In contrast to R401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), N2C3 keeps its colonization ability even in the presence of a protective strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], indicating different modes of competition of these two detrimental strains, although the different experimental setups may play a role as well. Interestingly, an avirulent mutant of the pathogen, in which the genes for the phytotoxic agent were deleted, was not able to protect plants against the wild-type strain, suggesting the requirement of additional genetic components, despite the already high phylogenetic similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, besides the intra-genus competition reported by us and by others, individual distantly related bacterial microbiota isolates have been shown to protect plants against pathogens, albeit through mechanisms other than direct resource competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In line with this, other taxa than <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic> may contribute to protective activity in our system as well, since LjSC6 leads to slightly better plant performance than axenically grown plants, even without the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> commensal LjRoot59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In summary, our experiments show that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative, either alone or within a taxonomically diverse microbial community. This is important because it may indicate that, in field settings under certain circumstances, i) the beneficial species can persist, and ii) the surrounding members can stabilize the community as a whole. Understanding such dynamics is crucial for engineering stable and beneficial microbial consortia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. The difference in relative abundance of certain commensals and opportunistic strains in a competitive situation is likely due to selective carbon source preferences and niche overlap. This concept provides important implications for sustainable agricultural processes. In further studies, especially in greenhouse or field conditions, testing the function of additional host-specific micro-organisms in protection of their host against other, non-adapted but detrimental microbial species will be necessary to determine generality of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Bacteria</title><p id="P26">All commensal bacteria were obtained from the <italic>At</italic>-RSPHERE and <italic>Lj</italic>-SPHERE culture collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].
