The origins of these biases remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identify PSC differentiation biases as arising from fluctuations in repressive and activating histone posttranslational modifications, leading to the acquisition of a caudal epiblast-like phenotype.</p><p id="P2">We present a novel approach to overcome this bias using a chemical chromatin restoration (CHR) treatment. This method restores transcriptional programs, chromatin accessibility, histone modification profiles, and differentiation potential, effectively recapitulating the competent anterior epiblast-like state. Furthermore, we propose that a high bivalency state is a defining feature of the anterior human epiblast. We suggest that fluctuations in histone modification marks drive epiblast regionalization, ultimately shaping cellular responses to differentiation cues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In the process of embryonic development a single cell generates the remarkably broad repertoire of tissues that build a fully formed body, and amongst them the most complex organ – the brain. In the primate embryo, after the inner cell mass of the blastocyst separates into epi- and hypoblast, the epiblast generates the amniotic cavity, and acquires a transient pluripotent state poised for generation of all three germ layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> The posterior part of the embryo is exposed to WNT signals that initiate primitive streak formation, whereas the periphery of the embryonic disc perceives BMP ligands from the amnion with which it is continuous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> The anterior part of the epiblast, however, is shielded from those patterning signals, and acquires the default fate of neural ectoderm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">When epiblast equivalent cells are cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> without any patterning factors they can form cerebral organoids, or, when presented with appropriate developmental cues, they can generate all other cell types of the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> However, both human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individual donors differ markedly in their capacity to differentiate into desired cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> The molecular underpinnings of this functional human PSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood, and this has been a major hurdle in PSC-based disease modelling approaches and regenerative cell therapies. Hypotheses to explain inter-individual PSC differentiation heterogeneity have mainly focused on genetic variation (both naturally occurring and acquired), and changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, as the primary drivers of differences in human PSC potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> However, accumulating evidence also shows that the precise developmental stage and state at which the differentiation cues are received plays a crucial role in defining human PSC differentiation outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Studies of mouse embryos demonstrated that even before pluripotency exit, epiblast cells show signs of regionalisation, and although all cells from mouse epiblast are still pluripotent, they show differentiation bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Interestingly, these features are preserved <italic>in vitro</italic>: mouse epiblast cells cultured in a dish show features of caudalisation and are incompatible with anterior neural fate unless Wnt signalling is inhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> However, if mouse cells are cultured from naïve conditions equivalent to the pre-implantation stage and then allowed to proceed to primed pluripotency <italic>in vitro</italic>, they can acquire either anterior neural fate or posterior neuromesodermal identities upon pluripotency exit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> This suggest that primed pluripotency is competent for antero-posterior patterning and that the A-P axis is established before germ layer specification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> However, whether regionalisation is mutually exclusive with pluripotency, how it affects the interpretation of developmental cues, and how the earliest mechanisms establish regional identity during early development remain to be elucidated.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we leverage the natural diversity between human PSC lines to investigate the mechanism of fate decisions around the peri-implantation epiblast regionalisation point to ask how this process underlies cell competency to generate anterior neural (ANE) tissues. Since the timing of cell fate transitions is preserved <italic>in vitro</italic>, we take advantage of the protracted transition from blastocyst to gastrulation in the human embryo to capture more subtle and gradual transition states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> Free of constraints and compensatory mechanisms present in natural embryos, and with hugely expanded analytical tools we can probe and dissect their precise identities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> We demonstrate that low ANE competency is associated with a posterior epiblast-like state, which at the molecular level is characterised by a locus-specific erosion of bivalent chromatin marks that leads to the aberrant expression of key developmental transcription factor genes. We further show that high chromatin bivalency is crucial for ANE specification and efficient development of other germ layers. Notably, we find that changes in bivalent chromatin at differentially expressed gene loci are largely uncoupled from changes in chromatin accessibility or DNA methylation.</p><p id="P7">Further, we establish a defined protocol that restores full PSC differentiation capacity in non-competent PSC lines by resetting their aberrant transcription and chromatin states. We predict that this approach will become instrumental for a broad range of PSC-based applications in developmental biology, disease modelling and regenerative medicine. Finally, we highlight the power of leveraging inter-individual genetic and epigenetic variation across the human population to decipher the signalling pathways and gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage specification during early human development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptomic differences underlying competency</title><p id="P8">To study ANE competency we selected a model of unguided cerebral organoids that faithfully recapitulates forebrain development from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). In this model, PSCs are aggregated into embryoid bodies, exit pluripotency upon withdrawal of TGFβ and FGF2 and self-organise into tissues closely resembling foetal dorsal telencephalon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> The cerebral organoid method is particularly sensitive to the quality of the starting PSC line and the differentiation outcomes are only partially improved by optimising PSC culture conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> To elucidate underlying features of PSCs that predict cerebral organoid generation success, or competency, we examined the transcriptomic landscape of a range of PSC lines. To ensure detection of cell-intrinsic differences, rather than differences due to culture conditions or other extrinsic sources of variation, we re-analysed single-cell (sc)RNA-seq data from cerebral organoids generated previously in our laboratory from a pool of human induced PSCs from healthy donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> in which the cells were cultured in the same dish before forming organoids. Within these mixed culture organoids, individual cell lines produced varying proportions of neural and non-neural identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">From these data, we were able to identify PSC lines that showed a clear ability to properly generate brain cells (deyz2, eesb1, fawm2, hehd1), demonstrating they were competent, while others generated mainly non-brain identities (burb1, cuhk2, feec2, fiaj1, sojd3), indicating they were non-competent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S A, B</xref>). We focused on cell lines with the highest proportion of cells represented in the scRNA-seq data, and analysed available bulk RNA-seq datasets for the PSC lines themselves to test for differences already present in the pluripotent state. To include a male karyotype not already present among the competent lines in our sample, we added data from kolf2 cells, previously demonstrated to be competent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> PCA analysis revealed separation of competent and non-competent lines that was most pronounced in the first principal component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and evident in the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S C</xref>). This demonstrated that transcriptomic differences between competent and non-competent cell lines already exist in the starting PSC culture.</p><p id="P10">To identify the particular genes and processes within PSC lines that contribute to competency, we performed DEseq analysis on 6 lines that showed the clearest phenotypes: 3 competent lines (eesb1, hehd1, kolf2) and 3 non-competent lines (feec2, fiaj1 and sojd3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). GO term analysis of genes upregulated in non-competent lines returned several biological process (BP) terms associated with embryonic patterning and differentiation, especially of the posterior structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Molecular function (MF) analysis pointed toward transcriptional regulators and in particular developmental transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We speculated that the aberrant expression of transcripts associated with body development might reflect a regional bias of the non-competent lines similar to the primitive streak bias of mouse EPiSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> To test this possibility, we turned to data from human embryos and stem cell embryo models (SEM). SEM data offer the possibility to capture stages of development when material would otherwise be difficult to access and where very limited cells are represented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> In particular, we were interested in examining the pre-gastrulation epiblast when the primitive streak anlage is first established. We cross-referenced the day 8 SEM data with an integrated scRNA-seq dataset of human embryos and a spatial transcriptome of human gastrula for cluster annotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> We identified 22 clusters using Leiden resolution of 1.2 that captured regionalisation of the epiblast cluster into two anterior subclusters (clusters 10 and 14) and three posterior subclusters (clusters 11, 12 and 22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S D</xref>). To identify parallels between PSC lines and different regions of epiblast we created pseudo-bulk data objects from these epiblast clusters 10, 11, 12, 14 and 22. We then performed dimensionality reduction analysis of the top 250 most variable genes. PC1 of our analysis captured the anterior to posterior gradient of the SEM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), and at the same time separated competent and non-competent lines, with the exception of kolf2. PC2 reflected the separation of PSC and SEM data. These data support a more caudal character of the non-competent lines.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Elevated endogenous WNT signalling in non-competent lines</title><p id="P12"><italic>In vivo</italic>, the establishment of the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is instructed by a Wnt signalling gradient, which in mouse occurs about one day before the appearance of the primitive streak. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments further confirmed that Wnt is sufficient for A-P regionalization and that the regionalisation occurs prior to germ layer specification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Because of the instructive role of Wnt in caudalising the embryo, we hypothesised that differences in competent and non-competent PSC lines might be due to differences in WNT activity.</p><p id="P13">Although our culture conditions were devoid of WNT ligands, endogenous WNT activity has been reported in human PSCs and was demonstrated to confound differentiation outcomes, in particular restricting anterior fate acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> To explore endogenous WNT signalling, we analysed expression of WNT ligands in our cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). WNT transcripts were generally expressed at very low levels but canonical WNT3 was higher in three of the non-competent lines and in the kolf2 line. Non-canonical WNT5A and B were expressed in all lines but at the highest levels in non-competent fiaj1 and sojd3 lines. Since A-P patterning results from canonical WNT signalling, we then explored expression of canonical WNT targets previously reported in human ES cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> We detected upregulation of all WNT-responsive transcripts in the non-competent feec2 line and higher abundance of HHEX, MIXL1 and GSC in the sojd3 and fiaj1 lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S F</xref>). Surprisingly, the competent kolf2 line also showed some degree of upregulation of WNT targets but in a pattern distinct to non-competent cells.</p><p id="P14">To test whether the endogenous WNT signalling in non-competent lines was the source of the posterior bias, we treated two of the non-competent lines, burb1 and sojd3, with the pan-WNT inhibitor IWP2 for 8 passages (4 weeks) while culturing on laminin 521 in Stemflex, and then generated cerebral organoids from them. We analysed the obtained tissues by immunofluorescence on days 10 and 20. One of the cell lines, burb1, showed improvement in the identity and morphology of the organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S G</xref>). The sojd3 line, however, did not show any improvement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 1S H</xref>), demonstrating that while spontaneous WNT activity may underly non-competence for some cell lines, its inhibition is not sufficient to restore competency more generally.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Chromatin accessibility differences between competent and non-competent lines</title><p id="P15">We next considered the possibility that the failure of WNT inhibition to restore competence may be due to an irreversible state of the cells, perhaps in the form of cellular memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> Exposure to WNT signal produces cellular memory that changes differentiation outcomes in micropatterned hPSC colonies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> We therefore hypothesised that a similar phenomenon could be responsible for the regionalisation of the non-competent cell lines, and that in the case of the IWP2 non-responsive line sojd3, the memory of WNT pre-exposure could not be erased simply by WNT inhibition.</p><p id="P16">The establishment and propagation of cellular memory often involves epigenetic changes at the chromatin level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> To investigate chromatin differences between competent and non-competent lines that could potentially explain the resistance of non-competent cells to WNT inhibition and other culture modifications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> we explored global chromatin accessibility. We performed ATAC-seq analysis of 4 non-competent lines and 4 competent lines. In general, chromatin accessibility was similar between all samples and almost identical in regions within +/- 5kb of transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating no differences in global chromatin accessibility. However, differential peaks revealed common trends among the non-competent compared with competent lines. Principal component analysis showed clustering of all 4 competent lines and 3 non-competent lines separately when 220,897 variable peaks were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Interestingly, the burb1 cell line clustered with the competent lines, perhaps reflecting its status as a line that is not irreversibly non-competent, as also demonstrated by its repair with WNT inhibition. However, because of this, it was omitted from the subsequent differentially accessible peak analysis. The patterns of differentially accessible peaks in competent and non-competent lines also confirmed that burb1 cells were more similar to competent cells than non-competent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To connect the changes in the chromatin accessibility with a biological function, we related differential peaks to the closest gene within 2kb downstream to identify more accessible promoters typically associated with active transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> Surprisingly, GO term analysis did not reveal any clear patterns in the differentially accessible promoters, as both more accessible in competent and more accessible in non-competent groups contained terms associated broadly with multiple system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). We then analysed the distribution of differentially accessible peaks, which showed that the vast majority localised to intergenic regions and introns, rather than promoters, pointing to putative regulatory elements (REs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We next performed motif enrichment analysis of differentially accessible peaks, which returned motifs specific to homeodomain, fork head (FOX) and SOX factors with important roles in organ development and tissue differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>). The binding of transcription factors to REs in the genome is crucial for orchestrating the complex expression patterns of developmental genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> Changes in RE accessibility drive cell fate transitions, ultimately shaping a unique enhancer landscape that defines cellular identity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> Notably, Wnt signaling promotes the activation of enhancers specific to caudal development, while non-gastrulating tissues maintain an enhancer landscape akin to that of the epiblast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> This distinction offers a plausible mechanism for WNT-mediated memory in non-competent lines and, corroborated by the differences in transcriptome and the effects of WNT inhibition, supports the hypothesis that non-competent lines may reflect a more posterior epiblast-like character even before pluripotency exit and onset of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Restoring uncommitted primed chromatin state</title><p id="P19">Since the differences between individual cell lines were retained at the chromatin level, we explored the possibility of restoring the chromatin landscape of non-competent lines to a competent state. Under natural circumstances chromatin remodelling associated with cell fate transitions is permanent and irreversible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, upon overexpression of individual or cocktails of transcription factors, exposure to undifferentiated cell cytoplasm or use of small molecules acting on chromatin modifiers, the cell chromatin and identity can be altered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> The global chromatin landscape is reset during reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and also in the transition from primed to naïve pluripotent state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> We reasoned that findings from the field of somatic cell reprogramming could inform strategies to restore a competent chromatin state in non-competent lines. From a practical standpoint, we aimed to establish a transgene-free approach that could be applied to a broad range of PSC lines. Such approaches have been successfully applied in resetting primed pluripotency to the naïve state and, more recently, in reprogramming somatic stem cells to pluripotent stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> We adapted part of a recently published stepwise method of chemical reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> The last step (Step IV) of this method reprograms extraembryonic-like POU5F1+ epithelial precursors to chemically induced PSCs and contains molecules that are also used for primed to naïve resetting, making it suitable to apply on already pluripotent cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> We first applied the unaltered Step IV of the Guan et al. method to our pluripotent cells. This produced viable colonies with typical PSC morphology; however, their cerebral organoid competency was not improved, and the derived lines produced disorganised tissues without typical neural buds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure S2 A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We therefore sought to develop a refined approach that is more specific to reversing the caudal epiblast chromatin landscape. Since the caudal epiblast is pre-determined to gastrulate, we analyzed the epigenetic changes underlying and potentially preceding gastrulation to determine which other aspects of chromatin we should target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> Step IV of the Guan et al. protocol already involved molecules that modify epigenetic regulators of gastrulation but with the exception of H3K9 methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> During gastrulation H3K9me3 is deposited in gene bodies, promoters and transcription termination sites, which in turn drive early endoderm and mesoderm germ layer specification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> In general, during cell fate transitions, H3K9 methylation represses lineage-specific promoters and enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.

Organoids generated with this method showed the correct morphology, correct marker expression and correct developmental progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We next tested whether this method is generally applicable to restore competency of other PSC lines. We applied the same treatment to the non-competent burb1 line, as well as hehd1 to assess any unwanted side effects of CHR on a naturally competent line. Organoids generated from colonies recovered after CHR treatment of burb1 and hehd1 lines were of high quality, confirming that CHR restored competency of burb1 to generate rostral neural structures, and that the competency of hehd1 cells was not compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We next asked whether CHR removed posterior bias and maintained general pluripotency or simply skewed differentiation potential towards anterior identities, by analyzing the pluripotency state of the CHR lines. To confirm pluripotency, we first looked at the expression of canonical pluripotency markers. All the CHR lines expressed the canonical pluripotency markers SOX2, OCT4 (POU5F1) and NANOG both at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 2S C</xref>), and also at the protein level as detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 2S D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To functionally confirm that the lines were able to differentiate into all three germ layers, we generated two more types of organoids: kidney - a mesoderm derivative, and intestine –an endoderm derivative. The hallmark of successful kidney organoid differentiation is epithelialisation of mesenchymal cells and generation of tubules, already visible on day 14 in phase contrast microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> We generated kidney organoids from all 4 CHR lines and their parental counterparts, and analysed resulting tissues for the presence of epithelial tubes.

We first analysed the chromatin accessibility pattern of CHR lines and their parental counterparts with ATAC-seq in the burb1, hehd1, fiaj1 and sojd3 lines. As expected, PCA revealed that the CHR lines clustered closer together with the naturally competent line hehd1 when 225,756 variable peaks were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 3SA</xref>). We then examined how regions differentially accessible between competent and non-competent lines behaved after chromatin restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). The accessibility of the peaks in CHR lines correlated with the accessibility in competent lines – peaks more accessible in competent lines were also more accessible after CHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas peaks less accessible in competent lines became less accessible with CHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the changes in burb1 were less profound than in fiaj1 and sojd3, in line with the fact that before treatment burb1 chromatin accessibility differed the least from competent lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The accessibility of chromatin in a naturally competent line hehd1 changed the least and when peaks differentially accessible between competent and non-competent cell lines were compared, the difference was minimal. This shows that for chromatin accessibility, the endpoint of CHR is similar irrespective of the chromatin landscape of the starting cell line, and in line with the functional outcome.</p><p id="P27">Analysis of the transcription factor binding motifs showed that the peaks that closed in restored lines were mainly enriched in the same class of motifs as those found in peaks more accessible in non-competent lines; predominantly the homeodomain and SOX-related transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>).

We performed bulk RNA-seq on all CHR lines and their parental counterparts, and included a naturally competent ES line, H9, for comparison.

Several hundred genes were up- or down-regulated in each of the non-competent lines after CHR treatment. We next identified the overlapping downregulated (core DE down) and upregulated genes (core DE up) shared between the burb1, fiaj1 and sojd3 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Comparison of DE genes between CHR and parental lines and competent and non-competent lines showed a high degree of consistency between transcript levels in CHR and competent lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 3S C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). When we interrogated the bulk RNA-seq dataset of competent vs non-competent cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), we found that the core DE down genes were also highly expressed in another non-competent line, feec2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 3S D</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Finally, we investigated whether the CHR process aligns with the epigenetic regionalisation that we postulated was ongoing in the non-competent lines.

Strikingly, core DE down genes were overrepresented in the posterior clusters 11,12 and 22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). We then generated pseudo-bulked objects of the relevant clusters of the SEM scRNA-seq dataset to perform PCA analysis together with all RNA-seq datasets used in this study so far (competent, non-competent and CHR lines). Dimensionality reduction analysis again showed that PC1 captured the anterior to posterior gradient of the SEM epiblast and revealed separation of competent, CHR and non-competent lines alongside the same axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). The anterior-most cluster 10 localised the closest to the competent and CHR lines, anterior cluster 14 occupied an intermediate territory, whereas posterior clusters 11,12 and 22 segregated with non-competent lines. Collectively this indicates that the transcriptomic differences between non-competent vs competent and parental vs CHR lines both capture the developmental oscillation around the antero-posterior epiblast regionalisation point.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CHR treatment restores bivalent histone marks</title><p id="P31">ATAC-seq analysis showed that the areas of differentially accessible chromatin between competent and non-competent lines localised to intergenic and intronic regions, consistent with regulatory elements, with only a minor fraction localised in promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, having identified the core genes whose expression was responsible for the caudalised phenotype, we investigated if promoter chromatin accessibility could explain the differences in their expression. We analysed chromatin accessibility in the promoters of core DE genes after CHR in burb1, fiaj1 and sojd3 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). To our surprise, we did not find a correlation between chromatin accessibility and transcript levels of differentially expressed genes, with only a few genes downregulated after CHR showing a more closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, when we looked at the individual ATAC-seq and RNA-seq tracks of the core DE genes, we noticed that although the RNA expression was markedly decreased after CHR, chromatin accessibility did not change substantially, and the promoter regions of DE genes still showed accessible conformation irrespective of transcriptional status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S A</xref>). This was consistent with the chromatin differences that determine competency mainly influencing distal RE but could not explain how the differences in expression of those genes are mediated at the chromatin level.</p><p id="P32">Many developmental genes with low DNA methylation and high chromatin accessibility show a bivalent signature of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) repressive and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) activating chromatin marks in their promoters that enables quick transcriptional activation upon initiation of differentiation programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> We therefore analysed H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications by CUT&amp;Tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> in parental and CHR lines. We first correlated core UP and DOWN regulated gene mRNA expression with intensity of signal for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in their promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In the CHR lines the core DE DOWN genes (blue datapoints) were enriched in H3K27me3 and depleted in H3K4me3 marks in comparison to their parental counterparts. On the other hand, core DE UP genes (red datapoints) showed H3K27me3 depletion and H3K4me3 enrichment. This effect was specific to the DE genes, since there was no global trend of enrichment or depletion of these chromatin marks in all expressed genes (grey datapoints). As expected, core DE genes did not show a shift of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 in the naturally competent line hehd1 after CHR treatment.</p><p id="P33">We next visualised chromatin mark changes at individual gene loci. The caudal patterning gene GBX2 exhibited decreased H3K27me3 and elevated H3K4me3 in the sojd3 parental cell line that was reversed upon CHR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Global analysis of H3K27me3 signal over the core downregulated genes in parental non-competent lines confirmed its depletion, particularly in the promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, CHR lines displayed H3K27me3 profiles more similar to naturally competent hehd1 and H9 lines. When the whole genome was analysed, parental fiaj1 and burb1 lines showed slightly lower global level of H3K27me3 in all the promoters than competent and CHR lines, whereas the difference was minimal in the parental sojd3 line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S B-C</xref>). H3K4me3 was enriched in the core DE DOWN genes in non-competent lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) but not globally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S B-C</xref>). The enrichment of H3K4me3 in promoter regions in core DE DOWN was the strongest in the sojd3 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Collectively this pointed to the expression of DE genes being regulated by the balance of H3K27me3 repressive marks and H3K4me3 activating marks, where low H3K27me3 and high H3K4me3 status predicted expression and competency.</p><p id="P34">Interestingly, we did not observe pronounced differences in DNA methylation in CHR vs parental lines nor in naturally competent vs non-competent lines, consistent with the notion that the differentially regulated regions were already hypomethylated and that the main regulatory mechanism works at the level of histone post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S D-H</xref>). When we focused on the genes downregulated in restored lines, we did not detect a clear trend of increased or decreased DNA methylation that would correlate with gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S F</xref>). Although some DNA regions became hypomethylated in the CHR cells, they were not consistent between cell lines and only 15 hypomethylated regions overlapped with core DE down genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure 4S G-H</xref>). Overall, we conclude that the loss of chromatin bivalency in a subset of developmental genes in the non-competent lines results in their aberrant expression that underpins the restricted potential in these lines.

Our study uncovers how initial epiblast regionalisation is encoded at the epigenetic level and is compatible with pluripotency maintenance. We experimentally establish that the genes involved in possible fate choices have high chromatin accessibility and are receptive to regulation by external signalling. These genes respond by balancing active and inactive chromatin marks around the point of bivalency to finally resolve the chromatin state in one of the directions. The correct pattern of bivalency is recognised as being crucial for pluripotency, and bivalency on key developmental genes is a predictor of differentiation capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> The balance of repressive and active chromatin marks therefore emerges as the most accurate predictor of gene activity, surpassing chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> whereas unguided cerebral organoid differentiation competency transpires as a readout of genuine pluripotency.</p><p id="P39">Interestingly, developmental genes that are targets for the PRC2 complex, the molecular machinery responsible for the repressive mark of bivalency H3K27me3, are the most variably expressed amongst PSC lines, often varying in different clones from genetically identical donors and showing little correlation with the genetic background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> This is in line with our conclusions that developmental genes are particularly sensitive to transient patterning signalling, which persistently changes proportions of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks, thus inducing lineage priming.</p><p id="P40">Since the lineage primed states are persistently encoded at the epigenetic level but do not dissolve the pluripotency network, they could explain the mechanism of non-genetic differentiation bias in cell lines that otherwise fulfil pluripotency criteria.

In this study, we demonstrate that the differentiation bias deposited in the form of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 imbalance can be reversed by the treatment with small molecules and maintained in the most competent (highest unbiased developmental potential) state by maintenance of pluripotent stem cell culture in conditions that minimise the strongest epiblast patterning signals, namely WNT and BMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup></p><p id="P41">The footprint of variable H3K27me3 reflects the past signalling pressure and provides a snapshot of the patterning milieu even before fate transition occurs.

Here, we demonstrate that a similar phenomenon in primed PSCs could be leveraged as a tool to probe the earliest effectors of differentiation by investigating a shift in H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks in promoters of the affected genes. This strategy allows the use of differential levels of bivalent marks to specify genes involved in early epiblast regionalisation.

The earliest decision is therefore a choice between gastrulation or maintenance of unchanged epiblast identity, with the latter being the default in the absence of signalling and permissive to anterior neural or brain fate. Interestingly, this initial asynchrony could be required to eventually align neural induction in the anterior and posterior epiblast to produce a continuous neural plate, whose induction through the neuromesodermal progenitor intermediate in the caudal embryo takes longer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup></p><p id="P43">A delay in fate transitions and maintenance of a developmentally early proliferative state has been described as a potential mechanism of expansion of the human forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> but an analogous delay could start even earlier in embryonic development. In this context the huge reliance of anterior neural fate on PRC2-maintained bivalency might be a trade-off of the evolutionary expansion of the anterior nervous system in higher vertebrates. The stable primed epiblast that is needed to grow a large forebrain would need to extend the time window of bivalency on key genes and resist posteriorizing signals.
