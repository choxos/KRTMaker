It is thought that during human development, nephrons form their proximal-distal axial polarity in response to collecting duct-derived signals that are absent in kidney organoids. To delineate how nephron polarities establish, we profiled human kidney development by spatial transcriptomic approaches. Our analyses describe a new axial polarity in the nephron and demonstrate that the nephron proximal-distal polarity develops adjacent to a transcriptional boundary in the collecting duct where non-canonical <italic>WNT11</italic> is downregulated and canonical <italic>WNT9B</italic> ligand is upregulated. The nephron region closest to this boundary in turn activates a series of canonical WNT target genes inferring positional nephron identities. To establish whether a canonical WNT source can improve organoid patterning to an <italic>in vivo</italic>-like state, we bioengineered self-organizing WNT-secreting synthetic organizers. Organizer-coupled kidney organoids respond to WNT ligands by forming expression gradients and developing distal cell identities. Tuning the WNT dose produced nephrons with continuous patterning along the proximal-distal axis. Strikingly, polarized iPSC-derived nephrons directed their distal tubules towards the WNT-source, indicating axial patterning and morphogenetic programs are tuned by WNTs from the synthetic organizers. Our data present a strategy to control organ patterning, build an artificial kidney, and highlights the power of synthetic organizer systems for advancing organoid models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Kidney organoids generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a promising source of synthetic kidney tissue to solve the scarcity of donor kidneys available for transplantation. To reach clinical relevance, kidney organoids must generate patterned nephrons that filter blood in renal corpuscles, reabsorb electrolytes in proximal convoluted tubules, regulate water and concentrate urine in the loop-of-Henle and distal tubules prior to draining into a collecting duct. However, current kidney organoids contain nephrons that display limited maturation of distal cell types, and incomplete proximal-distal (PD) patterning. This suggests that organoid derivation methods can be modified to include key mechanisms and tissues responsible for nephron patterning and kidney development, steps that would broaden the potential of organoid nephrons as therapeutics.</p><p id="P3">Nephron patterning arises during kidney organogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Kidneys develop from reciprocal interactions between the collecting duct (CD) and the metanephric mesenchyme that contains nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and stromal populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Throughout kidney development the forming nephron and CD develop in contiguity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> for a schematic). The developing CD consists of molecularly distinct tip (<italic>WNT11<sup>+</sup></italic>) and stalk (<italic>WNT9B</italic><sup>+</sup>) populations, containing CD progenitors and their progeny, respectively. NPCs marked by SIX2, CITED1, MEOX1, and PCDH15, are found surrounding CD tips and undergo balanced self-renewal and differentiation in response to CD stalk-derived WNT9B ligands that activate β-catenin signaling in NPCs to initiate nephrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Nephron formation is first observed as a stream of NPCs that exit their tip niche, downregulate <italic>SIX2</italic> and condensate into pre-tubular aggregates (PTA; expressing <italic>WNT4, FGF8</italic> and <italic>LHX1</italic>) under each CD tip <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The PTA develops into a lumenized renal vesicle (RV) with polarized <italic>JAG1</italic> and <italic>CDH1</italic> expression towards the CD stalk as more NPCs are gradually recruited to the opposite end of the RV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The RV thereafter develops into Comma- and S-shaped body nephrons (CSB and SSBs, respectively) that adopt distal (<italic>POU3F3, TFAP2A, MECOM, SOX9, CDH1</italic>), medial (<italic>IRX1, JAG1</italic>), proximal (<italic>HNF4A</italic>) and podocyte (<italic>MAFB, WT1</italic>) segments; these identities reflect their relative time of arrival into the forming nephron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Our studies in mice have shown that the distal nephron is marked by high β-catenin activity and manipulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to expansion of distal segments at the expense of medial and proximal segments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Given the spatial relationship between the forming nephron and the CD, and Wnt and β-catenin components controlling distal nephron development and nephrogenesis, it has been hypothesized that the Wnt-expressing CD serves as a signaling organizer for the nephron. Whether this holds true in the developing human kidney remains unknown.</p><p id="P4">Several kidney organoid models describe how to generate kidney cell-types by mimicking a developmental progression from pluripotency to metanephric mesenchyme-like cell states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Their strengths are in their relatively rapid timeline. Nephrons form between 10 and 15 days from cells leaving pluripotency. However, off-target cell-populations are frequently reported, and the forming nephrons display limited maturation and function compared to adult <italic>in vivo</italic> nephrons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These organoid models typically lack a CD epithelium which can be derived from an anterior intermediate mesoderm lineage through separate differentiation protocols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Instead, nephron differentiation is induced by pulsing the organoids with a WNT/β-catenin agonist <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In the Takasato protocol this occurs 3 days prior to the formation of nephron-like structures, and organoid nephrons therefore organize without a CD and its secretome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Determining whether kidney organoid nephrons can be locally controlled by CD-derived signals to generate normally axial PD patterning is therefore an important goal. Controlling patterning in other organoid models has been attempted with microfluidics delivery of growth factors and growth factors from cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Recently, cell-based signaling centers have been used to pattern embryoid bodies (EBs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> in mESC and hiPSC derived brain organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These foundational studies show that delivery of growth factors from adjacent cell sources can initiate and locally pattern regions of stem-cell-derived constructs. However, whether these approaches can finely pattern human organoids and mimic cellular-scale morphological and patterning features as seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, is not yet determined.</p><p id="P6">We hypothesized that recapitulating the CD-to-nephron signaling relationship in kidney organoids can normalize organoid nephron patterning. Here we first resolve the spatial transcriptional landscape of the developing human kidney and show nephrons possess a novel axial polarity. We show that nephrons develop adjacent to the transition point where CD precursors exit their <italic>WNT11</italic><sup>+</sup> niche and differentiate into CD stalk (<italic>WNT9B</italic><sup>+</sup>). Nephron cells adjacent to this transition express canonical WNT targets, form a distal nephron identity, and ultimately connect to the CD epithelium to form a luminal connection that enables drainage of urine into the CD. Detailing the nephron transcriptional profile demonstrates that the process of nephrogenesis occurs via an inherently asymmetric mechanism. Nephrons first develop a CD-<underline>a</underline>djacent to CD-<underline>d</underline>istant (AD) axial polarity that presages nephron anatomies and formation of its known PD axial polarity. Comparative analyses between kidneys and organoids reveal that organoids lack a canonical WNT signal input but can respond to WNT-secreting synthetic organizer cells. Coupling organoid nephrons with synthetic organizers drives a canonical WNT response, promotes distal nephron differentiation programs, and strikingly generates a morphogenetic response in nephrons prompting them to orient their elongating axes towards the WNT source. Our data highlight a strategy to engineer axial asymmetry and patterning in kidney organoids, control differentiation programs, and pave the way towards artificial kidneys that connect to an artificial epithelium and drain urine.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cross-lineage communication correlates with nephron polarization and morphogenesis in the human developing kidney</title><p id="P7">To scrutinize signaling interactions within the forming human nephron and its niche, we performed spatial transcriptional analyses using Xenium and seqFISH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, mapping the expression of hundreds of genes at two stages of kidney development rich in nephron formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S1</xref>). We analyzed the expression of known and putative WNT target genes in relationship to WNT ligands and markers of cell types present in the developing kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). Given that nephrons develop asynchronously and continuously across the developing kidney cortex, this allowed us to simultaneously observe all stages of early nephrogenesis. Our observations, described below, led us to hypothesize that the WNT expressing interface of the CD functions as a <italic>de facto</italic> organizer of the forming nephron during its aggregation and formation of the nephron axial polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The first stage of nephrogenesis, the PTA, is an approximately 75 μm wide cell-aggregate which forms within 3 to 4 cell distances of the point where CD progenitors (<italic>WNT11</italic><sup>+</sup>) transition into CD stalk (<italic>WNT9B</italic><sup>+</sup>); marked with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>. We have previously shown that mesenchymal NPCs migrate and gradually integrate into the forming PTA and RV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Here, we noticed that NPCs outside the PTA demonstrate polarized abundance of transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2a</xref>). A CD-adjacent stream of NPCs (<italic>ELAVL4</italic><sup>high</sup>/<italic>FGF8</italic><sup>high</sup>), and a CD-distant stream (<italic>ELAVL4</italic><sup>low</sup>/<italic>FGF8</italic><sup>low</sup>) can be distinguished compared to other NPC markers (<italic>PCDH15</italic> and <italic>MEOX1</italic>) that are expressed equally in the CD-adjacent and CD-distant NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2b</xref>). The CD-adjacent stream connects to the PTA immediately next to the CD while the CD-distant stream connects to the PTA one cell layer away from the CD. The distribution bias for <italic>FGF8</italic> and <italic>ELAVL4</italic> is evident in both week 13 and 16 kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The distribution of <italic>ELAVL4</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic> become progressively more biased towards the CD-adjacent NPCs between week 13 and 16, while <italic>MEOX1</italic> and <italic>PCDH15</italic> remain equal in CD-adjacent and CD-distant NPCs. The broader distribution is likely a consequence of the thicker NPC layers present at week 13 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> that thin during development. The local maxima of <italic>FGF8</italic> and <italic>ELAVL4</italic> near the CD-epithelium indicate that their expression is induced in response to a polarized CD-derived signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2a,b</xref>). Cells at the site of active recruitment in both streams (indicated as the end of the dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>, right most spatial transcriptomic panel) are <italic>WNT4<sup>low</sup></italic>, forming further evidence for the PTA being asymmetric. These observations support a scenario by which the 2 streams of nephron progenitors form conveyor-belts of cells that set up an intrinsic asymmetry in the epithelializing nephron polarized along a ‘<italic>CD adjacent</italic>’ to ‘<italic>CD distant</italic>’ axis.</p><p id="P9">The PTA consists of a group of cells morphologically distinct from NPCs. PTAs demonstrate distinctly polarized gene expression depending on cells’ position relative to the <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> transition point. The cells of the PTA closest to the <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> transition point and along the <italic>WNT9B</italic><sup>+</sup> CD-adjacent surface of the PTA upregulate WNT-β-catenin targets <italic>FGF8, LHX1, JAG1, EMX2, WNT4</italic> whereas NPC marker genes <italic>PCDH15</italic>, and <italic>MEOX1</italic> are gradually reduced in CD-adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c-d</xref>). These data indicate the PTA forms asymmetrically and from the outset contains cell subdivisions. PTAs progress to develop into RVs, epithelial pear-shaped cysts with an oblong distal domain extending in the direction of the elbow of the CD stalk, the whole structure approximately 100 μm long. At this stage, the NPC stream appears as a single file of cells that connects with the proximal CD-distant end of the RV, s the distal RV remains in tight association with the CD <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> transition point (marked with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>). While the distal-most region thus remains in a fixed position, gene expression-wise, the RV has grown and patterned, forming a distal region (also known as connecting tubule, <italic>GATA3</italic><sup>+</sup>), an expanding medial domain (<italic>JAG1+, HNF1B+</italic>), and a proximal domain (<italic>WT1</italic><sup>+</sup>), where NPCs are recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2c</xref>). The emerging connecting tubule and distal-medial domains are simultaneously patterned along their AD and PD axes, and the CD-adjacent RV surface displays polarized expression of <italic>WNT4, FGF8, LHX1, and EMX2</italic> towards the <italic>WNT9B<sup>+</sup></italic> source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To better define the CD-adjacent to distant transcriptional asymmetry we spatially mapped <italic>WNT4</italic> expression in the RV relative to the CD tip-stalk transition point. To do this, we performed RNA scope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization against <italic>WNT4, WNT11</italic>, and <italic>WNT9B,</italic> and immunolabeled KRT8 (marks CD and distal nephron) to define cell boundaries and <italic>WNT4</italic> expression. <italic>WNT4</italic> transcripts were asymmetrically distributed towards the <italic>WNT9B<sup>+</sup>/</italic>KRT8<sup>+</sup> CD stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f</xref>). Quantification of the spatial distribution of <italic>WNT4</italic> puncta shows high <italic>WNT4</italic> near the <italic>WNT9B</italic> source and low <italic>WNT4</italic> in cells further from the <italic>WNT9B</italic> source at the site of NPC recruitment and the CD distant domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f</xref>). These data confirm the existence of a CD distant-adjacent axis in the RV.</p><p id="P11">After initial asymmetry forms in the RV, it develops into the CSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2d</xref>) and thereafter the SSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2e</xref>) nephron stages. Throughout this process, the nephron remains defined by the <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> transition point in the CD. The CSB nephron elongates along its PD axis and is a transitory stage to the more elaborately patterned SSB. CSB cells nearest the CD <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> transition, now form the connecting tubule precursor domain, which is characterized by downregulation of <italic>WNT4</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic>, and expression of <italic>GATA3, POU3F3, and TFAP2A</italic>. While some <italic>WNT4</italic> transcripts remain in those cells, the <italic>WNT4</italic> expressing domain shifts proximally along the length of the CD-adjacent nephron abutting the <italic>WNT9B</italic> source. <italic>EMX2, TFAP2A, POU3F3</italic>, remain high, while genes marking later nephron precursor specification (<italic>IRX1, MAFB, WT1</italic>) are emerging or defining small subset cells in the medial, podocyte, and parietal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>). Other more mature markers such as PTPRO (podocyte) and HNF4A/G (proximal) have not yet been activated. As the nephron then transitions to the SSB, it adopts new morphological features of convolution, particularly the deep glomerular cleft but also the separation of the distal and medial domains. The SSB is characterized by <italic>WNT4</italic> expression that now only persists in the region most closely adjacent to the WNT9B source. This domain is the <italic>HNF4A/G</italic><sup>+</sup> proximal precursor (pP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S2e</xref>). Several putative precursors of specific nephron sub-populations have developed by the SSB stage, marked by expression of (<italic>GATA3<sup>+</sup>/SALL3<sup>+</sup>/POU3F3<sup>+</sup>/TFAP2A<sup>+</sup></italic>) in the connecting tubule precursors (pCNT) which is now connected to the CD via a patent luminal connection, (<italic>GATA3<sup>low</sup>/TFAP2A<sup>+</sup></italic>) in distal precursors (pDT), (<italic>IRX1<sup>+</sup>/PAPPA2<sup>+</sup></italic>) in loop of Henle and macula densa precursors (pLOH/pMD), proximal precursors (pP) (<italic>HNF4A/G<sup>+</sup>/HNF1B</italic><sup>+</sup>), parietal epithelium precursors (pPE - not defined in figure), and podocyte precursors (pPod) (<italic>MAFB<sup>+</sup>/PTPRO</italic><sup>+</sup>). These morphogenetic steps are now defined at high resolution via spatial transcriptomic analyses and revealing the stepwise patterning of the developing human nephron.</p><p id="P12">To provide an independent assessment of the hypothesis that the <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> junction functions as a point of reference and organization for early nephrogenesis, we scrutinized single-cell sequencing data (scRNA-seq) from kidneys temporally matched with our spatial transcriptional data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>).

The <italic>WNT9B</italic>-expressing CD cell cluster “cd1” is predicted to be the ligand-producing cells that target PTA and RV populations “n10” and “n12”, enriched in expression of FZD receptors, through a canonical WNT signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1j,k</xref>). Consistent with that prediction is the expression of <italic>WNT9B</italic> and <italic>WNT4</italic> in cd1 and n10/12, respectively, setting up the WNT9B driven canonical response (<italic>WNT4</italic>) in the PTA and RV. Receiver cells in n12 correspond to early distal progenitors positive for <italic>POU3F3</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>. Based on these analyses, there is a collective view emerging predicting a canonical WNT interaction between <italic>WNT9B</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the CD and <italic>WNT4</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the PTA that is sustained in the RV stage.</p><p id="P13">Our data therefore suggest that <italic>WNT9B</italic> from the ureteric stalk acts as a short-range morphogen driving gene expression in NPCs, and the PTA and RV.

On day 7, the 2D cell layers are transitioned into 3D discs cultured in transwell filters at the air-liquid interface and pulsed with CHIR for 1 hour, and thereafter maintained in FGF9 to promote cell survival until day 12, after which organoids are kept in basal media to enable nephron formation and patterning.</p><p id="P15">Rosettes of WT1<sup>+</sup> cyst-like structure of around 35-45 μm in diameter, reminiscent of PTAs, are visible at differentiation day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>), indicating that nephron precursors begin to epithelialize 3 days after pulsing with CHIR.

To do so, we coupled kidney organoids with iWnt-SOs at day 12 when organoid nephrons begin to polarize along their PD axes. These organizer-to-organoid coupled tissues were cultured in media with varying amounts of dox, thus inducing increasing levels of Wnt ligands from the organizer cells. After 48h of culture in these conditions, we profiled nephron axial polarities by immunofluorescent stains for nephron patterning markers POU3F3 (distal), EMX2 (distal transcription factor), JAG1 (distal/medial), DLL1 (medial/proximal Notch ligand), and WT1 (proximal). EMX2 and DLL1 were selected as are highly sensitive markers for cells responding to constitutive Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2g</xref>). iWnt3a-SOs drove a dosage-dependent upregulation of WNT/β-catenin and nephron distal patterning markers EMX2 and POU3F3 and induced morphological changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>). To define patterning and morphogenetic responses, we assayed the distribution of EMX2 and POU3F3 by measuring the polarization of markers within individual nephron tubules relative to the position of the organizer (similarly to how we established <italic>in vivo</italic> nephron axial asymmetry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). The position of these distal markers was enriched in the part of the nephron closest to the organizer.

In addition, DLL1 was similarly upregulated in a dosage dependent manner, whereas proximal marker WT1 was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3f-h</xref>).

To do so, given the requirement for RSPO-1 to enable iWNT9B organizers to drive a canonical signaling response in adjacent cells, we built a WNT9B/RSPO-1 matrix of culture condition to expose organoid nephrons to varying dosages of each. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3i-l</xref>, and similarly to iWnt3a results, overall presence of both RSPO-1 and WNT9B resulted in upregulation of DLL1 and JAG1, and downregulation of proximal marker WT1. In these experiments, we noticed that nephrons were highly sensitive to changes in WNT9B and RSPO-1: DLL1 is virtually absent in organoids where <italic>WNT9B</italic> is not induced (0nM dox column) but becomes strongly upregulated in 5nM dox <italic>WNT9B</italic> induction at any RSPO-1 dosage. A higher DLL1 increase was observed at 5nM dox with 100ng/mL RSPO-1 compared to the 50nM dox equivalent, an effect lost at the 500ng/mL RSPO-1 dose.

In control SO-conjugated organoids, nephrons positioned under organizers developed normal renal corpuscles (strong apical ZO-1), and short distal tubules (POU3F3<sup>+</sup>), similar to other regions of the organoids distant from the organizer.

Only in intermediate Wnt3a doses did HNF4A+ and large POU3F3<sup>+</sup> segments form immediately adjacent to the organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>), Similarly, at intermediate Wnt3a doses renal corpuscles formed adjacent to the organizer but their development was suppressed by high Wnt3a doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig.S8d</xref>).

This is configured as NPCs positioned around the CD tip undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition to generate nephrons and thereafter the axis persists through the stereotyped developmental morphogenetic steps of the PTA, RV, CSB, and SSB impacting adult nephron morphologies and function. Our spatial transcriptional analyses show that a CD <italic>adjacent-distant</italic> (AD) polarity precedes the formation of the PD polarity. The AD polarity initially traverses the partially epithelialized PTA and can be defined in the PTA by how cells are positioned in relation to the WNT11/WNT9B transition point and the WNT9B<sup>+</sup> CD surface (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Subsequent to PTA stages, the CD-adjacent domains define the nephron epithelium that is adjacent to the WNT9B<sup>+</sup> CD stalk as the RV and CSB grows and elongate and the SSB folds into its typical structure. Adding the AD axis as a reference point to describe nephrogenesis assists us in defining gene expression patterns and areas of the forming nephron and it integrates with the proposed gradual recruitment model and a time-dependent mechanism dictating nephron fate specification through sequential activation of signaling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">Providing a new term to an existing language model will create discussion on whether current nomenclature suffice. We anticipate that the AD axis will be welcomed as the kidney organoid field tackles questions on how to replicate stereotyped developmental steps <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, it assists with changing misconceptions about the PTA. The PTA has long been described as entirely non-epithelial, but its nature is nuanced and consists of partially epithelial cells in CD adjacent positions that epithelialize and asymmetrically upregulate gene expression while new NPC recruits are slotted into the forming nephron; a process intrinsically linked to cell recruitment and gradual formation of spatial positional identities. Given that this asymmetry appears to play a crucial role in nephron patterning and therefore acquisition of physiologies, we find it to be necessary to consider.</p><p id="P40">Is the AD axis temporary during nephrogenesis? While the precursor-progeny relationships of AD axial positions need to be defined in future experiments, our data shows that molecularly distinct AD regions are prominent in the RV, CSB, and SSB, thus making it hard to envisage how SSB and subsequent nephron patterning are not influenced by this polarity. Putative precursors can be defined by it. For instance, in the SSB we detect a secondary upregulation of <italic>WNT4</italic> in CD-adjacent proximal precursors; an expected find as we have previously shown <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of this domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, the dynamics of WNT4 illustrates the asymmetry of the nephron and puts forward an explanation for why podocytes are mosaically labeled with <italic>Wnt4<sup>Cre</sup></italic> fate mapping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Low expression of WNT4 in CD-distant cells is a likely reason for previously observed incomplete <italic>Wnt4 <sup>Cre</sup></italic> mediate recombination in CD-distant podocytes, while other nephron segments are robustly labeled with Cre-dependent reporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, an AD axis also begins to shed light on the chirality of SSBs, as one axis is insufficient, but two axes can define chiral structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P41">The perhaps most obvious reason for why an AD axis is required can be demonstrated by a simple visualization. Picture the SSB, rotate it on its AD axis, and imagine how it now connects with the CD and forms podocytes in close contact with a developing macula densa - a hard feat. We now need to define AD fate-maps, better understand AD spatial transcriptional signatures in three dimensions, and determine the downstream functional significance of this interesting axis.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Building an artificial kidney</title><p id="P42">A cell derived kidney suitable for replacement therapies should be connected to a vascular in and output, contain a physical filter, perform solute reabsorption, and lead unwanted solutes and metabolites to a drainage system. The latter function is normally performed by a luminal connection between the distal end of the nephron and the CD. Given that this is a critical requirement for function, we therefore sought to delineate how the distal nephron is polarized towards the CD and replicate this in an organoid model with a view to develop an approach for channeling urine in an artificial kidney.</p><p id="P43">To control nephron patterning in hiPSC kidney organoids we introduced WNT-secreting cellular organizers to replace CD-derived WNT9B ligands. This drove distalization and physical nephron alignment towards the WNT source. The concept of organizers has been one of the most powerful developmental biology concepts since the Spemann/Mangold organizer experiments. Although replicating sources of morphogenetic factors with beads and ectopic tissue has been performed before <italic>in vivo</italic> and in organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, it is only recently that there have been attempts to generate synthetic organizers made of cells. In these studies, organizing cells are placed in the context of a stem-cell derived construct, where they instruct polarization and cell fate changes. In our study, we utilized self-organizing HEK clusters that overexpress cadherin, possibly contributing to their compactness and capacity to stay coherent when integrated in the organoids. In fact, using hiPSC organizer cells resulted in integration of the hiPSC ‘organizer’ cells in the rest of the organoid, generating a chimeric structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Here, the organizer cells do not lose compaction and stay a separate entity compared to the organoid. This allows the organoid cells to continue their developmental trajectory without being invaded by organizer cells. In the later days of the organoid/organizer co-cultures, we could observe that the nephron tubules extend towards the organizers, and burrow into the organizer itself, as if they were reaching out to connect to a structure in an attempt to make epithelial connections. In future experiments it will be important to develop organizer cells of an CD-like epithelial nature, to engineer a continuous lumen between CD and nephron.</p><p id="P44">In our hands, providing organoid nephrons with WNT secreting organizers distalized nephrons. This demonstrates that human iPSC derived nephrons respond to canonical WNTs by upregulating a transcriptional response akin to that expected <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it is surprising that we found no evidence for an endogenous canonical WNT ligand-receptor pairing in control organoids during the timeframe when nephrons form and pattern. As part of the standard differentiation protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> cells are pulsed with GSK3β- inhibitor CHIR at day 7 and nephrons emerge 3 days later at day 10. There is therefore a discrepancy between when β-catenin signaling is driven and when nephrons form, and the timing disagrees with a proposed <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental timeline for the PTA-RV progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> during days 10-14, expression of <italic>WNT4</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic> (thought to be direct β-catenin targets) was low by bulk RNA sequencing (samples sequenced to ~20M reads) and by single cell RNA sequencing (~2500-4000 genes per cell). We therefore considered neither to be actively expressed. How then do nephrons form? In mice, ectopic Notch signaling can compensate in Wnt-deficient backgrounds when a dominant active Notch intracellular domain is overexpressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments in mice have also shown that the nephrogenesis and activation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Lhx1</italic> require expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In metanephric mesenchyme knockouts of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, NPCs aggregate into PTAs and RVs but lack <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Lhx1</italic> expression indicating Fgf8 is required during canonical Wnt activation or prefigures NPCs to be response. In recent work removing <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the NPC population, the NPCs are loosely packed but consistent with the full metanephric mesenchyme knockouts, removing <italic>Fgf8</italic> using either Pax8 or Wnt4 Cre lines shows PTAs still form <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This agrees with our <italic>in vivo</italic> human results where FGF8 is present in the NPC population and is enriched in the CD-adjacent cells and <italic>FGF8</italic> expression precedes broad activation of WNT4 in the PTA, in CD-adjacent cells at the WNT11/WNT9B transition point. While this is therefore consistent with FGF8 contributing to cell aggregation it also demonstrates that it is unlikely to be an absolute requirement.</p><p id="P45">Since Notch is not directly manipulated here, <italic>FGF8</italic> is not detected using the methods we describe, and cells still aggregate and form PTAs, could they drive nephrogenesis through a Notch-dependent compensatory mechanism? Notch pathway and target genes (e.g., JAG1 and HES1) are expressed during the day 10-12 timeframe and delineating whether Notch can compensate for a lack of WNT input during organoid nephrogenesis should a focus of future studies that determine how to improve <italic>in vitro</italic> nephrogenesis and patterning. Of note, while we do not detect canonical WNT ligands in organoids, we did detect increased expression of WNT pathway modifiers <italic>SFRP1, SFRP2, DKK1, DKK3</italic> between days 10 and 12. These are genes often associated with β-catenin signaling and it remains possible that a basal level of canonical WNT signaling is occurring that we cannot detect with current methods. However, given that the organoids displayed expression of WNT receptors and co-receptors we favor the hypothesis that they are prefigured to receive a canonical WNT, do not normally do this due to the lack of ligand inputs, and are highly when ectopic WNTs are provided. These responses are possible to detect using the methods used in this study.</p><p id="P46">In addition to the transcription response, we also showed that organoid nephrons align their epithelial axes towards the WNT source. Activation of β-catenin in NPC culture settings <italic>in vitro</italic> has shown that this is sufficient to drive a cell aggregation program similar to that observed during NPC aggregation into PTAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. NPCs with activated β-catenin signaling become more motile and adhesive to other differentiating NPCs. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the NPCs move over distance to leave the NPC niche and join each forming nephron. As outlined above, the dynamics of <italic>FGF8</italic> expression together with phenotypes makes this an unlikely candidate for being the NPC chemoattractant. Our data raises the possibility that a canonical WNT acts as one of the attractive signals that coax NPCs to leave their niche and aggregate, but it does not explain how NPCs are recruited from the NPC niche into the proximal ends of forming RVs (where there is no or little WNT9B). NPC behavior is highly dynamic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and they are capable of extending long cellular processes from their positions within the NPC niche to forming nephrons; indicating they respond to a long-range chemotactic signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The alignment of organoid nephrons to the WNT source suggests that WNT9B can act as a chemoattractive signal and simultaneously regulates a transcriptional distalizing program. From the perspective of engineering a cell-derived artificial kidney, the duality of one signal driving two processes would be advantageous as it can be used to drive distal nephrons towards defined positions in a common epithelial drainage system.</p><p id="P47">It is interesting to note as it could constitute an example for other attempts to “fix” organoid patterning, that rationale was lent to this synthetic organizer approach from our <italic>in vivo</italic> spatial transcriptional analyses. These analyses of human developing kidney show that β-catenin mediated transcription is polarized to those nephron cells adjacent to the <italic>WNT9B</italic> source. Human orthologs of previously proposed canonical WNT targets e.g., <italic>Emx2, Fgf8, Jag1, Lhx1, Gata3, Wnt4</italic>, and <italic>Lef1</italic> are expressed in that domain, and these <italic>in vivo</italic> human data agree with strong evidence for crosstalk between the CD and nephron derived from mouse studies. In mice, <italic>Wnt9b</italic> is produced in the CD and genetic studies show it is required in the nephron lineage, mediating NPC self-renewal, differentiation, and nephron formation, cell-fates, as well as for the maintenance of nephron planar cell polarity in maturing nephron tubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. In our past work we have shown that manipulation of the early mouse nephron with Wnt agonists or antagonists distalizes and proximalizes nephrons, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which is in line with evidence from the chick mesonephros, where mesonephric tubules suppress podocyte development and reorienting nephron PD axes in response to Wnt3a expressed in the chick embryo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Further, these nephron patterning effects can at least partially be mimicked in hiPSC organoids through positive and negative regulation of β-catenin signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Our spatial transcriptional data therefore confirm that this WNT9B to nephron cross-lineage signal transduction is likely in the human nephrogenic niche and overcome past limitations of predictions made from single cell RNA sequencing data where spatial data has been missing. This indicates that this pipeline of identifying polarizing activities in human development that are missing in organoids, and reconstituting them in organoids with synthetic organizers, is a viable strategy to correct organoids patterning.</p><p id="P48">Here we propose that nephrons possess a previously undefined axial polarity, show its relationship to a cell organizer in vivo, and demonstrate that we can reconstitute these patterning and morphogenetic events in stem cell derived nephrons via synthetic cell organizers.

Transcript positions were quantified using R-studio and Fiji to examine transcript coordinates relative to the collecting duct tip and stalk using <italic>WNT11</italic> and <italic>WNT9B</italic> as markers.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>RNA scope and quantification of WNT4 polarity</title><p id="P61">Whole kidneys fixed and prepared as for spatial transcriptional analyses were processed for RNA scope as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. RNAscope images of 8 renal vesicle-staged nephrons stained for <italic>WNT4, WNT11, WNT9B, KRT8</italic> and DAPI were processed on ImageJ/FiJi. The nephron’s lumen center and <italic>WNT11</italic> /<italic>WNT9B</italic> boundary were marked with the <italic>point</italic> tool. <italic>WNT11, WNT9B</italic> and <italic>WNT4</italic> puncta were registered using the <italic>multi-point</italic> tool. Lines were drawn between the nephron’s lumen center point and the <italic>WNT11/WNT9B</italic> boundary using the <italic>straight-line</italic> tool, and between the nephron’s lumen center point and <italic>WNT</italic> puncta using a custom macro. The angle of each line relative to the lumen center was recorded, summarized and averaged for all nephrons, binned and graphed in a radar plot using a custom Python script.</p><p id="P62">Quantification of spatial transcriptional data in the NPC population and PTA along an adjacent-distant axis Spatial transcriptomics data from capturing a total of 9 CD tips and nephron progenitors with associated PTAs, from week 13 and week 16 kidneys, were analyzed for expression of <italic>PCDH15, MEOX1, ELAVL4</italic>, and <italic>FGF8</italic>. The distribution of transcripts was graphed in relation to the surface of each <italic>WNT11</italic><sup>+</sup> CD tip. Pretubular aggregates were defined based on morphologies (DAPI) and the collective view offered by expression of PCDH15, MEOX1, ELAVL4, FGF8, WNT4, LHX1, JAG1, EMX2, GATA3, POU3F3, HNF1B, LEF1, PDGFRB, in relation to the WNT11/WNT9B transition in the CD. Transcript distribution was plotted in PTAs for WNT4, FGF8, LHX1, EMX2, JAG1, MEOX1, and PCDH15 with respect to the forming lumen in the PTA and the WNT11/WNT9B transition point. The angle of each line relative to the lumen center was recorded, summarized and averaged for all nephrons, binned and graphed in a radar plot using a custom Python script.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Quantification of Morphogenesis</title><p id="P63">Organizer-coupled HNF4A::YFP organoids were imaged via widefield fluorescence microscopy on Day18 and processed on ImageJ/FiJi. The center of the mCherry+ organizer was marked with the <italic>point</italic> tool, arrows were drawn from YFP+ tubules to YFP- tubules in clearly polarized nephrons showing elongated morphologies around the organizer, and axial paths were extrapolated using the <italic>straight-line</italic> tool. If paths passed through the organizer, they stopped at the organizer’s end; if not, they stopped when they could not converge with any other extrapolated path. Intersections were registered using the <italic>multi-point</italic> tool. XY coordinates of the organizer’s center and intersections were extracted and the Euclidean distance between each intersection and the organizer’s center calculated and averaged per organoid.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Immunostaining &amp; Clearing</title><p id="P64">Kidney organoids and mouse kidney explants were fixed for 20 min on ice in 4% PFA. Samples were permeabilized and blocked using PBS with 1.5% SEA Block (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37527X3) and 0.1% TritonX100 (EMD Millipore, 1.08643) at 4°C with gentle movement for 1 hour. Samples were stained with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight. Stained samples were washed for at least 3 hours through several rounds of PBS-0.1% TritonX100 washes, and stained with secondary antibodies in blocking solution overnight. PBS washing steps were repeated the next day and nuclei were counterstained using PBS-0.1% TritonX100 containing 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H3570) for 25 minutes. For widefield microscopy, samples were washed for 1 hour in PBS and mounted on slides with a glass coverslip in Immu-Mount (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 9990402). For confocal microscopy, organoids were cleared by gradual dehydration in and placed in BABB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Confocal Imaging &amp; Volume Analysis</title><p id="P65">Optically-cleared organoids were mounted in 20mm-diameter FastWell frames (Grace Bio-Labs, #664113) loaded with 190μl benzyl alcohol-benzyl benzoate (BABB). A coverslip shard was put on top of the transwell to ground the organoid, another round coverslip was used to seal the FastWell, and the sealed chamber was nail polish-glued to a Superfrost plus microscope slide. Organoids were imaged on a Leica SP8X confocal laser scanning microscope by stitching 20 Z-stack tiles captured using 40X oil lens (512x512 resolution). For thicker organoids a 25X water long-working distance lens was used. Imaging files extracted as TIFs were converted to IMS format using Imaris file converter and processed on Imaris imaging analysis software. Organizer surfaces were rendered from manually drawn regions on the basis of strong CDH3 or faint TFAP2A signal; a positive mask was extracted from the surface (organizer channel), and negative masks subtracting the organizer from all other channels were produced. Surfaces from resulting organizer-subtracted channels were rendered with a minimum 2000μm<sup>3</sup> volume threshold, and manually curated by deleting objects stemming from the mesenchyme, organizer leftover signal, and the autofluorescent transwell.
