Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations have been implicated in various human diseases, making precise genome editing tools invaluable for both basic research and potential therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Base editing has emerged as a transformative technology for precise genome manipulation, offering unprecedented capabilities for targeted nucleotide alterations without inducing double-strand breaks. While extensively explored in the nuclear genome, the application of base editing to mtDNA presents unique opportunities, but also challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P3">The inability to efficiently deliver nucleic acids into mitochondria has prompted the development of genome modification technologies based on custom DNA-binding protein. These technologies included mitochondrially-targeted zinc finger nucleases (mtZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (mitoTALEs) and meganuclease (mitoARCUS) and have been used for site-specific cleavage of mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Combining ZF or TALE programmable DNA-binding proteins with deaminase enzymes, such as cytidine or adenine deaminases, allows for C:G to T:A or A:T to G:C conversions, respectively. The first major breakthrough was DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) which allowed for site-specific C:G to T:A mutations in the mtDNA for the first time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The initial dimeric DdCBE architecture contained the catalytic domain of DddAtox bacterial cytidine deaminase acting on double-stranded DNA, split into two inactive fragments (at positions G1333 or C1397), which were brought together by TALE DNA binding domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The technology was rapidly used by our lab and others for many applications including; knocking out each mtDNA-encoded protein-coding gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], reverse genetics approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications in zebrafish[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

The discovery of mitochondrial cytidine base editing provided foundation for the development of adenine base editors in mitochondria using the TadA8e enzyme, deemed transcription-activator-like effector (TALE)-linked deaminases (TALEDs), majorly increasing the capabilities of the mitochondrial gene editing toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Further developments included adenine editors containing a nickase to generate the single-stranded DNA required for deaminase activity (mitoBEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].

The authors used either: (1) dimeric TALEDs (dTALED), which combines two sequence specific TALE arrays binding to opposite strands, with either the catalytically inactive (E1357A) DddAtox or TadA8e at their C-terminus, (2) split DddA TALED (sTALED) which uses the dimeric approach but with the DddAtox(E1357A) split at the G1397 position or (3) monomeric TALED (mTALED) which uses a single TALE-array attached to both the DddAtox(E1357A) and the TadA8e adenine deaminase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In order to test the efficiency of the TALED technology, we used validated TALE arrays for mtDNA-encoded mouse <italic>Mt-Cytb</italic>, <italic>Mt-CoII</italic> and <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> from our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. These TALEs are all known to bind the desired mtDNA position and induce high levels of cytosine base edits, and therefore acted as a good starting point to test the adenine base editing technology <italic>in vitro</italic>. Each of the TALE pair was cloned into plasmids containing the different DddAtox(E1357A)/TadA8e variations. This resulted in a total of 6 combinations which were transfected into WT NIH-3T3 mouse cells, sorted and replated to grow for 6 days. The levels of detectable editing from Sanger sequencing varied significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2-4</xref>), which was quantified using next generation sequencing (NGS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). For <italic>Mt-Cytb</italic>, low editing levels were observed in one of the dimeric DddAtox(E1357A) and TadA8e combinations, and also for the monomeric H strand binding construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the case of <italic>Mt-CoII</italic>, the dimeric DddAtox and TadA8e version showed editing alongside the split DddAtox(E1357A) dimeric combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Finally, <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> showed similar editing in both dimeric, split DddAtox(E1357A) and monomeric architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The highest editing efficiency we achieved after 7 days in vitro was 17%, comparable to previous reports for mouse NIH-3T3 cells, albeit lower than that observed in human cell A-to-G editing.

In the cases where editing was observed, it was present at multiple A:T sites within/across the editing window rather than being specific to predominantly one position as with the DdCBE technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The NGS analysis also allowed for mtDNA-wide off-target editing frequency to be calculated. The off-target editing was approximately 0.1% for all constructs which falls within the variation in unedited WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting generally lower activity of TALEDs, as compared to DdCBEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The off-targets for these constructs are therefore not concerning, although the on-target levels are relatively low and if they increased, the off-targets would likely follow.</p><p id="P15">We next decided to focus on <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic>, as we previously successfully edited this gene <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using cytosine base editors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. We tested the strand selective mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs), which use nickase enzymes to create the single stranded DNA required for TadA8e activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We used the Nt.BspD61(C) nickase due to its lack of sequence specificity, unlike the MutH* nickase used in the previous study, which requires a 5´-GAT-3´ sequence not present in the <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> target window. Following the NIH-3T3 cells transfection and selection (see above), the NGS analysis revealed up to 4% editing at multiple sites withing the targeting window between the TALE biding sites when using the mitoBEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), whilst mtDNA-wide off-targets were not significantly above control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Taken together, our study replicated the outcomes documented for both TALEDs and mitoBEs, with the efficiencies and editing patterns observed in mouse cells being largely consistent with those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Adenine base editing <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P16">Next, we intended to investigate if adenine base editing could be used to edit mtDNA in the post-mitotic tissues of neonate mice, as reported by us previously for various cytosine editors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Informed by our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we decided to test the best performing <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> constructs in dimeric architecture using TadA8e with the H-strand binding TALE and either the inactive DddAtox(E1357A) (the TALED architecture) or nickase Nt.BspD61(C) (the mitoBE architecture) with the L-strand binding TALE. We cloned the respective DNA sequences in a AAV-compatible vector and proceeded with encapsidation according to our standard AAV production approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. However the titres for the H-strand TadA8e construct were approximately 1000-fold lower than for the L-strand DddAtox(E1357A) or L Nt.BspD61(C), which proved insufficient for any mouse injections. We repeated the procedure at two different facilities with similar results. During the course of these experiments a study was published addressing the significant RNA off-targets of the TadA8e enzyme greatly affecting cell viability upon transfection, therefore, we hypothesized that this was likely the reason for the failure to produce AAVs containing the TadA8e enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The study engineered the TadA8e protein to reduce RNA off-target edits, with the V28R mutation preventing &gt;99% RNA-induced off-targeting and leading to increased cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. We installed the V28R mutation into the TadA8e AAV plasmid and tested the effect of TadA8e(V28R) on cells following transfection of HEK293T and comparing it to the unmodified TadA8e AAV plasmid. Consistent with the previously reported data, we observed substantial (up to ~90%) cell death with the unmodified TadA8e, which was alleviated following transfection with the TadA8e(V28R) mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). The generation of TadA8e(V28R) enabled us to produce sufficient AAV titres for subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. We then injected neonatal subjects (postnatal P1) with <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> H-strand TadA8e(V28R) AAV9 with either DddAtox(E1357A) or BspD61(C) AAV9 via temporal vein injection at 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg per monomer per animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Upon sacrificing the animals at 4-weeks post-injection, we confirmed successful AAV delivery through robust expression in mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). At this time-point we observed minimal editing of mtDNA in mouse heart, with NGS revealing up to 0.5% of A:T to G:C edits in 3 replicate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). However, we did not detect any editing in either skeletal muscle or liver tissues, as compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). We did not detect any mtDNA-wide off-targets above background, which was consistent with the low levels of edits observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We further did not observe any significant changes in mtDNA copy number in the AAV-treated mice as compared to the vehicle-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). We also did not detect any changes in OXPHOS protein steady state levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">10</xref>). Taken together, these findings confirm that adenine base editing of mtDNA in vivo in post-mitotic tissues is feasible upon AAV delivery, but the observed levels are notably low after a 4-week exposure period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P17">In this study, we tested the effect of adenine base editors first in cells using our TALEs targeted to <italic>Mt-CytB, Mt-CoII</italic> and <italic>Mt-Atp6</italic> and confirmed editing within the target window.

Considering the limited editing efficiency and the absence of single-nucleotide specificity within the editing window, current adenine base editors need further optimization to become a valuable tool for generating or correcting pathogenic <italic>in vivo</italic> point mutations associated with mitochondrial diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS202019-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the members of the Mitochondrial Genetics Group (MRC-MBU, University of Cambridge) for useful discussion during the course of this research.
