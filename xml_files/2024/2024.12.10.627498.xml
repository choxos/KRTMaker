Compared to summer morphology, winter morphology is characterized by shorter petioles, smaller, thicker leaves with a higher density of trichomes. While summer leaves senesce and are shed in winter conditions, winter leaves are adapted to the winter cold and drought, and effectively extend the growing season under natural conditions. The winter morphology is induced by exposure to short day conditions (daylengths shorter than 12-14 h) and/or low temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. To revert vegetative development from winter morphology to summer morphology, the plant requires exposure to low temperatures (&lt;6Â°C). The length of the required cold exposure period is known as the chilling requirement. The environmental regulation of strawberry seasonal dimorphism resembles that of winter dormancy in species such as apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic>) and peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>). However, in contrast to these species strawberry does not exhibit cessation of bud growth when dormant, which is why the term semi-dormancy is typically used to describe strawberry dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Winter dormancy consists of two stages: endodormancy and ecodormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Endodormancy is maintained by internal signals of the plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Terminal buds of an apple tree in endodormancy will not grow out, even in favorable environmental conditions. Contrastingly, an endo(semi)dormant strawberry plant will grow new leaves, but exhibit winter morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. After fulfilling the chilling requirement, the plant transitions into ecodormancy. In this stage, growth is inhibited by external conditions (typically cold), but will resume when the plant is moved to favorable conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In favorable conditions, an ecodormant apple tree will initiate bud growth, whereas vegetative growth of a strawberry plant will transition to summer morphology.</p><p id="P4">In seasonal flowering varieties of cultivated strawberry, flower initiation occurs upon extended exposure to short day conditions. These conditions concurrently induce development of the winter morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Before the plants are cultivated for fruit production, they are therefore stored at low temperatures until the chilling requirement is met. Interestingly, fulfilment of the chilling requirement inhibits subsequent flower initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The actual chilling requirement varies between cultivars. Low-chill and high-chill cultivars can be differentiated, with low-chill cultivars typically being destined for climates with relatively short and mild winters, such as in the south of Europe. Importantly, failure to reach the chilling requirement before cultivation can negatively affect vegetative development as well as plant productivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Chilling for extended amounts of time on the other hand, will reduce the root starch reserves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">It is not known which genes are involved in the regulation of seasonal dimorphism in strawberry. However, since the description of an <italic>evergrowing</italic> mutant in peach, research on the regulation of winter dormancy in fruiting trees from the Rosaceae family has brought to light a family of potential gene candidates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These <italic>evergrowing</italic> trees do not go into endodormancy and thus do not exhibit cessation of terminal bud growth upon exposure to short photoperiods and cold temperatures. This phenotype is caused by a deletion of four genes, named dormancy-associated MADS-box (<italic>DAM</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These genes are homologs of the MADS-box gene <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic> (<italic>SVP</italic>), which delays flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. MADS-box genes encode transcription factors which contain a DNA binding domain called the MADS-box<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The <italic>DAM</italic> genes encode MIKC-type transcription factors, which are a subset of the larger MADS-box family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The abbreviation MIKC refers to the different protein regions that have been identified: the MADS domain (M), a conserved region which is responsible for DNA interaction; the intervening (I) region, which connects the MADS domain and the K domain; the Keratine-like (K) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions; and the C-terminal (C) region, which is has been shown to play a role in the stabilization of protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Two <italic>SVP</italic> and four <italic>DAM</italic> genes have previously been identified in cultivated strawberry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The similarities between the environmental regulation of winter dormancy in peach and seasonal dimorphism in strawberry, as well as the close evolutionary relationship between these species, make the <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>DAM</italic> genes likely candidates for regulation of the winter morphology in strawberry. In this work, we explore the phylogenetic relationship between <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>DAM</italic> genes from strawberry and Rosaceae fruiting trees, as well as the similarities between amino acid sequences of the MIKC motifs. A series of gene expression analyses was performed to investigate which genes are possible gene candidates for the regulation of seasonal dimorphism in strawberry.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Phylogeny and protein alignment</title><p id="P7">Protein and DNA sequences of strawberry <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>DAM</italic> genes were obtained from the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

This differentiates strawberry from peach and other Rosaceae fruiting trees, which undergo complete cessation of bud growth in the winter upon induction of endodormancy.

Because of its small size and comparatively short life cycle, strawberry has the potential to be an interesting model organism to study the <italic>DAM</italic> gene family as a whole. However, because gene duplication and specialization appears to have happened after divergence of the Rosoideae and Amygdaloideae subfamilies, there are limits to what can be extrapolated from one clade to the other.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Divergence between strawberry SVP and DAM proteins is concentrated in the K-box and C region</title><p id="P33">Analysis of gene expression and amino acid sequences suggests that all <italic>FaSVP</italic> and <italic>FaDAM</italic> genes that we tested are expressed in strawberry and that translation yields functional proteins. In all protein alignments, the MADS-box region is relatively the most conserved. There is 100% similarity between the M, I, K and C domains of FaSVP1 and FaSVP2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This suggests functional redundancy between these two proteins. Between FaDAM1 and FaDAM2, and FaDAM3 and FaDAM4, most of the dissimilarity was found in the K-box and C regions. The K-box is responsible for protein-protein interaction and the C region has been reported to be involved in the stabilization of K-box interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and the formation of protein dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The function of MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors has been reported to change dependent on the formation of protein dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Although the high similarity suggests there might be functional overlap between the pairs of SVP and DAM proteins, it is likely that functional divergence has taken place between the paralogs, which may arise from homo- or heterodimerization between members of the SVP and DAM protein families. Furthermore, aside from differences in protein structure, specialization may also occur through differences in temporal or spatial expression.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title><italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> are likely candidates for the regulation of semi-dormancy in strawberry</title><p id="P34"><italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> are upregulated in plants that exhibit signs of semi-dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The short petioles and small leaves of the plants that were not chilled are typical for the winter morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The plants used in experiment 1 all had the same age at the time leaf samples were taken. However, because one of the treatments consisted of chilling the plants at 2Â°C, there is a difference in accumulated growing degree hours between the plants. Because of this, it cannot be said if the chilling treatment has actively reduced <italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> expression, or simply inhibited its upregulation by slowing down developmental processes. In experiment 2, we demonstrate that <italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> up and down regulation correlates with exposure to short days and chilling respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). After the first 324 h of chilling (Dec-1), <italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> expression had decreased compared to the last datapoint before chilling (Oct-26).

This makes <italic>FaDAM3</italic> a more likely candidate for semi-dormancy regulation, and suggests <italic>FaDAM4</italic> expression might be redundant. Because we hypothesized that differences in <italic>DAM</italic> expression might be fundamental to the chilling requirement of different cultivars, we included two cultivars with different chilling requirements in this experiment. However, we found no difference between these two cultivars in the rate at which <italic>FaDAM3</italic> or <italic>FaDAM4</italic> expression decreased under chilling conditions. A possible explanation is that differences in chilling requirement manifest at the protein level (e.g. from protein stabilization or interaction), which we did not investigate in the current study. DAM function is known to depend on homo- and heterodimerization of the proteins, and binding-partners are not necessarily other DAM or even SVP proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. It is possible that chilling requirement is fine-tuned by interaction with another protein and the expression thereof. Another possibility is that the difference between high and low chill cultivars arises downstream from <italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic>. In order to further investigate the potential role of <italic>FaDAM3</italic> and <italic>FaDAM4</italic> as master regulators of the winter morphology, we suggest a functional analysis of these two genes by means of gene knock-out and over-expression in a native system.</p><p id="P36">Flower initiation and semi-dormancy induction occur at photoperiods shorter than about 12-14 h.

The expression pattern of <italic>FaSVP2</italic> suggests it may play a role specifically in the induction of endodormancy, but may be of less importance during endodormancy breaking or ecodormancy.
