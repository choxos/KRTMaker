The study of this process often requires quantifying abundances of specific RNAs at precise subcellular locations. To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals. In sum, OINC-seq together with PIGPEN provide an accessible workflow for the analysis of localized RNAs across different biological systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The localization of specific RNA molecules to distinct subcellular locations is a widespread phenomenon. In organisms ranging from yeast to human, thousands of different RNA species are asymmetrically localized in a variety of conditions and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In many cases, the transport of these RNAs is mediated by the interaction of specific cis-localization-regulatory sequences with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that recognize these sequence elements. However, for the vast majority of localized RNAs, the identity of the cis-elements and trans-factors that regulate their subcellular distribution are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Misregulation of subcellular RNA localization is associated with a variety of cellular and organismal phenotypes. Mating type switching in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and developmental patterning in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) require proper trafficking of specific RNAs. In humans, a variety of human neurological diseases are linked to defects in neuronal RNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">A key challenge in studying RNA localization is identifying which transcripts are enriched at a given subcellular location. Methods to interrogate this problem have been consistently improving over the last few decades. Historically, microscopy-based methods like single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) have provided high-resolution quantification of localized abundances of single transcripts. These methods have more recently been multiplexed to allow the interrogation of multiple transcripts at once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, microscopy-based techniques require highly sophisticated imaging setups, and the number of cells that can be assayed in a single experiment remains limited. Given that gene expression at the single cell level can be stochastic and prone to “bursts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), gathering population average measurements from millions of cells can sometimes be preferable.</p><p id="P5">Other methods use high-throughput sequencing for the quantification of subcellular transcriptomes. Cells with extended morphologies, including neurons, can be mechanically fractionated into distinct subcellular fractions representing cell bodies and projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). RNA collected from these fractions can be analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify transcripts that are differentially abundant between the two subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This approach is limited to cells with specific morphologies with elongated projections. Given that RNAs are also localized in cells without these structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), more flexible techniques are needed.</p><p id="P6">Biochemical subcellular fractionation techniques involving ultracentrifugation have been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), yet these approaches separate molecules based on biochemical properties, not necessarily subcellular location. Two molecules that are not spatially coincident in cells that have similar biochemical properties may cofractionate, leading to false positives. Similarly, two molecules that are spatially coincident may not copurify, leading to false negatives.</p><p id="P7">To improve on these approaches, proximity-based approaches for identifying localized RNAs have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). These approaches rely on a localized “bait” protein and use spatially restricted chemical reactions enabled by the bait protein to specifically label nearby RNAs. Most commonly, labeling events facilitate biotinylation of the bait-proximal RNA, allowing its purification with streptavidin-coated beads and analysis using high-throughput sequencing. These approaches are more flexible in that they can target many subcellular locations in a variety of cultured cell types. However, proximity labeling-based approaches often take multiple days to complete, require relatively expensive RNA enrichment reagents, and due to harsh chemical treatments are often not compatible with experimentation in live organisms.</p><p id="P8">To streamline the process of subcellular RNA quantification, we developed OINC-seq. Our approach builds on the principles of a previously established proximity-based technique, Halo-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In Halo-seq, a HaloTag protein domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) is genetically fused to a protein that is specifically localized to the subcellular location of interest. A Halo ligand, Halo-dibromofluorescein (Halo-DBF), is then added, which specifically and covalently binds the HaloTag domain, thus assuming the same subcellular distribution as the localized protein. Upon irradiation with green light, Halo-DBF emits singlet oxygen radicals that oxidize biomolecules within a radius of approximately 100 nm. Oxidized (i.e. localized) RNA is then a substrate for in situ alkynylation using the small nucleophile propargylamine. This renders the localized RNA a substrate for in vitro biotinylation using “Click” chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and eventual purification using streptavidin.</p><p id="P9">With OINC-seq, the laborious and expensive biotinylation and purification steps are removed. Instead, in situ RNA oxidation events are read out directly using high-throughput sequencing. Oxidation events are detected as misincorporation at guanosine residues by reverse transcriptase. These oxidation events are then quantified at the individual transcript and gene levels using the accompanying Pipeline for the Identification of Guanosine Positions Erroneously Notated (PIGPEN) software. We demonstrate that OINC-seq induces and quantifies RNA oxidation events in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We show that OINC-seq performs these tasks in a spatially restricted manner, allowing the quantification of RNA populations at specific subcellular locations. Finally, we demonstrate that OINC-seq is compatible with RNA labeling in live zebrafish embryos using transgenic HaloTag fusions. Taken together, as a genetically controllable system with in vivo functionality, OINC-Seq expands the reach of proximity-based RNA localization techniques.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>8-oxoguanosine is interpreted by Superscript IV reverse transcriptase as uridine approximately 80% of the time</title><p id="P10">Of the four nucleosides, guanosine has the lowest reduction potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), making it the most likely nucleoside to be oxidized. Oxidation converts guanosine to 8-oxoguanosine (8OG). Further oxidation of 8OG leads to the production of 5-guanidinohydantoin (GH) and spiroiminodihydantoin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using primer extension and gel electrophoresis, previous work has demonstrated that when reverse transcriptase (RT) encounters these lesions, it makes predictable incorporation errors at those locations in the resulting cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Specifically, RT had been observed to interpret 8OG as uridine approximately 60% of the time while further oxidized products were interpreted as either cytidine or uridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). After PCR of the resulting cDNA, these misincorporations are manifested as G to T and G to C mutations in the strand corresponding to the original RNA molecule.</p><p id="P11">In Halo-seq, bait-proximal RNAs are oxidized and alkynylated <italic>in situ</italic>, facilitating their biotinylation <italic>in vitro</italic> and eventual enrichment with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We wondered whether we could instead harness RT’s propensity to misinterpret oxidized guanosine residues to directly quantify the amount of a given RNA species that had been HaloTag-proximal in cells, potentially negating the need for biotinylation and enrichment. We reasoned that this could be done by isolating whole-cell RNA after the light-controlled oxidation event, identifying the resulting modified RNA species using RNAseq, and quantifying RNA oxidation events by counting G to T and G to C conversions on a per-gene basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">For this strategy to work, oxidative labeling produced using Halo-DBF must produce 8OG residues in cells. To test this, we ectopically expressed a cytoplasmically localized Halo-tagged protein (Halo-p65) in HeLa cells. We then added the light-sensitive Halo ligand Halo-DBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and irradiated the cells with green light for 5 minutes to induce RNA oxidation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> for details). Using an antibody that targets 8OG, we measured the abundance of 8OG in this sample and a control sample in which we omitted the addition of Halo-DBF. We observed an 18-fold increase in 8OG abundance in Halo-DBF-treated cells, indicating that radicals produced through optical activation of localized Halo-DBF were creating 8OG residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We next moved to the detection of 8OG using sequencing-based approaches. Although RT had been previously shown to misinterpret 8OG approximately 60% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), this rate was calculated using primer extension and gel electrophoresis assays that are challenging to accurately quantify. We therefore sought to establish a more quantitative understanding of the frequency at which 8OG-caused misinterpretation of guanosine by RT occurs. To do this, we synthesized two RNA oligonucleotides of identical sequences with one exception. In one oligonucleotide, a single 8OG residue was inserted at a known nucleotide position. At the corresponding position in the control oligonucleotide, there was a guanosine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1B-E</xref>). We then reverse transcribed these oligos using Superscript IV, amplified the resulting cDNA, and sequenced it using an Illumina-based platform.</p><p id="P14">In our sequencing results, we found that at most positions in both oligos, nucleotide identities in the amplified cDNA were as expected almost 100% of the time. However, in the 8OG-containing oligo, the 8OG position was replaced with a nucleotide other than guanosine approximately 70% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further inspection of this position showed that almost all of these mutations were G to T mutations, consistent with the previously reported ability of Superscript-based RTs to interpret 8OG as uridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We repeated this experiment with an RNA oligo containing a further oxidized guanosine product (5-guanidinohydantoin or GH). We observed conversions at the nucleotide substituted with GH 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that almost all of these conversions were G to T and G to C conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S1F</xref>), as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In our data, G to T conversions are therefore likely arising from both 8OG and hydantoin guanosine oxidation products while G to C conversions are arising only from hydantoins. Interestingly, we also observed that RT also had a propensity to skip oxidized guanosine residues, particularly the hydantoin, resulting in a deletion of the nucleotide in cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). This effect had not been previously reported.</p><p id="P15">These results gave us confidence that Superscript IV would be suitable for 8OG quantification. Since this technique leverages nucleotide conversions (mutations) for the study of RNA oxidation, we named it Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion Sequencing (OINC-Seq).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PIGPEN quantifies mutations in RNAseq data</title><p id="P16">Given that we could quantify 8OG residues in single RNA oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), we then moved to testing 8OG residues created through localized oxidation in cells. To facilitate this, we created software that can identify nucleotide conversions from RNAseq data. With this approach, we can identify and quantify conversions induced by guanosine oxidation (i.e. G to T, G to C, and G deletion events, hereafter referred to as G conversions) in RNAseq samples. We named this software the Pipeline for the Identification of Guanosine Positions Erroneously Notated (PIGPEN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In brief, PIGPEN first aligns input RNAseq reads to a genome and then calls mutations relative to the reference sequence. Optionally, reference positions known to contain high frequencies of mutations (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) can be automatically called and masked from further analysis. Further, to minimize the contribution of sequencing errors, a requirement for dual observation of a given mutation in both mates of a read pair can be enforced.</p><p id="P18">In parallel, reads are assigned to transcripts using the quasi-mapping software salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). By combining observed conversions within reads with their salmon-based assignments, conversions are then (fractionally) assigned to transcripts. Gene-level conversion counts are then obtained by summing transcript-level conversion counts across all transcripts assigned to a given gene. Finally, optionally, genes whose G conversion rates significantly differ across conditions can be identified using the statistical framework in the Bioinformatic Analysis of the Conversion of Nucleotides (BACON) module.</p><p id="P19">To test the ability of PIGPEN to accurately quantify mutation rates in RNAseq data, we created a simulated paired-end RNAseq dataset in which all twelve possible inter-nucleotide conversion rates were predefined. On top of these conversion rates, we also simulated a sequencing error rate of 0.001, which is the approximate rate of sequencing error on Illumina platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We found that under these conditions, PIGPEN accurately calculated nucleotide conversion rates that were above the sequencing error rate, but that any conversion rates below the sequencing error rate were effectively dominated by sequencing error (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2A</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). However, if we required that observed conversions be present in both mates of a read pair, sequencing error was greatly reduced, and nucleotide conversion rates were accurately quantified across a range of frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2A</xref>, <bold>right</bold>).</p><p id="P20">To test the ability of PIGPEN to identify and quantify 8OG sites in transcriptome-scale RNA-seq data, we turned to a dataset in which 8OG-containing transcripts had been enriched using the anti-8OG antibody we used previously for immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In this dataset, oxidized RNAs were identified by comparing transcript abundances in input and immunoprecipitated RNA samples. Using PIGPEN, we found a 50% higher rate of G to T conversions in the immunoprecipitated RNA compared to the input, consistent with an increased abundance of 8OG in these samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2B, C</xref>). Conversely, G to C conversions and G deletions were only ~10% higher in the immunoprecipitated RNA, consistent with the antibody recognizing 8OG and not further oxidized species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, E</xref>). Together, these simulated and real-life data analyses establish PIGPEN as a software pipeline to quantify 8OG frequencies in RNAseq data.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>OINC-seq conversions are Halo-DBF dose-dependent</title><p id="P21">Given that we could detect and quantify 8OG residues in RNAseq data, we then moved to quantifying their induced formation from the localized oxidation reactions used by RNA proximity labeling experiments. We utilized our HeLa line that inducibly expressed a broadly cytoplasmically localized Halo-tagged protein, Halo-p65 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2D</xref>). We then added increasing amounts of Halo-DBF to these cells, washed away unbound Halo-DBF, irradiated them with green light for 5 minutes, and immediately collected total RNA samples. As a control, we also collected untreated samples without Halo-DBF addition. From all samples, we analyzed an amplicon from the <italic>GAPDH</italic> transcript using RNAseq and used PIGPEN to quantify nucleotide conversions in the resulting reads.</p><p id="P22">Compared to untreated samples in which Halo-DBF was omitted, we saw a large (up to 100 fold), dose-dependent increase in G conversions in Halo-DBF-treated samples, indicative of the formation and detection of guanosine oxidation products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of the other 13 possible nucleotide conversions, only A deletions were similarly enriched in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the specificity of the reaction.</p><p id="P23">As mentioned above, PIGPEN optionally only considers conversions observed in both mates of a read pair. We quantified conversion rates with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2E</xref>) and without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) this option. Requiring conversions to be present in both mates significantly increased conversion enrichment from 100 fold to 200 fold, suggesting that requiring agreement between both read pairs is effective in reducing the contribution of Illumina-based sequencing errors.</p><p id="P24">Although G conversions are suggestive of 8OG residues, these conversions also exist in non-Halo-DBF treated samples due to reasons unrelated to Halo-DBF-dependent oxidation (e.g., infidelity of the reverse transcriptase, naturally occurring 8OG, etc.). These “non-specific” conversions may be expected to be randomly scattered across all the guanosine residues in an RNA sample. On the other hand, due to the proximity-dependent nature of the reaction, we expect that Halo-DBF-dependent conversions are more likely to be spatially clustered within the cell and therefore found together within a single RNA molecule. We therefore tested whether we could increase signal to noise levels for proximity-dependent 8OG creation by only counting G conversions that came from RNAseq reads with at least two of these conversions within the ~300 bp that were interrogated in the amplicon. In fact, this approach further increased conversion enrichment levels considerably, with G to C conversions now up to 3000-fold enriched in Halo-DBF-treated samples compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The dose-dependent relationship between Halo-DBF concentration and conversion rates remained, again demonstrating that these nucleotide conversions were likely due to proximity-dependent RNA oxidation events.</p><p id="P25">In HeLa cells, <italic>GAPDH</italic> transcript is very highly expressed at approximately 1000 tpm (transcripts per million). To demonstrate the ability of OINC-seq to quantify RNA oxidation on more moderately expressed transcripts, we targeted an amplicon of the <italic>CD9</italic> gene. Transcripts from this gene are 20-fold more lowly expressed than those from <italic>GAPDH</italic>. We again found that G conversion rates were approximately 100 folder higher in Halo-DBF treated cells compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>OINC-seq mutations are dependent upon irradiation with green light</title><p id="P26">A key feature of a proximity labeling experiment is temporal control as this lends additional specificity to the experiment. In Halo-seq and OINC-seq, this is achieved through photo-activation of the Halo-DBF ligand with green light. To assay the photo-dependence of the OINC-seq reaction, we performed proximity labeling in cells expressing Halo-p65 using increasing exposure times to green light (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> for details). To quantify guanosine oxidation, we again analyzed an amplicon of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> transcript.</p><p id="P27">We found that samples that were not exposed to green light did not accumulate G conversions above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Increasing amounts of green light exposure time led to increasing rates of G conversions, with the accumulation plateauing at 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2G</xref>). We therefore concluded that the OINC-seq reaction was dependent upon exposure to green light and that for this Halo fusion and RNA pair, the reaction was saturated at 5 minutes of green light exposure. We believe this rather short period of labeling minimizes oxidative damage and secondary, off-target effects.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Testing the misincorporation frequency of different reverse transcriptases at 8OG residues</title><p id="P28">OINC-seq relies on the ability of reverse transcriptase to interpret 8OG residues as a nucleotide other than guanosine. Up to this point, we had used Superscript IV RT for this purpose as we and others had observed that this enzyme had this property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We sought to test if other reverse transcriptases may perform misincorporation at 8OG sites at higher rates and therefore be a superior choice for OINC-seq studies.</p><p id="P29">We therefore repeated the OINC-seq experiment again using Halo-p65 and a <italic>GAPDH</italic> amplicon. We reverse-transcribed the resulting RNA from this experiment using four different RT enzymes: Superscript IV, AccuScript, MarathonRT, and TGIRT III.

To test the spatial specificity of OINC-seq, we created two HeLa lines, one that inducibly expressed a cytoplasmically localized Halo fusion (Halo-p65) and another that inducibly expressed a nuclearly localized Halo fusion (Halo-H2B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We conclude that the RNA oxidation induced by OINC-seq and quantified by PIGPEN occurs in a spatially specific manner, making the technique suitable for RNA localization experiments.</p><p id="P35">To further probe the spatial selectivity of OINC-seq, we again labeled RNA using the H2B and p65 Halo-fusions.

One amplicon was the same as used above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B-C</xref>) and was entirely contained within one exon. As such, it is expected to be found on both nascent pre-mRNA and spliced mature mRNA. The other amplicon crossed a spliced junction and is therefore only present in spliced mature mRNA. Given that most cytoplasmic transcripts are spliced while those in the nucleus are a mixture of spliced and unspliced, we would expect the spliced amplicon to be relatively less abundant in nuclear RNA.

To test the ability of OINC-seq to report on the full RNA content of different subcellular locations, we took advantage of four HeLa lines that inducibly expressed HaloTag fusion proteins targeted to different locations. Halo-p65 was broadly cytoplasmically localized, Halo-P450 was localized to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Halo-ATP5MC1 was localized to the mitochondrial matrix, and Halo-H2B was localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P37">We performed OINC-seq with each cell line, isolated RNA, and created Quantseq 3′ end RNAseq libraries (including using this kit’s reverse transcriptase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).

For each HaloTag fusion, G conversions were enriched in Halo-DBF-treated samples compared to untreated samples, indicating that OINC-seq was inducing RNA oxidation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This downsampling had essentially no effect on detected conversion rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4A</xref>), indicating that read depth was not responsible for the decreased conversion enrichment values.</p><p id="P39">We next wondered whether differences in sequencing library preparation techniques (i.e. RT-PCR vs. 3′ end RNAseq libraries) could affect guanosine conversion frequencies. Indeed, when comparing Halo-DBF-untreated samples, Quantseq 3′ end RNAseq libraries showed significantly higher rates of “background” guanosine conversions than was observed with RT-PCR amplicons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4B</xref>). We therefore speculate that differences in the fidelity of polymerases used in the RT-PCR and RNAseq library approaches may be behind the drop in G conversion signal in transcriptome-wide samples. Nevertheless, clear ~10-fold enrichments of G conversions could be seen in Halo-DBF treated samples, so we continued with analysis of these samples.</p><p id="P40">To assay OINC-seq’s ability to label subcellular RNA populations, we then focused on G conversion rates in RNAs known to be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and to the mitochondrial matrix. mRNAs that encode secreted or membrane-embedded proteins are often translated on the surface of the ER, and their presence there has been previously assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We therefore used these mRNAs as positive controls for ER-localized transcripts. Transcripts that arise from the mitochondrial genome reside in the mitochondrial matrix, and we used these RNAs as positive controls for mitochondrially localized transcripts.

When RNA was labeled using the broadly cytoplasmically localized Halo-p65 fusion, we observed broad labeling of many classes of RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, when RNA was labeled with the ER-localized Halo-P450 fusion, we found that known ER-localized RNAs had higher rates of G conversions, consistent with OINC-seq being able to specifically label this RNA population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). When RNA was labeled with the mitochondrially localized Halo-ATP5MC1 fusion, mitochondrial RNAs were strongly enriched for G conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, when RNA was labeled with the nuclearly localized Halo-H2B sample, known nuclear RNAs were strongly enriched for G conversions. Using BACON, we identified RNAs in the ER, mitochondrial, and nuclear HaloTag samples that displayed statistically significantly different rates of G conversions, again finding that each compartment was significantly associated with positive control RNAs known to reside there (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Tables 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>).

Applying RNA proximity labeling into animal models <italic>in vivo</italic> is challenging due to the toxicity of some reagents, particularly those involved in biotinylation, and their inability to penetrate deep into tissues. In contrast, OINC-seq circumvents the need for biotinylation. We therefore sought to perform proximity-based oxidation of RNA in live zebrafish embryos.</p><p id="P47">For this purpose, we created the Tol2-based transgenic zebrafish strain <italic>Tg(bact2:HaloTag-NES-2A-mCerulean-CAAX)</italic>, or <italic>bact2:HaloTag-NES</italic> for short. The transgene consists of the broadly active, strong <italic>beta-actin2</italic> (<italic>bact2</italic>) promoter driving a HaloTag domain fused to three copies of the nuclear export sequence (NES) from MAPPK2 followed by P2A-membrane-bound mCerulean to identify transgenic zebrafish by blue fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5A</xref>, <bold>top</bold>).

The rates of G conversions, however, were markedly lower than observed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This may be due to a lower expression of the transgene in zebrafish compared to HeLa cells, the transgene not being expressed in every cell in the embryo, or issues with penetration of the Halo-DBF ligand through zebrafish tissue. Conversely, G conversions were not induced by Halo-DBF treatment in wild type embryos, indicating that they required expression of the Halo fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P51">To analyze the spatial specificity of labeling in zebrafish, we analyzed RT-PCR amplicons of <italic>gapdh</italic> and <italic>malat1</italic> transcripts from both <italic>bact2:HaloTag-H2B</italic> and <italic>bact2:HaloTag-NES</italic> lines as we had done previously with HeLa cell RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As before, for both transcripts, we observed more G conversions in Halo-DBF treated zebrafish than in untreated zebrafish, indicative of induced RNA oxidation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5G-H</xref>). The conversion rates of other nucleotides were relatively less affected, again showing the specificity of the reaction. The rates of G conversions, though, were again lower than we had observed in HeLa cells.</p><p id="P52">Still, to assess the spatial specificity of OINC-seq in zebrafish, we compared G conversion rates for both amplicons between the <italic>bact2:HaloTag-H2B</italic> and <italic>bact2:HaloTag-NES</italic> lines.

These results were highly similar to those observed with the human orthologs of these RNAs in HeLa cells that had undergone nuclear or cytoplasmic labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and suggest spatial specific labeling in zebrafish. Taken together, these proof-of-principle experiments using transgenic HaloTag with nuclear exclusion sequence establish the functionality of OINC-seq <italic>in vivo</italic> using zebrafish embryos.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P53">A variety of proximity-based methods for RNA labeling and analysis have recently been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) to enable the study of RNA localization at previously intractable subcellular locations. All of these approaches involve labeling RNA at a subcellular location and subsequently separating the labeled RNA from unlabeled RNA using biotin-mediated enrichment. Here, we present OINC-seq, an <italic>in vivo</italic>-compatible RNA proximity labeling method in which the <italic>in situ</italic>-deposited label is read out directly using high-throughput sequencing.</p><p id="P54">OINC-seq has several advantages over previously reported methods. First, removing the need for biotinylation and enrichment greatly streamlines the process. With OINC-seq, all steps necessary to create RNA samples ready for RNAseq library preparation can be performed in 2 hours. The same process can take up to 12 hours with earlier approaches. Second, removing the enrichment step removes a potential source of experimental noise. Streptavidin beads, although mostly inert, can nonspecifically bind unbiotinylated RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). If the relative amount of biotinylated and unbiotinylated RNA varies across samples, the contribution of nonspecifically bound RNA can also vary, skewing results.</p><p id="P55">The ability of OINC-seq to detect multiple labeling events within a single RNA molecule greatly increases the discriminatory ability of OINC-seq to identify true, proximity-dependent labeling events. RNAs labeled in a proximity-dependent manner are more likely to have multiple labels across their length. Conversely, background labels introduced during the experiment in a nonspecific way are expected to be less abundant and occur more randomly across the RNA sample with each RNA molecule receiving relatively fewer labels. Because of the high-affinity binding between biotin and streptavidin, RNAs with a single biotin moiety and those with multiple biotin moieties may interact with streptavidin with similar efficiencies. Therefore, with biotin-based approaches, truly labeled RNAs and nonspecifically labeled RNAs may be enriched with similar efficiencies. In contrast, OINC-seq’s ability to quantify labeled residues rather than simply detect their presence or absence allows further filtering for transcripts with multiple labels. In fact, we observed that requiring multiple labels on a single RNA for quantification increased the ability of OINC-seq to discriminate between labeled and unlabeled RNA samples by 10-fold.</p><p id="P56">Finally, the majority of RNA localization studies have been conducted in cultured cell models. To better understand the effects of RNA localization in living organisms, labeling RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> is desirable. However, biotinylation of RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> often involves toxic reagents, technical challenges, and high costs. By circumventing biotinylation, OINC-seq enables labeling RNA in living organisms, as shown here in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The ubiquitous, inducible, tissue-specific expression of transgene-encoded HaloTag protein fusions with specific localization tags is applicable to numerous model organisms, expanding the opportunities to discover and quantify RNA localization <italic>in vivo</italic>. Still, RNA labeling in zebrafish embryos may require additional optimization to maximize rates of G conversion.</p><p id="P57">On the other hand, removing the enrichment step also has disadvantages. RNA oxidation events are quite rare, even in samples where the parameters that control the extent of proximity-induced RNA oxidation have been maximized. In these samples, between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000 guanosine residues appear as cytidine or thymidine in the resulting cDNA, indicating their potential oxidation. In experiments where the fraction of RNA expected to be labeled is lower (e.g., when targeting a small subcellular region), the ability to detect a reasonable number of oxidation events at a reasonable read depth may become an issue. Biotinylation-based methods circumvent this problem by enriching these rare events. With OINC-seq, no such enrichment is performed.</p><p id="P58">RNA oxidation occurs in other contexts besides engineered proximity labeling experiments. RNAs are oxidized naturally in cells, such as a result of exposure to reactive oxygen species and/or carcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Mechanistically, the occurrence of 8OG in coding regions leads to ribosome stalling and mRNA decay through translation surveillance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). 8OG residues also inhibit RNA degradation by Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), possibly leading to a buildup of partially degraded transcripts. Increased levels of RNA oxidation is associated with a range of diseases, from neurodegenerative diseases to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). For these reasons, the detection of oxidized RNA in RNAseq samples may be useful beyond localization studies. PIGPEN can identify oxidized nucleotides in these samples, as evidenced by its ability to distinguish input and eluate samples from an 8OG immunoprecipitation experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2B,C</xref>). Further, since oxidation affects both RNA and DNA guanosine residues, care is needed to discriminate the effect of oxidation on RNA from DNA. By masking mutated positions (i.e. SNPs), PIGPEN is capable of identifying RNA-specific oxidation events. Finally, although here we paired PIGPEN with RNA oxidation induced by localized Halo-DBF, other proximity labeling approaches, including APEX-seq and CAP-seq, also utilize RNA oxidation. PIGPEN may therefore be useful in detecting and quantifying labeled RNA using variations of those techniques in which biotinylation is omitted.</p><p id="P59">We currently cannot explain with certainty why detected nucleotide conversion events are much higher in single transcript amplicon experiments (i.e. those involving <italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>MALAT1</italic>, ~100 fold) than in transcriptome-scale experiments (~10 fold). Because they only interrogate a single RNA species, amplicon experiments have many more reads per transcript species than transcriptome-scale experiments. However, this is not the reason for the difference in nucleotide conversion enrichments as subsampling the amplicon data did not change conversion enrichment values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4A</xref>). Instead, differences in sequencing library preparation approaches may contribute to this effect. Nucleotide conversion frequencies in control, untreated RNA were highly dependent upon library preparation method with transcriptome-wide libraries showing higher rates of “background” mutations in unlabeled RNA samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4B</xref>). Consequently, the choice of library preparation strategy can have an effect on observed nucleotide conversion rates, likely through differences in fidelity in the polymerases used. Further, quantifying the localization of single transcripts, including reporter transcripts, using amplicons has numerous applications in developmental biology, disease modeling, drug discovery, and more.</p><p id="P60">Finally, given that OINC-seq is capable of inducing RNA labeling <italic>in vivo</italic>, OINC-seq has potential application for cell type-specific transcriptome analysis from bulk RNA-sequencing. After driving the transgenic expression of a non-localized HaloTag fusion protein with a tissue-specific promoter/enhancer, RNAs in the HaloTag-expressing cells would be specifically labeled, facilitating their discrimination from unlabeled RNAs in other tissues in bulk sequencing data. Similar tissue- or cell type-specific sequencing currently requires flow cytometry-based sorting of cells of interest followed by RNA sequencing. OINC-seq may therefore offer a streamlined experimental workflow for tissue-specific transcriptomics applications in model organisms.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Creation of stably-integrated transgenic cell lines expressing HaloTag-fusion proteins</title><p id="P61">All transgenic cell lines started as HeLa cell lines containing a single <italic>loxP</italic> cassette with blasticidin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

In brief, PIGPEN takes in RNAseq reads and aligns them to a reference genome using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). These alignments are used to identify and quantify nucleotide conversions relative to the reference genome. If desired, genome positions with high levels of mutations (e.g. SNPs) can be called using varscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) and masked from further analysis. As a default, in order for a site to be masked a nucleotide must be covered by at least 20 reads and at least 20% of those reads must contain a SNP at that nucleotide. Low quality score nucleotides are masked (default Q &lt; 30), and, if desired, a requirement that a given conversion be observed in both mates of a read pair can also be enforced.</p><p id="P81">In parallel, reads are assigned to transcripts using salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and the fractional assignment of each read to a transcript is derived using postmaster (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/postmaster">https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/postmaster</ext-link>). At the end of this process, each read has the number of conversions it contains quantified and has also been fractionally assigned to one or more transcripts. For each read, these two measurements are combined to assign nucleotide conversions to transcripts. For each gene, nucleotide conversions are then summed across all substituent transcripts to give gene-level conversion counts.</p><p id="P82">For the transcriptome-scale experiments, ER-localized RNAs were defined as those previously described as “high-confidence” ER-localized RNAs in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). RNAs defined as those localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane were those encoding proteins with the gene ontology term “Mitochondrial Protein Complex” (GO:0098798). RNAs defined as those localized to the mitochondrial matrix were those that originated from genes on the mitochondrial chromosome.</p><p id="P83">To identify genes whose G to T and G to C conversion rates change across samples or conditions, the Bioinformatic Analysis of the Conversion Of Nucleotides (BACON) module of PIGPEN was used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/OINC-seq">https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/OINC-seq</ext-link>). BACON fits a binomial generalized linear mixed effects model of converted G counts and nonconverted G counts against conditions. This model is then compared to a null model in which the effect of the condition was removed. A likelihood ratio test was then used to evaluate the relative fit between the experimental and null models.

Wilcox rank-sum tests were used to compare across RNA classes (ns represents p &gt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, **** p &lt; 0.0001) (D) Representative fluorescent images of mitochondrial-localized HaloTag fusions Halo-ATP5MC1 and Halo-MAVS using structured illumination microscopy. Top: the mitochondrial matrix Halo fusion (Halo-ATP5MC1) co-stained with the mitochondrial membrane marker MitoView. Bottom: the outer mitochondrial membrane Halo fusion (Halo-MAVS) co-stained with the mitochondrial membrane marker MitoView. Scale bar 5 µm. Insets allow better appreciation of the relative position of each stained structure. Scale bar 1 µm (insets). (E) G conversion rates for two classes of RNA that encode mitochondrial proteins, those encoded on the mitochondrial chromosome and those encoded in the nuclear genome. Rates are shown for OINC-seq experiments using the mitochondrial matrix HaloTag fusion (Halo-ATP5MC1) and the outer mitochondrial membrane HaloTag fusion (Halo-MAVS) (n=3). Wilcox rank-sum tests were used to compare across RNA classes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200090-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>OINC-seq is compatible with RNA labeling in live animals.</title><p>(A) Representative images of 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) homozygous bact2:Halo-NES transgenic zebrafish (top), bact2:Halo-H2B transgenic zebrafish (middle) or wildtype zebrafish embryo (bottom) stained with the fluorescent Halo ligand JF646 (magenta).
