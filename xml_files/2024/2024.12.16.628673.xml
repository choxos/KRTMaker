Since the development of the first green fluorescent protein-based GECIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, significant progress has been made in improving signal-to-noise ratios and kinetics, with advancements seen in GCaMP3 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, GCaMP5 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>), G-GECO1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>), and GCaMP6 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>). These improvements have culminated in the recent development of jGCaMP8, which offers ultra-fast kinetics and heightened sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast to green fluorescent GECIs, red-shifted sensors are generally preferable, as longer-wavelength light penetrates deeper into tissue and induces less phototoxicity. However, despite the advancements in green fluorescent biosensors, red-shifted GECIs still face limitations, such as lower brightness, reduced photostability, and photoswitching, as well as unique challenges like lysosomal accumulation, which have persisted since they were first reported (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). Commonly used red GECIs, like jRCaMP1a,b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, R-GECO1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>), jRGECO1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, XCaMP-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and RCaMP3 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>), each have their own limitations.</p><p id="P3">All red fluorescent GECIs reported to date are derived from three distinct lineages of naturally occurring RFPs: R-GECO1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>) and its progeny are based on the <italic>Discosoma sp</italic>.-derived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> mApple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> ; jRCaMP1a,b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> are based on <italic>Entacmaea quadricolor</italic> eqFP611-derived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> mRuby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>; and K-GECO1 and FR-GECO1 are based on <italic>Entacmaea quadricolor</italic> eqFP578-derived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> mKate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. While jRGECO1a, evolved from R-GECO1, is the brightest commonly used red GECI, it is still more than three times dimmer than GCaMP6s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and although RCaMP3, the successor to jRGECO1a, is brighter than other red GECIs, it is still dim compared to green GECIs like GCaMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Based on circularly permuted mApple (cpmApple), jRGECO1a exhibits photoswitching under blue light, which complicates its use in combination with other tools, as blue-light excitation can falsely increase its brightness without reflecting actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes. The same issue applies to the recently developed RCaMP3, which, despite being the brightest red GECI reported to date, is unsuitable for all-optical applications due to persistent photoswitching under blue light illumination. Additionally, red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors based on R-GECO (mApple based), such as jRGECO1a, R-CaMP2 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>), XCaMP-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and RCaMP3 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>), inherit not only the photoswitching, but also all suffer from lysosomal accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, limiting their use in combined imaging and optogenetic experiments.</p><p id="P4">Developing new red-shifted GECIs is therefore crucial to overcome these limitations. One promising candidate fluorescence protein for the development of red-shifted GECIs is mScarlet, known for its enhanced brightness and minimal photoswitching behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. First published in 2016, mScarlet quickly gained popularity as a red-fluorescent marker protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This protein, composed of 232 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26.4 kDa, is similar in size to other red fluorescent proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; however, it differs significantly in important structural properties such as its chromophore orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. mScarlet is one of the brightest known red-fluorescent proteins only outperformed recently by mScarlet3 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>). mScarlet has a quantum yield of about 70%, while other monomeric red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) used in GECIs, such as mApple or mRuby have yields far below 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Additionally, mScarlet demonstrates negligible photoswitching behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.These attributes make mScarlet an excellent candidate for use in optogenetic tools and biosensors. However, possibly due to its limited structural similarity to other RFPs, no GECIs utilizing mScarlet have been developed yet.</p><p id="P6">Here we introduce PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, offering improved signal-to-noise ratio, brightness, photostability, no photoswitching, and an exceptional change in absolute fluorescence upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. We demonstrate its compatibility with blue light optogenetics and simultaneous green fluorescence-based neuromodulator imaging through various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Additionally, we validate PinkyCaMP in two-photon imaging, highlighting its potential for advanced imaging applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of an mScarlet-based GECIs</title><p id="P7">To develop an mScarlet-based GECI, we took inspiration from the design of previously reported GFP- and RFP-based GECIs. As a first step, we screened a large library of circularly permuted mScarlet (cpmScarlet) variants with different lengths and compositions of linkers connecting a calmodulin (CaM)-binding peptide (RS20 derived from R-GECO1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> to the N-terminus and CaM (also derived from R-GECO1) to the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a</xref>). Two promising prototypes were identified and designated as PinkyCaMP0.1a (brighter) and 0.1b (more responsive). To further improve the performance, the two prototypes were subjected to directed evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1b,c</xref>). After 12 rounds of library creation and screening in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which included assaying approximately 6,000 protein variants for brightness and response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we had three promising variants designated as PinkyCaMP0.9a (brighter), PinkyCaMP0.9b (more responsive), and PinkyCaMP0.9c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>; a balance of brightness and responsiveness) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of mScarlet-based GECIs as purified proteins</title><p id="P8">To characterize the biophysical and photophysical properties of PinkyCaMP0.9a,b,c, we first expressed and purified each of the three proteins. Based on this characterization, as well as preliminary cell-based imaging studies, PinkyCaMP0.9c was selected as the best variant for its balance of brightness and responsiveness and renamed as PinkyCaMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e,f</xref> and the results of PinkyCaMP0.9a and 0.9b are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). PinkyCaMP exhibits excitation and emission peaks of 568 and 600 nm, respectively, an absorbance peak of 567 nm, and a high ΔF/F of 15.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). PinkyCaMP has a pKa of 6.83 and 4.24 with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup> respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and an apparent Kd of 54 nM. These results indicate that, relative to other red GECIs, PinkyCaMP has the desirable characteristics of being less sensitive to cytoplasmic pH changes and having higher affinity for Ca2+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4a,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Upon binding to Ca2+, the quantum yield increases from 0.03 to 0.48, and the extinction coefficient decreases from 71,000 M-1cm-1 to 60,000 M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The intrinsic brightness of PinkyCaMP in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state matches that of jRCaMP1a which is the brightest, yet most poorly responsive, red GECI.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Basic characterization of PinkyCaMP in cultured cells</title><p id="P9">To assess brightness of PinkyCaMP in mammalian cells, we expressed PinkyCaMP, jRCaMP1a, jRGECO1a, and RCaMP3 in HEK293T cells. As demonstrated for other GECIs, the inclusion of the bacterial expression plasmid-derived leader sequence (RSET) enhances GECI expression in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and the inclusion of a nuclear export sequence (NES) prevents the mixing of slower or biphasic Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in the nucleus. Thus these two elements were incorporated into the final version of PinkyCaMP for expression and characterization in cultured cells, ex vivo, and in vivo. In HEK293T cells, PinkyCaMP showed a mean baseline fluorescence of 701 ± 71 a.u. and is more than twice as bright as RCaMP3 (292 ± 35 a.u.; p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) and jRGECO1a (294 ± 25 a.u.; p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) and fourteen times brighter than jRCaMP1a (50 ± 4 a.u.; p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Given its mScarlet backbone, PinkyCaMP was hypothesized to have no photoswitching under blue light, which is a crucial feature for multiplexing imaging with other optogenetic tools. Surprisingly, the original description of RCaMP3 13 did not include data on photoswitching despite its jRGECO1a derived origins. To test this, we stimulated HEK293T cells expressing either sensor with 470 nm light (10 ms pulses, 1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). PinkyCaMP displayed no increase in ΔF/F, confirming an absence of photoswitching behavior. In contrast, RCaMP3 exhibited pronounced photoswitching, with ΔF/F increasing up to 0.43 ± 0.04 during stimulation, followed by a subsequent decay in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>, inset).</p><p id="P11">Lastly, we assessed the photostability of PinkyCaMP in comparison to other GECIs. HEK293T cells expressing the sensors were exposed to continuous 560 nm light (1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), and fluorescence decay was recorded and normalized to the peak fluorescence.

It bridges the performance gap between red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and green GECIs like GCaMP. PinkyCaMP is the brightest and most photostable red GECI, free from photoswitching, making it ideal for multicolor imaging and optogenetic compatibility. Compared to established red GECIs like jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it is an order of magnitude brighter with a superior signal-to-noise ratio, enabling effective low-light imaging and consistent long-term signal detection. Its photostability ensures reliable signal tracking, and its lack of photoswitching makes it an excellent choice for multiplexing, such as dual-color imaging or optogenetic experiments. However, we found that orange light excitation of PinkyCaMP can still cause residual activation of sensitive blue-light opsins, such as CoChR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This could be circumvented by using more red-shifted excitation (&gt; 590 nm) for PinkyCaMP or further blue-shifted channelrhodopsins could benefit multiplexing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. As a red GECI, PinkyCaMP operates at wavelengths that typically result in lower tissue scattering, phototoxicity and autofluorescence, which will be in general advantageous for deep-tissue imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

PinkyCaMP kinetics are comparable to jRCaMP1a, but it outperforms jRCaMP1a in terms of brightness, photostability and signal-to-noise. In the future, PinkyCaMP would benefit from modifications to support applications requiring faster temporal dynamics. The slow kinetics of PinkyCaMP that we observed is likely due to its high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity. However, the current PinkyCaMP version seems ideal for neurons with sparse activity, where it will allow the detection of single events with high sensitivity. Additionally, PinkyCaMP has a relatively high sensitivity to calcium compared to other GECIs, which might lead to calcium buffering when overexpressed. This can likely be mitigated by carefully titrating the amount of virus and expression profile.</p><p id="P25">The next challenge will be to improve PinkyCaMP’s kinetics to match other GECIs. A feasible approach for this could be to exchange the RS20 peptide with either the ENSOP or ckkap peptide, as it has already been done for jGCaMP8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Despite these limitations, PinkyCaMP enables easy imaging alongside other green GECIs or fluorescent biosensors in multi-color experiments and facilitates multiplexing with optogenetic tools.

The sections were washed (3x 10 min, 1x PBS) and incubated with secondary ABs (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, 1:500; catalog no. 703-545-155, Jackson laboratories and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat, 1:500; catalog no. 31226, Invitrogen, conjugated in-house) for 3h at RT. Finally, the sections were washed again (2x 10 min, 1x PBS) and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, diluted in blocking solution with factor 1:10’000, 1x 10 min) before mounting on microscope slides using Hydromount (catalog no. HS-106, National Diagnostics).</p><p id="P58">A 2x2 tiled image of each dentate gyrus was taken from both hemispheres in all sections at a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axio Imager LSM 800, Zeiss) using a 25x oil-immersion objective (i LCI Plan-Neofluar 25x/0.8 IMM Korr DIC M27, Zeiss). Four z-stacks tile images at a resolution (pre-stitching) 1024x1024 pixel resolution were acquired. The Smart Setup function of the ZEN microscopy software (version 2.6, blue edition) was used to determine the optimal acquisition settings for the fluorophores used (DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488 (vGAT neurons), mScarlet (PinkyCaMP) and Alexa Fluor 647 (cFOS)). Each channel was acquired sequentially. For the overview image of PinkyCaMP expression, a 10x air objective (Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45 M27, Zeiss) was used. Only DAPI and mScarlet channels were used and no z-stack was acquired at 1024x1024 pixels per image tile.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Data analysis, quantification, statistic and reproducibility</title><p id="P59">To determine biophysical properties of the purified protein fluorescence intensity as a function of pH was then fitted by a sigmoidal function to determine the pKa. For Kd measurements. Fluorescence intensities versus [Ca2+] were plotted and fitted by a sigmoidal function to calculate the apparent Kd value for the purified protein.Calcium imaging data obtained in HEK cells were analyzed using ImageJ(Schindelin et al. 2012). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around individual cells in the field of view, with an additional ROI used to measure the background fluorescence. The fluorescent brightness of each cell was calculated by subtracting the mean gray value of the background ROI from that of the cell ROI. Analysis was performed in ImageJ, with ROIs drawn as described above. ΔF/F values were calculated using the formula: ΔF/F= (F-F0)/F0 where F0 represents the fluorescence intensity of the first frame, and F represents the fluorescence intensity at a given time point. Statistical analysis was conducted in Python using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. To asses brightness fluorescence values were background-subtracted and normalized to the peak fluorescence for each respective sensor. The half-decay time (τ1/2) was determined by fitting a single-exponential decay curve to the mean fluorescence trace and extrapolating the time point at which the fluorescence decreased to half its initial value. All calculations were performed using Python. For multiplexing experiments ΔF/F Ca2+ traces were extracted from manually selected ROIs using the following equation: (F – F0)/F0 where F0 is the 3s median fluorescence before the first stimulus (field stimulation or photoexcitation of CoChR) is applied. Stimuli (type and pulse number) were performed randomly. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 10. 11 Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Clampfit 11 (both Molecular Devices). Cells were excluded from the analysis if the access resistance was above 25 MΩ or if the holding current exceeded 250 pA at -70mV holding potential. Cells were always patched randomly without any preselection by fluorescence. Calcium imaging data were analyzed using ImageJ(Schindelin et al. 2012). Briefly, ΔF/F Ca2+ traces were extracted from manually selected ROIs using the following equation: (F – F0)/F0 where F0 is the 3s median fluorescence before the first stimulus (field stimulation or photoexcitation of CoChR) is applied. Stimuli (type and pulse number) were performed randomly. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 10.</p><p id="P60">For the analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cortical slice cultures data were processed in FIJI 2.16.0 (Schindelin et al. 2012). The images were further binned to 256x256 pixels and transformed to 32-bit. First, a region of interest (ROI) was defined by drawing a single polygon across the part of the slice which appeared focused, showed clear fluorescence above background and responses during synchronous network activity. A second region showing only membrane from the inserts was defined to obtain the background signal. The mean intensity value of the background region at t=0 was subtracted from all pixels in all images across the whole movie. Then a baseline fluorescence (F0) image was obtained for each stack by averaging 10 images at an early time point that showed fluorescence close to baseline (minimal intensity). Last, using the ImageJ image calculator, the stacks were converted to ΔF/F0 stacks. For further analysis, the mean ΔF/F0 signal of the ROI was transferred to Clampfit 11.2 (Molecular Devices). Data were collected in Excel Professional Plus 2019 (Microsoft) and statistically analyzed and plotted in OriginPro 2023 (OriginLab Corporation). Not all data sets were normally distributed and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05) was performed on all data followed by a Dunn`s multiple comparison. Figures were assembled in CorelDraw 2018 (Corel Corporation). For each sensor data were obtained from at least four independent transductions. Movies, which showed a focus shift, movement, unusual event heterogeneity or baseline drifts were not analyzed further. We also excluded single slices with unusually high or low baseline fluorescence intensity (F0) deviating &gt;10-fold from the mean. All slices showed ΔF/F0 changes, which report on global synchronous network activity (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). The measured intensity changes reflect bursts of epileptiform network activity and they were identified as separate events, if the signal returned to around 50% compared to baseline. The event frequency was determined by counting the number of events in the first 300 s of each movie. To avoid undersampling because of slow calcium dynamics or sensor kinetics, only slices with event frequencies between 0.05 to 0.25 Hz were taken into account (cp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5f</xref>).</p><p id="P61">Quantified brightness values give the mean F0 signal (background-subtracted, see above) of the ROI. The relative signal change is reported as the peak ΔF/F0 value of the first 20 events that were identified in each slice. The absolute signal strength of these events was calculated by multiplying their peak ΔF/F0 value with the mean brightness (F0) of the corresponding slice. Time constants τ of the signal decays were obtained by fitting single exponentials to the decay region. For determining the photostability (bleaching) in each slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>), the average baseline intensity (offset from exponential fits) after the first four events at the beginning of the recording and after four events close to 10 min recording time was determined. Then the obtained baseline intensities from the beginning were subtracted from the 10 min values and multiplied by 100 (to give %). Photoswitching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>) describes the difference in baseline fluorescence intensity after blue-light illumination (measured within 0.1 s after the LED was turned off) compared to before blue-light illumination (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Here, up to three measurements were averaged per slice, however, stimuli that were directly followed by a synchronous event were excluded.</p><p id="P62">For acute brain slices regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn around visible somas and a random section of neuropil. For PinkyCaMP, the neuropil signal was scaled by a factor of 0.7 (as described previously53)before being subtracted from the somatic signal. To account for photobleaching and artifacts, an exponential decay was fitted to each ROI and subtracted, followed by applying a rolling median with a five-frame window. The maximum ΔF/F of each cell was recorded and averaged to compare responses at different stimulation frequencies. All data was statistically analyzed with a Shapiro-Wilk test and Mann-Whiney U test in GraphPad Prism.</p><p id="P63">RCaMP3, recordings required a much higher light intensity (11.83 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). Both sensors were measured under these conditions during 2 Hz and 5 Hz stimulation. Due to RCaMP3’s neuropil signal magnitude exceeding that of the somas, neuropil subtraction was omitted to prevent the appearance of negative responses (data not shown).</p><p id="P64">For 5 Hz stimulation, we compared the maximum ΔF/F averaged across cells, brightness: calculated as the mean fluorescence of cells in the first frame and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): was defined as the maximum ΔF/F divided by the mean standard deviation of the one-second pre-stimulus baseline between PinkyCaMP and RCaMP3. Statistical comparisons of these metrics were performed using Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality and Mann-Whitney U tests in GraphPad Prism.</p><p id="P65">For cFOS Image Analysis Bit-plane Imaris (Oxford instruments, version 10.2.0) was used to process, analyze and quantify granule cell (GC) cFOS expression. First, the surface creation tool was used to mask the GC layer visualized by DAPI. The parameters for surface creation were a surface grain size of 2 μm and a threshold for absolute intensity of the signal &gt; 29.1 (a.u.). This surface was used to mask the cFOS channel, so as to restrict the cFOS positive (+) cells counted to the detected GC layer. Finally, the spot detection algorithm was used on the mask to automatically detect the number of cFOS+ cells. The parameters used were an estimated cell diameter of 8 μm and a quality above 11.8, where quality is a measure of signal intensity. The volume of the GC layer, as well as the number of detected cFOS spots were extracted and further analyzed using R on R-studio (ver. 4.0.4 and 1.4.1106 respectively). To compute the number of cFOS+ GCs, the GC number per image was estimated using the reported numerical density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The cFOS fraction was calculated by dividing the cFOS+ cells by the estimated GCs per image. Finally, cFOS was reported as a ratio between the 488 nm irradiated (ipsilateral) vs contralateral side.</p><p id="P66">For data analysis of dual color fiber photometry, a custom Python script was developed following the guidelines that have previously been outlined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

Detection of cell bodies and source-separation was performed using the CaImAn algorithm based on constrained non-negative matrix factorization56. ΔF/F Ca2+ traces were extracted from detected ROIs using the following equation: (F – F0)/F0, where F0 is the minimum 8th quantile of a rolling window of 200 frames. Ca2+ imaging traces were processed and analyzed using Gaussian process regression (GPR)57–59 to obtain a smooth approximation of the fluorescence signal over time. Peaks in the GPR-predicted traces were identified and characterized by fitting an exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) function60. Metrics such as peak amplitude were extracted for each identified peak. Baseline fluorescence was calculated as the average of the 10th percentile of fluorescence values during the baseline window (10–45 s) For all following distribution analysis, a filter was applied to only select transients with &gt;20% ΔF/F. For each cell the number of Ca2+ transients per minute (&gt;20% ΔF/F) were calculated. To ensure reproducibility61, the analysis pipeline was implemented in Python and details of the computational environment and dependencies are provided. Additionally, 129 representative unitary events were selected by hand and extracted from ΔF/F Ca2+ traces with an amplitude of at least 60% ΔF/F using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). Rise time was calculated from these events using the 10-90% time interval of onset until peak of the respective event transient.</p><p id="P68">Statistical analysis, and graph preparation were carried out using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). To test for normal distribution of data, D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was used. Statistical significance for groups of two normally distributed data sets paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests were applied. One-way ANOVA with Šídák’s multiple comparison test was performed on data sets larger than two, if normally distributed. If not indicated differently, data are represented as mean ± SEM. Chosen sample sizes were similar to commonly used ones in the community. We did not predetermine the sample size.
