This conceptual dichotomy is explained by the assumption that all synaptic plasticity is generated via either electrical and/or biochemical signaling. Here, we challenge this dogma by revealing an activity-dependent presynaptic response that is physical in nature. We show that dynamic filopodia emerge during action potential discharge and transiently deform synaptic boutons to enhance connectivity. Filopodia generation requires neuronal activity, calcium and actin, and occurs in intact brain circuits and human brain. Mechanistically, their extension preserves synchronous neurotransmitter release by increasing presynaptic membrane tension. However, filopodia generation becomes maladaptive during dysregulated brain activity, exacerbating seizures <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we provide direct evidence that presynaptic mechanical forces determine the extent and timing of synaptic signals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Sustained synaptic transmission relies on the recycling of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), a process that involves a continuous and often extremely rapid flux of membrane material at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Despite this constant flow of membranes, the prevailing view is that synaptic boutons preserve their structural integrity over long periods of time (days and months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The only reported structural plasticity at presynapses involves bouton formation/elimination, and modest size variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), processes that can be enhanced by synaptic activity and in turn modulate synaptic strength. The limited evidence for activity-dependent structural plasticity within mature synaptic boutons contrasts with the established role of slow, large-scale axonal expansion in circuit refinement during development and in several epilepsy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Any structural changes result in a redistribution of forces across the cell membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Membrane tension, defined as the membrane’s ability to resist deformations, is emerging as a global coordinator of cell and tissue physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Its regulation at the presynapse is particularly pertinent, as tension plays a key mechanical role in the reciprocal control of exocytosis and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In this context, elevated membrane tension accelerates exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Conversely, repeated SV fusion at release sites reduces membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), weakening the mechanical force driving exocytosis and depressing release rates. SV endocytosis is believed to mitigate this by retrieving SV membranes post-fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). However, high-capacity SV endocytosis modes are comparatively slower than exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Furthermore, the membrane retrieval efficiency of ultrafast endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) during repeated fusion, especially at high firing rates, remains uncertain. This indicates a deficit in existing models of presynaptic plasticity that describe the coupling of SV exocytosis and endocytosis, suggesting that crucial physiological mechanisms may remain undetected.</p><p id="P5">Here, we present data challenging the concept that synaptic boutons are structurally stable elements of the nervous system. Using high-resolution, fast optical imaging of synaptic boutons during neurotransmission, combined with “zap-and-freeze” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and serial-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that transient presynaptic sprouting is a universal feature of neurotransmitter-releasing synapses. This form of structural plasticity involves localized SV fusion with the tip of dynamically growing and retracting filopodia. Activity-induced filopodia formation is triggered by various neuronal firing rates and enhances neuronal wiring capacity by establishing transient connections, termed kinapses, with postsynaptic structures. Furthermore, functional analyses revealed that filopodia increase presynaptic membrane tension, safeguarding SV fusion rates and the synchronicity of neurotransmitter release during repeated fusion. Finally, we provide <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence implicating this mechanism in the regulation of seizure activity.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Presynaptic filopodia – ubiquitous structural remodelling in response to neuronal activity</title><p id="P6">To assess presynaptic structural changes during synaptic transmission, we labelled the membrane of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons by expressing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-EGFP (GPI-EGFP). For parallel monitoring of SV fusion and retrieval, we co-expressed the red pH-sensitive probe synaptophysin-mOrange2 (SypmOr2), which reports SV fusion as an increase in fluorescence and SV endocytosis as a decrease. High resolution time-lapse imaging revealed that 44% of the presynapses responsive to electrical field stimulation (600 action potentials, AP, at 40Hz), formed extended filopodial protrusions (Movie 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). These filopodia were exclusive to active synapses, with an exceptionally high percentage (78%) enclosing SV fusion events within their structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The discovery of these previously undetected alterations in presynaptic structure suggested that these events may be restricted to periods of exceptionally high activity. To determine this, we challenged neurons with two additional stimulation protocols: 600AP, 5Hz, an identical stimulation load but with reduced frequency, and 40AP, 20Hz, which selectively mobilizes the subset of SVs physically attached to the plasma membrane (the readily releasable pool, RRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Both protocols generated filopodia, although with variations in morphology, number, or lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D to J</xref>). At 600AP, 40Hz, 47% of filopodia formed and disappeared during or within 15 seconds (sec) after stimulation, termed transient filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D and J</xref>). This ratio remained consistent at 600AP, 5Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, E and J</xref>), but substantially increased at 40AP, 20Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, F and J</xref>), suggesting that prolonged neuronal activity stabilizes presynaptic filopodia. With shorter stimulation trains (40AP, 20Hz), fewer filopodia per axon length were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Morphologically, filopodia showed a slight reduction in length at lower stimulation frequencies (600AP, 5Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), but maintained consistent shape across stimulation paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). These results suggest that presynaptic filopodia form during repeated SV fusion, irrespective of stimulation load or frequency, with their stability dependent on the duration of neuronal activity.</p><p id="P8"><bold>Link to Movie 1:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/7793">https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/7793</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>Movie 1</label><title>Activity-induced filopodia form at the presynapse and enclose SV fusion</title><p id="P9">Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with GPI-EGFP and SypmOr2.

First, we suppressed neuronal network activity using a combination of the ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers, APV (2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione). In parallel, we increased neuronal excitability by treating the neurons with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which offers the advantage of inducing stable and spontaneous seizure-like events <italic>in vitro</italic> while also demonstrating robust convulsant properties <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In these experiments presynaptic membrane dynamics were visualized with the red membrane protein GPI-Apple, with neuronal activity along axons simultaneously monitored via the calcium-sensitive indicator GCaMP6f. No spontaneous calcium spikes or filopodia formation were detected in APV/CNQX-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, A and B</xref>). In contrast, 4-AP induced propagation of calcium transients that spatially and temporally coincided with a spread of filopodia (Movie 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, C to G</xref>). Importantly, there was a robust temporal coupling between individual calcium spikes and filopodia extension, confirming its activity-dependent nature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, D to F</xref>). Furthermore, the comparable ratio of transient versus (vs) stable filopodia in 4-AP-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>), with electrical field stimulation confirms this protocol is physiologically relevant.</p><p id="P12"><bold>Link to Movie 2:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/7794">https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/7794</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="S3"><label>Movie 2</label><title>Temporal coupling of axonal calcium responses and filopodia formation</title><p id="P13">Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with GPI-Apple (red) and GCaMP6f (green) and were incubated with 100 μM 4-AP for 30 min.

Therefore, to explore filopodial ultrastructural morphology, we combined “zap-and-freeze” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) of primary hippocampal cultures with serial-section TEM and subsequent 3D reconstructions of axonal segments. The protocol involved electrical field stimulation of primary hippocampal neurons (600AP, 40Hz), followed by high-pressure freezing milliseconds after stimulation. This approach allowed an effective capture of filopodia for ultrastructural characterization.</p><p id="P15">Eleven presynaptic boutons containing filopodia were 3D reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Consistent with our live imaging data, filopodia displayed variable morphology and length, appearing as elongated extensions of the presynapse, each carrying a heterogeneous number of SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). The SVs within the filopodia showed a relatively uniform distribution with only a slightly reduced density near the tip, suggesting possible passive transport from the presynaptic bouton through the filopodia lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). This result supports our observation from live imaging, demonstrating that filopodia carry SVs capable of undergoing fusion within them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>). Interestingly, 73% of the reconstructed filopodia also contained endosomes. Their distribution varied within filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), with some concentrated at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, filopodium 1) and others along the filopodial core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, filopodium 2, 4, 7, 8 and 11) or base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, filopodium 9 and 10). These individual examples likely represent different stages in the recruitment or generation of endosomes within filopodia. Since endosomes are integral to sorting and directing cellular debris for degradation, we hypothesize that endosomes are a consequence of retrieving the membrane of contracting filopodia.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Presynaptic filopodia are key in establishing dynamic synaptic connectivity</title><p id="P16">Filopodia exclusively emerge from synaptic boutons during synaptic activity as indicated by the co-localization with SypmOr2 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>). To validate their synaptic localization, we investigated their co-localization with two additional presynaptic markers: Bassoon (Bsn), a constituent of the cytomatrix of the active zone, and vGAT, a marker for inhibitory presynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In parallel, we examined their co-localization with postsynaptic AMPA receptors containing GluA subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">First, we performed a post-hoc analysis to assess the co-localization of the synapses from which filopodia emerge and filopodia themselves with the synaptic markers. Analyses revealed that 81% of synapses forming filopodia contained a Bsn signal, with 46% of filopodia showing a Bsn signal along their core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and D</xref>). A notable portion of synapses forming filopodia were vGAT-positive (30%), and 30% of filopodia contained vGAT along their central axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, B and E</xref>). Furthermore, 59% of synapses forming filopodia were Glu-A positive, and 50% of filopodia overlapped with Glu-A puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, C and F</xref>). These findings confirm the synaptic origin of filopodia at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and indicate that they serve as extensions of the presynapse, potentially facilitating connections to postsynaptic structures.</p><p id="P18">Next, we examined the dynamic 3D co-localization of filopodia with GluA-labelled postsynapses through real-time live imaging during field stimulation (600AP, 40Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, G to I</xref>). The assessment of the number of co-localizing GPI-EGFP-GluA objects and volumes showed a statistically significant increase in overlap during filopodia extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, H and I</xref>). This suggests that the formation of filopodia provides the presynapse with the capacity to establish temporary multisynaptic connections. We term these dynamic connections “neuronal kinapses” (a combination of movement (kine-) and fastening (-apse)). Therefore, filopodia formation is a form of short-term structural synaptic plasticity that can transiently modify connectivity in response to AP discharge.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Filopodia formation requires actin polymerization but is not dependent on SV exocytosis</title><p id="P19">We have demonstrated that neuronal activity triggers filopodia generation, with SV fusion events detected in most of these structures. However, there were instances of filopodia where no SypmOr2 signal could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>). Therefore, we next assessed whether filopodia formation is dependent on either or both SV fusion and/or calcium influx, via two different strategies that decouple these events. First, we triggered activity- and calcium-independent SV fusion by applying a 5-sec hypertonic sucrose pulse (500mM), which elicits fusion of RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This stimulus triggered a minor enlargement of synapses without the development of elongated protrusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, A and B</xref>), in contrast to RRP mobilization by an electrical field stimulus, where robust filopodia generation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, F to J</xref>). Second, we used tetanus toxin (TeTN) treatment to block SV fusion by cleaving synaptobrevin2 (syb2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, C to H</xref>), a key component of the vesicular Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor complex. Importantly, activity-dependent calcium influx is not impacted by this maneuver. TeTN did not affect filopodia shape but reduced both filopodia number and the average length of individual filopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, F to H</xref>). Importantly, despite complete blockade of evoked SypmOr2 responses by TeTN, activity-induced filopodia formation persisted unperturbed in some neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, E and F</xref>). These data demonstrate that SV fusion alone is not sufficient to initiate filopodia formation and point to the critical role of neuronal activity and calcium influx for their emergence. Nevertheless, SV fusion may contribute to filopodia elongation, likely through membrane addition.</p><p id="P20">The formation of presynaptic protrusions involves extensive plasma membrane deformations, which we reasoned would require a coordinated reorganization of the underlying cytoskeleton. The rearrangement of cortical actin is necessary for the exertion of protrusive forces, that push the membrane forward. To determine if presynaptic filopodia contain a network of actin filaments, we co-expressed LifeAct-Ruby together with GPI-EGFP and visualized actin dynamics during activity-induced filopodia formation. Axons, including putative en-passant synaptic boutons, were filled with filamentous actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, J and K</xref>). LifeAct-Ruby-labelled actin filaments were detected in nearly all filopodia (92%) formed in response to field stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>). Certain actin filaments within the filopodia displayed continuity, seamlessly integrating the filopodial core into the actin meshwork of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>, white arrows). Conversely, some actin filaments displayed a more intermittent pattern, treadmilling along the filopodial extension trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>, yellow arrows). These results strongly suggest that the elongation of presynaptic filopodia is tightly associated with the <italic>de novo</italic> growth of actin filaments.</p><p id="P21">To confirm a key role for actin polymerization in filopodia elongation, we disrupted pathways regulating actin dynamics. To this end, we used SMIFH2, an inhibitor of formin-driven actin polymerization which impacts invagination-driven presynaptic clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Our array of inhibitors included EIPA and its slightly less potent analogue amiloride, both specifically selected for their ability to target actin-rich membrane ruffles with high selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). To probe the dynamin-dependence of filopodia assembly, we also used dynasore, a potent inhibitor of this GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The number of filopodia formed in response to field stimulation served as an indicator of inhibition efficacy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Our analyses revealed that SMIFH2 moderately reduced filopodia numbers, whereas EIPA and amiloride virtually abolished their formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, A and B</xref>). SMIFH2 reduced filopodia length but filopodial shape remained unaffected by the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, C and D</xref>). Dynasore showed no significant impact on the number or morphology of activity-induced filopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, A to D</xref>). The interventions also had no significant effect on the ratio of stable-to-transient filopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>).

Therefore, artificially reducing membrane tension via application of hypertonic sucrose phenocopies the impact of filopodia inhibition on SV fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, D and E</xref>), confirming that the SV fusion rate is highly sensitive to membrane tension and slows under reduced tension.</p><p id="P32">To evaluate the impact of inhibiting filopodia formation on wider synaptic performance, we monitored both evoked neurotransmitter release and intracellular calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, K to N</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, F and G</xref>).

The stimulation train triggered a robust synchronous iGluSnFRA184S response in control neurons, only occasionally followed by asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, K to N</xref>). In contrast, in neurons treated with EIPA and amiloride, the amplitude of the collective synchronous response to 40AP was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, L and M</xref>).

No presynaptic structural changes and no extensive fluctuations in the Fura Red fluorescence signals were observed in slices that had their electrical activity silenced by APV+CNQX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). In contrast, in 53% of the slices treated with 4-AP, we identified synaptic boutons with dynamic filopodia-like extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), which had a slightly shorter average length than in dissociated neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>).

Quantification of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes at several stimulus intensities showed no difference between control and EIPA-treated slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), indicating that the ability of presynaptic stimuli to evoke postsynaptic responses is not affected by the treatment.

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduced rate of repeated SV fusion due to filopodia inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, A to C</xref>), leads to an accelerated rundown of synchronous synaptic transmission. The high frequency stimulation protocol also triggered asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>), which persisted after the presynaptic firing had ceased.

SV fusion occurs within filopodia, which also establish connections with postsynaptic structures, thereby enhancing the neuronal wiring plasticity during AP discharge. As a result of these observations, we have termed these transient contacts kinetic synapses - kinapses. Furthermore, we show that these protrusions elevate membrane tension at the presynapse, a critical mechanical factor that regulates the kinetics of exocytosis.

The emergence of filopodia counteracts this by raising membrane tension, thereby preventing a decline in SV exocytosis rates, and promoting synchronous neurotransmitter release. Prior research demonstrated rapid tension propagation along axons in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), but this process is slower in specialized presynaptic terminals, covering a few micrometers in a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).

Therefore, our study shifts the concept of synapse stability towards that of metastability. During synaptic transmission, the development of filopodia enables the presynapse to transiently extend from the axonal shaft and produce more widespread excitation and inhibition. Multi-synaptic boutons, where one synaptic bouton interfaces with multiple postsynaptic spines across different neurons, are common throughout the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Here we report a novel mode of synaptic connectivity underpinned by the transient contacts of the sprouting nerve terminal with multiple postsynaptic targets. We name this dynamic and temporary interaction between pre- and postsynaptic neurons a “neuronal kinapse”, drawing an analogy to the brief contacts between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Furthermore, presynaptic filopodia displayed diverse dynamics, with approximately half disappearing during or shortly after stimulation, while the other half stabilized. These persistent filopodia could potentially establish stable synaptic connections or promote collateral axon branching, thereby contributing to adult morphogenesis. This concept provides a new framework for interpreting synaptic plasticity in the context of both physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p id="P47">Seizures trigger significant structural and functional changes in neuronal circuits. A prominent example is mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>), which results in the formation of recurrent excitatory circuits that promote epileptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Presynaptic filopodia formation is essentially a transient small-scale sprouting that can also contribute to the maladaptive remodelling of neuronal circuits. In support, inhibiting filopodia formation with EIPA resulted in increased asynchronous glutamate release, which in turn was associated with a decrease in ictal-like discharges in a 4-AP <italic>in vitro</italic> model of acute seizures, and a reduction of seizure severity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that presynaptic filopodia can increase excitability through two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, they transiently increase synaptic connectivity. Secondly, they modify the mechanical properties of the release sites, maintaining high SV fusion rates during excessive AP discharge. Both mechanisms promote a hypersynchronous state, which is assumed to underlie the abnormal coupling of hyperactive neuronal populations, leading to the onset of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), although the relationship is not linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). In contrast, desynchronization leads to the functional isolation of these populations and restricts epileptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). An increase in asynchronous neurotransmitter release upon inhibition of filopodia can lead to desynchronization of neuronal circuit activity by lowering the signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic signals and distorting their temporal integration within the network. These results suggest that presynaptic filopodia can establish positive feedback loops within neuronal circuits. Their emergence promotes excessive excitation, triggering further filopodia growth, which ultimately results in hyperexcitability. This process could serve as one of the foundational explanations for the “seizures beget seizures” theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>).

A fresh stock solution of 20% Pluronic F-127 in DMSO was prepared using sonication. The calcium loading solution was prepared by mixing Fura Red AM (30 μM) and Pluronic F-127 (0.065%) in carbongenated standard aCSF. The brain slices were covered with the calcium loading solution and incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 45-60 min in a cell culture incubator. After incubation, the dye solution was replaced with fresh aCSF to prevent dye overload. The slices were then incubated with either 100 μM 4-AP or a combination of 50 μM APV and 10 μM CNQX for additional 30 min prior to live imaging for 5 minutes in the presence of the inhibitors.</p><p id="P89">Brain slices loaded with Fura Red AM were placed in an imaging chamber mounted on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Superficial cortical layers with sparsely EGFP-labelled axons and putative synaptic boutons were selected for imaging. Time-lapse imaging was performed at 35-37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, using a resonant scanner over a 5 min period. A 40x Plan Fluor/NA 1.3 oil objective was used for imaging. Image stacks (typically, 50-70 sections, spaced 0.125μm apart) were acquired at a speed of ~0.07Hz. Confocal settings were adjusted to a 1024 x 1024-pixel resolution, 12-bit dynamic range, and 4.0 optical zoom, achieving a final pixel size of 0.04 μm. Dual excitation of EGFP and Fura Red at 488 nm was implemented, with emissions collected at 525/50 nm for EGFP and 595/50 nm for Fura Red. The interaction of Fura Red with cytoplasmic calcium reduced its excitation efficiency at 488 nm, decreasing its emission at ~650 nm.</p><p id="P90">All time-lapse series of image stacks were deconvolved with Huygens Professional version 23.04 (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://svi.nl">http://svi.nl</ext-link>). A Gaussian filter with (sigma: 4.0) was applied to the Fura Red channel in ImageJ to enhance the signal and minimize background noise. Synaptic boutons marked by Fura Red were inspected for fluorescence decreases, serving as a proxy for calcium dynamics through kymographs in ImageJ. The data used to generate kymographs were scaled multiple times to enhance visual clarity.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>High-pressure freezing and freeze substitution</title><p id="P91">High-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze substitution (FS) were performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>).

Data analysis was performed using custom ImageJ macros and Python scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). The AZ was defined as the presynaptic membrane facing PSD. Docked SVs were those whose outer membrane contacted the AZ membrane. The distribution of cytosolic SVs was measured by calculating the shortest distance to the AZ membrane, and SV diameters were determined by fitting a circle to the outer membrane. Endosome-like structures were identified as spherical (diameter &gt;60 nm) or tubular structures with a single outer membrane and a clear lumen.</p><p id="P97">For 3D EM, brightfield images were captured of stimulated (600AP, 40Hz) HPF/FS samples and candidate regions of fine axons selected for TEM (Zeiss AxioImager Z2). Samples were then glued to a resin block, trimmed with blades and glass knives, and ribbons of serial 70 nm-thick ultrathin sections cut (Leica Ultracut 7 ultramicrotome) and collected onto formvar/carbon-coated single slot copper grids. Grids were contrasted with Uranyless and 3% lead citrate before imaging. TEM images were acquired using a 12-sample carousel and annular scanning TEM (aSTEM) detector housed inside a Zeiss Gemini 360 field emission scanning electron microscope. Serial images from 3 samples were used to find 11 filopodia on 5 axons and then to trace filopodia (split into 200 nm segments from the tip), parent axons, endosomes, vesicles, mitochondria and filaments using ImageJ (TrakEM2 plugin). These tracings were used to create 2D images, 3D reconstructions and to measure segment volumes of filopodia and endosome volumes to calculate endosome fractions (% of segment volume).

Whole-cell configuration was achieved within a CA1 pyramidal neuron by use of negative pressure to rupture the cell membrane. Synaptic properties were tested in voltage clamp as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Briefly, the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was first tested in response to series of single 50 μs stimulation pulses (100 – 10000 μA). The stimulation intensity was then set to give an EPSC of approximate 200 pA. Presynaptic properties were then examined through a tetanic stimulation protocol of 600 pulses at 40 Hz.

To calculate metrics from these experiments, a representative single event template was generated by averaging multiple events from a control DMSO recording. Events were classed as a single continuous ictal period where the interevent interval between two consecutive events was less than 5 s. Total ictal period was calculated as the summation of the duration all ictal periods, and interictal period encompassed the duration within the recording not classed as an ictal period following the onset of the first detected event.

To assess the protective effects of EIPA (5mg/kg) and carbamazepine (20mg/kg) against the behavioral effects induced by 4-AP, these drugs were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before 4-AP. DMSO served as a vehicle control. All drugs were prepared in 0.9% saline. Mice were placed in a testing arena, and their behavioral responses were monitored for 30 minutes post 4-AP injection with both top and side video cameras. Seizure intensity was evaluated using a modified Racine scale: 1. sudden behavioral arrest; 2. head nodding and facial jerking; 3. clonus of one forelimb (sitting); 4. clonus of both forelimbs (sitting); 5. clonic, tonic-clonic seizure (lying on belly); 6. clonic, tonic-clonic seizure with wild running and jumping; 7. tonic extensions, possibly resulting in respiratory arrest and death.
