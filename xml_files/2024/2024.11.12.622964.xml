This is particularly true within the context of pleural mesothelioma, in which there are many recent preclinical developments and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TEAD inhibitors. The range of inhibitors have shown great promise, but comparisons of their performances are so far limited. Here we develop a high content pipeline that enables a comparative analysis of currently developed YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors. We take advantage of isogenic cellular models that enable us to examine inhibitor specificity. We identify genetic compensation of the Hippo pathway transcriptional module, with implications for therapeutic targeting, and implement Cell Painting to develop a detailed morphological profiling pipeline that enables further characterisation, quantification, and analysis of off-target effects. Our pipeline is scalable and allows us to establish specificity and comparative potency within cancer relevant assays in a clinically relevant cellular model.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Pleural mesothelioma is an asbestos induced cancer of the mesothelial lining of the lung and the deadliest cancer after diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Patients have a bleak outlook as many are diagnosed late or with aggressive disease, limiting the efficacy of surgical intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. There are no curative therapies. To this end, therapeutics currently used can be considered palliative care and patients only survive on average for 12-18 months after diagnosis. This highlights a clear and urgent need for the development of targeted therapies and implementation of effective chemotherapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. As a relatively uncommon cancer-type, pleural mesothelioma (PM) is defined by a lack of clear, high penetrance driver mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Despite this, PM is distinct from most common cancers in that genomic perturbations within upstream components of the Hippo pathway are overrepresented within its mutational profile.</p><p id="P3">The Hippo pathway comprises an upstream kinase cascade module, which functions to regulate the activity of the co-transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These, alongside the TEAD family of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, represent the downstream transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway. Since the initial discovery of the signalling pathway as a core regulator of a variety of processes in development, differentiation, and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, YAP and TAZ are implicated as oncogenic drivers across a range of cancer-types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Strikingly, PM is defined by a relatively high frequency of loss-of-function mutations within the upstream regulatory component of the Hippo pathway relative to other cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These mutations include frequent loss-of-function mutations within the upstream Hippo pathway kinase cascade, including most frequently in <italic>NF2</italic>, with more occasional loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SAV1</italic>, <italic>LATS1</italic> and <italic>LATS2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">While designing therapeutics specifically against loss of tumour suppressors has been challenging historically, multiple inhibitors of the TEAD family of transcription factors have recently been developed with the hopes to position for clinical use. The realisation of the development of a range of varied direct inhibitors is an exciting advancement in cancer research, as hyperactive YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity is a widespread phenomenon across many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The majority of the inhibitors developed comprise small molecule disruptors of TEAD auto-palmitoylation, a post translational modification required for the interaction between these transcription factors and YAP/TAZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Following initial preclinical development, some of these promising inhibitors have now progressed to clinical trials, to be positioned as YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors in PM patients. Due to the genomic evidence and frequent dysregulation of the Hippo pathway within PM, combined with both the ineffectiveness of surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and general dearth of effective therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, this cancer-type is the primary focus in the development of these therapeutics.</p><p id="P5">Beyond these selective inhibitors that are currently undergoing testing, there are a variety of indirect inhibitors of YAP/TAZ-TEAD. These comprise a heterogenous range of chemicals, including dasatinib, a Src kinase inhibitor commonly used as an anti-cancer agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, verteporfin, a photosensitiser historically used as a chemical inhibitor of YAP/TAZ activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, as well as statins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, a family of mevalonate pathway inhibitors reported to inhibit YAP/TAZ activity via the disruption of geranylgeranylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We focus on these different therapeutic classes and prioritize a range of inhibitors with a focus on those that have well-documented, potent anti-YAP/TAZ activity. By focusing on a range of both selective and classical, less selective inhibitors, we compare these side-by-side, taking advantage of two separate and complimentary isogenic cellular models to facilitate a direct comparison in the molecular impact of therapeutic families within a clean genetic background.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identifying high potency inhibitors of YAP/TAZ-TEAD</title><p id="P6">With the current focus on YAP-TEAD inhibition in the development of chemotherapeutics for use, especially for the treatment of PM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, three recently developed TEAD inhibitors were selected for testing within cell-lines. This includes VT-107<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and K-975<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, both pan-TEAD inhibitors, and IK-930, a TEAD1-specific inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> that has undergone clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> for the treatment of PM and other tumours associated with perturbations within the Hippo pathway (NCT05228015). A multitude of additional inhibitors of YAP-TAZ/TEAD have in the past been identified through screening approaches and used primarily as tool compounds to probe pre-clinical impacts of Hippo pathway perturbations, as well as undergoing further preclinical development and optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Despite widespread use, most of these have less well-defined mechanisms of action (MoA) and might have YAP-TAZ/TEAD inhibition as a secondary and potential off-target effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. To compare the inhibitory potential of recently developed, on-target TEAD inhibitors to these more classic YAP inhibitors, we included verteporfin, lovastatin, and dasatinib as comparators. Dasatinib is prioritized, as its primary mechanism-of-action as an anti-cancer therapeutic is via its function as a Src and tyrosine kinase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, with Dasatinib’s downstream cellular impact on YAP/TAZ-TEAD appearing likely through the Src-YAP signalling axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Initial testing was focused on the ability of compounds to inhibit cellular TEAD activity. This was analysed via the use of a luciferase reporter regulated by multiple TEAD binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Quantification of TEAD activity upon 24-hour treatment at 1 μM confirmed the ability of almost all tested compounds to inhibit TEAD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>), apart from lovastatin. Interestingly, dasatinib exhibits the most profound inhibition of TEAD activity. In order to validate this effect, we quantified the expression of YAP/TAZ signature genes, as defined by TCGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, on treatment with a selection of these inhibitors. This reveals a modest, though significant, decrease in signature expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>) under the same treatment conditions. Notably, the observed decrease in signature gene expression is TEAD-dependent, with no significant effect evident on treatment in TEAD KO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1A</xref>). This suggests that not only TEAD inhibitors, but also off-target inhibitors such as verteporfin, modulate the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes in a TEAD-dependent manner. Given the difficulties associated in directly targeting YAP/TAZ directly due to their intrinsic disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, these findings reinforce the likelihood that YAP/TAZ may be primarily targetable via their interaction with TEADs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In order to probe the efficacy of candidate compounds within the context of mesothelioma, evaluation was then conducted in a preclinical model of PM driver mutations, with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (KO) of tumour suppressor NF2 in non-malignant, MeT-5A mesothelial cells. This unique isogenic cellular model represents the disease well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and is an ideal platform for interrogating YAP/TAZ-TEAD dynamics and responses to therapeutic inhibition. We have previously shown that the TCGA-defined YAP/TAZ signature gene-set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> is upregulated on NF2 loss in the mesothelial context under cancer-related stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Initial testing focused on the effect of treatment on YAP/TAZ-TEAD mediated transcription via quantifying the expression of these canonical downstream target genes. Computing the expression of this signature reveals that almost all tested inhibitors were sufficient to significantly downregulate the transcription of the full gene-set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>) after 24-hour treatment at 1 μM, reinforcing their abilities to suppress YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity. Interestingly, IK-930, a TEAD1-specific inhibitor, did not decrease signature expression under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity is contingent on nuclear retention of YAP/TAZ, with the upstream kinase component of the Hippo pathway known to phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, leading to subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration and therefore inhibition of these co-transcriptional activators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. To assess the dynamics of YAP/TAZ alongside the observed reduction in YAP/TAZ-TEAD mediated transcription, we next quantified the inhibitory potential of candidate compounds across a range of concentrations in the context of YAP nuclear localisation. YAP was selected as the sole readout of activity here, with cellular TAZ dynamics omitted from study, due to YAP and not TAZ being the prime determinant of tumorigenicity within the MeT-5A cellular model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, as inhibitors are presumed to be cytostatic/cytotoxic and YAP nuclear localisation is reduced under conditions of high cell density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, cells were filtered to those approximating 50% cell-cell contact to limit effects from contact inhibition at either extreme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Although lower potency analogues of VT-107 and K-975 apparently do not impact nuclear YAP retention in mesothelioma cell-line models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and the osteosarcoma U2OS cell-line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> respectively, we identified that the majority of selective TEAD inhibitors tested did modulate YAP localisation 24 hours post-treatment. This effect is observed by increased cytoplasmic/nuclear YAP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1D</xref>), indicating a reduction in the level of transcriptionally active YAP, with the maximal response generally observed at the lowest concentration point included (370 nM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1B</xref>). Reduction in YAP nuclear localisation broadly matches decreased YAP/TAZ signature gene expression, with a clear effect observed when cells were treated with pan-TEAD inhibitors. However, in contrast to its effect on YAP-TEAD gene expression, there was no significant decrease in nuclear YAP with verteporfin treatment, with dasatinib being the prime non-selective inhibitor that induced cytoplasmic retention of YAP in MeT-5A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P10">With the inhibitory potential of these compounds established within MeT-5A cells, we next sought to assess this effect within the context of loss of the tumour suppressor <italic>NF2</italic>. Notably, loss of NF2 had little impact on sensitivity to YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition in terms of expression of YAP/TAZ signature genes, with just a slight decrease in sensitivity to K-975 observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1C</xref>), while NF2 KO cells exhibited slightly enhanced sensitivity to selective TEAD inhibition on YAP nuclear localisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1D</xref>). Though this effect was significant, it was modest, while sensitivity to dasatinib was conversely decreased in NF2 KO cells.</p><p id="P11">YAP’s principal nuclear/cytoplasmic regulation primarily takes place via LATS1/2 mediated inhibitive phosphorylation on five serine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. In order to interrogate the manner with which this YAP inhibition is mediated, we analysed cellular lysates after 24-hour treatment at 370 nM and 1 μM, performing Phos-Tag western-blotting, a sensitive technique that allows for the identification of the phosphorylation state of YAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This shows that dasatinib is the sole tested inhibitor that induces YAP phosphorylation at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1F</xref>), while lovastatin treatment results in YAP phosphorylation only at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1E</xref>). This YAP phosphorylation indicates that dasatinib’s potent inhibitory effect on YAP/TAZ-TEAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1F</xref>), as well as lovastatin’s more modest effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1E</xref>), may be mediated via the core kinase module of the Hippo pathway. To explore this, we conducted Phos-Tag based western-blots using lysates from similarly treated LATS1/2 double knockout (dKO) HEK293A cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Cells lacking LATS1/2 have, as expected, less phosphorylated YAP, indicating nuclear and therefore hyperactive YAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1F</xref>). These cells also show no YAP phosphorylation response to treatment with lovastatin or dasatinib, while cells with intact LATS1/2 exhibit TEAD-independent phosphorylation of YAP on treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1F</xref>). Combined, the results highlight that YAP phosphorylation induced by lovastatin or dasatinib treatment is dependent on LATS1/2 kinases and therefore likely mediated via the Hippo pathway kinase cascade.</p><p id="P12">Interestingly, the increase in phosphorylated YAP observed in NF2 KO MeT-5A cells upon dasatinib treatment is diminished relative to WT MeT-5A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1F-G</xref>). This blunted response is consistent with the decreased sensitivity of NF2 KO cells in YAP nuclear localisation to dasatinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1D</xref>). Considered together, these findings suggest that NF2-loss may result in a resistance to inhibition of YAP/TAZ-TEAD via activation of the Hippo pathway’s core kinase cascade, while leaving NF2-deficient cells similarly vulnerable to TEAD inhibition as compared to those with intact NF2.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition disrupts the tumorigenic potential of <italic>NF2</italic>-deficient mesothelial cells</title><p id="P13">With the activity of the candidate compounds established, we next sought to determine the <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer potential of candidate therapeutics in the context of <italic>NF2</italic>-deficient mesothelioma. Initially, this was assessed by quantifying YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition’s impact on cellular viability. Proliferation assays performed over the course of 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>) revealed that selective TEAD inhibitors generally had little effect on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>). Only VT-107 showed a consistent, though modest, reduction over the course of 72 hours treatment. This was in stark contrast to non-selective inhibitors of YAP, which caused a complete cessation of growth at concentrations &gt;1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">On loss of NF2, sensitivities across all treatments remain almost equivalent to wildtype (WT) MeT-5A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2A</xref>). This is somewhat unexpected, as recent findings have indicated that NF2-deficient mesothelioma cells are more sensitive to TEAD inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Importantly, our studies are conducted on an isogenic background and are therefore not impacted by the complexities of comparing different heterogenous cell lines with varying epigenetic backgrounds and underlying genetic diversity beyond <italic>NF2</italic> status. Combined, these additional factors might modulate sensitivity to TEAD inhibition, obfuscating nuanced molecular dynamics. Interestingly, loss-of-viability induced by non-selective YAP inhibitors appears to be YAP-independent, with YAP KO MeT-5A cells exhibiting similar sensitivities as WT cells to all compounds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>). YAP-independence therefore might explain the initial observation that NF2 KO cells are equally sensitive to dasatinib in terms of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2A</xref>), despite the relative insensitivity in terms of YAP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Given the role of NF2 in regulating YAP/TAZ in response to mechanical stimuli, including contact inhibition, substrate stiffness, and the mechanotransduction mediated by the YAP/TAZ-TEAD axis, we next focused on the establishment of a functional assay capable of quantifying cellular response to these cancer-adjacent mechanical stresses. Previously, we identified NF2 as an upstream mechanoregulator in mesothelial cells, and that mesothelial NF2-loss is sufficient to drive YAP-mediated anchorage-independent growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. As the soft agar assay is challenging to scale up for high-throughput assays, we sought to establish an analogue approach. We therefore implemented a spheroid formation assay to analyse the effects of the selected inhibitors in a scalable manner. When MeT-5A cells are cultured in an ultra-low attachment setting, they readily form spheroids, with spheroids exhibiting less nuclear YAP than cells cultured in 2D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly in spheroids, NF2-loss leads to relatively enhanced nuclear YAP signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2C</xref>), suggesting a resistance to the reduction in nuclear YAP observed in WT spheroids. To assess how these differences in YAP activity may drive distinct spheroid phenotypes, we compared the growth of spheroids with intact NF2 and YAP to those with either KO of NF2 or YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>). In addition to a relative increase in nuclear YAP, there is a concurrent increase in spheroid size in MeT-5A spheroids on loss of NF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, YAP-deficient spheroids exhibit a clear decrease in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2F</xref>). This increased growth observed in NF2-deficient spheroids recapitulates key aspects of the 3D tumour environment and therefore reflects tumorigenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, possibly mediated via enhanced YAP activity.</p><p id="P16">Next, having established a quantifiable cancer-relevant phenotype robustly driven by NF2 loss, we tested spheroid growth in the presence of YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors to quantify the impact of inhibition on the tumorigenic capacity of spheroids. WT MeT-5A cells exhibit partial sensitivity selectively to pan-TEAD inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2G</xref>), with a significant reduction in spheroid growth observed on treatment with VT-107 and K-975 at high concentrations (10 μM).

Beyond sensitivity, our data highlight that NF2 KO cells exhibit a marked decrease in spheroid area, with an enhanced effect observed with on-target TEAD inhibition as compared to indirect YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2E</xref>).

To confirm YAP’s role in driving NF2 KO spheroid formation, YAP was overexpressed in WT MeT-5A cells. We exogenously expressed YAP-5SA, which contains point mutations across five LATS1/2 target residues, rendering YAP non-phosphorylatable by LATS, and therefore hyperactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Expression of YAP-5SA in MeT-5A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>) reveals that hyperactive YAP drives spheroid growth, closely phenocopying NF2 KO spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>). To resolve whether this is driven by TEAD activity targetable via therapeutic inhibition, YAP-5SA spheroids were treated with TEAD-selective inhibitors. Spheroids with hyperactive YAP phenocopy the inhibition observed upon loss of NF2 KO, with enhanced sensitivity to TEAD inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We next assessed spheroid growth in NF2/YAP double knockout (dKO) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>).

As such, NF2/YAP dKO spheroid sizes were restored roughly to those observed in YAP KO spheroids. Taken together, these observations further reinforce the likelihood that YAP is the primary effector of NF2 KO spheroid growth and, given the enhanced sensitivity to TEAD inhibition observed in the presence of hyperactive YAP, may be targetable via inhibiting YAP-TEAD transcription.</p><p id="P20">The TEAD family consists of four proteins in vertebrae, in humans termed TEAD1-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Recent early-stage clinical evaluation has highlighted that pan-TEAD and TEAD isoform specificity might be a defining clinical feature in toxicity and efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The implications of isoform specific or pan-TEAD targeting in cancer is therefore of importance with pan-TEAD likely being more effective, but in general higher risk of toxicity. Assessing TEAD isoform functional importance and drug specificity is therefore critical during drug development to guide optimal clinical responses. These implications prompted us to generate NF2/TEAD isoform specific dKO cells for TEAD isoforms with antibodies available and where TEAD isoforms are robustly expressed and detected in MeT-5A cells. TEAD1 and TEAD4 were specifically recognised and targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>), with both TEAD1 and TEAD4 implicated in the progression and development of various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Notably, TEAD4 loss leads to an increase in protein levels of TEAD1, while loss of either TEAD1 or TEAD4 increases YAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>). This finding has ramifications for mesothelioma, and potential general cancer therapy, given the possibility of compensatory upregulation to counter the inhibition of single components within the pathway. Loss of TEAD1 or TEAD4, in contrast to YAP loss, leads to a modest decrease in spheroid area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3F</xref>), reverting spheroid size closer to that of WT spheroids. This effect is particularly pronounced in TEAD4 KO cells. When compared to NF2/YAP dKO, these results suggest complete and partial dependence on YAP and individual TEAD isoforms respectively.</p><p id="P21">To assess which of the four TEAD isoforms, if any, coordinate the hypersensitivity of NF2-deficient spheroids to TEAD inhibition, we treated NF2/TEAD1 and NF2/TEAD4 dKO MeT-5A spheroids and compared response to parental genotypes. If the observed response to TEAD inhibition is mediated via YAP-TEAD, a limited additive effect of spheroid reduction on combination of TEAD inhibition and KO of critical TEAD isoforms would be evident. Resulting dKO sensitivities indicate that, although TEAD4 may be more critical for the establishment of the observed NF2-deficient phenotype, with a more complete reversal on concurrent loss of TEAD4 as compared to TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3F</xref>), the loss of either isoform is sufficient to offset the increased sensitivity of NF2 KO spheroids to selective TEAD inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figures 3G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figures 3A-B</xref>). More specifically, loss of TEAD1 leads to a blunting of NF2 KO spheroid sensitivity to selective TEAD inhibition, with all compounds exhibiting reduced sensitivity at one or both concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figures 3A</xref>). Similar results are seen when TEAD4 is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figures 3B</xref>), which is particularly striking given IK-930 is purported to be a TEAD1-selective inhibitor.

To initially confirm the phenotype observed in MeT-5A spheroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3C</xref>), we performed a quantitative analysis of the morphological shift of spheroids on treatment with YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors. Brightfield images were segmented, and morphometric characteristics extracted and processed according to Joint Undertaking in Morphological Profiling (JUMP) pipelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of high-dimensional morphometric data reveals a morphological shift on treatment with non-selective inhibitors of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). To quantify this shift, the correlation distance across all morphological features was computed between treated wells. The resulting correlation distance matrix shows a clustering of non-selective and high concentration inhibitors, which share a high degree of morphological similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, there was little clustering in vehicle control and low concentration TEAD-selective inhibitor wells. This suggests that morphological uniformity may be a metric of non-specific inhibition of YAP/TAZ-TEAD. Quantification of uniformity, as defined by the mean correlation distance between like-treated cells, reveals significantly enhanced morphological uniformity on high concentration, as well as dasatinib and lovastatin, treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>). To assess whether this observed uniformity is YAP-dependent or - independent, we quantified morphological uniformity on treatment in YAP KO MeT-5A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4D</xref>). This reveals similar trends, with both dasatinib and lovastatin inducing a shift to more morphologically similar cells, thus indicating YAP-independence. Strikingly, high concentration K-975 and verteporfin treatment induced no such effect in YAP-deficient cells in contrast to WT, which may suggest a degree of morphological disruption mediated via YAP-TEAD inhibition.</p><p id="P27">With the broad impact of treatment on cell morphology established, we next performed in-depth analysis of specific features disrupted on inhibition of YAP/TAZ-TEAD. For this, we implemented a modified robust Z’ scoring, a parameter typically used in quality control of drug screening to extract features for each treatment that resolve distinctly from untreated controls. The Z’ scoring reveals a disruption of a high percentage of features on treatment with non-specific YAP and high concentrations of TEAD-specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4E</xref>), consistent with broad profile analysis. Interestingly, these features are generally equally disrupted in YAP KO cells, particularly in dasatinib treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that this morphological disruption is YAP-independent. To quantify this YAP specificity in detail, we adjusted modified Z’ statistics in WT to YAP KO cells. This revealed a range of conserved features that were consistently disrupted in a YAP independent manner specifically on treatment with the non-specific YAP inhibitors dasatinib and lovastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, a smaller proportion of features were YAP dependent, which were disrupted on treatment with both selective TEAD inhibitors, with minimal overlap between the various TEAD inhibitors, and non-specific YAP inhibitors. Intriguingly, this suggests that different sets of features may be used to quantify YAP-dependent and -independent morphological changes, with verteporfin and both selective TEAD inhibitors showing less off-target YAP effects than dasatinib and lovastatin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Given the critical role the Hippo pathway and, more specifically, its downstream effectors YAP/TAZ-TEAD, play in the progression of mesothelioma and other cancers, there is a clear need to develop pipelines capable of assessing the efficacy and specificity of newly developed inhibitors to streamline positioning to clinical use. While <italic>in vitro</italic> studies assessing the efficacy of TEAD inhibition in NF2-deficient mesothelioma cells have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, these are limited by the heterogenous genomic and transcriptomic landscapes associated with cell-lines of mixed origins, potentially obfuscating critical, nuanced molecular dynamics of inhibiting of the transcriptional machinery of the Hippo pathway. Here, we present a pipeline within an isogenic model of loss of upstream and downstream components within the Hippo pathway, allowing the detailed interrogation of the molecular interplay of the individual constituents that comprise this tumorigenic pathway. We additionally describe functional assays for quantifying the YAP/TAZ-TEAD selective inhibition of tumorigenic capacity, which have shed light into the specifics of efficacy and selectivity of the core compound library used to target the major players within the pathway.</p><p id="P29">Prior multiomic and genetic analysis have highlighted the <italic>in vivo</italic> complexities of pleural mesothelioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. The unfortunate continued lack of curative therapies for this deadly disease is likely due to late-stage diagnosis and the sparsity of complimentary preclinical models representing the disease required for the predictive evaluation of drug targets before clinical evaluation in patients. Notably, our observations predict that targeting the transcriptional complex directly via inhibition of TEAD, including via its auto-palmitoylation site, is more specific, and thereby likely more effective, than targeting the upstream kinase module. Our observations also correlate well with clinical data, including the lack of activity and overall unwelcome association with pulmonary toxicities with dasatanib treatment in unselected pleural mesothelioma patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Our platform combines an extensive, <italic>in vitro</italic> based isogenic cellular model allowing for specificity evaluation, cancer-relevant assays where tumour suppressors are functionally active, high content imaging, and Cell Painting.

We are hopeful, that our approach provides a milestone within the development of mesothelioma treatments, as we appear to potentially evaluate potency of inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> and clinical efficiency. The development of the platform thereby might inform future clinical trials and overall complement ongoing efforts to develop advanced cellular models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> and ultimately curative therapies.</p><p id="P30">Results point to K-975 as exemplar inhibitor of TEAD auto-palmitoylation, with VT-107 exhibiting equivalent potency alongside off-target effects at higher concentrations. Conversely, while IK-930 treatment is not associated with off-target effects and therefore a favourable safety profile, its potency is markedly less relative to alternative TEAD inhibitors. Despite previously reported selectivity for TEAD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, the observation that loss of TEAD4 impacts the sensitivity of spheroids to IK-930 to the same extent of TEAD1 indicates some degree of inhibition of additional TEAD isoforms. Our findings also highlight the apparent compensatory mechanisms in place when targeting individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>). This discovery may explain the promiscuity observed in IK-930, suggesting a compensatory upregulation of, and therefore potential dependence on, TEAD1 on loss of TEAD4. Interestingly our results echo preliminary results from clinical studies of IK-930, which indicate that, despite being well tolerated, IK-930 has not proved effective in patients enrolled in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">In comparison to selective TEAD inhibitors, upstream inhibitors of YAP/TAZ-TEAD are associated with sweeping off-target effects, with dasatinib inducing cellular changes well beyond inhibition of the YAP-TEAD axis alone. Surprisingly, given the extent of YAP-independent effects previously associated with treatment, verteporfin exhibits a high degree of YAP-specificity across a range of functional assays. The convergence between phenotypes in cells treated with verteporfin and selective inhibitors of TEAD reinforces previous findings that verteporfin can act to disrupt YAP-TEAD binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, though YAP-independent cytotoxicity is validated within our model system.

Quantification of spheroid size was then achieved using CellProfiler, with the CellPose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup> plugin to enhance spheroid segmentation. Brightfield images acquired were then subjected to morphological analysis as described in Cell Painting and morphological analysis, with a pipeline modified for single-channel quantification.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Cell Painting and morphological analysis</title><p id="P40">Cell Painting assays were conducted according to established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, with cells seeded as with high-content imaging in 384-well μClear plates (781091, Grenier) and treated with appropriate inhibitor for 24 hours before fixing, staining and imaging. Image acquisition using the Opera Phenix Plus high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer) was performed with the same set-up as described for YAP nuclear localisation high content image-based assays. Morphometric datasets were then acquired from resulting images using CellProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup> pipelines established by JUMP-CP protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>, with the implementation of a modified version of pipelines available at github.com/broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines/tree/master/JUMP_production. The cytominer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup> package was then used to trim low variance or highly correlated features (leading to retention of 417 of 3,446 input features; 12.11%) and normalise retained features to vehicle control (DMSO) treated WT MeT-5A cells. Normalised high-dimensional morphometric datasets were visualised using circlize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup> package in R. Morphological uniformity was computed by calculating correlation distances between all preserved features in each like-treated well. Feature disruption was quantified via a modified robust Z’ scoring, designed to act as a simplified, relative measure of a feature to resolve treated cell morphology from vehicle control (DMSO). This was calculated by removing the scaling constant of 3 of the traditional Z’ score and using median/MAD as opposed to mean/standard deviation as measures across wells, given no assumption of data to conform to a normal distribution. To implement scoring, the following equation was used: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Modifed</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Median</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Median</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P41">Modified Z’ scores were adjusted to quantify YAP dependency by subtracting YAP KO from WT scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS200096-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Ongoing research in the Hansen lab (CGH) was funded by Worldwide Cancer Research (19-0238) and CSO-LifeArc.

Loss of either TEAD isoforms results in a decrease in sensitivity to TEAD inhibition. Spheroids in (<bold>c</bold>), (<bold>g</bold>), and (<bold>h</bold>) were treated for 24 hours with 1 and 10 μM of selective TEAD inhibitors.

Clustering of cells, each representing a single well, was performed via complete linkage, with annotations (top) showing the genotype, inhibitor family, name of treatment, and treatment concentration for each well. <bold>c,</bold> Violin plot portraying morphological uniformity of WT MeT-5A cells on YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition. Each point represents a single well, with uniformity calculated as the mean correlation distance of a single well to all like-treated wells. <bold>d,</bold> Violin plot as in (<bold>c</bold>), showing morphological uniformity on YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibition in YAP KO MeT-5A cells. <bold>e,</bold> Heatmap shows the percentage of disrupted features, as defined by modified Z’ scores &gt; 0, in WT vs YAP KO MeT-5A cells in response to various YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors. As treatment concentration increases, a greater percentage of features are disrupted across most inhibitors. <bold>f,</bold> Heatmap shows modified Z’ scores of features with known discriminatory potential, defined as those with modified Z’ scores &gt; 0, adjusted for YAP-dependency. Positive values indicate feature disruption selectively in WT, and not in YAP KO MeT-5A cells, indicating dependence on YAP, while negative values show features disrupted to the same or greater degree in YAP KO cells.
