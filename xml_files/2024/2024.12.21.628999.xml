Understanding how enzymes containing P460 heme oxidise hydroxylamine into either nitrous oxide or nitric oxide has implications for climate change. Interestingly the P460 containing hydroxylamine oxidoreductase utilises a tyrosine cross link to heme and performs similar chemistry. Previous crystal structures of cytochrome P460 from <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic> (NeP460) clearly show the existence of a single crosslink between the Nz atom of lysine and the heme porphyrin with mutagenesis studies indicating roles for the crosslink in positioning a proton transfer residue and/or influencing the distortion of the heme. Here we describe the evidence for a novel double cross link between lysine and heme in the cytochrome P460 from <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> (Bath). In order to understand the complexities of this enzyme system we applied high resolution structural biology approaches at synchrotron and XFEL sources paired with crystal spectroscopies.

In this process, the reactive intermediate hydroxylamine is formed through the oxidation of ammonia by ammonia monooxygenases before being converted to a series of nitrogen oxides, including the damaging greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Two enzymes that have been identified as carrying out the challenging hydroxylamine oxidation reaction each have unusual cross linked heme active sites which share a characteristic absorption maximum of 460 nm in the ferrous state. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductases (HAO) use a P460 heme with a crosslink between a tyrosine residue and the heme. In contrast, cytochromes P460 have a crosslink between a lysine and the heme. The P460 heme is thus characterised by a protein to porphyrin crosslink in addition to the canonical cross link of two cysteine residues that occurs in all c-type hemes. HAO and P460 differ in their reaction mechanism and product despite acting upon the same substrate. P460s consist of a homodimer with one heme P460 present per monomer. in contrast, HAO is an octaheme protein with seven electron transfer hemes and a single P460 heme. For this reason, cytochromes P460 are far more tractable for experimental and computational study. The properties and molecular structure of several catalytically active cytochrome P460s have been characterised, particularly those from the ammonia oxidising <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic> (NeP460) and methane oxidising <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> (Bath) bacteria (McP460). The structures reveal rather different active site pockets but in both cases a solvent filled, highly polar active site pocket is present positioning residues appropriately for electron and proton transfer. McP460 lacks the C-terminal helix seen in NeP460 but harbours three arginine residues in the active site. Crystal structures have been determined for NeP460<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and its crosslink-deficient mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, for McP460<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and for an inactive cytochrome P460 from <italic>Nitrosomonas</italic> sp. AL212<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (NsALP460) and its mutants including an active one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">All published crystal structures of these enzymes have been determined at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. While the structures are highly informative, the possibility of electronic states changes around the group as a result of radiation damage is highly likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Spectroscopic data from crystals has revealed that reduction typically takes place at doses far lower than those required for structure determination using conventional methods. Moreover, cryo-cooling of protein crystals can suppress functionally relevant dynamics and/or lead to the observation of structural artefacts.</p><p id="P4">Extensive work has been carried out by Lancaster and co-workers on cytochromes P460, identifying the role of the active site pocket structure and the crosslink in positioning the heme and crucial residues involved in proton transfer, in influencing the heme geometry and in the origins of the unusual spectroscopic properties of cytochromes P460. Site-directed mutagenesis of NsALP460 to introduce a glutamate residue (Glu131) mimicking the active site pocket of NeP460 (Glu97) led to gain of hydroxylamine oxidation activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> This activity can be removed by knocking out the crosslinking lysine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> leading to a mutant enzyme with standard spectroscopic properties for c-type heme enzymes This identified the glutamate in that position as being important for proton transfer within the catalytic mechanism with the proposal that one role of the protein crosslink to heme was to correctly position this glutamate for proton transfer.</p><p id="P5">Molecular simulation studies of cytochrome P460 enzymes have been limited to date. These were mainly restricted to cluster calculations using density functional theory (DFT) and omit the role of the protein environment. The absorption spectra of the crosslinked heme moiety and innersphere ligands in NeP460 have been simulated with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The spectroscopic calculations revealed that the experimentally observed spectral red shift in NeP460 can be attributed to geometric distortions within heme, in particular, the deviation of the macrocycle out of planarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this work we describe a structure of native McP460 obtained at room temperature using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to exclude any effects of radiation damage to the sample that could affect the structure or electronic state. Importantly, to provide the best model as inputs to QM/MM molecular simulations it is critical to have a true ground state structure that has not been modified by the data collection technique used to determine that structure. This could not be achieved using synchrotron radiation and required the unique properties of an XFEL.</p><p id="P7">We also describe structures validated by absorption spectroscopy carried out on crystals to explicitly identify the oxidation state and/or ligand state of the crystals. This enables a structure of the Fe(II) (ferrous) enzyme and the iron-bound ligand of the Fe(III) (ferric) structure to be assigned. Crucially, we use this data to carry out QM/MM molecular simulations of cytochrome P460 and to validate these by prediction of spectroscopic data that can be readily compared to experimental results. Our data suggest the presence of an unusual double cross link between the heme and active site lysine residue in contrast to the single cross link to lysine that is present in NeP460. The possible chemical natures of the crosslinks observed in the experimental structures were suggested as shown in Scheme 1: A) a single covalent link between Lys78-N and Heme-CHA (single crosslink, SC), B) an additional covalent link between Lys78-CD and Heme-C2A (double crosslink, DC) and C) a double crosslinked species with a double bond in the Lysine side chain between Lys78-CD and Lys78-CE (double crosslink with unsaturated Lys side chain, DCu). These three alternatives were modelled into the active site of the crystal structures and structural and spectral determination were carried out via QM/MM simulations to identify the nature crosslink species present in the oxidised and reduced X-ray structures. Scheme 2 provides a chart of the experimental structures that were used for simulations and the oxidation state of Fe and the nature of crosslinks explored via simulations. The study provides an exemplar of close interplay between molecular simulation and experimental studies, used here to understand structure of the covalently linked Lys-heme unit in this challenging enzyme system.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Activity Assays and N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> Quantification</title><p id="P8">Recombinant McP460 was expressed and purified as described previously (Adams et al 2019).

Such a structure provides the best starting point for further molecular simulations. The most effective means to achieve this was to use serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at an XFEL where the very short (10 fs) pulse duration allows diffraction data to be measured from room temperature microcrystals without sufficient time being available for radiation chemistry to occur (the principle of diffraction before destruction). Using room temperature microcrystals also avoids any artefacts from cryoprotection or flash cooling. Accordingly, SFX data were measured at the SACLA XFEL and produced a structure to 1.28 Å resolution, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Such high resolution is rarely achieved in SFX (only two room temperature SFX structures at higher resolution were present in the protein data Bank at the time of writing).</p><p id="P25">As was the case in the previous structure from a single crystal at 100 K, cytochrome P460 forms a homodimer with each monomer adopting a largely beta sheet fold connected by several loops. Superposition of the SFX structure with the 100 K structure (PDB 6HIU) yielded an RMSD value of 0.30 Å over 286 residues. The region of the backbone that differs most between cryogenic conditions and room temperature is the loop from Thr85 to Ser91, which harbours the Phe89 residue that is in contact with the heme from the other monomer. Indeed, this loop is shifted by approximately 0.5 Å in chain A and 0.4 Å in chain B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A and B</xref>) based on analysis by Gesamt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> At room temperature, it is therefore closer to the heme of the other chain.

This happens through potentially charged hydrogen bonds (N to O distances of 2.8 Å and 3.1 Å in chain A, 2.9 Å and 3.2 Å in chain B). The presence of the sulfate may explain the differences in the conformations of Arg 50. For example, the major conformation on Arg50 in the SFX structure is the one binding the sulfate with potentially charged hydrogen-bonds (N to O distances of 2.9 A and 3.1 Å in chain A, 2.9 and 3.0 Å in chain B). The minor conformations of Arg50 could affect its interactions with the propionate of the heme. Arg121 also forms a potentially charged hydrogenbond to the sulfate (2.9 Å between its nitrogen and a sulfate oxygen in chain A, 3.0 Å in chain B).</p><p id="P27">The SFX structure reveals a new conformation for the sidechain of Gln46A, a very mobile residue according to B-factors. It also shows hydrogen bond between the sidechains of Ser80 and Asn48 that could be involved in a proton relay between the iron-bound ligand and the surface (through Asp102, HOH403 and HOH441, better seen in chain B). The largest shift between the r.t and 100 K structures is from Lys60 on the surface of chain B, at a crystal contact with chain A of another dimer. A minor r.t conformation of Arg66A not seen at 100 K may force Lys60B further away than in its 100 K conformation. An indicator of radiation damage in the 100 K structure is the iron-water distance of over 2.3 Å compared to the 2.1 Å distance in the damage-free SFX structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. This shorter iron-water distance in the SFX structure could explain the why the sidechain of its Asp102 is 0.2 Å closer to the iron centre (based on the distance to the CG carbon) than in the 100 K structure.</p><p id="P28">B-factor analysis indicated regions that the sidechain of His156B is more disordered than that of His86A which lies some 3.5 A away. Surprisingly, the opposite is the case in the 100 K structure. Anisotropic B-factors allow us to see the direction of displacement to be estimated. In the case of the iron-bound water, its position varies in the direction of Asp102 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>), so it may depend on which of the two conformations Asp102 assumes. The sulfate in the active site pockets undergoes a rocking motion, followed by Arg50. The atoms in Tyr130 and Glu139 that are close to the entrance to the active site have some thermal motion towards it, especially their terminal oxygen.</p><p id="P29">Intriguingly and in contrast to the previous 100 K structure of NeP460, the <bold>SFX</bold> structure of McP460 to very high resolution contained electron density features suggestive of a second cross link between residue Lys78 and the porphyrin. Indeed, the model of the main conformation of Lys78 causes an overlap between its CD carbon and the C2A carbon of the heme (1.4 Å overlap in chain A and 1.3 Å in chain B, 0.2 Å more severe than in the published 100 K structure). The chemical nature of this new modification was unclear due to the multiple conformations of the Lys78 sidechain.</p><p id="P30">Intriguingly, a spectral shift occurs in the UV-vis spectrum of McP460 on exposure to ammonium sulfate in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Testing of different compounds containing ammonia or sulphate ions suggested that ammonia was the species responsible for the observed spectral shift. We therefore investigated whether ammonia could have bound to the heme group (potentially displacing any heme coordinated water) in crystals grown in high concentrations of ammonium sulphate as precipitant. Importantly, single-crystal spectra consistently show spectra consistent with ferric protein in the absence of ammonia and we do not observe any evidence of ammonia binding in crystals.

Pleasingly, the fresh crystals yielded a structure with a clearly resolved conformation of Lys78. The aged crystals gave a structure that was essentially identical, albeit at a lower resolution. This suggests that the additional Lys78 conformation is not caused by degradation over time. We could only speculate that it is due to a combination of the batch of protein or the method of crystallisation.</p><p id="P32">This structure collected on fresh crystals clearly shows a second crosslink between Lys78 and the porphyrin: a covalent bond between the CD carbon of Lys78 and the C2A carbon of the porphyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Since there are now four carbons bonded to C2A, they must all do so through single bonds to satisfy its valence. This means the C2A-C3A bond has been changed from double to single (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The geometry around C3A having remained clearly planar in the structure, we assign it an exocyclic double-bond, as evidenced by a shorter bond length to the terminal carbon on this tetrapyrrole ring D compared to all others (1.46 Å vs 1.52 Å when using restraints without this double-bond; 1.33 A Å when using double-bond restraints).</p><p id="P33">When examining the geometry around the CD of Lys78 in the electron density, it was unclear whether it had four covalently bonded atoms (with a hydrogen pointing towards the iron-bound water) or three bonded atoms thanks to an additional double-bond on the lysine. We therefore reduced model bias by calculating a composite omit map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). This shows a mostly planar arrangement of atoms around the Lys78 CD, supporting a double-bond on the lysine sidechain. This also provides the reactivity needed to form a second crosslink, especially if α to a heteroatom. We therefore tentatively built a double-bond between the CD and CE carbons of Lys78 in the RT fresh and RT aged models.</p><p id="P34">Electron density near the heme-linked sulfur atom of Cys143 was assigned to a minor alternate conformation of the residue. Since this other sulfur position is close to bonding distance from the heme carbon CAC (1.9 Å), it was also modelled as linked. Because of the nearly planar geometry around CAC from this new bond, there could remain a C-C double bond to the terminal carbon CBC. This can unfortunately not be distinguished within the mainly single bond from the major conformation of Cys143. We do not expect the UV-vis spectrum to be affected as this doublebond is not in plane of the heme and therefore would not be conjugated with its π-system.</p><p id="P35">The iron in the <bold>RT fresh</bold> structure is likely to have remained in the ferric state, as X-rays seem unable to reduce it in McP460 based on single-crystal UV-vis spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>). The <bold>RT fresh</bold> structure is very similar to the damage-free <bold>SFX</bold> structure (RMSD 0.14 Å across 286 residues).

Hence changes in conformation in chain A and B cause a different pattern of H-bond interactions around the active site.

We suspected this to be a sign of a more complex modification than the single crosslink between the lysine nitrogen (NZ) and γ-meso carbon (CHA) of the heme found in NeP460. The electron density for the lysine in 6HIU was difficult to assign to a particular chemical description, likely due to multiple conformations. To ascertain whether the additional conformation was the result of radiation damage, which metalloproteins are particularly susceptible to, it was important to obtain a high resolution structure of the true ground state of the protein free of experimental artefacts. Accordingly, we obtained a structure by serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) to 1.28 Å resolution. By using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) with 10 fs X-ray pulses, we also avoid any possibility of electronic state changes as a result of exposure to the X-ray beam because the x-ray pulse is too short to allow time for radiation induced chemistry to occur. The structure is one of the highest achieved resolutions for room temperature structures using SFX, which helped provide even greater confidence that a new bond was formed between the lysine and the heme. Intriguingly, even after ruling out the effect of radiation damage, the structure still exhibited multiple conformations of the lysine, making the chemical nature of its crosslink unclear. In contrast, a room temperature synchrotron structure from fresh crystals revealed the position of a single conformation of the lysine with two crosslinks to the heme. This was not affected by crystal ageing, suggesting that it is not crystal size or age that determines the cross-linking but that this is an inherent property of the crystalline protein. We can only speculate about the cause of variation in crosslinking between the SFX and previously published McP460 structure, both with multiple conformations of Lys78, versus the RT fresh and aged structures that exhibit only a double crosslink. Very different crystal sizes were used for the SFX microcrystals than for the three single crystal structures</p><p id="P56">We suggest that the formation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> crosslink also results in a shifting of the adjacent tetrapyrrole double-bond to become exocyclic, based on its bond length and angle.

Simulation also allowed us to inspect the geometrical changes within spin states. The geometric parameters change with increasing spin multiplicity, with significant effects seen on the Fe-water distance and Fe-pyrrole N distances; they increase with increasing spin multiplicity. The latter parameter is very prominent for DC and DCu systems where there is an almost 0.1 Å increase in the Fe-N distance of the pyrrole D ring in both chains.

The presence of a second cross link between the active site lysine residue and the heme was suggested by this structure with supporting room temperature multi-crystal structures supporting this concept and excluding the possibility that it could be caused by ageing of crystals. An anaerobic, freeze trapped structure of the ferrous form of the enzyme was also determined from a single-crystal with the oxidation state confirmed using single-crystal UV-visible spectroscopy.</p><p id="P68">QM/MM simulations of the ferric form of McP460 indicated that a double crosslink structure is stable and compatible with the available experimental data. Notably, distortion of the heme between Fe and pyrrole D ring nitrogen is observed in the optimised structures, in qualitative agreement with the crystallographic structure. QM/MM geometry optimisations on the ferrous form also reproduced key experimental structural features such as the interaction of water and iron at the 6<sup>th</sup> coordination site. The QM/MM calculations of both the oxidised and reduced forms revealed a complex energetic landscape with several spin states accessible in both and sensitive to the local chemical environment of the heme. UV-vis spectroscopic simulations using TD-DFT suggest that the shift in absorption maximum observed experimentally between the ferric and ferrous forms is compatible with and supports a double crosslink model. For validation we also considered an in silico reduced model starting from the ferric crystal structure. This was also able to reproduce key features of the experimental data, indicating that in silico reduction is a valid approach to modelling the ferrous state in the case that only an oxidised experimental structure is available, and adding further support to the double crosslink proposal.</p><p id="P69">Intriguingly, no evidence of a second cross link was observed in previous crystal structures of a different cytochrome P460[NeP460; 2je3] from an ammonia oxidising organism which may be reflected in differing catalytic activity and chemical conditions within the organism. Notably the structure of NeP460 contained a hydroxyl modification to the heme group evident in low-dose structures but that disappeared in higher dose structures, a feature not present in McP460.</p><p id="P70">Our work highlights the power of combining multiple experimental and computational techniques to address the structure and mechanism of an enzyme. Electron density features that may be ambiguous or unclear even at very high resolutions may be investigated and validated using simulation while the simulations themselves benefit from starting structures that are free of experimental artefacts such as radiation damage and changes due to cryo cooling. In addition to comparison of coordinates and bonds, the ability to predict experimental structures and to measure them from the same crystals used for structure determination allows for further cross validation. Future work will focus on applying this combined approach to the ligand bound states of cytochrome P460 and site-directed mutagenesis of protein residues proposed to be relevant to the catalytic mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting information</label><media xlink:href="EMS202308-supplement-Supporting_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d55aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by BBSRC grant awards BB/V016660/1, BB/V01577X/1 and BB/V016768/1, and BBSRC Japan Partnering Awards BB/R021015/1 and BB/X01844X/1.
