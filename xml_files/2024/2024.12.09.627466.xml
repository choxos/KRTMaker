output through mere top-down processes, such as motor imagery. While executed finger movements activate finger representations in the primary sensorimotor cortex that are spatially consistent over time within participants, the stability of top-down activated finger representations remains largely unexplored. Given the increasing use of top-down activated sensorimotor representations to both plan implantation of and control brain-computer interfaces, it is crucial to understand the stability of these representations. Here, we investigated the spatial consistency, and thereby reliability, of finger representations activated through motor imagery in the primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex over time. To assess this, participants performed imagined and executed individual finger movements in two 3T fMRI sessions that were ~2 weeks apart. We observed highly consistent univariate finger-selective activity clusters and multivariate vertex-wise activity patterns within participants over time in both the motor imagery and motor execution task. Using a multivariate across-task decoding approach, we further found that motor execution and motor imagery activate similar finger representations in both the primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex. This demonstrates that motor imagery can be used to identify finger representations related to movement execution. Our findings not only validate the use of top-down processes for brain-computer interface planning and control, but also open up new opportunities for the development of sensorimotor training interventions that do not rely on overt movements.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The somatotopic organisation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary motor cortex (M1) describes the correspondence between an area of the body and the specific area of the cortex representing that body part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Penfield &amp; Boldrey, 1937</xref>). Neural finger representations have been of particular interest in this context given their fine-grained somatotopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Besle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Schellekens et al., 2018</xref>) and importance for fine motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). Their detailed somatotopic organisation has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Janko et al., 2022</xref>). Traditionally, S1 and M1 finger representations are investigated using tactile stimulation or motor execution paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Berlot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>). Over the past years, evidence has accumulated demonstrating that neural representations of individual fingers in S1 and M1 can also be activated through top-down processes, i.e., without any overt motor output or somatosensory input. Specifically, finger representations have been detected in S1 by directing attention to individual fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Puckett et al., 2017</xref>), by anticipated tactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kassraian et al., 2023</xref>), by merely holding tactile information in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rabe et al., 2023</xref>), or by observed touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, finger representations are activated in both M1 and S1 during movement preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ariani et al., 2022</xref>) or motor imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Odermatt et al., 2024</xref>). While it has been shown that finger representations activated through executed movements are spatially highly stable over time for up to six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>), the spatial consistency, and thus reliability, of top-down activated finger representations has not yet been explored.</p><p id="P3">The lack of a clear understanding regarding the reliability of top-down activated sensorimotor representations is surprising, given their growing neuroscientific and clinical importance. Indeed, the fact that top-down processes can activate representations of individual fingers has enabled researchers to study finger representations in populations in the absence of sensorimotor functions. Specifically, S1 and M1 finger representations have been detected through attempted finger movements of a missing hand after arm amputation or paralysed hand after cervical spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kikkert et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wesselink et al., 2019</xref>). These preserved representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Shah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">van den Boom et al., 2021</xref>) are increasingly used to control brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Shah et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Willsey et al., 2024</xref>). Using intracortical recordings in the sensorimotor cortex of cervical spinal cord injury patients with completely paralysed fingers, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to decode individual attempted and imagined finger movements even though actual motor output is completely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andersen &amp; Aflalo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Guan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jorge et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, we have shown that it is possible to strengthen these top-down activated finger representations through motor imagery training in the absence of overt movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Odermatt et al., 2024</xref>). Such top-down sensorimotor training interventions may allow to induce adaptive sensorimotor neuroplasticity in patients who are not (yet) able to perform overt movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">McFarland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Norman et al., 2018</xref>), for instance following a stroke or incomplete spinal cord injury.</p><p id="P4">To validate the use of and optimally leverage top-down activated sensorimotor representations for BCI control and training interventions, we investigated the reproducibility of fine-grained finger representations activated through motor imagery of three different fingers (thumb, index finger, and little finger) over time. To do so, we assessed finger representations in a motor imagery and a motor execution task in 16 healthy participants across two 3T fMRI sessions that were approximately two weeks apart. We investigated spatial consistency in S1 and M1 using two distinct approaches. First, we applied univariate analysis methods to quantify the spatial correspondence of finger-selective (or winner-take-all) maps. Second, we used multivariate analysis to examine the reproducibility of the full intricate activity patterns associated with individual (imagined) finger movements through a decoding approach. If finger representations activated through motor imagery (and motor execution) are spatially consistent over time, then the univariate analysis should reveal more spatial overlap of finger-selective activity across sessions for ‚Äòsame‚Äô compared to ‚Äòneighbouring‚Äô or ‚Äònon-neighbouring‚Äô fingers. Furthermore, if motor imagery (and motor execution) elicit consistent activity patterns over time, the multivariate decoding approach should achieve high classification accuracy across sessions. In both the uni- and multivariate analysis, we expected higher consistency within participants than across participants. Given the intertwined nature of S1 and M1, we expected to obtain similar results in these areas. Additionally, due to the implicated role of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the ventral (PMv) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in top-down motor-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bruurmijn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pilgramm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zabicki et al., 2017</xref>), we exploratively conducted uni- and multivariate analyses to characterise motor imagery finger representations in these secondary motor areas. Finally, we compared motor imagery finger representations to the representations activated through motor execution to test their neural similarity in M1 and S1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Univariate finger-selective maps activated through motor imagery are spatially consistent over time</title><p id="P5">Motor imagery of individual fingers revealed top-down activated finger-selective activity clusters in the primary sensorimotor cortex at the individual participant level based on winner-take-all finger maps that were minimally thresholded (Z &gt; 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These finger-selective activity clusters progressed from the thumb (laterally) to the little finger (medially), corresponding to the gradient of finger preference in characteristic hand maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Besle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>). Qualitative assessment of these motor imagery finger maps suggests some extent of reproducibility across sessions for most participants, but high variability across participants.</p><p id="P6">To understand the stability, or spatial correspondence, of motor imagery finger maps, we then quantified the spatial overlap of the finger-selective (or winner-take-all) maps across sessions. Specifically, we calculated the Dice Overlap Coefficient (DOC) between every possible finger pair across both sessions within S1 and M1. In the main text, we focus on the results in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), as we obtained similar results in M1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The explorative analysis for secondary motor areas is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p id="P7">A DOC of 1 reflects a perfect overlap of two representations, while 0 indicates no overlap at all. In S1, our analysis revealed relatively high spatial consistency (DOC) for the ‚Äòsame‚Äô motor imagery finger representations over time and low DOC for ‚Äòneighbouring‚Äô and ‚Äònon-neighbouring‚Äô finger representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), consistent with previously reported somatotopic finger maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kikkert et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>). This was indicated in a significant <italic>Task</italic> by <italic>Finger pair</italic> interaction (<italic>œá</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>(2)</sub> = 15.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; main effect <italic>Task:</italic> <italic>œá</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 87.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; main effect <italic>Finger pair:</italic> <italic>œá</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>(2)</sub> = 203.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). For the motor imagery task, the DOC for the same finger representations was higher compared to neighbouring (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = 7.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and non-neighbouring finger representations (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = 9.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), and higher for neighbouring compared to non-neighbouring finger representations (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = 3.42, <italic>p</italic> = .003). This demonstrates a somatotopic gradient in the spatial correspondence across sessions and indicates that the finger maps activated through motor imagery were stable over time. Similarly, in the motor execution task, the DOC was higher for same compared to neighbouring (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = 10.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and non-neighbouring finger representations (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = 11.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). However, there was no difference in the DOC for neighbouring and non-neighbouring finger representations (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = -0.72 <italic>p</italic> = .95), possibly due to the inclusion of only three fingers (i.e., thumb, index finger, little finger) in the analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> for DOC including all five fingers). When comparing the spatial consistency across the two tasks, we found lower DOC during motor imagery compared to motor execution for the same (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = -4.07, <italic>p</italic> = .003) and non-neighbouring (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = -9.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) finger representations, and no significant difference for neighbouring finger representations (<italic>t</italic><sub>(85)</sub> = -0.37, <italic>p</italic> = .95; for simplicity of visualisation not depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we compared the within-participant to across-participants consistency. To do so, we calculated the DOC across sessions for all possible finger and participant pairings. The across-participants DOC matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) consists of submatrices representing each finger pair. If the spatial overlap of finger-selective activity clusters is higher within than across participants, then the values on the diagonal of the ‚Äòsame‚Äô finger pair submatrices (i.e., D1-D1, D2-D2, D5-D5) should be higher than the values on the off-diagonal of these ‚Äòsame‚Äô finger pair submatrices. As expected, within-participant DOC was higher than across-participants DOC for same fingers, as indicated by all matrix dominance ratios (Mdr) &gt; 1 (Mdr D1 = 3.03, Mdr D2 = 3.42, Mdr D5 = 5.22; see diagonal of matrix on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). By contrast, for both neighbouring and non-neighbouring finger pairs, all Mdrs were &lt; 1 (see off-diagonal of matrix on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This indicates that for neighbouring and non-neighbouring finger-pairs, the spatial correspondence across sessions within a participant was not higher than the spatial correspondence across participants. Finally, the overall Mdr was calculated based on the Mdr scores of the submatrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>. The resulting overall Mdr of 10.68 implies that spatial correspondence of the ‚Äòsame‚Äô finger representations across sessions drives within-participant consistency. To investigate the likelihood of obtaining a Mdr score higher or equal to the obtained Mdr score merely by chance, we applied bootstrapping and found that the overall Mdr was significanty different from chance level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), demonstrating higher within-participant than across-participants consistency of motor imagery finger representations.</p><p id="P9">Together, the DOC analyses suggest that, at the group level, the finger-selective activity clusters elicited through motor imagery can be studied using fMRI and follow a somatotopic organisation, similarly as finger maps activated through finger movement or tactile finger stimulation. Importantly, these somatotopic motor imagery finger maps are spatially consistent over weeks. However, at the individual participant level, the minimally thresholded finger maps did not reveal finger-selective activity clusters for each participant, session, and finger. If overall activity levels are (expected to be) low and the conditions are thought to be represented in distributed activity patterns, as suggested for individual (imagined) finger movements, then univariate analysis is suboptimal. Thus, we next used multivariate analysis to overcome these limitations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Imagined finger movements can be decoded with higher accuracy across sessions than across participants</title><p id="P10">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) takes into account the full pattern of activity elicited by (imagined) finger movements. Here, we used a multivariate decoding approach to investigate whether imagined finger movements can be reliably predicted from the activity pattern in the S1 or M1 hand area across sessions, giving insight into the consistency of these activity patterns over time. To do so, we trained a linear support vector machine on the data of one session and tested it on the data of the other session. In the S1 hand area, we found that within-participant classifiers generalised well across sessions. Specifically, accuracy of this across-sessions decoding was significantly above the empirical chance level <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and did not differ from within-session accuracy (<italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> = .21, BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.52 indicating anecdotal evidence for the null hypothesis). This suggests that activity patterns associated with individual imagined finger movements are highly reproducible over fMRI sessions, demonstrating high within-participant consistency.</p><p id="P11">To investigate across-participants consistency in finger representations, we next tested the generalisability of a classifier to other participants and found that such an across-participants classifier was able to successfully decode individual fingers of participants whose data were unseen in the training (average accuracy in leave-one-participant-out cross-validation: 0.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, empirical chance level: 0.33). However, classification accuracy was significantly lower compared to within-participant classification (within session vs. across participants <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 6.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; across sessions vs. across participants <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 6.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These results demonstrate that within-participant consistency in activity patterns associated with individual finger motor imagery is significantly higher than across-participants consistency.</p><p id="P12">When comparing the true vs. the predicted labels in the decoding analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), we found more misclassified trials for neighbouring fingers (i.e., thumb misclassified as index finger or vice versa), than for non-neighbouring fingers (i.e., thumb or index finger misclassified as little finger or vice versa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>; significant main effect <italic>Prediction</italic>: <italic>F</italic><sub>(290)</sub> = 187.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; non-significant main effect <italic>Comparison</italic>: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,190)</sub> = 0.00, <italic>p</italic> = .99; non-significant interaction effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,90)</sub> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = .85). Significantly more trials were correctly classified compared to misclassified as neighbouring (<italic>t</italic><sub>(75)</sub> = 14.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) or as non-neighbouring fingers (<italic>t</italic><sub>(75)</sub> = 18.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). From the wrongly classified trials, significantly more trials were misclassified as a neighbouring finger compared to another finger (<italic>t</italic><sub>(75)</sub> = 3.58, <italic>p</italic> = .0006), indicating higher similarity of vertex-wise activity patterns of neighbouring fingers compared to non-neighbouring fingers. Note that the values obtained from the across-participants classification are plotted for visualisation purposes only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> but were not considered in the statistical analysis as only a single value per <italic>Prediction</italic> level was available.</p><p id="P13">We then compared the classification accuracy scores obtained from decoding of fingers in the motor imagery vs. the motor execution task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and found, as expected, lower scores for imagined than executed finger movements (significant main effect <italic>Task</italic>: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,45)</sub> = 364.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; non-significant main effect <italic>Comparison</italic>: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,45)</sub> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = .59; non-significant interaction effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,45)</sub> = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> = .69). While decoding of three fingers in the motor execution task lead to very high classification accuracies (mean within session: 0.92; mean across sessions: 0.91; empirical chance level: 0.33), including all five fingers lead to lower absolute values (mean within session: 0.63; mean across sessions: 0.58; empirical chance level: 0.20; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These findings reveal that although motor imagery elicits less distinguishable activity patterns for individual fingers compared to motor execution, the reproducibility of these patterns across sessions does not differ significantly between the two tasks.</p><p id="P14">Similar results were obtained for the M1 hand area, as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>. In secondary motor areas including SMA, PMd, and PMv we found that imagined and executed finger movements could be decoded significantly above chance, with most correctly classified trials for the thumb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Within-participant variability in vividness, motivation, and perceived effort do not predict across-sessions generalisability of a classifier that decodes imagined finger movements</title><p id="P15">In comparison to overt finger movements or tactile stimulation, motor imagery has a higher cognitive component that may increase variability in task performance both within and across participants. We thus investigated whether session-to-session variations in attentional and cognitive processes could explain the scores obtained from generalising a classifier across sessions. We calculated the absolute difference score from session 1 to session 2 for the subjective measures of vividness during motor imagery, perceived motivation, and effort.

This analysis revealed that we could successfully decode individual fingers across tasks, as indicated by classification accuracies significantly above the empirical chance level (all p &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

Similar results were obtained for the M1 hand area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).

Our results show that both finger-selective activity clusters and the full intricate activity patterns associated with individual imagined finger movements were highly consistent across two fMRI sessions. The finding that motor imagery reliably activated finger representations is particularly striking given the highly unsupervised nature of the task. Notably, the level of consistency of finger representations activated through motor imagery was comparable to motor execution. Furthermore, an across-task decoding analysis revealed that motor imagery and motor execution activated finger representations that contained shared information in their underlying activity patterns, indicating neural similarity between these representations.</p><p id="P19">Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we found high within-participant consistency in finger representations activated through motor imagery in both S1 and M1. These findings align with the results of previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>) and the current study showing highly reproducible finger representations activated through motor execution, which we used as a benchmark for comparing our motor imagery findings. In line with the results from univariate analysis of motor execution finger representations reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al. (2016)</xref>, we found that the spatial correspondence of finger-selective activity clusters in S1 for the same motor imagery finger representations across sessions was higher compared to different finger pairs, representing a hallmark of somatotopic organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kikkert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al. (2016</xref>) employed a travelling-wave paradigm, we created finger maps based on a blocked paradigm. Travelling-wave paradigms are powerful in detecting finger maps based on gradients from the thumb to the little finger. In contrast, blocked paradigms allow to investigate more detailed somatotopic information that account better for the spatial overlap of finger representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Besle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kikkert et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, even based on blocked paradigms, winner-take-all approaches have limitations as they strongly depend on the (arbitrarily) chosen threshold and the specific conditions (in our case, fingers) that were tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Muret et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wesselink et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, despite minimal thresholding, motor imagery finger maps did not show finger-selective activity clusters for all tested fingers in every participant. To circumvent arbitrarily thresholding of winner-take-all approaches, and to account for low activity levels during motor imagery and largely overlapping finger representations, we used a multivariate decoding approach and examined whether the finger with which motor imagery (or motor execution) was performed could be predicted from the full activity patterns of single trials. Our results confirm high reproducibility of these activity patterns associated with individual fingers across sessions for both motor imagery and motor execution.</p><p id="P20">For finger representations activated through motor imagery, we found lower absolute values in spatial consistency compared to motor execution. This was evident in lower spatial correspondence of the same finger representations across sessions in the univariate analysis and in lower classification accuracy when decoding fingers within- and across-session. Multiple factors may have contributed to this effect. First, it is likely that the activity levels evoked by motor execution were higher, resulting in a better signal-to-noise-ratio and thus more clearly distinguishable activity patterns associated with individual fingers. Second, the motor execution task was more standardised compared to the motor imagery task. For motor execution, participants performed paced button presses. If participants started a trial with a delay, we corrected the trial onsets and if they accidentally moved with the wrong finger, we assigned the trial to that finger. In contrast, the motor imagery task was unsupervised, self-paced, and without clear instruction towards the specific motor imagery strategies. Suggested strategies included pressing a button, playing the piano, typing on keyboard, moving the finger up and down or left and right, or imagine pulses in the finger muscle. We did not restrict participants to use only one motor imagery strategy and left it open to change strategies from trial to trial or session to session (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for instructions and self-reported strategies). These task differences may have resulted in higher variability in the motor imagery performance and thus resulting activity patterns. Third, top-down processes may be more affected by task compliance and attentional and cognitive processes compared to motor execution tasks, additionally contributing to more variability in motor imagery finger representations. Indeed, attention can greatly modulate finger representations measured with fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Puckett et al., 2017</xref>) and vividness of imagined action has been shown to be reflected in more distinguishable top-down activated representations of hand actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zabicki et al., 2019</xref>). We found that session-to-session variability of perceived vividness of motor imagery, motivation and how exhausting the motor imagery task was perceived, did not predict the generalisability of a classifier across sessions, suggesting that top-down activated finger representations may be robust against small session-to-session fluctuations in attentional and cognitive processes. However, higher self-reported motivation scores were associated with higher decoding performance within session, indicating that motivation (and thus, task compliance) may indeed play a role. In summary, it is likely that an interplay of all processes contributed to lower classification accuracy and lower spatial overlap of finger-selective activity for motor imagery compared to motor execution. Nevertheless, higher classification accuracies may be achievable through training, as we have demonstrated that neurofeedback training for mental finger individuation results in more distinguishable activity patterns of individual imagined finger movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Odermatt et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In the across-task decoding analysis, we found neural similarity between activity patterns elicited by imagined and executed finger movements. We have previously reported that motor imagery activates similar finger representations as motor execution in the primary sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Odermatt et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we extend this finding by showing high spatial consistency over time across tasks. Notably, the across-task decoding analysis performed better when trained on motor imagery and tested on motor execution, than vice versa. We speculate that the lower signal-to-noise-ratio and higher within-session variability in activity patterns elicited by motor imagery compared to motor execution (as described in the previous paragraph), may have contributed to this finding. If motor execution of individual fingers elicits highly consistent activity patterns across trials, a decoder trained on this data may exhibit decreased performance when tested on the more variable activity patterns of motor imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hebart &amp; Baker, 2018</xref>). Sensorimotor representations activated through motor imagery are thought to be more sparse and widespread than motor execution patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zabicki et al., 2017</xref>). While motor execution patterns may be encompassed within the broader motor imagery patterns, and thus be successfully predicted by a decoder trained on motor imagery patterns, the reverse case may be more challenging. These findings of our across-task decoding analysis add to the knowledge on neural equivalence of imagined and executed movements, which is relevant for the development of motor imagery training interventions aiming to improve sensorimotor functions.</p><p id="P22">In both motor imagery and execution, we found similar patterns of spatial consistency in S1 and M1, reaffirming their tight inter-connections and co-involvement not only in executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ogawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Umeda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wesselink et al., 2019</xref>) but also imagined finger movements. While S1 activity during motor execution is modulated by the sensory feedback from finger movements, it has been shown that top-down processes elicit activity in the form of predicted sensory consequences prior to (and in the complete absence of) sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ariani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bashford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gale et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jafari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">London &amp; Miller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Umeda et al., 2019</xref>). This top-down induced activity, or corollary discharge, in S1 is highly somatotopic with a topographic arrangement of individual fingers, while neuronal populations in M1 may be less selective towards individual fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arbuckle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hlu≈°t√≠k et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kakei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Schellekens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Schieber, 2001</xref>). Studying M1 and S1 separately is interesting due to their differences in somatotopic organisation. However, the exact delineation of M1 and S1 is challenging with 3T fMRI given the spatial resolution. Most previous studies investigated uni- and multivariate characteristics of finger representations using 7T fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Besle et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gooijers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wesselink et al., 2022</xref>) achieving a spatial resolution of ~ 1mm<sup>3</sup> (as opposed to 2.2 mm<sup>3</sup> in the present study). However, our results relating to the motor execution task are in line with studies using ultra-high field fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ejaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the similar findings obtained in S1 and M1 are not merely effects of the lower spatial resolution in our study, but likely attributable to the co-involvement of S1 and M1 during (imagined) finger movements.</p><p id="P23">Our results have implications for technologies relying on top-down processes to activate sensorimotor representations such as the control of BCIs, including neuroprosthetic devices. While top-down processes during fMRI assessments have been used for presurgical planning to optimally locate BCI target regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Downey et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Leinders et al., 2023</xref>), the reliability of these approaches to activate finger representations has not yet been explicitly studied. For BCI localisation, attempted movements are typically employed, as they were shown to result in higher blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity compared to motor imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hotz-Boendermaker et al., 2008</xref>) and better discrimination of specific representations using intracortical recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vargas-Irwin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P24">However, it is likely that some patients are unable to perform attempted movements. Our findings suggest that in these cases motor imagery can be used instead to reliably reveal finger maps. Additionally, our results validate the use of 3T fMRI to study and visualise top-down finger representations, which makes is more accessible in research and clinical settings than its 7T equivalent. The stability of top-down sensorimotor representations across sessions is promising for the use of decoding approaches that are intended for longer-term use. Finally, despite rather high variability across participants, similar as for finger representations activated through motor execution, we observed that motor imagery finger representations share some information across participants. This was evidenced in a decoding approach that successfully generalised across participants and implies that technologies focusing on decoding individual fingers, such as BCIs for fine-motor control, may benefit from pre-training with large datasets of multiple participants to improve performance.</p><p id="P25">Together, our results highlight the use of fMRI and multivariate analysis that takes into account the full activity pattern as a reliable method to study (top-down activated) finger representations in sensorimotor areas, also if a clearly ordered somatotopic organisation is lacking and activity levels are relatively low. We show that motor imagery, a mere top-down process, activates consistent finger representations over time. Additionally, we demonstrate that finger representations activated through motor imagery and motor execution contain mutual information. These findings not only validate the use of top-down processes for brain-computer interface control, but also have implications for the development of top-down training interventions targeting sensorimotor functions without relying on overt movements.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P26">The data used in this manuscript was published previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Odermatt et al.

The verbal task instructions replaced the fixation cross for the duration of the trial. After each trial, the fixation cross reappeared for a jittered period of 3-4 s during which participants were instructed to rest, i.e., as during the rest trials. This additional rest period was included to facilitate switching between different fingers during the motor imagery task. We instructed participants to imagine, as vividly as possible, how it would feel to move the cued finger (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1a</xref> for verbatim instructions). Additionally, we reminded them to not contract any finger muscles, as trained in the pre-fMRI session with EMG activity control. An experimenter visually controlled for finger movements inside the scanner room. If any movements were detected, we stopped the run, instructed the participant to refrain from executing finger movements, and repeated the run.

Our exploratory analyses included secondary motor areas, namely supplementary motor area (SMA), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). As these secondary brain regions were slightly overlapping with the M1 mask obtained from the Glasser atlas, we removed any overlapping voxels from all ROIs to avoid a voxel being assigned to multiple ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Spatial overlap analysis</title><p id="P39">The Dice Overlap Coefficient (DOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dice, 1945</xref>) was used to quantify the spatial consistency of univariate finger-selective (or winner-take-all) motor imagery and motor execution maps across sessions and participants. The DOC calculates the spatial overlap between two representations relative to the total area of these representations and varies from 0 (no spatial correspondence between finger representations) to 1 (perfect spatial correspondence between finger representations). Where A and B are the areas of two finger representations, the DOC is expressed as:

We minimally thresholded (Z &gt; 2) the winner-take-all maps to obtain finger-selective activity clusters and masked these clusters using the ROIs (S1, M1, SMA, PMd, or PMv). We then used the in-vertex volume between the white matter and pial surfaces to calculate the volume covered by the thresholded representations and the resulting DOCs.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Within participant</title><p id="P41">To assess within-participant consistency of univariate finger maps, we calculated the DOC for all possible finger pairings across the two fMRI sessions per participant. We then categorised the finger pairs in ‚Äòsame‚Äô, ‚Äòneighbouring‚Äô and ‚Äònon-neighbouring‚Äô. A benchmark for finger-selectivity identified in univariate finger maps is greater DOC for the same finger representations than for neighbouring finger pairs, followed by non-neighbouring finger pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kikkert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanders et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we investigated whether there is such spatial correspondence in the finger-selectivity across two fMRI sessions for motor imagery finger representations and whether it differed from motor execution. If spatial correspondence is high across two sessions, the DOC is higher for the same finger representations across sessions compared to neighbouring and non-neighbouring representations. To investigate how the choice of threshold influences the spatial overlap results, the DOC was further calculated as a function of Z-thresholds ranging from 1.4 to 3.2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Within vs. across participants</title><p id="P42">To investigate the spatial correspondence of finger maps across participants, we calculated the DOC for all possible finger pairs and participants across sessions and constructed an across-participants DOC comparison matrix (48 x 48 for motor imagery and motor execution with three fingers; 80 x 80 for motor execution with five fingers), similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kolasinski et al., (2016</xref>). The across-participants matrix consisted of submatrices (16 x 16) containing the DOC for the 16 participants for each possible finger pair. We then calculated the matrix dominance ratio (Mdr) for each submatrix (i.e., each finger pair) by dividing the average of the diagonal (i.e., DOCs of the same participant) to the average of the off-diagonal (i.e., DOCs across different participant pairs). Values &gt; 1 indicate higher overlap of finger representations within the same participants than across participants. We then computed the overall Mdr by calculating a higher-order Mdr of the Mdr scores in the submatrices. Here, a value &gt; 1 indicates a matrix dominance for spatial correspondence of ‚Äòsame‚Äô finger representations compared to ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô (i.e., neighbouring and non-neighbouring) finger pairs. To obtain a p-value indicating significance of the overall Mdr value, we applied bootstrap resampling (n = 10‚Äô000) to the across-participants DOC comparison matrix.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Multivariate pattern analysis</title><p id="P43">While the (univariate) spatial overlap analysis gives insight into the consistency of winner-take-all finger-specific activity clusters across sessions and participants, it does not account for the full activity pattern associated with individual (imagined) finger movements. In contrast, MVPA allows to examine the spatial consistency of the full intricate activity patterns associated with individual (imagined) finger movements. Here, we used multivariate classification analysis to decode the instructed finger during motor imagery (or motor execution) from the single-trial parameter estimates in a specific ROI (S1 hand area, M1 hand area, SMA, PMd, or PMv), using the scikit-learn python library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>). To prepare the data set, we extracted the single-trial parameter estimates corresponding to the vertices in a ROI using nibabel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brett et al., 2024</xref>). We then scaled the data across all motor imagery (or motor execution) runs for each session and participant separately with the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to remove the mean and scale to unit variance within each vertex. Next, we performed the classification analysis using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and default parameters of C = 1 and l2 regularisation.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Within session</title><p id="P44">Within each session, and separately for each participant, we conducted a leave-one-run-out cross-validation. We evaluated the classifier performance based on the classification accuracy averaged across cross-validation folds and labels. To compare the actual and predicted labels, we averaged the confusion matrices obtained from each cross-validation fold. To define chance level, we generated a null distribution based on 1000 random permutations of the trial labels. We then computed an empirical p-value by dividing the number of permutation-based classification accuracies that were greater than or equal to the true score +1, by the number of permutations + 1 as implemented in scikit-learn. Finally, we averaged the classification accuracies, confusion matrices and empirical p-values across the two sessions for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Across sessions</title><p id="P45">To investigate whether a classifier trained on one session within a participant generalised to data acquired in another session, we performed an across-sessions decoding analysis. For that, we fitted a linear SVM on all data of the first session and tested it on all trials of the second session, and vice versa. To determine the empirical chance level and p-values, we shuffled the labels of the test set using 1000 permutations. We then averaged the two classification accuracies, confusion matrices and p-values for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Across participants</title><p id="P46">To test whether a classifier may generalise across participants, we conducted a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation pooling the data of both sessions together.

To determine statistical significance of classification accuracy at group level, i.e., whether classification accuracy is significantly above the empirical chance level, we combined the empirical p-values across participants using Fisher‚Äôs method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fisher, 1992</xref>). To compare within-session to across-session accuracy, we used paired t-tests (or non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests if normality was violated according to the Shapiro-Wilk test). To compare within-session or across-session accuracy to across-participants accuracy (that consisted of only one value per ROI), we used one-sample t-tests.</p><p id="P49">To examine the effects and interaction of tasks and conditions on DOC and classification accuracy, we used lme4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) for linear mixed-effects models.

For each model, we evaluated the expected against observed residuals for uniform distribution using the R package DHARMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartig, 2022</xref>). If violations were detected (which was the case for the models on DOC in both S1 and M1), we used glmmTMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>) instead, which allows the dispersion parameter of the linear mixed-effects model to vary with the different levels of the factors. If the linear mixed-effects models revealed significant main effects or interaction, we computed post-hoc contrasts using emmeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lenth, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P50">To examine whether subjective measures of attentional and cognitive states (i.e., vividness of motor imagery averaged across the three fingers and the four runs, motivation, focus and effort; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for differences in the subjective measures across the two sessions) were associated with within-session classification accuracy, we performed linear regressions on the average within-session classification accuracy using the average of the subjective measures reported in both sessions. To assess potential multicollinearity of fixed effects, we examined the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). Due to high multicollinearity, we excluded the predictor with the highest VIF (focus: VIF = 9.76), and rerun the model, resulting in low (i.e., &lt; 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">James et al., 2021</xref>) multicollinearity of predictors (vividness = 2.87, effort = 2.87, motivation = 2.59). To evaluate whether changes in the subjective measures predict the generalisibility of a classifier across sessions we calculated session 2 minus session 1 difference scores per subjective measure and included these as fixed effects in the model. The average score of the across-sessions classification accuracy was the dependent variable. Multicollinearity was again high (focus: VIF = 25.96). After excluding focus, VIFs were &lt; 5 for the remaining predictors (vividness = 1.87, effort = 1.11, motivation = 1.76).</p><p id="P51">The significance level alpha was set to 0.05 for all inferential tests. We corrected the p-values for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni Holmes method within each ROI.

sulcal pattern in dark grey. The top left shows the magnified area (black square), encompassing the hand area of the primary somatosensory (S1; green) and primary motor cortex (M1; purple). The colours of activity clusters refer to the winner-take-all finger contrasts thresholded at Z &gt; 2 (red = thumb; blue = index finger; yellow = little finger). Typical finger-selectivity maps can be observed with a gradient of finger preference, progressing from the thumb (laterally) to the little finger (medially). While these characteristic aspects of finger maps are displayed for most participants, some finger representations are not visible in the minimally thresholded maps.

The diagonal of the matrix represents the overlap of the same finger representations and participants across the two sessions. The 16 x 16 submatrices depicted by the white lines show the overlap for a specific finger pair for all participants. Right: Matrix dominance ratio (Mdr) for all submatrices based on the matrix on the left. The values &gt; 1 on the diagonal reflect that the spatial overlap of the same finger representations was higher within-participant than across-participants. For neighbouring and non-neighbouring fingers there was no such higher spatial overlap within compared to across participants. From the Mdr matrix, an overall Mdr was calculated. A value &gt; 1 indicates higher within-participant consistency than across-participants consistency. Bootstrapping revealed that the overall Mdr is significantly different from chance.

Within-session classification accuracy depicts the average accuracy of a leave-one-run-out cross-validation performed separately for each participant and session. Across-sessions is based on the average accuracy score of a within-participant classifier trained on all trials of one session and tested on all trials of the other session. Across-participants classification accuracy shows the average accuracy of a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation using the data of all participants. Paired classical and Bayesian t-tests suggest that within-session and across-sessions accuracy do not differ significantly (BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.52). One-sample t-tests demonstrate significantly higher classification accuracy for classifiers trained and tested within-participants compared to across-participants, indicating higher within-participant consistency of motor imagery finger represenations over time than across-participants.
