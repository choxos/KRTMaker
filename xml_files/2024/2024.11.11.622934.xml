Here, we adopt a new perspective on information gathering and demonstrate an information integration bias where most recent information is over-weighted by means of evidence strength updates (ΔES). In a large, crowd-sourced sample (N=5,237), we find reduced ΔES-weighting drives indecisiveness along an OC spectrum. We replicate the attenuated ΔES-weighting in a second lab-based study (N=105) that includes a transdiagnostic OC spectrum encompassing OCD and generalised anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace ΔES signals to a late neural signal peaking around 920 ms. Critically, high-OC participants show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in medio-frontal areas while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information-weighting as a key driver of information gathering, where attenuated ΔES can lead to indecisiveness across an OC spectrum.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Knowing when to decide is difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. From selecting a movie on a streaming platform to buying a car, whenever there is uncertainty about the ‘right’ choice, gathering more information usually helps us make better decisions. But being indecisive and spending too much time gathering information is also disadvantageous and carries substantial opportunity and energy costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In humans information gathering biases are common, often expressed as gathering too little or too much information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Dramatically inflated information gathering biases are a feature of psychopathology and believed to drive core symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. For example, indecisiveness and persistent doubt can be debilitating aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Excessive deliberation also extends beyond core OCD symptoms and can impact everyday wellbeing and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">While indecisiveness in OCD is traditionally assessed using clinical interviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, recent literature has provided a more quantitative approach based upon using information gathering tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Studies using the latter have shown that patients with OCD, as well as nonclinical participants with high obsessive-compulsive (OC) scores, manifest elevated levels of information gathering before committing to a decision. While similar effects have been observed in naturalistic settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the precise neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the expression of indecisiveness remain unknown.</p><p id="P6">A relevant field of study, largely disconnected from information gathering, is that of evidence accumulation in decision making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Here it is considered that evidence for different options increases gradually with incoming information, and a decision is made when evidence for an option hits a decision threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The latter is believed to collapse with time, meaning that decisions become increasingly liberal, which is often framed in terms of an urgency signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These effects are observed in a range of information gathering contexts despite striking differences in tasks and timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Importantly, recent studies suggest that evidence does not accumulate linearly as a function of decision-relevant information, but in a recency-biased manner such that most recent evidence is over-weighted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Determining whether such biases also exist in information gathering, and whether they act as drivers for indecisiveness is an important question.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we investigate the neurocognitive contributors to information gathering across two large samples and tasks which we previously collected in the lab. We find that, in addition to urgency-like signals, evidence is integrated non-monotonically, with what we term evidence strength updates (ΔES) critically determining when a participant decides to decide. Furthermore, across both studies, we find that participants along an OC spectrum rely less on these ΔES both in clinical and nonclinical samples. Using magnetencephalography (MEG), we show this attenuation of ΔES is mirrored in the brain, with neural ΔES representations in medio-frontal areas being less evident in OC whereas other critical contributors to information gathering remain intact. We conclude that indecisiveness along an OC spectrum is driven by a reduced reliance on most recent information.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cognitive contributors to information gathering</title><p id="P8">To first ascertain a link between information gathering and OC symptoms in the general population, we conducted a large-scale, crowd-sourced study (N = 5,237 at the time of analysis). To this end, we implemented an information gathering task on an app for handheld electronic devices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainexplorer.net">www.brainexplorer.net</ext-link>), where participants had to decide which of two stimuli was more plentiful across 25 hidden locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Participants were free to sample as many of the locations as they wanted before committing to a decision, such that we could use the number of draws prior to a decision as an index of indecisiveness.</p><p id="P9">First, to better understand the cognitive contributors to participants’ information gathering behaviour, we used general linear mixed models (GLMMs) to predict on each draw whether a participant would continue sampling information or make a decision (<italic>p(decide)</italic>). In this task, information accumulated non-monotonically, allowing us to distinguish the contribution of different factors (e.g., current information, total evidence, number of draws) to commitment to a decision. To test whether a recency bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> is present in an information gathering context, we distinguished total evidence strength on the previous draw (|∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>|; absolute cumulative evidence difference across draw 1 to d-1 for the current majority) from the most recent change in evidence strength or evidence strength update (ΔES; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Model comparison favoured the aforementioned distinction over a model where all evidence was aggregated in a single predictor (ΔAIC = 1.709 × 10<sup>6</sup>; ΔBIC = 1.709 × 10<sup>6</sup>). We found that both the current update in signal strength (ΔES, β = 1.098, SE = 0.008, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and previous evidence strength (|∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>|; β = 1.038, SE = 0.005, p &lt; 0.001) positively predicted whether participants would commit to a decision. An additional GLMM predicting <italic>p(decide)</italic> from the current evidence at draw d, d-1 and d-2 relative to the chosen option showed a decreasing contribution of current evidence for lagged draws (ES<sub>d</sub>: β = 0.648 SE = 0.007, p &lt; 0.001; ES<sub>d-1</sub>: β = 0.253 SE = 0.004, p &lt; 0.001; ES<sub>d-2</sub>: β = 0.195 SE = 0.005, p &lt; 0.001, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). This accords with a recency-bias in information gathering, analogous to that found across other decision making domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. It is particularly striking as this task was designed so that all information remained present on the screen irrespective of when it was gathered, such that this recency-bias is not accounted for by working memory limitations or related explanations.</p><p id="P11">In keeping with the idea of collapsing decision boundaries or urgency signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, we added draw number as a predictor. Draw number additionally predicted whether participants would make a decision (β = 1.799, SE = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001) such that participants were more likely to stop gathering information the longer they had already spent gathering information (irrespective of how strong the evidence is) and, in addition, if they (recently) received stronger evidence favouring one option over the other.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OC-linked indecisiveness is due to attenuation of evidence weighting</title><p id="P12">Next, we investigated whether an OC spectrum was linked to indecisiveness. Taking the number of draws prior to making a decision as an indicator of indecisiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, we found - as hypothesised - that participants with higher OC symptoms (as determined by the OCI-R total score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>) gathered more evidence before making a decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0.040, p = 0.004), while not showing any difference in accuracy for these decisions (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -9.998 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, p = 0. 942). Thus, in this large information-gathering dataset we find indecisiveness relates to OC symptoms across the general population.</p><p id="P13">Next, we investigated which of the identified cognitive contributors explained differences in task behaviour in high-OC participants. We found that OC symptoms were linked to reduced weighting of previous evidence |∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>| (β = –0.053, SE = 0.007, p &lt; 0.001) and particularly of ΔES (β = -0.085, SE = 0.009, p &lt; 0.001). There was no main effect of OC symptoms on sampling decisions (<italic>p(decide)</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, β = 0.033, SE = 0.030, p = 0.265), implying that the increased draws prior to a decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) is not a simple consequence of a tendency not to decide; and, contrary to our initial assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> there was no effect on urgency (as captured by the interaction with the number of draws; β = -0.016, SE = 0.019, p = 0.265). We found similar but weaker effects of OC symptoms on evidence weighting when comparing a subset of participants with a self-reported OCD diagnosis with those who explicitly declared no lifetime psychiatric disorder (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Further, by fitting an additional GLM predicting <italic>p(decide)</italic> from the current evidence at draw d, d-1 and d-2 relative to the chosen option per participant, we found that a difference in beta weights for the evidence at draw d and the evidence at draw d-1 correlated negatively with the OCI-R score (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.068, p &lt; 0.001), supporting the notion of a decreased recency effect. This means that high-OC participants were no more likely to decide per se, or express an altered urgency signal, but instead showed an attenuated impact of the most recent information sample. In other words, evidence strength updates seem to be driving an indecisiveness along the OC spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Lowered confidence in high-OC participants mediated by attenuated ΔES</title><p id="P14">Having identified key drivers of indecisiveness, we next assessed if this was a purely behavioural effect or whether it also affected participants’ perception of their performance or insight. To assess this, we asked participants to rate their post-choice confidence (prior to viewing the outcome; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We found that OC symptoms were also linked to confidence, with high-OC participants having lower confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>; ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.054, p = 0.002, N = 3,293 after excluding additional participants based on confidence data criteria, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). This means that the OC spectrum was not only linked to indecisive information gathering but also to a lack of confidence, a finding that aligns with evidence of impoverished confidence in other domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. It also chimes with the notion that indecisiveness is closely linked to subjective doubt.</p><p id="P15">Lastly, using a mediation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, we evaluated the link between the reduced ΔES weight from our information gathering analysis and confidence findings. We found that the ΔES weighting (using beta estimates from non-hierarchical models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) was associated with task confidence (b = -0.07, SE = 0.018, t(3293) = -3.754, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). More specifically, we found that ΔES partially mediated the influence of OC symptoms on confidence (ab = 0.01, SE = 0.003, t(3293) = 3.402, p &lt; 0.001, c = -0.04, SE = 0.017, t(3293) = -2.467, p = 0.014, c’ = -0.05, SE = 0.018, t(3293) = -2.986, p = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). This means that the lower confidence in high-OC participants is, at least in part, influenced by the same underlying process as that of attenuated ΔES.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cognitive contributors to information gathering replicate in a lab-based sample</title><p id="P16">As the above dataset was primarily derived from a large, self-selected, population of non-clinical participants, we next asked whether the findings also held true in a more targeted patient sample. Thus, we analysed an independent sample that included patients assessed in the lab (N = 105), using a novel adaptation of the above information gathering paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) which had been previously collected in the lab.</p><p id="P17">We first replicated the findings related to the cognitive contributors to information gathering per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Both ΔES (β = 0.830, SE =0.020, p &lt; 0.001) and previous evidence strength (β = 0.516, SE = 0.021, p &lt; 0.001) positively predicted when participants would make a decision. Likewise, we replicated the effect of current draw number (β = 2.367, SE = 0.069, p &lt; 0.001), supporting the notion of an emerging decision urgency. A noteworthy extension here was that this lab version featured two different finite horizons, meaning that each game would end after a probabilistically predetermined number of draws (either 4-8 in the ‘short’ or 10-14 in the ‘long’ horizon condition). We found that this horizon condition significantly predicted participants’ decision making (β = 1.602, SE = 0.074, p &lt; 0.001). In other words, participants are not only more likely to commit to a decision if they (recently) received more evidence for one of the options and if they had already gathered information for longer, but also if they are incentivised to trade off speed for accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Attenuated ΔES are also linked to OC symptoms in a transdiagnostic clinical sample</title><p id="P18">Next, we investigated how these predictors’ link to an OC spectrum in a sample consisting of a clinical group of OCD patients (N = 29) and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) patients (N = 17), as well as non-patient cohorts with varying degrees of OC symptoms (high OC: N = 20, low OC: N = 20, controls: N = 19). This recruitment strategy allowed for a broad sampling of OC symptoms not only in OCD patients but also in adjacent disorders as well as non-clinical high-OC participants. A similar approach has previously revealed striking dissociations between transdiagnostic dimensions and traditional diagnostic categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To derive a transdiagnostic and dimensional OC symptom measure, we factor analysed key psychiatric questionnaires collected across the entire sample, yielding a three-factor solution where one factor primarily reflected OCD and related symptoms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). On average, OCD patients ranked highest on this factor, followed by high-compulsive non-patients and GAD patients, while low-compulsive and controls ranked the lowest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Investigating how this transdiagnostic OC factor linked to cognitive contributors of information gathering, we again replicated the effect of ΔES (β = -0.049, SE = 0.020, p = 0.013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C and D</xref>), such that high-OC participants weighted the update in evidence strength less in their decision to declare for a stimulus. Similar, albeit less robust, effects were seen when comparing OCD patients to matched controls alone (β = -0.102, SE = 0.061, p = 0.046, one-sided test). In addition, by fitting an additional GLM predicting <italic>p(decide)</italic> from the evidence at draw d, d-1 and d-2 relative to the chosen option per participant, we again found a decreasing contribution of current evidence for lagged draws (ES<sub>d</sub>: β = 0.519 SE = 0.015, p &lt; 0.001; ES<sub>d-1</sub>: β = 0.212 SE = 0.013, p &lt; 0.001; ES<sub>d-2</sub>: β = 0.216 SE = 0.010, p &lt; 0.001, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), and that the difference in beta weights for the evidence at draw d and the evidence at draw d-1 correlated negatively with OC symptoms (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.199, p = 0. 024, one-sided test).</p><p id="P20">As was the case for the previous population sample, we find no main effect of OC symptoms (β = 0.055, SE = 0.055, p = 0.318), or any interaction with the current number of draws (β = -0.098, SE = 0.069, p = 0.155) or with the horizon condition (β = -0.074, SE = 0.074, p = 0.320). In this sample, the interaction of OC symptoms with previous evidence did not reach significance (β = -0.023, SE = 0.021, p = 0.272), in contrast to the first, larger sample. In sum, this further supports the notion that an over-reliance on most recent information during information gathering is attenuated in high-OC participants, including patients.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Attenuated ΔES are primarily linked to obsessions in OCD patients</title><p id="P21">Lastly, we asked whether an attenuated weighting of ΔES was linked to symptom severity, especially in patients with OCD. To this end, we correlated the scores from the clinical Y-BOCS interview (only conducted in OCD patients by trained researchers) with the ΔES effect on information gathering. Interestingly, we found that attenuated weighting of ΔES was significantly associated with symptom severity for obsessions (ρ<sub>s</sub> =-0.475, p=0.012), but not for compulsions (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.205, p = 0.306; total score trended at ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.342, p = 0. 081). This suggests that the attenuated weighting of recent information may be primarily linked to an obsession dimension, in line with the idea that underweighting of information about the unlikely nature of the obsessions promotes their perpetuation.</p><p id="P22">To assess how generalisable this effect was, we went back to the complete samples in both studies, and found that ΔES attenuation related to obsessions from the OCI-R questionnaire both in the smartphone population sample (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.083, p &lt; 0.001) as well as in the lab-based sample (including patients and non-patients: ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.226, p = 0.030). However, these effects were less specific (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), possibly due to range effects across the wide spectrum of patients and non-patients.</p><p id="P23">Thus, our findings indicate that attenuated ΔES are not only associated with OC symptoms across a wide OC spectrum, but also linked to symptom severity of obsessions within OCD patients.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The brain processes decision-relevant factors sequentially</title><p id="P24">To better understand the brain processes relevant for information gathering, we concurrently acquired magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from all participants in our second study. Here the validity of our behavioural model leads to the prediction that we could decode (5-fold cross-validated iterative lasso regression with whole-brain MEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>) each of the relevant cognitive factors used to predict information gathering, as described above - namely, ΔES, total evidence strength at draw d-1 |∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>|, horizon, and number of draws.</p><p id="P25">We found evidence for a representation of each of the aforementioned factors in our MEG data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; p &lt; 0.05 cluster-based permutation tests at t &gt; 3), supporting the idea that the brain tracks these variables. Interestingly, these representations were instantiated at different times within a trial following a sequential order, where pre-existing latent factors were represented first and novel information, that needed to be computed based on these latent representations, was represented later in a trial. Specifically, we found that the representations of the number of draws, horizon and the total evidence at draw d-1 preceded the representation of ΔES (comparison of maximum decodability timepoint; number of draws vs ΔES: t(104) = - 14.773, p &lt; 0.001; horizon vs ΔES: t(104) = -5.387, p &lt; 0.001; |∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>| vs ΔES: t(104) = - 23.750, p &lt; 0.001, one-sided tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Importantly, the representation of the currently shown evidence (quantified as the relative evidence for the two alternative response options in the current draw) also preceded the representation of ΔES (t(104) = -8.711, p &lt; 0.001, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>), as would be expected when considering that ΔES is computed based on both previous total evidence and current evidence. In addition, we observed that latent variables that are not dependent on currently presented information manifest as a more sustained representation (e.g., horizon), consistent with the fact they do not need to be computed on the fly after each draw. Thus, our findings demonstrate a cascade of neural information processing and representation that aligns with the evolution of cognitive processes we deciphered from participants’ behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Reduced neural signatures of ΔES in high-OC participants mirror behavioural findings</title><p id="P26">Having established the decodability of cognitive contributors to information gathering, we next tested whether these representations were altered in high-OC participants. More concretely, given a reduced effect of ΔES on behaviour in the latter group, we hypothesised a reduced strength of this representation in the brain. On this basis, we assessed how transdiagnostic OC symptoms related to the decodability of ΔES. We found that ΔES representations were attenuated in high-OC participants, whereby two time periods reached significance using cluster-based permutation testing, namely 420-470 ms and 530-560 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>; controlling for other psychiatric factors). Neither the decodability of the variable nor the individual differences appear driven by the effect of a commitment to a final decision, as both decodability and individual differences associated with the OC factor remained consistent after omitting the sample immediately preceding the response (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Likewise, the results held for the cumulative evidence strength for the current majority ∑ES<sub>d</sub>, as opposed to the update in evidence strength ΔES (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). When analysing other variables, we did not find any links with the OC spectrum. This means that – as per behavioural findings – the ΔES representation is attenuated in participants with high OC symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Attenuation of ΔES representations arise from mediofrontal areas</title><p id="P27">Lastly, we investigated the likely regional origins of an attenuated OC spectrum-related ΔES signal.

Here, using the largest ever behavioural dataset in combination with data from a novel neuroimaging task, we show that attenuated weighting of most recent information by means of evidence-strength updates (ΔES) drives altered information gathering across an OC spectrum. Our finding of attenuated ΔES was evident at the level of both behaviour and brain, and was also evident dimensionally and transdiagnostically across both patients and those with non-clinical symptoms.</p><p id="P29">Excessive information gathering has been extensively investigated in relation to OCD and OC-like symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, yet the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Much previous work on information gathering (including our own) has focused on altered decision criteria, such as collapsing decision thresholds or urgency signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, ignoring the possibility that evidence integration (i.e., how information gathered at different timepoints is combined) might be implicated. We show that information integration shows a strong recency effect, where most recent information (by means of ΔES) exerts a much bigger impact on deciding, and when to decide, than more remote information. A recency weighting has been argued to confer an advantage under certain signal strength conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> or in dynamic contexts where the latest information is most representative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. It is also well aligned with similar recency biases found across domains that span perception, memory and mood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the nonlinear accrual of evidence has been widely accepted in the reward learning domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, and the present results indicate similar mechanisms are at play also during information gathering. Crucially, ΔES is also represented in the brain, as a late electrophysiological component peaking approximately 920 ms after new information is revealed. Importantly, this ΔES representation peaks following the representation of other decision variables from which it is computed (specifically, newly revealed information and prior evidence), further supporting a putative sequential cascade of information processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">A mediofrontal localisation of the ΔES decodability is strongly reminiscent of that found in previous studies on information sampling during value-based decisions, where consistency of current evidence with a participant’s belief is signalled by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation in single-cell recordings from monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> and in an equivalent human fMRI paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. In line with the strong effect of ΔES on the probability of committing to a decision, ACC signals peak immediately prior to the final decision in monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. While the signal we show here does not depend crucially on the brain activity immediately prior to commitment to a decision (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>), it should be noted that this possibility would be best addressed using a response-locked analysis, as opposed to the stimulus-locked approach we chose, and remains a question for future studies.</p><p id="P31">The ΔES measure may also fit within a broader belief-updating or predictive coding framework, provided the evidence strength for the current majority maps onto a participant’s current belief. If this assumption holds, ΔES can be cast as a type of prediction error (PE), in that it captures the deviation from the expectation formed in the previous draw. While different prediction errors have been described beyond the classic reward prediction errors, from perceptual to cognitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, ΔES is different in so far as it is not based on explicit feedback for a completed action but rather on novel information available during the decision making process. As such, its relationship to a traditional conceptualisation of PEs needs to be established. This also applies to its implementation in the brain as well - while classic reward PEs have been associated with dopamine signalling, the extent to which dopamine influences information gathering is less clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> and other candidate neurotransmitter systems, such as noradrenaline or serotonin, may conceivably contribute to the formation of ΔES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">Critically for this study, we find attenuation of ΔES in people with (clinically and non-clinically) high OC symptoms and we propose it is the likely driver underlying excess information gathering behaviour found by draws-to-decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (though see also<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>). Importantly, we find a closer association between the ΔES weighting and the OC dimension, than with draws to a decision alone, supporting the notion this is the driving factor, while the latter behavioural marker is likely also under the influence of many other cognitive contributors, such as stringent constraints, urgency signals, and clear speed-accuracy trade-offs (as found in our MEG experiment). The finding of attenuated ΔES in OC, without a significant effect on draws to a decision, in the more constrained MEG experiment (cf. horizon conditions) also speaks to this, and accords with previous literature showing intact adjustments in speed-accuracy trade-offs in OCD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> Our finding of an attenuated neural representation of ΔES in high-OC participants also suggests that it may provide a sensitive biomarker.

Indecisiveness manifests in different ways in the real world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> with different degrees of severity, which motivated the dimensional and transdiagnostic approach adopted here that included patients diagnosed with OCD and with generalised anxiety (GAD). We found that OC symptoms are not exclusive to OCD patients but are prominent in some GAD patients and non-clinical, high OC, participants in our sample (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). While data on indecisiveness in clinically diagnosed GAD is lacking, our findings align with previous reports of high indecisiveness in undiagnosed individuals with probable GAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> as well as in those with high levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Moreover, our findings supports a transdiagnostic approach adopted in previous studies where dimensional measures outperformed traditional diagnostic categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

To perform this analysis, we obtained a measure of sensitivity to ΔES for each individual participant by fitting a separate general linear model (GLM) to each participant predicting the probability to make a decision, based on the same experimental factors as in the GLMM. We then tested if the individual beta coefficients for ΔES mediated the negative association between mean confidence and OCI-R scores.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>In-lab MEG sample</title><p id="P54">We performed an analogous analysis, while accounting for sample and task differences. As stated above, we used the OC factor score to quantify variability in OC symptoms.

The interaction of ΔES with the horizon was omitted in the participant-level GLMs, as the beta coefficient was not significantly different from zero.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26"><title>MEG analysis</title><sec id="S27"><title>Data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p id="P55">Participants sat upright in the scanner while MEG was recorded continuously using a 275-channel system, whereby sensor MLO42 was missing for all participants, and in addition sensor MRC12 was missing for 59 participants. Empty channels were added in these cases in order to keep the dimensionality of the MEG data consistent across participants. Bad-quality channels were removed and not interpolated. Physiological and technical artefact removal was performed manually using Fieldtrip. The data was down-sampled to 100 Hz and high-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz to remove slow drift effects. Data was segmented into 1350-ms segments from -100 to 1250ms relative to stimulus onset. MEG data was z-scored by block and channel (univariate normalisation).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Decoding analysis</title><p id="P56">Whole-brain MEG activity was used to decode ΔES using an iterative multivariate lasso regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Here, we estimated the lasso regression 2,000 times, using a random subset of 50 sensors on each iteration. The primary benefit of this method is the increased reliability of the individual differences analysis, relative to a single iteration of a multivariate lasso regression using all channels. The regularization parameter λ was set at 0.01 using 5-fold cross-validation. The value for the regularization parameter was tuned by optimizing the cross-validation performance of an orthogonal variable, namely the current evidence for yellow (correlation between current evidence for yellow and ΔES: r = 2.755 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, p = 0.920), and was fixed for all subsequent whole-brain analyses. The initial optimization procedure was conducted using a non-iterative multivariate lasso regression using all 273 channels, yet note that the decodability using the iterative method remains extremely similar for a range of regularization parameter values in follow up analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P57">The correlation between the tested and trained data constituted the measure of decodability. Non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests against 0 were used to determine the time window at which the decodability was significant, setting the t statistic threshold at 3 and using one-sided p &lt; 0.05. Individual differences in decodability were assessed by predicting the decodability at each time point from the three factor scores in a GLM per time point. Significant differences were assessed by non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests at each time point in which the factor scores were shuffled across participants while maintaining the factor score combination constant (t = 2, p &lt; 0.025, two-sided test). Correlation values were normalized by dividing these by the maximum correlation value for visualization purposes, yet note that all statistical tests were performed prior to normalisation.</p><p id="P58">To investigate which brain areas underpin the decoding, we used a searchlight analysis, such that the lasso regression was estimated 273 times, i.e., for each sensor and its direct neighbors, determined using the Fieldtrip <italic>ft_prepare_neighbours</italic> function. Given the stark difference in the number of sensors used in the searchlight analysis, we first fine-tuned the value of the regularization parameter λ in the same way as above, and set it at 0.001. We then calculated the mean decodability per sensor within a given time window of interest to generate sensor contribution maps. To explore individual differences in the sensor contribution maps, we fit a GLM predicting the sensor contribution per sensor averaged across the time window of interest from the three factor scores. In order to keep the sensor subsets constant across participants, sensors MLO42 and MRC12 were omitted for all.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS200095-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Central London OCD support group, the OCD Action charity, the North East London NHS foundation, especially the IAPT services at Waltham Forest, Redbridge and Barking &amp; Dagenham, and the Camden and Islington NHS talking therapies service iCope for their help with patient recruitment.</p><p>TUH is supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (211155/Z/18/Z; 211155/Z/18/B; 224051/Z/21) from Wellcome &amp; Royal Society, a grant from the Jacobs Foundation (2017-1261-04), the Medical Research Foundation, a 2018 NARSAD Young Investigator grant (27023) from the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation, and a Philip Leverhulme Prize from the Leverhulme Trust (PLP-2021-040).

id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>OC symptoms are linked to increased information gathering in a large-scale smartphone population study.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The participants’ task was to determine which of two possible gems was more abundant. They were free to uncover as much evidence as they wished, by tapping on locations on the grid, until they decided to commit to a binary choice between one of two gems. An example sequence of samples and corresponding evidence accumulation process for cumulative evidence strength at the previous draw |∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>| and the evidence strength update ΔES is depicted on the right. Participants rated their confidence after every binary choice, then received 100 points for correct responses or lost 100 points for incorrect responses. <bold>B</bold> Within a large-scale sample of the general population, individuals with higher OC symptoms sampled more information before committing to a decision. Data points pertaining to individuals with a self-reported OCD diagnosis are shown in orange. <bold>C</bold> The probability of making a decision p(decide) was predicted from experimental factors as well as individual differences in OC symptoms using a general linear mixed model. The experimental factors (left y-axis) comprised current draw number, cumulative evidence from the start of the game until the previous draw (|∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>|), and the evidence strength update (ΔES). More draws and higher |∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>| and ΔES increased the probability of making a decision p(decide). Individual differences in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (right y-axis) were quantified as the main effect of the OCI-R score, and the interactions of the OCI-R score with the experimental factors. The analysis showed that OC symptoms per se did not have a significant effect on p(decide), and that people with high OC symptoms did not weight the current draw number differently in deciding to commit to a choice – instead they weighted both previous and current evidence less. The latter effect is illustrated in <bold>D</bold>: to obtain estimates of sensitivity to evidence at a single-participant level, we fit a GLM predicting p(decide) separately for each participant. Convergent with the significant interaction effect in the GLMM, those with higher OC symptoms had reduced beta coefficients for ΔES, i.e., they weighed ΔES less in deciding to commit (N = 3,903 after removing outliers, defined as any participant with any beta values outside of the interquartile range). <bold>E</bold> Individuals with higher OC symptoms also rated their confidence in their decisions as being lower on average (N = 3,293, see exclusion criteria in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). <bold>F</bold> A mediation analysis suggests that sensitivity to ΔES partially mediates the association between OC symptoms (OCI-R total score) and confidence ratings, such that lower confidence is partially explained by altered evidence integration.

They were presented with a sequence of draws until they decided to declare for a stimulus. Each draw consisted of five stimuli at a time in varying proportions. Here, sequences were constructed to reduce the collinearity between the number of draws, current and previous evidence, which will allow us to study their specific representations in the brain. The maximum number of draws varied between 4 and 8 in the short horizon condition and between 10 and 14 in the long horizon condition. The horizon condition was cued by the colour of the frame (different colours were presented in the task). Participants received 2 points for a correct response, lost 2 points for an incorrect response, and lost 1 point for non-decisions, which were later translated into bonus payments. <bold>B</bold> In order to pool across clinical and non-clinical groups, we reduced the dimensionality of seven questionnaires using an exploratory factor analysis. This revealed a three-factor solution, where the second factor mapped primarily onto items in questionnaires assessing OCD (OCI-R and PI-WSUR). We used this OC factor to quantify individual differences across all participants. <bold>C</bold> The number of draws to a decision varied across trials and participants in the short and long horizon condition. Note that the number of draws to a decision per se was not associated with the transdiagnostic OC factor (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.117, p = 0. 236), yet this is not surprising given the highly constraining horizon manipulation. <bold>D</bold> The probability to make a decision was predicted in a GLMM from experimental factors as well as variability in the OC factor. Experimental factors (left) comprised the number of draws, the cumulative evidence strength from the start of the game until the previous draw|∑ES<sub>d-1</sub>|, ΔES, and the horizon condition (controlling for interactions of the horizon condition with all other experimental factors). More draws, higher previous and current evidence strength, and a short horizon condition all increase the probability to make a decision. Individual differences in the OC factor (right) are quantified as the main effect of the OC factor score and its interaction with the experimental factors. The GLMM shows no significant effect of the OC factor per se, or differences in weighting the current number of draws or the previous evidence in making a decision. Conversely, it shows that those with higher OC factor scores weight ΔES less in making a decision. <bold>E</bold> Illustration of the association between ΔES weighting and the OC factor (using individual GLMs per participant; N = 92 after outlier exclusions were applied to all beta coefficients in the GLM). <bold>F</bold> OCD patients with stronger obsession symptom severity had more attenuated weighting of ΔES (ρ<sub>s</sub> = -0.475, p = 0.012).
