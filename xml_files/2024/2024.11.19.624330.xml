Cells must recognise damaged membranes and orchestrate repair programmes to preserve compartmentalisation. A variety of cellular factors including ESCRTs, Annexins, stress granules, lipids and proteins allowing vesicle and organelle fusion with damaged membranes have been reported to contribute to membrane repair. However, whether these factors operate independently or together to repair membranes is unclear. Here, we expose temporal differences and interdependencies in the recruitment of ESCRT-III and Annexin proteins to sites of membrane damage. We show that while Annexins are recruited immediately to sites of damage, ESCRT-III assembles only after membrane sealing. We show that ESCRT-III acts to shed damaged membranes from the cell and that FTD-and ALS-associated mutations in CHMP2B and ANXA11 compromise the repair process. These data present an integrated ‘sealing and healing’ model of events allowing membrane repair and restoration of membrane integrity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Maintenance of plasma membrane and organellar integrity is essential for cellular viability, the maintenance of ionic gradients across membranes and the compartmentalisation of proteins and bioactive molecules. Membranes can be damaged physically by the forces imposed by cell and tissue mechanics, crystalline material or aggregates, including those associated with neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> such as amyloid-beta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, alpha synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and tau-fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and the activities of pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> or <italic>Mycobacterium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Membranes can be damaged chemically through reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and biochemically, through the actions of bacterially secreted Pore Forming Toxins (PFTs), cellular components of immune control such as Perforins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, Gasdermins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, Ninjurin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and the complement membrane attack complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, are also thought to damage cellular membranes. A variety of mechanisms to repair membrane damage have been proposed, including the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery, Annexins, delivery of lipids by membrane contact sites, vesicular or organellar fusion and the assembly of stress granules at sites of damaged membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Whether these activities represent truly independent membrane repair mechanisms or are integrated parts of a singular process is currently unclear. ESCRT-III is an ancient membrane remodeling complex with essential roles in several membrane shaping processes throughout the cell including endolysosomal sorting, exosome biogenesis, enveloped retrovirus release, cytokinetic abscission, nuclear envelope regeneration during mitotic exit and the repair of ruptured nuclear, plasma and lysosomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Mammalian cells express 11 different ESCRT-III subunits called Charged Multivesicular Body Proteins (CHMPs) and a related protein called IST1, that, alongside an AAA-ATPase called VPS4, act together to orchestrate the membrane remodeling process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. C-terminal truncating mutations in the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP2B (CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup> or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>) are rare causative factors of autosomal dominant Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. How these mutations lead to disease is currently unknown. Several other ESCRT-associated proteins have been implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a wider implication of ESCRT activity in neurological health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The calcium dependent phospholipid binding Annexin proteins have also been implicated in membrane repair at plasma, endosomal and nuclear membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Mutations in Annexin A11 (ANXA11) are associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, a disease with genetic, clinical and neuropathological overlap with FTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Given the involvement of lipid regulation in neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and recent suggestions that membrane damage is at the core of Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we wondered if these different FTD/ALS risk factors operated in a common pathway to provide protective functions that preserve cellular viability. We used advanced live cell imaging to examine CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup> and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup> in response to multiple forms of plasma membrane damage and describe previously unreported differences in their subcellular localisation that lead to temporal defects in their response. By imaging at high temporal resolution, we demonstrate sequential recruitment of Annexins and ESCRT-III to sites of membrane damage, with ESCRT-III arriving after membrane sealing has occurred. Further, we show that FTD-associated and ALS-associated mutations in <italic>CHMP2B</italic> and cause a phenotypically similar stalling of ESCRT-III at sites of membrane damage. These data provide an integrated ‘sealing and healing’ model for the repair of damaged cellular membranes to allow preservation of membrane integrity, and characterise a common mechanistic phenotype associated with separate FTD/ALS-associated mutations.</p><sec id="S2"><title>FTD-causing mutations in CHMP2B cause its nuclear retention</title><p id="P4">To interrogate the cellular biology of the FTD-causing C-truncating mutations of CHMP2B, we first generated CAL-51 cells stably expressing low levels of GFP-tagged versions of human CHMP2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used the linker from the C-terminal Localisation and Purification (LAP) tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, referred to as ‘L’, to preserve CHMP function. We were surprised to find that whilst CHMP2B-L-GFP was largely cytosolic, CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP were both retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). We confirmed these distributions using a C-terminal Hemagglutinin (HA) tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). Extending these observations, we found that the CHMP2B paralog, CHMP2A-L-GFP, displayed a predominantly nuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data show that the steady-state distribution of CHMP2A and CHMP2B between nucleus and cytoplasm is non-equivalent and that FTD-causing mutations in CHMP2B lead to its inappropriate nuclear retention.</p><p id="P5">Partitioning between nucleus and cytoplasm is governed by access to the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. We demonstrated that exportin inhibition with Leptomycin B (LMB) resulted in strong nuclear accumulation of CHMP2B-L-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>), but had limited effect on the nuclear retention of CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1C - S1E</xref>). As such, we conclude that C-truncating mutations in CHMP2B restrict its nuclear export. Type-1 Nuclear Export Sequences (NES) in Helix5 and Helix6 of CHMP7 are critical to its control of the timely regeneration of the nuclear envelope during mitotic exit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We noted two similar, but previously uncharacterised, Type-1 NESs in the C-terminus of CHMP2B that were truncated in CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup> and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). By individually inactivating these sequences, we found that whilst both NESs contributed transport activity, the C-terminal NES was stronger than the internal NES (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1F and S1G</xref>). This is consistent with a stronger nuclear retention of CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP relative to CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>) as it is missing both NESs. CHMP2A encodes a basic residue instead of a hydrophobic residue at position 221 and we hypothesised that this would inactivate its C-terminal NES, leading to its nuclear retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We mutated the equivalent residue (Val212) in CHMP2B and found that CHMP2B<sup>V212K</sup>-L-GFP was now retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1F and S1G</xref>). Finally, we fused the Helix6 NES from CHMP7 to the C-terminus of CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1H</xref>) and recovered cytoplasmic localization of these C-truncated versions of CHMP2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1F and S1G</xref>). These data identify NES sequences in CHMP2B’s C-terminal helices that act to position this protein in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P6">The LMB-sensitive nuclear export of CHMP2B-L-GFP and nuclear accumulation of CHMP2A-L-GFP, CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP suggested the presence of as-yet unidentified Nuclear Localisation Sequences (NLS) within these proteins. Using a previously described deletion series of YFP-CHMP2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we identified a cluster of basic residues in the N-terminus of CHMP2A Helix α2 that allowed nuclear import (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S2C - S2F</xref>). This arrangement of basic residues is conserved in CHMP2B, and in all other ESCRT-III subunits, (except CHMP1A and CHMP1B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S2G</xref>), in which a bi-partite NLS in Helix1 has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>). These data highlight a previously unreported difference in subcellular localization between CHMP2A and CHMP2B, explain mechanistically how this is achieved through different NES and NLS activities, and show that FTD-causing mutations in CHMP2B lead to its nuclear retention due to truncation of its NESs.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>C-truncating mutations in CHMP2B display a delayed and persistent recruitment to sites of membrane damage</title><p id="P7">We next asked whether the altered subcellular distribution of C-truncated FTD mutations of CHMP2B affected its ability to respond to plasma membrane damage. We imaged cells stably expressing CHMP2B-L-GFP live and used a multi-photon laser to ablate a 90 nm<sup>2</sup> region of the plasma membrane, illuminated with a transfected plasma membrane marker, PLCδ1<sup>PH</sup>-mCh. Confirming known roles of ESCRT-III in plasma membrane repair, we observed a transient assembly of CHMP2B-L-GFP at the site of damage, reaching a maximum 116 ± 12 seconds after the ablation, before gradually dissipating over the next 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S3A-S3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). At later stages, we were occasionally able to observe a transient relocation of CHMP2B-L-GFP to an extracellular protrusion and the externalization of plasma membrane at this site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S3B</xref>). Interestingly, when the site of ablation was placed at the edge of a filopodia, the dimensionality reduction in these structures allowed us to visualize a ‘wave’ of CHMP2B-L-GFP puncta that formed in the cytosol approximately 20 μm distal to the site of ablation. This wave travelled progressively toward the site of ablation over the next 100 seconds, culminating in the decoration of a patch of membrane which narrowed to a focus at the ablation site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>). Whilst prior data has implicated actin remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and lysosomal fusion with the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> in plasma membrane repair, we saw no evidence of lysosomes being trafficked to sites of membrane damage, and CHMP2B-L-GFP recruitment prevailed in the presence of actin cytoskeleton disruption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S4</xref>). As CHMPs are soluble cytosolic proteins, we infer direct assembly of ESCRT-III at sites of plasma membrane damage. We next examined recruitment of CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP in response to localized plasma membrane damage. Consistent with a limited cytosolic pool of these proteins, both accumulated more slowly at the site of damage, reaching a maximum after 645 ± 52 and 786 ± 107 seconds respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie S4</xref>). Whilst recruitment of CHMP2B-L-GFP was transient, recruitment of CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP and CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP was persistent, suggesting that turnover of ESCRT-III at sites of membrane damage was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). These C-truncating mutations in CHMP2B also remove the MIT-domain Interaction Motif (MIM) present in CHMP2B’s C-terminus that allows engagement of the ESCRT-associated AAA-ATPase, VPS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). As VPS4 allows turnover and disassembly of ESCRT-III we wondered whether a failure to bind VPS4 was responsible for the persistence of the C-truncated versions of CHMP2B at sites of membrane damage. Using a stable cell line expressing a chimaera of CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup> and the Helix6 NES from CHMP7 (CHMP2B<sup>INT5+C7α6</sup>-L-GFP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S1I</xref>) we confirmed that returning this protein to the cytosol restored its timely assembly at sites of plasma membrane damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie S5</xref>). Importantly, the NES in CHMP7 Helix6 does not contain a MIM due to charge inversion at a critical arginine residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Consistent with a role for VPS4 in turning over ESCRT-III, CHMP2B<sup>INT5+C7α6</sup>-L-GFP was not disassembled after recruitment to sites of membrane damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S5</xref>). These data separate NES and MIM activities in CHMP2B’s C-terminus, with the NES allowing cytoplasmic access for timely recruitment and the MIM allowing CHMP2B turnover once it has assembled at sites of membrane damage.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ESCRT-III recruitment is temporally disconnected from membrane sealing</title><p id="P8">Local Propidium Iodide (PI) influx can be used as a reporter of plasma membrane integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We recorded multi-channel live cell imaging data at high time resolution and combined this with multi-photon laser ablation. Laser ablation at the plasma membrane resulted in a burst of PI influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Movie S6</xref>). As PI entry was transient, rather than progressive, the plasma membrane appears to be almost immediately sealed upon damage. Strikingly, CHMP2B-L-GFP was recruited to sites of damage only after PI influx had abated, suggesting that ESCRT-III recruitment is disconnected from the act of membrane sealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We next examined PI influx in cells expressing CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP. Consistent with ESCRT-III recruitment occurring after membrane sealing, the kinetics of PI influx in these cells was indistinguishable from WT cells, despite CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP localizing to sites of damage substantially later than CHMP2B-L-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data indicate that membrane sealing, and ESCRT-III recruitment are temporally disconnected and suggest that ESCRT-III-independent factors are responsible for the initial seal of damaged membranes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Annexin proteins are recruited immediately to sites of plasma membrane damage in advance of ESCRT-III</title><p id="P9">As CHMP2B was recruited to sites of plasma membrane damage after membranes had been sealed, we next looked upstream at potential recruitment factors for ESCRT-III. Human cells express a total of 11 Annexin proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S6A</xref>) that bind both calcium and phospholipid membranes. ANXA7 and ANXA11 are unique in that they share an extended N-terminal low-complexity domain (LCD) that binds the ESCRT-associated factor, Apoptosis-linked gene-2 (ALG-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and participates in liquid-liquid phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. To investigate coordination between ESCRT-III and these factors, we generated stable cell lines expressing both CHMP2B-L-GFP and mCherry (mCh) tagged versions of these proteins. Building on the discovery that ALG-2 and ANXA7 were recruited immediately to sites of plasma membrane damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, we used multi-photon laser ablation of the plasma membrane, to confirm that ALG-2 was enriched progressively at the point of damage, peaking just before CHMP2B-L-GFP and forming projections that protruded out of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Movie S7</xref>). Like ANXA7-mCh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Movie S8</xref>), we found that ANXA11-mCh, was recruited immediately (ANXA11-mCh; 5.9 ± 0.5 seconds) to sites of damage, first decorating a broad area of the plasma membrane and rapidly becoming focused to a point at the site of ablation that projected out of the cell (ANXA11-mCh; 9.5 ± 2.9 seconds after ablation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Movie S9</xref>). CHMP2B-L-GFP was recruited some 40 seconds later (45.3 ± 3.1 seconds after ablation), initially covering a broad area of the plasma membrane surrounding the Annexin focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>) with its intensity peaking 82 ± 8.3 seconds after ablation. Importantly, ANXA11-mCh recruitment was temporally coordinated with the block in local PI influx, suggesting that Annexin recruitment plays a role in the sealing of damaged membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ALS-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair its recruitment to sites of membrane damage</title><p id="P10">Pathogenic mutations in ANXA11 (including G38R, R235Q, R346C and R456H), are associated with ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, a neurodegenerative disease found on a continuum with FTD. The P93S mutation was recently found to be a pathogenic variant in corticobasal syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. To test whether mutations in ANXA11 impacted its ability to respond to membrane damage, we examined recruitment of WT, several pathogenic mutants and a LCD-deletion of ANXA11-mCh to laser-ablated lesions of the plasma membrane. ANXA11-mCh, ANXA11<sup>G38R</sup>-mCh, ANXA11<sup>P93S</sup>-mCh and ANXA11<sup>R346C</sup>-mCh were recruited immediately to the site of damage and concentrated rapidly at a focus that protruded from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD31">Figure S6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Movie S10</xref> – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Movie S13</xref>).

To confirm the release of PfO and Annexin-positive membranes biochemically, we treated cells with a sub-lytic pulse of PfO for 5 minutes, washed the monolayer extensively, chased the cells into fresh media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>) and collected material released from cells by filtration and ultracentrifugation. We found that PfO could be recovered from the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>) and found that recovery of pelletable ANXA7, ANXA11, ALIX and ALG-2 was elevated in the media of cells treated with PfO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).

We investigated the robustness of this seal by treating cells with a 5-minute pulse of PfO and probing plasma membrane integrity by adding PI at sequential times after removal of PfO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). At 30 minutes after PfO addition, CHMP2B-L-GFP, CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP cells were all equally susceptible to PI challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Allowing a chase of 120-minutes before challenging with external PI revealed that cells expressing CHMP2B-L-GFP were no longer permeable to PI. However, at this time point, cells expressing CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP were still able to allow PI entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that the plasma membrane integrity of these cells was still impacted by PfO. Cells expressing CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP were also able to let more PI in over this period of chase, leading to significant nuclear accumulation of the dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). We next wondered if the persistent loss of membrane integrity in cells expressing CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP led to cytotoxicity. We exposed cells to differing concentrations of PfO and followed cell death by live Incucyte microscopy.

These data suggest that whilst cells mount an acute response to membrane damage by mobilising Annexin proteins, this initial seal is not robust and requires ESCRT-III activity to normalise and heal these membranes through a process of shedding. Moreover, these data show that cells bearing pathogenic mutations of CHMP2B are less able to maintain membrane integrity and more susceptible to cell death upon plasma membrane damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Here, we have used live cell imaging to illuminate how Annexin and ESCRT-III proteins work together in the cellular response to plasma membrane damage. We have uncovered nuanced stages in the repair process; an acute seal that limits loss of cellular material, and a subsequent shedding process that restores the membrane. Several machineries have been proposed to orchestrate the repair of damaged membranes, although it is unclear whether these represent independent mechanisms of membrane repair, or whether each machinery represents a single facet of a multi-stage process. Here, using independent forms of plasma membrane damage, we show that arrival of the calcium-binding ANXA7 or ANXA11 proteins at sites of damage occurs concurrently with the initial sealing of the plasma membrane. One possibility is that the accumulation of Annexin proteins at these sites, in a LCD-dependent manner, acts as an acute plug to restrict cytolysis and facilitate subsequent ESCRT-III-dependent repair. Interestingly, this could have parallels with the condensation of stress granules that act to seal damaged endolysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the phase separation of LEM2’s LCD that acts to seal holes in the nuclear envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, the ESCRT-III-independent diffusion barriers that maintain nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization prior to ESCRT-III activity during <italic>S. pombe</italic> spindle pole body extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> and the finding that biomolecular condensates can contribute to the membrane bending necessary for intra-endosomal vesicle formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. We found that ESCRT-III proteins were only recruited to sites of damage after Annexin recruitment, and after permeability to PI had been restricted, indicating that ESCRT-III recruitment occurs after membranes have been sealed. Consistent with this, in a recent cryo-electron tomography study of perforin-mediated cytolysis cellular membranes appear intact at the point of ESCRT-III recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Overexpressed CHMP2B has been shown previously to assemble at plasma membrane protrusions in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> and to the base of membrane necks pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles, where it acted as a diffusion barrier to restrict lipid flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. We speculate that this activity might isolate damaged membrane lipids and the Annexin plug for subsequent ESCRT-III-dependent shedding. Prior data has observed membrane protrusions at sites of laser ablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and shown that pore forming toxins could be collected from the media of treated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Whilst ESCRT-III proteins have been reported to localise to the plasma membrane of cells damaged by MLKL or GasderminD pores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, the process of shedding these membranes at this site has only been inferred. Here, we show that ANXA7 and ANXA11 proteins are involved in the coordination of these processes by condensing rapidly into protrusions at sites of membrane damage that were removed from the cell after ESCRT-III recruitment.</p><p id="P17">These data highlight topological parallels in the shedding of Annexin-containing membranes with the release of enveloped retroviruses, during which the act of ESCRT-III-dependent budding leaves a scarless plasma membrane. Additionally, the dynamic relocalisation of CHMP2B from a broad initial recruitment to a focus at the neck of an ANXA7- or ANXA11-positive protrusion parallels the relocalisation of ESCRT-III during cytokinetic abscission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, suggesting that the behaviour of ESCRT-III is conserved between these processes. Whilst Annexin and ESCRT-III proteins clearly work together, recruitment of CHMP2B was independent of ANXA11, suggesting that independent localisation cues act to mobilise these proteins. However, mimicking the phenotype of C-truncated versions of CHMP2B, in the absence of ANXA11 recruitment, CHMP2B accumulated under the site of damage, rather than condensing transiently to the neck of an ANXA11-positive protrusion. These data suggest that condensation of ANXA11 may help shape the membrane into a neck for subsequent ESCRT-III dependent severing. Our data suggests a segregation of sequential ‘sealing’ and ‘healing’ activities between Annexin and ESCRT-III proteins during membrane repair.</p><p id="P18">These defects in membrane repair were uncovered through the analysis of FTD- and ALS-causing mutations in the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP2B and ANXA11. Whilst the C-truncated pathogenic versions of CHMP2B have been well characterized in terms of an endolysosomal phenotype, reflective of impaired ability to recruit VPS4 through C-terminal MIMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, we note here relative differences in their subcellular localization. Similar differences in the subcellular localisation of CHMP2A and CHMP2B were observed, with CHMP2A predominantly localised to the nucleus and CHMP2B to the cytoplasm. These data suggest that functional segregation across the Vps2 paralogs may have been enabled by gene duplication within ESCRT-III. We identify functional NESs that drive CHMP2B’s cytoplasmic localization and show that they are lost in the C-truncated FTD-associated versions of this protein. As such, as well as plasma membrane repair, we hypothesise that the kinetics of a range of cytosolic ESCRT-III activities such as endolysosomal repair and multivesicular body biogenesis are likely compromised by these pathogenic mutants of CHMP2B. Increasing evidence presents FTD/ALS as a spectrum of disease, inclusive of a wide range of genetic risk factors. Thus far, there is no consensus as to an underlying mechanism supporting this relationship. Here, we have demonstrated that two FTD/ALS associated proteins act sequentially in the same process of plasma membrane repair. Moreover, pathogenic mutations in both CHMP2B and ANXA11 converge on a common phenotype of impaired ESCRT-III turnover at sites of membrane repair, suggesting membrane damage as a potential disease mechanism in FTD/ALS.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P19">STR-profiled, mycoplasma-free vials of GP2-293 (CVCL_WI48), Phoenix-AMPHO (CVCL_H716) and CAL-51 (CVCL_1110) cells were obtained from the Crick Cell Services Science Technology Platform.

Mean intensity values were measured in these ROIs for each frame. Corresponding background values were measured similarly and used for frame-wise background correction by subtraction. For PI measurements, a region of interest was drawn around the local area of influx at T = 0 and integrated density was applied and measured across all frames. Movies with significant drift, retraction of cells after membrane damage, or death were discarded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Incucyte Microscopy</title><p id="P28">CAL-51 cells stably expressing CHMP2B-L-GFP, CHMP2B<sup>INT5</sup>-L-GFP or CHMP2B<sup>Q165X</sup>-L-GFP were seeded in Phenoplate glass bottomed 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer). PfO (1 nM) was diluted in complete imaging media and imaged using a Sartorius Incucyte SX5 at 37 °C and 5% CO2, capturing 9 images per well every 30 minutes. Sartorius Incucyte Analysis software was used to calculate the average confluency in each well normalised to T = 0 and acquired in triplicate for each independent experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Collection of released material by ultracentrifugation</title><p id="P29">CAL-51 cells stably expressing the indicated proteins were grown in two 15 cm dishes per condition in complete DMEM. When confluent, cells were washed thrice with PBS and then into DMEM containing 1% FBS. PfO was added at a final concentration of 0.3 nM in warmed DMEM containing 1% FBS for 10 minutes. PfO-containing media was removed, the monolayer was washed thrice with PBS, taking care to remove all residual PBS, and cells were incubated with 18 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS. Cells were left at 37 °C for 6 hours to allow PfO-containing membranes to be released. The media was collected and subject to low-speed centrifugation (300 x g, 5 minutes) to pellet any insoluble material, and was filtered through a 5 μm PluriStrainer. 36 mL of media per condition was subject to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 6 hours at 4 °C in a SW-32-Ti swinging bucket rotor (Beckman). The media was decanted and 500 μL PBS was added to the pellet and left to resuspend overnight at 4 °C. The next morning, the pellet was resuspended and re-centrifuged at 100,000 x g in low-bind 1.5 mL ultracentrifuge tubes using a TLA55 fixed angle rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in 50 μL of PBS and denatured through the addition of 50 μL 2 x LDS sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P30">Two-tailed Student’s T-tests, or ordinary one-way ANOVA with the indicated post-hoc tests, were used to assess significance between test samples and controls or significance in response over time, as stated in figure legends.
