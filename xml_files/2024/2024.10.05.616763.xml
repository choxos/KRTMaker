Here, we ask whether drug resistance and invasiveness coevolve to drive metastasis. Selection experiments involving pulsed carboplatin exposure established isogenic chemoresistant variants of lines, which typify high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most aggressive type of EOC. Time-lapse imaging showed enhanced migration of resistant single cells and their collectives. Resistant cell spheroids spread faster on Collagen I substrata than sensitive controls. The resistant OVCAR-3 transcriptome was ontologically enriched for migration and showed overlap with previously reported markers of resistance in EOC patients and other evolved lines. Gene set enrichment predicted transition between epithelial, mesenchymal, and amoeboid states is higher in resistance compared to control lines. Lower matrix adhesion, weak focal adhesion, and highly deformable and translatory dynamics of cell collectives indicated that resistant cancer cells displayed a unique collective amoeboid-like migration. When injected intraperitoneally into immunodeficient mice, resistant cells colonized to a greater extent on parietal mucosae. Ex vivo, suspended resistant cells formed moruloids associated with quicker peritoneal adhesion, clearing human coelomic mesothelial monolayers with higher efficiency. Knockdown in resistant OVCAR-3 cells of two upregulated proteins, E-cadherin and LGALS3BP, had distinct consequences. E-cadherin knockdown partially restored sensitivity to carboplatin but did not affect invasion. In contrast, silencing LGALS3BP decreased invasion but not resistance. Our results suggest that drug resistance and invasiveness could coevolve through the upregulation of distinct trait drivers in EOC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Despite impressive strides made in understanding the mechanisms behind the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the mortality rate associated with the disease remains alarmingly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Coleman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Siegel et al., 2021</xref>). Upon diagnosis, ovarian cancer is managed through a combination of surgical cytoreduction and treatments with chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ortiz et al., 2022</xref>) and, in some cases, personalized medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Morand et al., 2021</xref>). Patients afflicted with EOC, especially its aggressive variant known as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), initially respond well to a combination of platinum and taxane drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lheureux et al., 2019</xref>). However, most who do show a good response eventually relapse and develop a chemoresistant form of the disease, which contributes to high patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Guo et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Several studies have sought to address how resistance evolves in ovarian tumor populations. Platinum-based chemo drugs induce apoptosis by adducing themselves to purine bases of DNA and triggering their damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Eastman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Rabik &amp; Dolan, 2007</xref>). Therefore, cells become resistant by efficiently mediating drug efflux or improving their ability to repair nucleic acid damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cornelison et al., 2017</xref>). Repeated rounds of drug exposure in tumor cell populations increase the frequency of resistant variants that possess unique genomic alterations and distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profiles relative to their sensitive counterparts. A recent elegant study on paraffin-embedded tissue sections from HGSOC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy revealed transcriptional upregulation of the AP-1 transcription factor family genes and copy number amplification of a chromosomal segment that subsumes the SIK2; in combination with platinum-based therapy, inhibition of both synergistically decrease resistant cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Javellana et al., 2022</xref>). Such transcriptome-wide alterations also result in modifications in other phenotypic traits that sculpt cancer progression. For example, overexpression of miR-296-3p has been shown to significantly enhance the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells in vitro, showing a greater degree of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Sun et al., 2024</xref>). Transcriptomic changes associated with drug resistance may also result in altered matrisomal dynamics that can, in turn, modify the interaction of cancer cells with their tissue microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Salemme et al., 2023</xref>). A recent study uncovers the upregulation in resistant cells of the extracellular matrix protein Periostin, which contributes to recurrence in EOC cells by enhancing stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Huang et al., 2023</xref>). Acquisition of drug resistance is also often correlated with morphological-molecular changes that signify a transition from the epithelial state into a more mesenchymal one (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kajiyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rohnalter et al., 2015</xref>). The link between EMT and the evolution of drug resistance has been proposed to be established by nodal proteins such as those belonging to the Snail family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kielbik et al., 2023</xref>). Mediators of EMT represent novel druggable targets in chemo-refractory cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Tangsiri et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Apart from the epithelial and mesenchymal states, recent studies suggest the transitioning of mesenchymal cells to an amoeboid state as an adaptive measure to bypass microenvironmental stress, which may also include the induction of drug resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Emad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ketchen et al., 2021</xref>). Amoeboid migration, typically characterized for immune cells and dictyostelid amoebae, achieves motility without relying on strong substrate adhesion, as is seen for mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barry &amp; Bretscher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">George et al., 2023</xref>). As a result, amoeboid migration, which is characterized by short-lived actomyosin-rich pseudopodia, is faster than mesenchymal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>) and has been proposed to contribute to metastatic kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Crosas-Molist et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Driscoll et al., 2024</xref>). These studies notwithstanding, formal analyses of whether and how phenotypic traits tend to co-evolve with drug resistance, and if such coevolution has consequences on HGSOC progression in a drug-agnostic context are few and far between.</p><p id="P5">In the current study, we develop an experimental model of platinum chemoresistance by exposing the HGSOC lines OVCAR-3 and COV362 to periodic pulses of the drug carboplatin. Having ascertained the evolution of resistance, we rigorously probe its migratory potential and show how the resistance is associated not just with enhanced single-cell motility but also collective migration. RNA sequencing followed by ontological analysis surprisingly suggests the evolution of a complex hybrid state that possesses signatures of epithelial, mesenchymal, and amoeboid state, which is consistent with their collective cellular behavior, low ECM adhesion, upregulation of metastasis-related extracellular matrix genes, and in vivo peritoneal colonization morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Carboplatin-resistant cells migrate faster than sensitive controls</title><p id="P6">Carboplatin-resistant variants of the HGSOC lines OVCAR-3 and COV362 were developed by repeated exposure to 10-15 cycles of IC<sub>50</sub> dose of carboplatin (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and the methods subsection titled “establishing resistant cell lines”), after which their metabolic viability was assessed using resazurin assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To assess whether the differences in values within resazurin-based assays were due to effects on cell viability or metabolic activity, OVCAR-3 and resOVCAR-3 were treated for 72 h with 30 μM carboplatin and their numbers calculated using hemocytometry: resOVCAR3 cells showed a 4.3-fold higher cell number indicating greater cell viability in the presence of carboplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; p &lt; 0.01 significance established using unpaired student’s t-test).</p><p id="P7">Drug-resistant cancers are usually aggressive in their progression with increased incidence of metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Norouzi et al., 2018</xref>).

RNA sequencing was performed with three independent passages of control and resOVCAR-3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref> shows the principal component analysis showing the proximity of overall cell states of the replicates). Differential gene expression analysis between the resistant and sensitive cell lines showed that 1457 genes were upregulated, while 1376 genes were downregulated in resistant compared to sensitive cells, with |log-fold change| &gt; 1 and FDR (q-value) &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Gene ontological analysis for the significantly up- and down-regulated expressions of genes for biological functions predicted mRNA alterations associated with cell motility and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> top). This was further confirmed through gene set enrichment based on the KEGG pathways, which, in addition to altered motility and cell-ECM interaction, implicated an altered regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> bottom). Transduction through this signaling pathway (through a cognate signature set) has been shown to be associated with poor survival, harsher progression, and poorer response to therapy in patients with serous ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Carvalho et al., 2022</xref>). We used patient-derived gene signatures for poor prognosis, which comprised 20 genes, to assay if the transcriptome of resOVCAR-3 recapitulates the transcriptome of the patients: of the 20 genes (related to the PI3K pathways), 12 (COL1A1, LAMA5, LAMC1, ITGB1, COL4A2, EFNA1, EPHA2, LAMC2, ITGA6, ITGA3, ITGB4, FN1) showed an upregulation in our resistant cell line, and one gene, IGF1, was not available in our RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; refer to Table S1 for log2fold change and p values).</p><p id="P10">We also examined the expression of a second curated set of 10 genes chosen based on their dysregulation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ortiz et al., 2022</xref>). This set included the genes involved in influx (CTR1) and efflux (ATP7B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kalayda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mangala et al., 2009</xref>) of carboplatin. CTR1 did not appear in our sequencing analysis. The efflux transporter gene ATP7B was upregulated in resOVCAR-3 cells, consistent with previous literature on its expression in drugresistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The gene set also included DNA mismatch repair genes, which are generally mutated/silenced in EOC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Milanesio et al., 2020</xref>; Ovejero-Sánchez et al., 2023). As expected, we found a corresponding downregulation of MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, in resOVCAR-3 cell line replicates. Additionally, Zhao and co-workers have shown that high levels of expression for these genes are associated with favorable prognosis post-platinum therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). resOVCAR3 cells also showed an upregulation for the nucleotide excision repair protein coding gene ERCC1, which is known to be elevated in cisplatin-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Du et al., 2016</xref>). We further added another pair of genes - USP14 and BCL6- to the gene set based on previous reports, which showed their elevation with platinum resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">J. Shen et al., 2020</xref>). Our expression analysis of resOVCAR3 cells showed an upregulation in the case of USP14 but a downregulation in BCL6. Similarly, the misexpression of two other genes in the gene set, the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) and the extracellular matrix protein Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), is recapitulated by the resOVCAR-3 (refer to Table S2 for log2fold change and p values). However, the expression for PGC1/PPARGC1A was lower in resOVCAR-3 cells, unlike what has been observed in the cisplatin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">L. Shen et al., 2021</xref>); this could be due to minor differences in metabolic responses of cells to carboplatin and cisplatin.</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, we obtained expression signatures from cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer line (ACRP) from MsigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>), which showed similar trends with the resOVCAR-3 transcriptome, particularly for the downregulated set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Ei and ii</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Drug-resistant cells show stronger signatures of migration</title><p id="P12">Our observations of the migratory behaviors of resOVCAR-3 cells combined with results from gene ontology analyses motivated us to examine the possibility of the transition of resistant cells to a more mesenchymal expression state. This is in consonance with a strong association in ovarian and other cancers of resistance evolution with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Debaugnies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kralj et al., 2023</xref>). We performed single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) on the control OVCAR-3 and resOVCAR-3 transcriptomes and observed higher scores for both epithelial and mesenchymal marker signatures in resOVCAR-3 cells, which suggested that drug resistance may be associated with the acquisition of a hybrid phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>; p = 0.002 and 0.06; significance established using unpaired student’s t-test). A hybrid or partial EMT state is intermediate within the spectrum characterized by the expression of both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, resulting in phenotypic characteristics more aggressive than the complete transited mesenchymal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kisoda et al., 2022</xref>). The existence of resOVCAR-3 cells in a hybrid EMT state was further indicated by the high partial EMT score obtained using ssGSEA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, p = 0.002; significance established by unpaired student’s t-test). Results from the bioinformatics analyses were further confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR, wherein mRNA levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1) and the mesenchymal marker fibronectin-1 (FN1) were found to be 2.5-fold and 2.8-fold higher in resOVCAR-3 cells compared with control OVCAR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>; p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.01 respectively; significance established using unpaired student’s t-test). CDH1 and FN1 protein levels were also found to be upregulated immunocytochemically in resOVCAR-3 compared to OVCAR-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>; green: secondary antibody, red: F-actin using phalloidin and white: DNA using DAPI; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6, S7</xref> for no primary antibody control).</p><p id="P13">Motility in partially and fully transited mesenchymal cells is mediated through high adhesion of cellular protrusion to underlying extracellular matrix substrata. Therefore, adhesion to Collagen I substrata was compared between suspended OVCAR-3 and resOVCAR-3 cells: in the same time interval, a lesser number of the latter adhered compared to sensitive control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, epifluorescent micrographs of OVCAR-3 (left) and resOVCAR-3 (right) cells stained with PI for DNA (white against black background); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, 1.9-fold difference in mean cell number per field; p = 0.001 with significance calculated using an unpaired student’s t-test). We hypothesized that the resistant cells may employ an amoeboid state, wherein cells achieve higher velocities by eschewing strong cell-ECM adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Graziani et al., 2022</xref>). Cancer cells are known to transit from mesenchymal to amoeboid modes (MAT) partially or completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">B.

To understand if there is a significant shift in the population of cells exhibiting amoeboid signatures, ssGSEA analysis was performed on transcriptomes of OVCAR-3 and resOVCAR-3 cells. Although statistically insignificant, our results indicate increased MAT signatures in resOVCAR-3 cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). However, further ssGSEA analysis to study the expression profile of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal-amoeboid transitions (EMAT) yielded a significant upregulation of these markers in the res-OVCAR3 cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>; p = 0.01 with significance calculated using an unpaired student’s t-test).</p><p id="P14">To examine these dynamics further, we performed time-lapse fluorescence imaging on GFP/RFP expressing OVCAR-3 and resOVCAR-3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Video S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S6</xref>). To our surprise, small multicellular patches of resOVCAR-3 cells acted like giant amoebae by constantly altering their shape, sending out protrusions, and even translating en masse. In contrast, control OVCAR-3 patches grew centrifugally through cell division without net translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, epifluorescence micrographs captured over specific time intervals showing migratory behaviors of a patch of fluorescently labeled OVCAR-3 (top) and resOVCAR-3 (bottom) cells cultured in normal 2D conditions).</p><p id="P15">Similar collective migratory properties of the resOVCAR-3 cells compared to control OVCAR-3 cells were also observed when 24-hr spheroids were allowed to adhere and grow on top of 1 mg/mL Collagen I scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, bright field photomicrographs captured over specific time intervals showing adhesion and collective migratory properties of OVCAR-3 (top) and resOVCAR-3 (bottom) clusters on Collagen-I, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">videos S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S4</xref>: time-lapse videos of the same). Compared to the relatively sedate sensitive OVCAR-3 spheroids, resOVCAR-3 spheroids showed rapid en masse motility, throwing mesoscale multicellular projections and retractions.

Here we examined the roles of CDH1 and LGALS3BP genes in developing chemo-resistance and the associated migratory properties. CDH1 is a strong epithelial marker that contributes to the epithelial properties of OVCAR-3 cells. Our results described above showed although resistant cells depart from an epithelial state to mesenchymal or amoeboid states to aid in migration, the expression of CDH1 remains higher compared to OVCAR-3 in resOVCAR-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). LGALS3BP is a secreted protein associated with cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Capone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Iacobelli et al., 1994</xref>) and ishighly expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Qu et al., 2016</xref>), and early reports suggest that monitoring the serum levels of CA125 and LGALS3BP can be used to better detect ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Scambia et al., 1988</xref>).

Although resistance is clinically assessed through a threshold of recurrence before the six-month mark after the last dose of platinum therapy, even patients who relapse beyond the threshold eventually show poor response to platinum drugs, leading to diminishing progression-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Moore et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we chose to look at chemoresistance as one of a set of canonical histopathological tumor traits that combinedly evolve in response to selective pressures of platinum exposure. We demonstrate that such coevolution results in a more invasive phenotype, which would be responsible for the aggression of chemoresistant EOC.</p><p id="P20">A rigorous examination of the invasiveness of resistant cells in this study suggests unique morphogenetic dynamics. Given that OVCAR-3 cells are epithelioid cells with a capacity to form adherent patches, it was intriguing that the resistant cells showed even higher levels of both E-cadherin and Fibronectin. However, this is consonant with the non-monotonic variation of functional properties from epithelial to mesenchymal states; for instance, hybrid E/M cells have been reported to be the most plastic, stem-like, and metastatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Grosse-Wilde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hari et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Pastushenko et al., 2018</xref>). Gene enrichment prediction of the bulk RNA sequencing of the carboplatin-resistant cells also pointed to the transition between these phenotypes, which is now documented in the evolution of chemoresistance across cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Debaugnies et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lüönd et al., 2021</xref>). However, their poor adhesion to ECM and relatively fainter basal stress fiber staining indicated the transition further extends toward an amoeboid-like state. The novelty of such a collective transitory state was evidenced by the deformable translational dynamics within smaller adherent clusters of drug-resistant cells, which also show evidence of supracellular F-actin organization at the cortex of the clusters. In contrast, within clusters of sensitive ovarian cancer cells, F-actin is localized subcellularly to cell cortices. These observations suggest that clusters of resistant cells are organized like a single giant cell that jiggles and moves en masse. Such behavior has been observed for cell clusters in non-adhesive environments and has been referred to as collective amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Pagès et al., 2022</xref>). We observe the collective amoeboid migration within suspended spheroids of resistant cancer cells, which showed mesoscale-level pseudopod-like extensions and retractions while translating across polymerized fibrillar Collagen I surfaces.</p><p id="P21">Collective low-adhesion translation of multicellular clusters has been elegantly studied by Beaune and coworkers, who used a combination of particle imaging velocimetry and traction force microscopic measurements to delineate how such clusters translate on low stiffness substrate but dismantle and spread on rigid surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beaune et al., 2018</xref>). The velocity of such clusters is driven by the difference in spreading parameters at the receding and moving edge of the clusters, which in turn depends on the traction exerted by these clusters on the surface, leading to an irreversible modification of the surface at the rear end. However, in their time lapses, they do not capture the formation of pseudopodia-like projections, nor drastic deformation in cluster shape of the nature we observe: this sheds light on the cell-contextual nature of collective behavior. The movement of our clusters may be driven by asymmetricity in both intercell adhesion strengths due to increased E-cadherin levels and cohesiveness due to fibronectin. We look forward to testing this hypothesis in future studies using traction force microscopic measurements in spheroids from cells expressing live fibronectin and E-cadherin reporters.</p><p id="P22">Cells can deploy amoeboid migration to move faster than when they are mesenchymal. Such features help the cell to adapt and migrate through narrow spaces in the ECM or even exert a force sufficient to deform the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Driscoll et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">McGrail et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Śliwa et al., 2024</xref>).

In ovarian cancer, the overexpression of Rho/Rock kinases increases cancer cell dissemination and increases their resistance to cisplatin, alluding to the potential of kinase-specific inhibitors as having therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Horiuchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ohta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Śliwa et al., 2024</xref>). In fact, melanoma cells that are resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors show higher levels of myosin II, which is associated with the amoeboid migratory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Orgaz et al., 2020</xref>). The actomyosin-driven deformability allows such cells to metastasize faster. This is consistent with our observation that resistant cells colonize and spread further on peritoneal surfaces. Moreover, amoeboid cells express markers that strongly overlap with those typical of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions, such as RHO-ROCK signaling and TGF-β-SMAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cantelli et al., 2015</xref>). The increase in mesenchymal marker fibronectin in our resistant cells and the co-existence of lower cell-substrate adhesion with higher gene enrichment-based scores for EMT and EMAT is consistent with the amoeboid state being related to the epithelial-mesenchymal spectrum. Even so, we propose that the resistant cell migratory dynamics represent a unique transitory state due to its upregulation of E-cadherin (downregulated in classical amoeboid and mesenchymal cells), contributing to its collective nature.</p><p id="P23">A careful study of the transitory dynamics will be the focus of subsequent investigations. Resistant cell populations may represent heterogeneous mixtures of co-existent cell populations with distinct cell states. On the other hand, we cannot rule out plasticity among different cell-states where the transition rates may depend on cell confluence, local rheological heterogeneity, and other ecological interactions among diverse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gasior et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jain et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2019</xref>). We aim to interrogate these questions using live expression markers of cell states as well as undertake single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed immunocytochemistry to dissect subpopulation level behaviors. The factors governing the rates of these cell-state transitions would help us better understand and eventually control co-evolution trajectories in a heterogeneous population subjected to therapeutic stress.</p><p id="P24">The temporal scale over which the divergence in the phenotype of the resistant from sensitive cancer cells took place was several weeks: it is, therefore, conceivable that distinct molecular mechanisms drove resistance to the selective pressures of carboplatin exposure, and other traits may have evolved subsequently through consequential ‘passenger’ changes. This led us to investigate the effects of E-Cadherin, and a known marker of mesenchymal state associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer LGALS3BP, on the traits of drug resistance and invasion. The association of E-Cadherin depletion with loss of drug resistance indicates it plays an early and causal role in the acquisition of resistance to carboplatin. In contrast, the association of LGALS3BP levels with invasion but not carboplatin resistance suggests its elevation during resistance evolution may be temporally distal to the elevation in levels of E-cadherin. Future studies will probe the correlations or lack thereof in the temporal evolution of individual traits and their molecular mediators.</p><p id="P25">Finally, the observations reported in this study are based on selection experiments on HGSOC-mimicking lines under cultivation as monolayers. While the results from the system are strongly resonant at the cellular and molecular level with existing literature, a better understanding of the chemoresistance mechanisms can be gained by developing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of chemo-sensitive and chemoresistant tumors. The validation of such novel migratory dynamics within tumor microenvironment-incorporating experimental models should result in the identification of unique therapeutic targets for the refractory form of cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P26">The human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 was a kind gift from Professor Rajan R.

PyDESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Muzellec et al., 2023</xref>) was used for differential gene expression. A cut-off of Log2FC≥ 1 and fdr cut-off of 0.05 was used for selecting 1457 upregulated genes, and Log2FC≤ -1 and fdr cut-off of 0.05 was used for selecting 1376 downregulated genes.

The genes are ranked based on the transcript per million (TPM) levels, and the enrichment scores are calculated as the area between the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of the genes in the geneset and the background genes. The normalized enrichment scores were used for further analysis. The signature for epithelial, mesenchymal, partial-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT), and epithelial-mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (EMAT) signatures were obtained from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Emad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Puram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Tan et al., 2014</xref>).
