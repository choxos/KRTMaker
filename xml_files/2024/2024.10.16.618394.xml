Although many PAK substrates identified are implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a coherent picture of the total effect of PAK activation on the state of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. We therefore set out to observe and quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on the actin cytoskeleton in greater detail. In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts, inhibition of PAK kinase activity, either by treatment with small molecule inhibitors or overexpression of mutant PAK constructs leads to the constitutive production of patches of the phosphoinositide PIP3 on the ventral surface of the cell. The formation of these patches remodels the actin cytoskeleton and polarises the cell. From the overexpression of truncated and mutant PAK constructs as well as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of PAK recruitment to small GTPases we propose that this is due to a hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners in the absence of PAK kinase activity. This aberrant production of PIP3 suggests that, by limiting its own recruitment, the kinase activity of class I PAKs acts to downregulate PI3K activity, further highlighting class I PAKs as regulators of PI3K activity and therefore the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The p21 Activated Kinases (PAKs) are a family of 6 serine/threonine kinases identified as acting downstream of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Edward Manser et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">1995</xref>). The 6 family members are divided by sequence homology into two subclasses, class I (PAK 1,2,3) and class II (PAK 4,5,6) PAKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arias-romero and Chernoff 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kumar et al. 2017</xref>).

For class I PAKs this has been thought to be due to an intermolecular interaction that results in the formation of a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lei et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baskaran et al. 2012</xref>). However recent evidence suggests that it may in fact be intramolecular, as is the case for class II PAKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sorrell and Kilian 2019</xref>). Regardless of the exact nature of the interaction, this autoinhibition is relieved by GTPase binding to the PBD domain.</p><p id="P4">Unsurprisingly for a kinase acting downstream of Rac/Cdc42, many PAK substrates are directly linked to the regulation of the cytoskeleton including LIM Kinase (LIMK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Edwards et al. 1999</xref>), filamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Vadlamudi et al. 2003</xref>), MLC Kinase (MLCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sanders et al. 1999</xref>) and a component of the Arp2/3 complex, ArpC1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Vadlamudi et al. 2004</xref>). Additionally, several kinase independent roles for class I PAKs in the regulation of the cytoskeleton have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Higuchi et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Davidson et al. 2021</xref>) and the transient overexpression of wt or mutant PAK constructs as well as the inhibition of PAK by small molecule inhibitors have all been shown to have dramatic consequences for the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sells et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mary Ann Sells, Boyd, and Chernoff 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dharmawardhane et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">M.

Despite the wide body of work linking PAKs to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a cohesive picture of the exact role of PAKs in the regulation of the cytoskeleton remains elusive.</p><p id="P5">Since the average serine threonine kinase is predicted to phosphorylate 300 unique sites, this is perhaps unsurprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sugiyama, Imamura, and Ishihama 2019</xref>). However, the dysregulation of class I PAKs during cancer makes this an important issue, as changes to the actin cytoskeleton underpin many of the hallmarks of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hideki Yamaguchia 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Olson and Sahai 2009</xref>). Having recently identified a kinase-independent role for class I PAKs during pathogen-mediated actin remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Davidson et al. 2021</xref>) we wanted to take a more general look at the consequence of PAK kinase activity on the actin cytoskeleton. We find that, in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs), the inhibition of PAK kinase activity drives a PI3K dependent rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that this rearrangement depends upon the presence of PAK that lacks kinase activity but can bind to small GTPases and contains an intact AID domain. We hypothesise that this results from the maintenance of a kinase-independent scaffolding activity that is usually opposed by PAK autophosphorylation. This provides further evidence of complicated feedback mechanisms between PAK activation and PI3K activity and complicates the interpretation of experiments performed with either PAK kinase inhibitors or the overexpressed kinase dead PAK constructs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Pak kinase inhibition polarises MEFs</title><p id="P6">To investigate the consequence of PAK kinase inhibition we first observed Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) before and after the addition of the ATP-competitive PAK kinase inhibitor G5555 by low magnification transmitted light microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. movie1</xref>). Before the addition of the drug, cells appear relatively elongated and produce multiple small, short-lived protrusions. Upon the addition of G5555, MEFs rapidly polarise, producing broad, fan-like lamellipodia which completely alter the shape of the cell. To better characterise this transition MEFs were transiently transfected to express mApple-LifeAct to mark the actin cytoskeleton and imaged by widefield fluorescence microscopy before and following the addition of G5555. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1A</xref>) is a montage taken from (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. movie2</xref>) which captures the transition. Before the addition of G5555 multiple small, short-lived, protrusions can be observed. Upon addition of the drug a new protrusion forms and steadily expands. This protrusion is relatively stable and dramatically alters the shape of the cell as it grows.</p><p id="P7">To quantify these observations MEFs were fixed and stained for cortactin, a marker of branched actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Weed et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kage et al. 2022</xref>). Cortactin localisation to the periphery of the cell indicates an Arp2/3 dependent protrusion. Cells treated with G5555 showed an increase in the percentage of the perimeter that was marked by cortactin, demonstrating an increase in lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1B</xref>). Whereas untreated cells produce multiple, small protrusions, Cells treated with G5555 produce on average, a single, large protrusion highlighting a polarisation in the presence of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1C,D</xref>). A similar increase in lamellipodia production was observed in MDA-MB-231 and HAP cells, showing that this effect is not specific to MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp.1A,B,C,D</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of MEFs with the allosteric PAK kinase inhibitor NVSPAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Karpov et al. 2015</xref>) resulted in a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1B,C,D</xref>). Together this suggests that the loss of PAK kinase activity promotes lamellipodia formation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PAK kinase inhibition drives formation of cortactin rings</title><p id="P8">Upon further analysis of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supp movie2</xref> we noticed that the large protrusion that forms after addition of G5555 is marked by dynamic actin puncta which form a ring behind the leading edge <bold>(arrowheads</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1A</xref>). This further differentiates this structure from the smaller protrusions observed before the addition of G5555. To quantify the presence of these actin rings we re-examined images of cells fixed and stained for cortactin and found rings of cortactin positive actin puncta to be very prominent in cells treated with PAK kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>). Rings were clearly marked by cortactin, providing a convenient read out for the effect of the drug. Whilst observed in only 10% of untreated cells, 70-80% of cells treated with G5555 or NVSPAK1 display at least one ring of cortactin/ actin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1F</xref>). A similar response was observed upon treatment with two additional ATP competitive Class I PAK kinase inhibitors FRAX 1036 and FRAX 597 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Semenova and Chernoff 2017</xref>). The inhibition of PAK kinase activity leads to the upregulation of a subset of cytoskeletal structures, typified by the presence of a ring of cortactin/actin puncta.</p><p id="P9">We took advantage of these cortactin/ actin puncta as a useful readout of the effect of PAK kinase inhibition to further characterise the effect of the loss of PAK kinase activity on the actin cytoskeleton. Like many kinases, several kinase-independent functions of class I PAKs have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Davidson et al. 2021</xref>). Therefore, the kinase inhibitors tested so far may not block all functions of the molecule. IPA3 is a PAK inhibitor thought to block the GTPase binding activity of class I PAKs and therefore block recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deacon et al. 2008</xref>). To determine whether a kinase independent function of class I PAKs may contribute to the phenotype we have described, cells were treated with IPA3 and examined for the formation of cortactin/ actin rings. Interestingly IPA3 treatment alone did not drive the formation of cortactin/ actin whilst cotreatment of cells with G5555 and IPA3 blocked the effect of the kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>). This suggests that the recruitment of kinase-dead PAK is required for the observed changes to the cytoskeleton.</p><p id="P10">To examine this further, we partially depleted PAK1 and 2 by siRNA treatment and checked for the formation of cortactin/ actin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1G</xref>). Simultaneous knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 had no effect on ring formation in untreated cells but did impair the ability of G5555 to induce cortactin/actin rings. This further suggests that the formation of cortactin/ actin rings in the presence of kinase inhibitors is due to the local recruitment of kinase dead PAK rather than a global reduction in total class 1 PAK activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Effect of Kinase dead PAK requires GTPase binding and the AID domain</title><p id="P11">To determine how PAK kinase inhibition influences the cytoskeleton a series of truncated PAK constructs were expressed in MEFs, and these cells were assessed for the presence of cortactin rings. A schematic of PAK1 highlighting key interactions is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2A</xref>) and results of overexpression experiments are summarised in the table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2B</xref>). In line with our siRNA results, simply increasing the global levels of full-length PAK1 in the cell, via the overexpression of full-length GFP-PAK1, had no effect on the formation of cortactin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2C</xref>). Overexpression of a truncated construct lacking the kinase domain (GFP-PAK1 Δkin) however led to a fourfold increase in ring formation. Furthermore, overexpression of a full-length, kinase dead, construct (GFP-PAK1 K298R) also promoted ring formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brown et al. 1996</xref>). Together, this provides further evidence that ring formation is dependent on the recruitment of PAK that lacks kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>GTPase-binding is required for cortactin/ actin ring formation</title><p id="P12">A further truncation consisting of the P21 Binding Domain (PBD) and Autoinhibitory Domain (AID) domain of PAK1 (GFP-PAK1 PBD-AID) promoted ring formation whilst a shorter construct consisting of just the PBD, regularly employed as a marker of active Rac, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2C</xref>). The PBD domain did however localise to the centre of actin rings in cells treated with G5555 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 2a</xref>), suggesting that it may be sufficient to recruit PAK to these structures (and that Rac and/or CDC42 are active within the rings). To determine whether the GTPase binding activity of this domain contributes to the activity of kinase dead PAK, we overexpressed both a GTPase binding null full-length PAK1 (GFP-FL PAK1 H83/86L) and a GTPase binding null kinase dead FL PAK1 construct (GFP-FL PAK1 H83/86L K298R) and found that neither promoted ring formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2C</xref>). The PBD is therefore sufficient to localise PAK1 to these structures, and both the GTPase binding activity of the PBD and the presence of the AID domain is required for the effect of kinase dead PAK on the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Role of the AID domain</title><p id="P13">How the AID domain may contribute to the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. The AID domain of PAK binds to the kinase domain, blocking the substrate-binding pocket and holding PAK in an autoinhibited state. To determine whether the interaction between the AID and kinase domain of PAK is required for the effect of kinase dead PAK we took advantage of the L107F mutation, which has previously been shown to disrupt this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brown et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Frost et al. 1998</xref>). Overexpression of either GFP-full-length PAK1 L107F or GFP-full-length PAK1 L107F K298R did not promote the formation of cortactin/ actin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2C</xref>) suggesting that the interaction between the AID and the kinase domain is required for the formation of these structures.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Kinase dead PAK hyperaccumulates at active Rac</title><p id="P14">Since both the interaction with small GTPases and the ability to bind to more PAK is required for cortactin/ actin ring formation, we hypothesised that PAK kinase inhibition may lead to a change in the recruitment of PAK to active GTPases. Upon activation PAK undergoes a series of autophosphorylations which weaken both the interaction between the AID and the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chong et al. 2001</xref>) as well as the interaction between PAK and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Edward Manser et al. 1994</xref>). In the absence of PAK kinase activity perhaps maintenance of tight GTPase binding, as well as the stabilisation of intermolecular PAK-PAK interactions, disrupts PAK localisation.</p><p id="P15">To test this, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of PAK activation. Lipid coated beads coated with prenylated constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1 QL) were incubated with pig brain lysate, in the presence or absence of G5555 and protein recruitment to the beads was assessed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2D</xref>). In untreated lysates class I PAKs were pulled down by Rac1 QL and PAK phosphorylation at S144 was detected indicating PAK activation. Importantly this phosphorylation was lost in the presence of G5555 showing both that it is an active process occurring in the lysate and that the drug is working in this system. Upon inhibition of PAK kinase activity, 3 times more PAK was recruited to Rac1 QL beads. Loss of PAK kinase activity therefore leads to the aberrant accumulation of PAK, suggesting that one consequence of PAK kinase activity is to limit PAK recruitment to sites of small GTPase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Role of βPIX during PAK inhibition</title><p id="P16">We next asked how accumulation of kinase dead PAK at small GTPases influences the organisation of the cytoskeleton. We hypothesised that enrichment of PAK may lead to the accumulation of PAK binding partners. βpix is a Rac and Cdc42 GEF that binds to PAK and is therefore a good candidate to mediate changes to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Edward Manser et al. 1998</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that both βpix and its constitutive binding partner GIT were enriched on RacQL beads in the presence of the PAK kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2D</xref>). In agreement with a potential role for βpix during PAK kinase inhibition, partial depletion of βPIX by siRNA treatment led to a 50% reduction in the number of cells that generated cortactin/ actin positive rings upon treatment with G5555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2E</xref>). To further confirm a role for βPIX in this process we transiently overexpressed βPIX -GFP and checked for cortactin/ actin ring formation. Upon overexpression of this construct there was a 2.5-fold increase in the number of cells making rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">βPIX is required for the full response of the cell to PAK kinase inhibition and overexpression of full length βPIX alone is sufficient to mimic the phenotype of PAK inhibition. We therefore conclude that the dramatic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton upon PAK kinase inhibition depends upon the presence of a molecule of PAK that lacks catalytic activity but maintains the GTPase binding activity of the PBD domain and the kinase binding activity of the AID domain. This results in the hyperaccumulation of PAK and PAK binding partners and the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Identity and dynamics of cortactin rings</title><sec id="S11"><title>Identity of cortactin puncta</title><p id="P18">To determine how the recruitment of a kinase dead molecule of PAK might influence the cytoskeleton we set out to better define the cortactin/ actin rings observed in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>). First, we asked where PAK1 localised. Live cell Total Internal Reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFm) of cells expressing GFP-PAK1 and mApple LifeAct, treated with G5555, showed PAK1 to localise within the actin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3A</xref>). GFP-PAK1 also showed clear localisation to focal adhesions across the ventral surface of the cell.</p><p id="P19">Next, we further probed the molecular composition of the cortactin/ actin rings. A combination of live cell imaging of overexpressed fluorescent markers and immunostaining of endogenous proteins was used to dissect the molecular composition of the cortactin positive actin puncta. Unsurprisingly these were shown to contain several components of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 3A</xref>). They were also marked by the nucleation promoting factor N-WASp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 3B</xref>) and two components of the wave regulatory complex (CYFIP and ABI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 3C,D</xref>) as well as Myo1e (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The size and molecular composition of these puncta are reminiscent of podosomes. These are actin dependent adhesive structures characterised by a dense actin core surrounded by a ring of adaptor proteins such as vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dries et al. 2019</xref>). Immunostaining of endogenous vinculin revealed a diffuse localisation around the actin puncta, suggesting that they may indeed be adhesive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3B</xref>). These puncta therefore appear similar in both superficial appearance and molecular composition to podosomes but lack the clear organisation of actin core and adhesive ring. We therefore tentatively term these structures ‘podosome-like’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Dynamics of cortactin rings</title><p id="P21">These ‘podosome like’ puncta are organised into higher order structures, referred to here as cortactin/ actin rings, that are themselves dynamic.

B16F1 cells are routinely used in studies of the actin cytoskeleton for a number of reasons, not least because they form prominent lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kage et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Buracco et al. 2022</xref>). We hypothesised that the apparent excitability of the cytoskeleton in this cell line might make for a prominent response to PAK kinase inhibition. B16F1 cells were therefore transiently transfected to express eGFP lifeAct and observed via widefield fluorescence microscopy before and then during the addition of G5555 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. movie5</xref>. Before addition of the drug the cytoskeleton of the cell appears relatively stable with prominent stress fibres and only small, short-lived protrusions. Following the addition of G5555 an actin wave can be seen to form that begins to traverse around the cell. This wave splits at multiple points until many waves can be seen travelling around the cell, driving protrusion where they contact the cell edge and reorganising the prominent stress fibres where they pass. The dramatic change in the state of the cytoskeleton is highlighted in the accompanying kymograph as well as a read out of actin intensity overtime at the region of the cell marked with a circle in the first panel.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Lipid composition of rings</title><p id="P24">Actin waves and related structures are organised around regions of the plasma membrane with a specific identity, within which PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> /PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> are enriched and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhan et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Masters, Sheetz, and Gauthier 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brandon 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Ostrowski et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gerhardt et al. 2014</xref>). To examine whether a similar organisation of lipid species may organise the cortactin/ actin ring structures observed upon inhibition of PAK kinase activity, fluorescent markers of various phosphoinositides were expressed in MEFs expressing mApple LifeAct to mark the actin cytoskeleton. These cells were then treated with G5555 and the localisation of the different markers relative to the actin cytoskeleton compared using TIRFm.</p><p id="P25">After treatment with G5555 the PI(3,4,5)P3 marker (GFP BTK PH) was observed to localise within the ring of actin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. movie6</xref>). BTK fluorescence dropped off sharply outside of the ring and there was no corresponding peak of PI(3,4,5)P3 observed relative to the actin puncta. Interestingly the PI(3,4)P2 marker (GFP TAPP1 PH) and a PI3P markers (EYFP p40phox px domain) also localized within the actin ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 4A,B</xref>). The PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> marker (mCherry PLC PH) was clearly excluded from the center of the ring of actin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supp. movie7</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Cortactin/ actin rings therefore form around patches of membrane enriched in PIP3, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3)P. Due to the prevalence of 3’ phosphorylated phosphoinositides within the centre of the rings we wanted to determine the role of PI3Ks on the formation of these structures. Cotreatment with the PI3k inhibitor LY294002 abolished cortactin ring formation in both cells treated with G5555 and cells expressing PAK1 Δkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure4C</xref>). The formation of these structures upon PAK kinase inhibition is therefore PI3K dependent. In agreement we detected an increase in the ratio of pAKT : AKT by western blot in cells treated with G5555, consistent with a global increase in PIP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 4C</xref>). We propose then that the accumulation of PAK upon PAK kinase inhibition ultimately leads to a dysregulation of PI3K signalling and the constitutive production of PIP3 domains on the plasma membrane. These domains organise actin polymerisation resulting in the formation of rings of cortactin/ actin positive puncta which travel across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>PI3K dependence of phenotypic changes upon PAK kinase inhibition</title><p id="P27">PIP3 is produced at the plasma membrane in response to acute external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Karunarathne et al. 2013</xref>). This is one mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton may be organised in response to a change in the external environment of the cell. The aberrant production of PIP3 in the presence of PAK kinase inhibitors may therefore mimic the application of an external signal. This might explain the polarisation of the cytoskeleton in the absence of an external directional cue, described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1</xref>. We therefore further analysed the localisation of cortactin in cells treated with LY294002 or cotreated with LY294002 and G5555. Whilst cells treated with LY294002 still produced lamellipodia, this blocked the increase in lamelipodia formation when co-treated with G5555 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Furthermore, there was no change in the number of protrusions formed per cell demonstrating that MEFs treated with G5555 do not polarise in the absence of PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Migration</title><p id="P29">We hypothesised that this PI3K-dependent polarisation of the cytoskeleton may disrupt the ability of the cell to respond to external signals as the pathway may already be saturated. To test this, we analysed the effect of PAK kinase inhibition on cells migrating randomly and in the presence of a chemotactic gradient. Class I PAKs have previously been implicated in the regulation of cell migration with both overexpression of mutant constructs and inhibition with small molecule inhibitors have been shown to influence both the speed and directionality of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Itakura et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mary Ann Sells, Boyd, and Chernoff 1999</xref>). The aberrant over-production of PIP3 has also been shown to disrupt efficient cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Veltman et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Upon the addition of a chemotactic gradient untreated cells responded by orientating migration along the gradient. One read out of this change is an increase in the directional persistence, as cells turn less as their migration becomes directed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Upon the addition of G5555 however MEFs no longer increased directional persistence in the presence of a chemotactic gradient. However, cotreatment with LY294002 restored the ability of cells treated with G5555 to migrate in a more persistent manner within a chemotactic gradient. Plots displaying a random subset of cell trajectories are displayed in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 5B</xref>). This suggests that the aberrant production of PIP3 in the absence of PAK kinase activity disrupts the ability of the cell to respond to external signals. This does not mean that the dysregulation of PI3K accounts for all effects of PAK in cell migration but demonstrates that directional migration is possible in the absence of PAK kinase activity, if PI3K activity is also inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Macropinocytosis</title><p id="P31">We lastly wanted to determine whether the dramatic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton observed upon PAK kinase inhibition may disrupt other actin dependent processes. Macropinocytosis is the bulk uptake of extracellular fluid and requires an actin dependent reorganisation of the plasma membrane. Overexpression of various mutant PAK constructs, treatment with PAK kinase inhibitors and knockdown of PAK1 has previously been shown to influence levels of macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lee et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dharmawardhane et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nazemi et al. 2024</xref>). We therefore wanted to determine whether the PI3K dependent rearrangement of the cytoskeleton may explain some of the effect of PAK kinase inhibition on this process.</p><p id="P32">Since macropinocytosis is PI3K dependent in many cell types we used MiaPaCa cells, which constitutively perform PI3K independent macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">S. H. Kim et al. 2022</xref>). We first examined the response of MiaPaCa cells to PAK kinase inhibition and observed an increase in area upon treatment with G5555. Importantly this spreading was PI3K dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. 5C</xref>). We next examined the effect of PAK inhibition on macropinocytosis, as measured by the uptake of 70kDa dextran <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig5c</xref>. As expected, untreated MiaPaCa cells performed macropinocytosis and this was unaffected by the addition of LY294002. Addition of G5555 however led to a nearly 50% reduction in uptake. Amazingly, this effect was partially reversed by cotreatment with LY294002. This further demonstrates that the aberrant formation of PIP3 in response to PAK kinase inhibition can disrupt the normal functions of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure5D</xref>). Again this does not mean that dysregulated PI3K signalling accounts for all effects of PAK during macropinocytosis as several studies have shown an effect on macropinocytosis following a knockdown of PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nazemi et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Montserrat Llanses Martinez et al. 2024</xref>) but clearly demonstrates that caution is required when attributing phenotypes to the loss of PAK kinase activity when using PAK kinase inhibitors alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Previous studies have reported marked effects on the cytoskeleton upon both the overexpression of PAK and mutant PAK constructs as well as treatment with small molecule inhibitors. In this study we quantify and further characterise an increase in lamelipodia formation upon inhibition of PAK kinase activity in MEFs as well as in several other cell lines. We show that this correlates with an increase in the presence of a subset of PI3K-dependent actin structures. We conclude that PAK kinase inhibition results in a dysregulation of Pi3K activity and that this explains a number of the phenotypic changes observed upon PAK kinase inhibition. We hypothesise that this is due to the disruption of a class I PAK kinase dependent negative feedback loop which in untreated cells limits the recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners to sites of GTPase activation. Together this provides further evidence of feedback from class I PAK kinase activation to PI3K activity and positions PAK and PAK binding partners as vital nodes in the regulation of the excitable pathways that control PI3K signalling.</p><p id="P34">Numerous studies have demonstrated effects on the actin cytoskeleton upon overexpression of various mutant PAK constructs as well as inhibition of PAK kinase activity by small molecule inhibitor. We find that the formation of PI3K dependent cortactin/ actin rings only occurs when PAK kinase activity is inhibited. Importantly we show that kinase inhibition by small molecule inhibitors recapitulates the effect of the overexpression of kinase dead PAK constructs. This suggests that the effect of kinase dead constructs represents the genuine inhibition of endogenous PAK kinase activity and demonstrates that similar phenotypes can be driven at endogenous levels of PAK expression.</p><p id="P35">The model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig2F</xref> suggests that: 1. the recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners modulates the actin cytoskeleton in a kinase-independent manner and that 2. PAK kinase activity limits the total accumulation of PAK to sites of small GTPase activation. In the presence of PAK kinase activity, recruitment of PAK to small GTPases is therefore self-limiting and an optimal level of PAK recruitment, and therefore PAK scaffolding activity, is achieved. It is interesting to speculate that levels of PAK recruitment may be optimally tuned to elicit an appropriate cytoskeletal response following small GTPase activation. It will be important in the future to better characterise this scaffolding activity in the presence of PAK kinase activity. For example, in the absence of PAK as a scaffold, are cells in which levels of class I PAKs have been lowered by knockdown or knockout able to organise a coherent response to an external signal?</p><p id="P36">The mechanism linking hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners to PI3K activation also requires further investigation. We show that βPIX is required for the full response of the cell to PAK kinase inhibition, but how βPIX mediates this response is uncertain. Furthermore, class I PAKs and the PIX-GIT complex interact with multiple components of the excitable pathway that regulates PI(3,4,5)P3 production including binding directly to PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Papakonstanti and Stournaras 2002</xref>), Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Edward Manser et al. 1994</xref>), ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yin et al. 2005</xref>) and AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Higuchi et al. 2008</xref>) as well as phosphorylating the Ras effector Raf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chaudhary et al. 1999</xref>) and the tumour suppressor Merlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Xiao et al. 2002</xref>). The consequences of these varied activities and how they are integrated into a coherent response upon PAK recruitment and activation is far from clear. Due to the complex nature of interactions accounted for by the PAK-PIX-GIT-complex, the accumulation of these proteins is likely to be complicated and perhaps non-linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">J. Zhu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Premont et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Regardless of the exact mechanism, in MEFs the loss of PAK kinase activity results in the production of ventral PIP3 domains implying a dysregulation of the excitable networks which regulate PI3K activity. Acute perturbations to this pathway have previously been shown to drive dramatic switches in cell shape in both <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and mammalian cell lines in agreement with the polarisation observed in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Miao et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Devreotes et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhan et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Trogoff et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kuhn et al. 2024</xref>). This positions PAK as a potential node at which the excitable pathways controlling PI3K activity may be regulated. Again, it will be important now to test whether the opposite is true: do increased levels of PAK kinase activity negatively regulate the production of PIP3? Partial depletion of PAK 1 and 2 by siRNA did not in itself promote the formation of cortactin/ actin rings but it would be interesting to test this further in a system with higher basal PI3K activity.</p><p id="P38">Pip3 domains organise the cytoskeleton across large regions of both time and space and facilitate macropinocytosis and phagocytosis as well as a subset of protrusions in a range of cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Veltman et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lutton et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Ostrowski et al. 2019</xref>).

They have been studied extensively in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as lab strains constitutively produce ventral PIP3 domains which are amenable to imaging via TIRFm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gerhardt et al. 2014</xref>). Analogous ventral structures can be induced in a range of mammalian cell types, however, comparison between Mammalian and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> models has been somewhat limited by the relative difficulty of culturing and transfecting the specialised cell lines required as well as due to the transient nature of the response of the mammalian system to stimulation. The dramatic and long-lasting induction of ventral PIP3 domains in MEFs and B16F1s therefore provides a convenient model to better characterise the organisation and dynamics of these structures in mammalian cell lines.</p><p id="P39">Lastly, the rapid formation of large pip3 domains following the inhibition of PAK kinase activity complicates the interpretation of results obtained in the presence of PAK kinase inhibitors. The</p><p id="P40">formation of PIP3 at the plasma membrane necessarily influences many signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Swanson, Yoshida, and Swanson 2019</xref>) and PIP3 domains organise many key components of the cytoskeleton, potentially limiting the availability of key factors. Furthermore, they dramatically remodel the cytoskeleton, specifically the ventral cortex. The formation of these structures, which at times encompass the majority of the ventral surface of the cell, necessarily influences the mode of adhesion as well as the contractility of the cell. This in turn may further influence the state of key signalling pathways as well as the physical properties of the cell itself. Together this makes it hard to uncouple direct effects of the loss of PAK kinase activity from indirect effects stemming from the modulation of PI3K signalling and provides further justification for the recent development of a PAK1 selective degrader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chow et al. 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S19"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P41">MEFs, B16F1s, MiaPaCas and MDA-MB-231 were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100U/ml penicillin-streptomycin.
