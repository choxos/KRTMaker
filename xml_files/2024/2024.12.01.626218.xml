The TRAIP ubiquitin ligase induces mitotic replisome disassembly, fork cleavage, and repair via ‘Mitotic DNA Synthesis’ (MiDAS). Until now, it was unclear how TRAIP is regulated in mitotic cells. Here we show that TRAIP phosphorylation mediates a complex with the TTF2 ATPase and DNA Polymerase ε (Polε). Whereas TTF2 ATPase activity removes RNA polymerase II from mitotic chromosomes, replisome disassembly involves an unanticipated mechanism. The TTF2 amino terminus couples TRAIP to Polε, via tandem Zinc fingers that recognise phosphorylated TRAIP, and a motif that binds to POLE2. Thereby, TTF2 and Polε cause TRAIP to ubiquitylate the CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, triggering replisome disassembly and MiDAS. These data identify TTF2 as a multifunctional regulator of chromatin transactions during mitosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">When eukaryotic cells enter mitosis, any remaining regions of unreplicated DNA have the potential to impair the segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase, and thus represent a major threat to genome integrity. Cells duplicate the bulk of the genome during the S-phase of the cell cycle, by assembling replisomes at many origins of DNA replication, and the subsequent G2-phase was traditionally thought to separate the completion of replication from mitotic entry. In species with large genomes, however, mathematical modelling of origin spacing and replication errors indicated that the replication of a small subset of loci is likely to continue throughout G2-phase and even into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Al Mamun <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, mitotic entry before the completion of DNA replication is a feature of the early human embryo from the first cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Palmerola <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), and is especially prevalent in cancer cells with inherent DNA replication stress that results from oncogene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bournaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). In such cases, cells still enter mitosis despite the persistence of a low number of DNA replication forks, which are not sufficient to activate cell cycle checkpoints. Therefore, eukaryotes with large genomes needed to evolve mechanisms to process sites of incomplete DNA replication very quickly during early mitosis, to support successful chromosome segregation during anaphase. At present, these pathways are poorly understood in all species.</p><p id="P3">One such mechanism involves the cleavage of DNA replication forks upon mitotic entry, followed by repair pathways such as MiDAS that help to produce two disentangled sister chromatids that are able to segregate during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bhowmick <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). High-resolution mapping of MiDAS in human cells shows that it commonly occurs at very late replicating loci within large transcription units, corresponding to ‘common fragile sites’ that are frequently rearranged in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ji <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Macheret <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). A likely trigger for the cleavage of DNA replication forks in mitotic cells is disassembly of the CMG helicase, which forms the stable core of the replisome and encircles the DNA template for leading strand synthesis. Animal cells disassemble the CMG helicase at any remaining DNA replication forks upon entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Priego Moreno <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sonneville <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sonneville <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), thereby exposing the underlying parental DNA to nucleolytic attack. Work with <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts supports a model whereby mitotic CMG disassembly and leading strand cleavage at converging replisomes, followed by subsequent gap filling and Pol-theta dependent microhomology-mediated repair, would produce one daughter chromosome with a sister chromatid exchange and another with a small deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). These features are typical of common fragile sites in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bhowmick <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bournaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In metazoa, the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase is responsible for CMG helicase ubiquitylation and disassembly upon mitotic entry, leading to replication fork cleavage and MiDAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Priego Moreno <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sonneville <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). During S-phase, TRAIP associates with the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dewar <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Villa <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) and specifically ubiquitylates factors in front of stalled replication forks, to initiate the repair of protein-DNA crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Larsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) or inter-strand DNA crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), and to resolve transcription-replication conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Scaramuzza <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Upon entry into mitosis, however, TRAIP rapidly induces the ubiquitylation and disassembly of all remaining CMG helicase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Priego Moreno <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sonneville <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Villa <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). This does not require the convergence of two replisomes and is not impaired by replication fork DNA, unlike CMG ubiquitylation by the ubiquitin ligase CUL2LRR1, which is inhibited by the lagging strand DNA template at replication forks until the termination of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deegan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jenkyn-Bedford <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Low <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Until now, the mechanism by which TRAIP is activated to induce CMG helicase disassembly during mitosis was unknown. Here we show that mammalian TRAIP is regulated by the TTF2 ATPase in mitotic cells. TTF2 couples TRAIP to Polε, which binds to the CMG helicase at DNA replication forks and synthesises the nascent leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Daigaku <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jenkyn-Bedford <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Langston <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nick McElhinny <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pursell <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sengupta <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). These findings indicate that TTF2 and Polε position TRAIP to promote CMG helicase ubiquitylation and disassembly in mitotic cells, thereby initiating the rapid processing of sites of incomplete DNA replication.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>CDK phosphorylation of TRAIP is required for CMG helicase disassembly during mitosis</title><p id="P6">To study how TRAIP is regulated upon entry into mitosis, we used mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) that provide a tractable system for studying the assembly and disassembly of the mammalian replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Evrin <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Villa <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). When mouse ES cells were synchronised in mitosis, by inhibition of the Eg5 kinesin with S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), the mobility of TRAIP was shifted in polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 4-5) that contained the phosphate-binding molecule known as ‘Phos-tag’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kinoshita <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The migration of TRAIP in Phos-tag gels was further retarded when mouse ES cells were driven prematurely into mitosis by treatment with Calyculin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gotoh <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), which inhibits the protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 that counteract mitotic protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). These findings suggested that TRAIP is regulated by phosphorylation during mitosis.</p><p id="P7">Mouse TRAIP contains three consensus sites for cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which are broadly conserved in TRAIP orthologues from other vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Mutation of all three sites reduced the phosphorylation of TRAIP in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, TRAIP-3A), suggesting that cyclin-dependent kinases are a major source of mitotic TRAIP phosphorylation. Moreover, phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that all three of TRAIP’s CDK-consensus sites are phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 9-10 with lanes 11-12). To test whether phosphorylation of TRAIP on CDK-consensus sites is required for mitotic CMG helicase disassembly, we inhibited CUL2LRR1 to block CMG helicase disassembly during DNA replication termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dewar <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sonneville <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Villa <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and then used spinning disk confocal microscopy to monitor the association of a GFP-tagged CMG subunit (GFP-SLD5) with condensed mitotic chromosomes. GFP-SLD5 persisted on metaphase chromosomes in <italic>Traip</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, <italic>Traip</italic>Δ), as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Villa <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and this could be rescued by expression of wild type TRAIP from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, <italic>Traip</italic>Δ + TRAIP). In contrast, expression of the TRAIP-3A mutant was unable to rescue the mitotic CMG disassembly defect of <italic>Traip</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, <italic>Traip</italic>Δ + TRAIP-3A), though TRAIP-3A retained other aspects of TRAIP function, since it rescued the sensitivity of <italic>Traip</italic>Δ cells to the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin-C and the PARP inhibitor Olaparib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). These data indicate that mitotic phosphorylation of TRAIP, likely by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase, is essential for mitotic disassembly of the CMG helicase.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Mitotic phosphorylation of TRAIP induces complex assembly with the TTF2 ATPase and DNA polymerase ε</title><p id="P8">Alphafold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Evans <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mirdita <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) predicts with high confidence that TRAIP forms an extended dimer via a long region of coiled coil, preceded at the amino terminus by the RING domain that couples TRAIP to ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and followed at the carboxy-terminal side by an extensive disordered tail that comprises about 40% of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The three CDK-consensus sites are located within the disordered tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that they might mediate the interaction of dimeric TRAIP with other factors.</p><p id="P9">We expressed a recombinant form of mouse TRAIP in <italic>E. coli</italic> and used mass photometry to show that the purified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) had a mass of about 106 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming dimerization as predicted by AlphaFold (Mw TRAIP monomer = 53.1 kDa). Moreover, recombinant TRAIP migrated more slowly than expected in a size exclusion column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), but not in a glycerol gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, sample 1), consistent with the elongated nature of the predicted TRAIP dimer.</p><p id="P10">When an extract of asynchronous mouse ES cells was fractionated in a glycerol gradient, the migration of TRAIP was very similar to the recombinant TRAIP dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, sample 2). However, fractionation of mitotic cell extracts revealed a dramatic shift of TRAIP to an apparently larger protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, sample 3), formation of which was impaired by mutation of the consensus CDK sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, compare samples 2 and 4). These findings suggested that mitotic phosphorylation causes the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase to associate with other factors that might control its ability to ubiquitylate the CMG helicase at DNA replication forks.</p><p id="P11">To identify mitotic partners of the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase, we generated mouse ES cells in which the only form of TRAIP was modified by addition of five copies of the FLAG epitope, either at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, or between two poorly conserved residues in the disordered tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Both tagged forms of TRAIP were able to rescue the sensitivity of <italic>Traip</italic>Δ cells to mitomycin C and Olaparib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>), as well as supporting mitotic CMG helicase disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D-E</xref>). Subsequently, therefore, we isolated FLAG-tagged TRAIP from extracts of asynchronous or mitotic mouse ES cells, and used mass spectrometry to analyse co-purifying proteins. In three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1-S3</xref>), FLAG-tagged TRAIP co-purified from asynchronous and mitotic samples with the DNA repair factor RAP80, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Soo Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). RAP80 is part of the BRCA1-A complex and we also found that FLAG-tagged TRAIP co-purified with additional BRCA1-A components, namely ABRAXAS1, BABAM2, BABAM1 and BRCC36 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1-S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Strikingly, two factors selectively co-purified with TRAIP during mitosis. The first was an ATPase known as TTF2 (Transcription Termination Factor 2), which was originally identified as a factor in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and Humans that releases RNA Polymerase II and nascent transcripts from template DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Xie &amp; Price, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Xie &amp; Price, 1996</xref>). Subsequent work showed that human TTF2 and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue known as ‘lodestar’ are predominantly cytoplasmic proteins, which associate with chromosomes during mitosis and are required to displace RNA polymerase II and nascent transcripts from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Carmo <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Girdham &amp; Glover, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), by a mechanism that remains to be characterised. Live cell video microscopy indicated that mouse TTF2 is principally a cytoplasmic protein during interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), before associating with chromosomes throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The second factor that co-purified selectively with TRAIP during mitosis was Polε. The preferential association of TRAIP with both TTF2 and Polε during mitosis was confirmed by immunoblotting, using pulldowns of either TRAIP-5FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare lanes 9-10) or 5FLAG-POLE1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>, lane 12). Moreover, selective association of TRAIP with TTF2 and Polε in mitotic cells was dependent upon TRAIP’s CDK-consensus sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, lanes 11-12; note that TRAIP-3A still retained a residual association with Polε). These findings indicate that phosphorylation of TRAIP causes the assembly of a stable complex with TTF2 and Polε, during mitosis in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Tandem Zinc finger domains at the TTF2 amino terminus are required for mitotic CMG disassembly but are dispensable for displacement of RNA polymerase II from mitotic chromatin</title><p id="P14">TTF2 contains a SWI2/SNF2 ATPase domain in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>), which is thought to mediate the release of RNA polymerase and nascent transcripts from mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Carmo <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). TTF2 also has a pair of zinc-fingers of unknown function at the amino terminus, connected by a long disordered region to the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). To explore whether TTF2 is important for mitotic CMG helicase disassembly, and then elucidate the underlying mechanism, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a set of tools for studying TTF2 function in mouse ES cells.</p><p id="P15">Firstly, we used the repair of dual Cas9 nicking sites to generate small deletions within Exon 2 of the <italic>Ttf2</italic> gene, close to the start of the coding sequence, or in Exon 11 within the region encoding the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A-C</xref>). Cell viability was reduced dramatically when the <italic>Ttf2</italic> coding sequence was cut within Exon 11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8D</xref>), consistent with data from large-scale CRISPR screens in human cancer cell lines that indicate that TTF2 is essential for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tsherniak <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, targeting Cas9 to Exon 2 of <italic>Ttf2</italic> did not compromise viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8D</xref>), despite causing frame-shift deletions after the first 10-12 amino acids of the <italic>Ttf2</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8E</xref>), which prevented expression of full-length protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8F</xref>). Such deletions within Exon 2 of <italic>Ttf2</italic> were associated with expression of a truncated protein that lacked the amino terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8F-G</xref>) and likely started from Met177, which represents the next in-frame methionine after the initiator ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the truncated TTF2 protein was sensitive to <italic>Ttf2</italic> siRNAs, confirming specificity of the observed band). These data indicated that cells are able to proliferate in the absence of the amino-terminal pair of Zinc fingers of TTF2, and suggested that the ATPase domain might be essential for cell viability.</p><p id="P16">Secondly, we modified the <italic>Ttf2</italic> locus in mouse ES cells to introduce degrons that allow the rapid and conditional depletion of TTF2 protein. Initially, we used BromoTag that is ubiquitylated by the CUL2VHL ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bond <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), when cells are treated with the PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) known as AGB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> lanes 5-6). Despite depletion of the bulk of BromoTag-TTF2 in the presence of AGB1, cell proliferation was impaired but not completely blocked, likely due to residual protein that still provides some measure of TTF2 function. Therefore, we generated cells in which TTF2 was fused not only to BromoTag but also to dTAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Nabet <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), which is ubiquitylated by CRL4CRBN in response to the PROTAC dTag-13. Depletion of TTF2-dTAG-BromoTag in the presence of either AGB1 or dTag-13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9B</xref>) partially reduced the growth of <italic>Ttf2-dTAG-BromoTag</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9C</xref>), whereas combination of both PROTACs blocked cell proliferation more efficiently without affecting growth of control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The growth defect caused by efficient depletion of TTF2 could be rescued by expression of wild type TTF2 from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, wt TTF2). Similarly, expression of truncated TTF2 lacking the amino-terminal Zinc fingers also rescued depletion of degron-tagged TTF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, TTF2-Δ1-94). In contrast, TTF2 with a mutated Walker A motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, TTF2-K578A) lacked ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>) and was unable to support cell proliferation. These data confirmed that cells are able to proliferate in the absence of the TTF2 Zinc fingers and indicated that the ATPase activity of TTF2 is essential for cell viability.</p><p id="P18">Using these tools, we tested whether the TTF2 Zinc fingers and ATPase activity are required for mitotic CMG disassembly, using spinning disk confocal microscopy as above. Strikingly, cells lacking the amino terminus of TTF2 were just as defective in mitotic CMG disassembly as <italic>Traip</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E-F</xref>). This defect could be rescued by expression of wild type TTF2 from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>, TTF2 1-1138), but not by expression of TTF2 lacking the two Zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>, TTF2 95-1138). Interestingly, the TTF2-K578A allele that lacks ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>) supported mitotic CMG disassembly as efficiently as wild type TTF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>, TTF2-K578A). These data indicated that the TTF2 Zinc fingers are essential for mitotic CMG disassembly, whereas TTF2 ATPase activity is dispensable. Correspondingly, the amino terminal half of TTF2 that precedes the ATPase domain is sufficient to mediate complex assembly with TRAIP and Polε in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 10).

To explore this idea further, we first tested the impact on mitotic CMG disassembly of individually mutating the three consensus CDK sites in TRAIP. Whereas CMG was still unloaded from chromosomes in mitotic cells lacking either TRAIP-S295 or TRAIP-S348, mutation of TRAIP-T325 blocked mitotic CMG disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

These findings indicated that phosphorylation of TRAIP-T325 is essential for mitotic CMG disassembly, suggesting that the region around T325 is a potential binding site for TTF2 or Polε. The data further suggest that phosphorylation of TRAIP-S295 and TRAIP-S348 might contribute indirectly to mitotic CMG disassembly, by promoting the efficient phosphorylation of TRAIP-T325.</p><p id="P22">The first of the TTF2 Zinc fingers resembles the ‘GRF’ Zinc fingers of DNA repair factors such as APE2 and NEIL3, which bind to single-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wallace <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).

Since the amino-terminal half of TTF2 is sufficient to support the TRAIP-TTF2-Polε complex and mitotic CMG disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11A-B</xref>), we used AlphaFold to screen for interactions between TTF2 1-504 and the four subunits of Polε.

Direct monitoring of mitotic CMG ubiquitylation in cells is challenging, as the vast majority of the genome is normally replicated before mitosis, with the associated replisomes being disassembled during DNA replication termination. Therefore, we took advantage of the fact that Calyculin A drives mouse ES cells prematurely from S-phase into mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), to explore the regulation of mitotic CMG ubiquitylation by TRAIP, TTF2 and Polε, under conditions where cells still contain many DNA replication forks. Treatment of asynchronous mouse ES cells for one hour with Calyculin A was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of TRAIP-T325, and complex formation with TTF2 and Polε, analogous to when cells were arrested in mitosis by treatment with STLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">To monitor CMG ubiquitylation when cells entered mitosis prematurely from S-phase, we isolated CMG and associated factors from cell extracts, by immunoprecipitation of the SLD5 subunit of the helicase.

After treatment with Calyculin A, TTF2 was recruited to CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 8), dependent upon TRAIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 10). Correspondingly, a ladder of modified bands was detected for the MCM3 and MCM7 components of CMG in the presence of Calyculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 8), uniquely amongst the 11 subunits of the helicase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15A</xref>). Modification of MCM3 and MCM7 corresponded to ubiquitylation, since the USP2 deubiquitylase could remove the modified bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15B</xref>), in a reaction that was sensitive to propargylated ubiquitin that inhibits deubiquitylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ekkebus <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).

These findings indicate that Polε is required for mitotic CMG ubiquitylation, together the TTF2 amino terminal region and the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase.

At present, a structural understanding for how TRAIP associates with the replisome during S-phase is lacking for any species. TRAIP forms an elongated dimer via its extended region of coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) and it is likely that the amino-terminal RING finger domains of the TRAIP dimer are orientated to the front of the replication fork and away from the replisome itself.

The tandem Zinc fingers of TTF2 bind to a region of the disordered tail of TRAIP, dependent upon phosphorylation of TRAIP-T325 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and represent a new class of phospho-receptor domain. Simultaneously, a motif downstream of the TTF2 tandem Zinc fingers binds to the POLE2 subunit of Polε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Alternatively, TRAIP might make additional replisome contacts after docking onto TTF2 and Polε, thereby orientating the RING domains more specifically towards MCM3 and MCM7.

Cells were then rinsed with pre-warmed PBS three times (within 5 minutes) and incubated with fresh medium containing 20 µM EdU and 200 ng / ml nocodazole for 45 minutes. The following steps were performed at room temperature. Mitotic cells were harvested by mitotic-shake off, pelleted by centrifugation at 233 g for 3 minutes, resuspended in 0.5 ml of medium and re-seeded onto microscope slides (Avantor, 631-1553), which was coated by Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma, P8920), heated at 300°C for 30 seconds and dried up before use. Three minutes after re-seeding, excess medium was removed from the slides with a piece of tissue paper. The attached cells on the slide were then fixed with 100 µl of 4% PFA / PBS for 10 minutes.

A z-stack of five images with 1 µm spacing was gathered and the images show a 2-dimensional projection of the 3-dimensional data. The scale bars represent 10 µm. (<bold>C</bold>) Quantification of the number of EdU foci on chromatin per mitotic cell. Individual datapoints from three independent experiments are shown as black spots. The mean values from each experiment are denoted by red circles, with a red line showing the average of the three means. P-values were calculated using a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test. (<bold>D</bold>) Model for how TTF2 contributes to mitotic CMG disassembly (left panel) and mitotic unloading of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from chromosomes (right panel). In the left panel, the three sub-assemblies of the CMG helicase are shown in different colours: the hexameric MCM2-7 ATPases as a ring of red dumbells, the GINS complex in green and blue, and CDC45 in orange. ‘Zfs’ = tandem Zinc finger domains of TTF2. The TTF2 motif that binds to the POLE2 subunit of Polε is shown as a blue rectangle. ‘RINGs’ = two RING domains of the TRAIP dimer, which recruit ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. ‘P’ = phosphorylation of TRAIP-T325.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201653-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
