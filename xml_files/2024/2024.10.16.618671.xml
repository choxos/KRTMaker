Eighteen adolescents with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) completed a single□blind sham□controlled cross□over randomised atDCS trial. Dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate the effective connectivity between regions that showed working memory effects from the fMRI. Group-level inferences for between sessions (pre- and post-stimulation) and stimulation type (atDCS and sham) effects were carried out using the parametric empirical Bayes approach. A correlation analysis was performed to relate the estimated effective connectivity parameters of left dlPFC pre-atDCS and post-atDCS to the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-GABA). Next, correlation analysis was repeated using all working memory performance and all pre-atDCS and post-atDCS connectivity parameters. It was found that atDCS decreased average excitatory connectivity from left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to left superior frontal gyrus and increased average excitatory connectivity to left globus pallidus. Further, reduced average intrinsic (inhibitory) connectivity of left dlPFC was associated with lower MRS-GABA. However, none of the connectivity parameters of dlPFC showed any association with performance on a working memory task. These findings suggest that atDCS reorganised connectivity from frontal to fronto-striatal connectivity. As atDCS-related changes were not specific to the effect of working memory, they may have impacted general cognitive control processes. In addition, by reducing MRS-GABA, atDCS might make dlPFC more sensitive and responsive to external stimulation, such as performance of cognitive tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neurofibromatosis</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>effective connectivity</kwd><kwd>functional MRI</kwd><kwd>non-invasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>atDCS</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a single-gene autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder with birth incidence of 1:2700 Evans, Howard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The condition is caused by mutation of the NF1 gene, encodes the neurofibromin protein, and regulates the Ras-MAPK molecular pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Physiologically, NF1 is associated with skeletal abnormalities, brain and peripheral nerve tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In addition, NF1 patients tend to underperform in academic settings compared to their siblings without an NF1 diagnosis, including poorer performance on assessments of intelligence, visuospatial skills, social competence, executive function and attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Notably, Shilyansky, Karlsgodt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] found that NF1 patients score lower on working memory tasks than controls and that they are more sensitive to the effects of increased memory load than controls. In addition, Shilyansky, Karlsgodt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] explored the neural substrates of these deficits using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and demonstrated that deficits in working memory of NF1 patients were associated with hypoactivity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), frontal eye fields, and parietal cortex, as well as striatal regions. Thus, the working memory deficits in NF1 patients may be explained by disrupted activity of left frontal regions associated with working memory.</p><p id="P4">To address these physiological and psychosocial alterations, clinical neuroscience has explored therapeutic effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Application of NIBS has shown some success in improving cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum condition and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] investigated effects of NIBS on working memory performance in NF1 patients. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) was applied to left dlPFC during performance of a working memory task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. atDCS is thought to increase cortical excitability through depolarisation of the resting membrane potential. Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] demonstrated that application of atDCS was associated with decreased levels of GABA in the dlPFC, as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, atDCS had transient effects on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI data, and it did not influence behavioural outcomes.</p><p id="P5">To further understand the effects of atDCS on NF1 patients it is important to understand how brain regions coordinate their activity with each other during performance of working memory tasks prior and post NIBS. Here, we further analyse the data obtained by Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], as we investigate the effects of a sham-controlled anodal atDCS administration trial on effective connectivity of left dlPFC in adolescent patients with NF1. To this end, this work will employ dynamic causal modelling (DCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Since in the original Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] study the administration of atDCS aimed to increase dlPFC excitability, we hypothesise that the administration of atDCS will result with a reduction of inhibitory intrinsic connectivity (self-connectivity) of left dlPFC, which will increase connectivity from left dlPFC to other regions involved with working memory. We further hypothesise that effective connectivity parameters of left dlPFC will show a positive correlation with GABA concentration and working memory performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>NF1 Participants</title><p id="P6">The data used in this study has been previously described in Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].

Participants maintained their regular medication schedules, including stimulants. During the visits, participants were comfortably positioned in a scanner, and high-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired.

First, 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained in the sagittal plane with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence (repetition time = 8.4 ms; echo time = 3.77 ms; flip angle = 8°; inversion time = 1150 ms; in-plane resolution = 0.94 mm; 150 slices with 1 mm thickness). Next, a T2-weighted structural scan was performed using a turbo spin echo sequence (TR = 3756 ms; TE = 89 ms; 40 slices of 3 mm thickness and 1 mm gap; in-plane resolution = 0.45 mm). Single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H MRS data were collected before and after stimulation from two volumes of interest (VOI) in each participant: one VOI (40 × 20 × 24 mm) in the left dlPFC and a control VOI (20 × 50 × 20 mm) in the posterior occipital lobe (OCC), centred on the mid-sagittal plane to encompass both hemispheres. Water-unsuppressed spectra were recorded from these locations to serve as references. To detect GABA+ (so called, because the edited signal contains contributions from co-edited macromolecules as well as GABA) , water-suppressed GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS spectra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] were acquired (repetition time = 2000 ms; echo time = 68 ms; 1024 sample points at a spectral width of 2 kHz, as detailed in Sanaei Nezhad, Anton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The acquisition for the dlPFC MRS took approximately 7 minutes, with 96 averages, while the occipital voxel MRS took about 3 minutes, with 32 averages. The number of averages was adjusted to ensure comparable spectral quality between the DLPFC and OCC.

To maximise signal-to-noise (SNR), we utilised a dual-echo fMRI protocol developed by Halai, Welbourne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The fMRI sequence included 36 slices, 64×64 matrix, field of view (FOV) 224×126×224 mm, in-plane resolution 2.5×2.5 mm, slice thickness 3.5 mm, TR=2.5 s, TE = 12 ms and 35 ms.

In addition, during selection of VOIs we considered regions affected by working memory in this dataset. To identify these regions, first-level mass univariate analysis using the General Linear Model based on the canonical haemodynamic response function. A high-pass filter with a cut-off at 128 seconds was applied to remove slow signal drifts. An autoregressive model of order 1 was fitted to estimate and remove serial correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The outlier volume censoring regressors and 6 motion parameters were included as covariates. An F-contrast for the main effect of the N-back task and a t-contrast for the effect of working memory (2-back &gt; 0-back) were defined. Finally, to discover the regions that show effect of working memory, we performed four separate group-level analysis for pre-atDCS, post-atDCS, pre-sham and post-sham sessions. Age and sex were input as covariates.</p><p id="P14">Eight VOIs were defined as spheres with 6mm radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

The first eigenvariate of the timeseries of all voxels in each VOI was extracted and adjusted by F-contrast for main effects (removing effects of motion and global signal artefacts).

Average connectivity refers to the average connections between brain regions, independent of task conditions. Modulatory connectivity refers to the impact of experimental inputs on connectivity between regions. The off-diagonal elements of the A-matrix represent the average extrinsic (inter-regional) connection strengths, and the diagonal elements represent the intrinsic (intra-region) inhibitory connection strengths.

This model included the mean connectivity, main effect of session, main effect of stimulation type and interaction between session and stimulation type, as well as estimating the between-subject variability. A Bayesian model comparison (BMC) approach was then used to test the hypothesis that interaction between session and stimulation type would manifest in intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity from dlPFC. To do this a model space was constructed by sequentially “switching off” the intrinsic and extrinsic connections originating from dlPFC, producing a total of 16 DCMs. Model comparison between all DCMs in the model space was then carried out based on their model evidences, which were calculated using Bayesian Model Reduction (BMR)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].

The key finding of this work was that administration of atDCS to dlPFC resulted with reduced connectivity between itself and frontal lobes, coupled with increased connectivity to subcortical structures. This suggests a shift in the functional dynamics of the brain regions involved in working memory and attention. We also discovered neurochemical associations with these changes in the form of an association between GABA+ and sensitivity of left dlPFC to inputs, where reduced self-connectivity of this region was associated with lower GABA+. However, connectivity parameters of dlPFC showed no association with performance on an N-back task. This work offers novel insight to complex interactions between neurostimulation, neural connectivity, and neurochemical processes in the brain. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the left dlPFC in cognitive control functions and open new avenues for research in NIBS and its clinical applications.</p><p id="P26">This work supplements Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] with novel analysis of effective connectivity changes associated with administration of sham and anodal atDCS. Here, we uncovered the effects of administration of atDCS that persisted during the post-atDCS session. Specifically, we found reduced the average connectivity from left dlPFC to left SFG and increased connectivity from left dlPFC to left globus pallidus. This finding likely reflects changes to the neural substrates of cognitive processing conducted during N-back task performance. The left frontal regions are implicated in executive control processes through inhibitory control of responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], anticipatory attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], maintenance of working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], and goal-directed behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Importantly, the left frontal regions have widely been related to error monitoring, interference resolution and selection during retrieval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], particularly but not only in the verbal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Therefore, atDCS has likely enhanced excitatory signalling of top-down control and interference resolution of competing stimuli from dlPFC to globus pallidus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Overall, this may result with increased stimulus filtering of relevant stimuli prior to relay of stimuli to working memory processes conducted within the parietal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], or prior to relay of appropriate motor response selection to the sensorimotor cortices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. This is an important finding for the NF1 population, because many NF1 patients suffer from increased distractibility and decreased filtering of irrelevant information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], and as many as 50% of individuals with NF1 receive comorbid diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder that is characterised by difficulty in information filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Therefore, the findings suggest that atDCS could potentially serve as a therapeutic tool to address inattention-related symptoms by enhancing the brain’s ability to filter information and improve attentional control. Overall, understanding the effects of these effective connectivity changes on control processes offers important future directions for NIBS research in NF1. Specifically, investigating the specific aspects of cognitive control (e.g., stimulus monitoring, stimulus filtering, sustained attention, selection of motor responses) and specific parameters of atDCS (e.g., intensity, duration, frequency) that yield optimal cognitive benefits for patients could refine treatment protocols.</p><p id="P27">Further, Garg, Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] demonstrated that application of atDCS was associated with reduction of GABA+. Here we additionally found that lower inhibitory intrinsic connectivity of left dlPFC was associated with less GABA+ post-atDCS, which indicates an increased dlPFC’s excitability during the N-back task post-atDCS. This result suggests that by reducing GABA+, atDCS might make dlPFC more sensitive and responsive to external stimulation. This can affect how the dlPFC processes information, potentially enhancing its ability to engage in working memory performance, attention control, and cognitive flexibility the N-back task. Future research should explore this by investigating how atDCS impacts how regulation of intrinsic connectivity during tasks is related to GABA+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and its ratio to glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].</p><p id="P28">This study faces several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, DCM BMR did not allow us to test whether the interaction between session and stimulation would be seen in the average intrinsic connectivity of left dlPFC. Instead, DCM BMR always includes all intrinsic connections in the average connectivity. Therefore, we only formally explored the nested models of the effects of atDCS on extrinsic connectivity from left dlPFC. Further, our study is limited by a lack of extensive analysis of psychometrics of attentional capacities in this sample. Therefore, our proposed association between changes to top-down attentional control processes and changes in connectivity and behaviour from pre-atDCS to post-atDCS is speculative. Complementary attentional and linguistic mechanisms in NF1 must continue to be explored to understand the effects of atDCS. We cannot comment on the reliability of long-term effects of atDCS stimulation, and the effects we observed here may be transient. It will also be useful to understand how stimulation of basal ganglia, achieved with other electrode configurations, may impact subcortical signalling during working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P29">In summary, this study revealed that atDCS decreased average excitatory connectivity from the left dlPFC to the left SFG and increased connectivity to the left globus pallidus in adolescents with NF1. We suggest that these changes likely reflect enhanced top-down control and filtering of relevant information. Future research should further explore the relationship between attentional processes and neural connectivity in NF1, as well as the long-term effects of atDCS. This study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying atDCS effects and highlights potential avenues for improving cognitive interventions in NF1 patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material - 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199534-supplement-Supplementary_Material___4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d122aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Materials 1-3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199534-supplement-Supplementary_Materials_1_3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d122aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR203308).
