Therefore, nature has evolved several autonomous mechanisms to regulate protein expression such as transcription, translation, post-translational modifications and epigenetic changes. These processes are typically controlled by distinct molecular players with no overlapping roles. Here, we reveal that same transcription factor, NFAT2 regulates both transcription and lysosomal degradation of Orai3 oncochannel in a context dependent manner. We demonstrate that NFAT2 drives Orai3 transcription and thereby increases Orai3 levels in non-metastatic cancerous cells. While in invasive and metastatic cancerous cells, NFAT2 induces Orai3 lysosomal degradation by transcriptionally enhancing the levels of MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our biochemical and super-resolution microscopy data show that MARCH8 physically interacts with Orai3 eventually resulting in its degradation. Mechanistically, the dichotomy in regulation of Orai3 expression emerges from the differences in the epigenetic landscape of MARCH8. We uncover that the MARCH8 promoter is highly methylated in non-metastatic cancerous cells and hence NFAT2 does not induce MARCH8 mediated Orai3 degradation in these cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that MARCH8 restricts pancreatic cancer metastasis by targeting Orai3 degradation thereby highlighting pathophysiological importance of this signaling module. Taken together, we report a unique and clinically relevant scenario wherein nature has commissioned the same transcription factor to both enhance and curtail the expression of a target protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F11" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS202005-f011"/></fig>

The regulation of proteins in the cell is a complex process involving various mechanisms that control when and how proteins are synthesized, modified, localized, and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ross et al., 2021</xref>). At the transcriptional level, gene expression regulates the amount of mRNA produced, while alternative splicing can lead to diverse protein variants. Post-transcriptionally, mRNA stability and translation are controlled by microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Once synthesized, proteins can undergo numerous post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which alter their activity, stability, and interactions. To prevent accumulation of damaged or excessive proteins, cells employ mechanisms like proteasome/lysosomal-mediated degradation and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ross et al., 2021</xref>). Normally, each regulatory process for a single target protein is orchestrated by distinct molecular players with no intermingling effects on other mechanisms. The components involved in a specific protein regulatory process are typically limited to that process alone. These regulatory mechanisms work together to ensure precise spatio-temporal control over cellular functions and responses. But in pathophysiological conditions like cancer, proteome imbalance is a prominent feature due to alterations in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the deadliest forms of cancer as it is highly metastatic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fitzmaurice et al., 2019</xref>). The 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is around 13%, which is amongst the lowest. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling plays a key role in regulating the oncogenesis and metastasis in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tanwar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Vashisht et al., 2015</xref>). However, functional relevance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis is poorly understood. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway is a ubiquitous process for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cells. It is a process that starts with depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the endoplasmic reticulum and results in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across the plasma membrane. ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors STIM1/STIM2 sense the depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, oligomerize and move towards ER-plasma membrane junctions. STIM proteins physically interact with calcium-activated calcium release (CRAC) channels i.e Orai channels in the plasma membrane. This association activates Orai channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lopez et al., 2020</xref>). Dysregulation in Orai channels in particular Orai3 expression and function is associated with various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chalmers &amp; Monteith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tanwar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Vashisht et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating Orai3 expression, stability and degradation remain largely unappreciated.</p><p id="P5">An earlier study from our group demonstrated that Orai3 forms a functional SOCE channel in pancreatic cancer cells and regulates key hallmarks of oncogenesis. Further, we demonstrated that Orai3 is transcriptionally upregulated in human pancreatic tumor samples as compared to normal patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>). Pancreatic cancerous cells have higher Orai3 mRNA expression than normal cells, but what drives Orai3 transcriptional upregulation remains unappreciated. In addition to transcriptional regulation, protein degradation plays an essential role in regulating protein levels. Nevertheless, Orai3 degradation process remains completely unexplored. Gaining insight into the mechanisms that drive Orai3 protein degradation can aid in developing treatments for the diseases associated with aberrant Orai3 expression particularly pancreatic, breast, lung and prostate cancers.</p><p id="P6">Here, using unbiased and robust bioinformatic analysis, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NFAT2 transcription factor has putative binding sites on the Orai3 promoter. Interestingly, NFAT2 gain of function and loss of function studies revealed a dichotomy in the regulation of Orai3 by NFAT2 in non-metastatic versus invasive and metastatic cells. Our data demonstrates that NFAT2 positively regulates Orai3 transcription in non-metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. Hence, it generates a positive feedforward loop wherein a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive transcription factor drives transcription of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. Surprisingly, NFAT2 acts as a bimodal regulator in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells by inducing both Orai3 transcription and Orai3 protein degradation. Further, we show that downstream of NFAT2, MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates and degrades Orai3 via the lysosomal pathway. Mechanistically, NFAT2 transcriptionally regulates MARCH8 in pancreatic cancer cells depending on the epigenetic profile of the MARCH8 promoter. We reveal that the MARCH8 promoter is hypomethylated in invasive and metastatic pancreatic cancer cells compared to non-metastatic cells. Therefore, NFAT2 stimulates MARCH8 transcription in non-metastatic cells and thereby mediates Orai3 protein degradation. Finally, we establish that MARCH8 acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> migration assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish xenograft experiments show that MARCH8 negatively regulates metastasis. To summarize, we reveal that same transcription factor controls both mRNA transcription and protein degradation of the identical target. Further, we have identified and characterized MARCH8 as an important regulator of Orai3 driven pancreatic cancer metastasis. Importantly, the dichotomy in Orai3 regulation highlights an intricate pathway in pancreatic cancer cells that can control disease outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NFAT2 binds on the Orai3 promoter and regulates Orai3 expression</title><p id="P7">To delineate the transcriptional regulation of Orai3, we carried out extensive bioinformatics analysis of human Orai3 promoter through three independent tools: Eukaryotic promoter database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Perier, 2000</xref>), PSCAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zambelli et al., 2009</xref>), and Contra_V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kreft et al., 2017</xref>). PSCAN was utilized to identify all potential transcription factor binding sites within the Orai3 promoter. PSCAN leverage the JASPAR Core 2020 transcription factor position weight matrix database. The analysis revealed that the NFAT family of transcription factors has potential binding sites on the Orai3 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate this observation, the Orai3 promoter was analyzed for NFATc-binding sites using the EPD-Search Motif Tool, applying a stringent p-value cut-off of p = 0.01. Moreover, we assessed the sequence of the Orai3 promoter for NFATc-binding sites using Contra_V3 with a similarity matrix value = 0.75 and core value = 0.90. All three tools, each using different algorithm, consistently identified three NFATc binding sites on the Orai3 promoter. The three NFATc binding sites were present at -920bp, -990bp, and -1017bp before the transcription start site. Furthermore, the multi-species alignment of the Orai3 promoter showed that these binding sites were conserved across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Thus, our robust bioinformatics analysis suggests that NFAT transcription factors may transcriptionally regulate Orai3.</p><p id="P8">The NFAT family of transcription factors has four Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive members: NFAT1, 2, 3, and 4 (Müller &amp; Rao, 2010). To identify which isoforms of NFAT regulate Orai3, we performed overexpression studies of the four isoforms of NFAT in HEK-293T cell line. We found that only NFAT2 significantly upregulates Orai3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Further, NFAT2 overexpression increased Orai3 mRNA levels compared to empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). To investigate the association of NFAT2 and Orai3 levels in pancreatic tissue, we carried out expression analysis of NFAT2 and Orai3 using the “GEPIA” (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Tang et al., 2017</xref>) and observed a positive correlation between NFAT2 and Orai3 mRNA expression in pancreatic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To corroborate the bioinformatic analysis, we performed dual luciferase assays. Orai3 promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, and dual luciferase assays were performed with NFAT2 overexpression in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. The results showed an increase in relative luciferase activity with NFAT2 overexpression compared to the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>) suggesting that NFAT2 positively regulates Orai3 expression. To determine if NFAT2 physically binds to the Orai3 promoter, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in PANC-1 cells either overexpressing eGFPC1-NFAT2 or an empty vector control (pEGFP-C1). The immunoprecipitated cross-linked sonicated DNA was amplified using human Orai3 promoter-specific primers. The ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that the Orai3 promoter with putative NFAT2 binding sites was highly enriched compared to mock IP samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>) thereby confirming physical binding of NFAT2 on Orai3 promoter. Collectively, the ChIP and dual luciferase assays provide substantial evidence for the binding of NFAT2 on the Orai3 promoter.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NFAT2 overexpression dichotomously regulates Orai3 in non-metastatic v/s metastatic pancreatic cancer cells</title><p id="P10">To delineate the role of NFAT2 in regulating Orai3 expression and function, we chose three human pancreatic cancer cell lines: MiaPaCa-2 (non-metastatic), PANC-1 (invasive), and CFPAC-1 (metastatic). NFAT2 overexpression in these cell lines showed significant upregulation of Orai3 at mRNA level compared to empty vector control in non-metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). However, at the protein level, we observed a dichotomy in Orai3 regulation by NFAT2. In non-metastatic cells, NFAT2 overexpression led to an increase in Orai3 at the protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Surprisingly, NFAT2 overexpression in invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G, H</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L, M</xref>) led to a decrease in Orai3 protein levels compared to the control. This suggests that some sort of negative feedback loop is functional in invasive and metastatic cells. It appears that in these cells, NFAT2 apart from transcriptionally regulating Orai3, initiates a protein degradation cascade.</p><p id="P11">To further corroborate the dichotomous role of NFAT2 on Orai3, we examined Orai3 function upon NFAT2 overexpression in the three cell types. For this, we performed live-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with FURA-2AM dye, a ratio-metric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator. We utilized 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB), a pharmacological agent that can differentiate between functional Orai1 and Orai3 channels. It is widely recognized that 2APB, at concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 μM, inhibits Orai1 channels but activates Orai3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>; Motiani et al., 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vashisht et al., 2018</xref>). We utilized standard thapsigargin activated SOCE protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Tanwar et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">2024</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies showed that in non-metastatic cells, NFAT2 overexpression led to an increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, B</xref>), augmentation in SOCE activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, C</xref>) and higher 2APB potentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, D</xref>) compared to empty vector control. This data correlates with the protein data that NFAT2 overexpression upregulates Orai3 at protein level in non-metastatic cells. As reported earlier (Motiani et al., 2010), 2APB is an efficient tool to observe functional activity of Orai3, we did calcium imaging in HBSS-Ca buffer with 2APB addition alone. We observed that in non-metastatic cells, NFAT2 overexpression leads to higher 2APB-induced Orai3 potentiation compared to empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). This data correlates with both standard thapsigargin activated SOCE protocol calcium imaging and the Orai3 protein data that NFAT2 overexpression results in augmented Orai3 protein levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). However, in invasive and metastatic cells, NFAT2 overexpression results in lower 2APB-induced Orai3 potentiation compared to empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I, J, N, O</xref>). This functional analysis of Orai3 is in line with the protein data that NFAT2 overexpression downregulates Orai3 protein expression in invasive and metastatic cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with both standard thapsigargin activated SOCE protocol and 2APB potentiation replicated the same result. Therefore, for further imaging experiments, we continued with 2APB potentiation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Competitive inhibition of NFAT validates dichotomous regulation of Orai3 in non-metastatic v/s metastatic PC cells</title><p id="P12">Overexpression of NFAT2 in PC cells indicated a bimodal regulation of Orai3 by NFAT2. To corroborate these findings, we inhibited NFAT activity with VIVIT. VIVIT is a small peptide that inhibits NFAT translocation to the nucleus by competing with NFATc for the calcineurin binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Aramburu et al., 1999</xref>). VIVIT peptide shows 25 times higher affinity for calcineurin binding and prevents calcineurin-facilitated NFAT dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Aramburu et al., 1999</xref>). Surprisingly, transfection of non-metastatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>) with VIVIT showed an increase in Orai3 at mRNA compared to empty vector control. One possible explanation for the increase in Orai3 mRNA by inhibiting NFAT in non-metastatic, invasive, and metastatic cells could be that other endogenous transcription factors are activated and they drive Orai3 transcription in this condition. To test this possibility, we performed luciferase assay in VIVIT transfected PANC-1 cells and observed an increase in relative luciferase activity in VIVIT transfected cells compared to empty vector control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). This indicates that inhibition of NFAT dephosphorylation activates other endogenous transcription factors to bind on Orai3 promoter and upregulate Orai3 transcription.</p><p id="P13">Excitingly, NFAT2 inhibition by VIVIT resulted in a decrease in Orai3 protein expression in non-metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>) and an increase in Orai3 protein levels in invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G, H</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L, M</xref>). This Orai3 protein data upon NFAT2 inhibition is in line with NFAT2 overexpression data. Collectively, the dichotomy in the regulation of Orai3 protein levels remains consistent in both NFAT2 gain of function and loss of function studies. Next, we performed standard thapsigargin activated SOCE protocol Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in VIVIT-transfected non-metastatic and invasive cells. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data revealed that inhibition of NFAT activity caused decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> Release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B, C</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B, D</xref>) and 2APB potentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B, E</xref>) in non-metastatic cells. This allied with the protein data in non-metastatic cells. Thus, NFAT inhibition decrease Orai3 activity in non-metastatic cells. Using 2APB mediated Orai3 potentiation protocol, we observed that inhibition of NFAT activity caused a decrease in 2APB-induced Orai3 potentiation in non-metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). While in invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I, J</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3N, O</xref>), NFAT inhibition caused an increase in 2APB-induced Orai3 potentiation. Taken together, NFAT2 overexpression and inhibition data establishes the divergent control of NFAT2 over Orai3 protein expression and activity in non-metastatic v/s invasive and metastatic cells.</p><p id="P14">Since VIVIT inhibits transcriptional activity of all NFAT isoforms, we next validated the specificity of NFAT2 in the dichotomous regulation of Orai3. We performed siRNA mediated NFAT2 knockdown in pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1 and CFPAC-1). We observed a robust decrease in the NFAT2 mRNA levels in all the cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F, G, H</xref>). Next, we checked Orai3 mRNA and protein levels upon NFAT2 knockdown in these cells. Similar to VIVIT transfection, we observed an increase in Orai3 mRNA levels upon NFAT2 knockdown in MiaPaCa-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2I</xref>), PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2N</xref>) and CFPAC-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2S</xref>). On the other hand, NFAT2 knockdown decreases Orai3 protein levels and functional activity in MiaPaCa-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2J, K, L, M</xref>) while Orai3 protein levels and functional activity increases upon NFAT2 silencing in PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2O, P, Q, R</xref>) and CFPAC-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2T, U, V, W</xref>). Therefore, both siRNA mediated NFAT2 knockdown and competitive inhibition of NFAT display the dichotomous regulation of Orai3 in non-metastatic v/s metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. Since NFAT2 siRNA and VIVIT gave same results, we proceeded with VIVIT for further NFAT2 loss of function studies.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MARCH8 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase degrades Orai3</title><p id="P15">NFAT2 overexpression and inhibition studies in invasive and metastatic PC cell lines suggests involvement of Orai3 protein degradation in regulating Orai3 protein expression and activity. However, to best of our knowledge, the Orai3 protein degradation machinery is unknown. Therefore, we started investigating Orai3 protein degradation mechanism. First of all, to determine whether NFAT2-induced Orai3 protein degradation occurs via proteasomal or lysosomal pathway, we treated the NFAT2 overexpressed cells with either MG132 or bafilomycin A1. MG132 inhibits the proteasomal degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lee &amp; Goldberg, 1998</xref>), while bafilomycin A1 blocks the lysosomal degradation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Tapper &amp; Sundler, 1995</xref>). We observed that treatment of bafilomycin A1 for 6hr in NFAT2 overexpressed invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>) inhibited Orai3 degradation by NFAT2 compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, treatment of MG132 for 6hr in NFAT2 overexpressed invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>) did not inhibit Orai3 degradation by NFAT2. This indicates that NFAT2 induces Orai3 degradation via lysosomal ubiquitination pathway in invasive and metastatic PC cells.</p><p id="P16">As ubiquitination of proteins is mainly carried out by E3 ubiquitin ligases, we next started identifying the putative E3 ubiquitin ligases that target Orai3. We utilized well established bioinformatics tool (UbiBrowser) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">X. Wang et al., 2022</xref>) to predict potential Orai3 E3 ubiquitin ligases. We only got 4 putative hits through this analysis. Interestingly, all the 4 predicted E3 ubiquitin ligases belong to the MARCH (Membrane-associated RING-CH-type) family of membrane bound E3 ubiquitin ligases i.e. MARCH1, MARCH3, MARCH8 and MARCH11.</p><p id="P17">Since Orai3 is a plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, its ubiquitination by membrane bound E3 ubiquitin ligases appears logical. MARCH family are a subset of RING domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have specific transmembrane domains allowing them to be tethered to the plasma membrane or membranes of other organelles. We next evaluated the subcellular localization of the 4 predicted E3 ubiquitin ligases. Intriguingly, only MARCH3 and 8 have been reported to be localized at the plasma membrane (Lin et al., 2019) while MARCH1 and MARCH11 are localized to endo-lysosomes. In light of this analysis, we then focused our attention on MARCH3 and MARCH8. Since we observed Orai3 lysosomal degradation downstream of NFAT2, we examined the presence of potential NFAT2 binding sites on the MARCH3 and MARCH8 promoters. Interestingly, we found that the promoters of both MARCH3 and MARCH8 have NFAT2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). As Orai3 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissue and is associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>) we next analyzed the expression of MARCH3 and MARCH8 in pancreatic cancer samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B, C</xref>). Further, we examined association of MARCH3 and MARCH8 with pancreatic cancer patient survival using OncoLnc database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anaya, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we found that MARCH8 but not MARCH3 is associated with favorable prognosis in pancreatic cancer tissue wherein higher MARCH8 expression correlated with better patient survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D, E</xref>). Additionally, MARCH8 is reported to have anti-oncogenic effects in breast and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">W. Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Qian et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, MARCH8 promotes lysosomal degradation of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">W. Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, this robust and extensive bioinformatics analysis suggested that MARCH8 could be the E3 ubiquitin ligase that bridges NFAT2 and Orai3 protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, we decided to examine the role of MARCH8 in Orai3 degradation downstream of NFAT2.</p><p id="P18">To study the effect of MARCH8 on Orai3 protein levels, we overexpressed MARCH8 (WT) and inactive MARCH8 (CS) mutant in MiaPaCa-2 (non- metastatic), PANC-1 (invasive) and CFPAC-1 (metastatic) cells. The MARCH8 (CS) mutant is inactive as all the cysteine residues (Cys80, 83, 97, 99, 110, 123, and 126) are substituted with serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>). The overexpression of MARCH8 leads to decrease in Orai3 protein levels in non-metastatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F, G</xref>), invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J, K</xref>), and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N, O</xref>) while overexpression of MARCH8 (CS) mutant did not alter Orai3 protein levels in these cells. Next, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging upon MARCH8 (WT) and MARCH8 (CS) overexpression in MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and CFPAC-1 cells showed decrease in 2APB induced Orai3 potentiation upon MARCH8 (WT) overexpression but no significant change in 2APB induced Orai3 potentiation upon MARCH8 (CS) overexpression in non-metastatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H, I</xref>), invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4L, M</xref>), and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4P, Q</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data further substantiated the Orai3 protein data. Taken together, this demonstrates that overexpression of functional MARCH8 leads to decrease in Orai3 expression and subsequent activity.</p><p id="P19">To further validate the role of MARCH8 in regulating Orai3 expression, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCH8.

Hence, the Orai3 protein levels and activity is exactly opposite to the MARCH8 expression. Collectively, MARCH8 gain of function, overexpression of inactive MARCH8 and MARCH8 loss of function studies reveal that MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a critical regulator of Orai3 protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MARCH8 physically interacts with Orai3 and induces its ubiquitination</title><p id="P20">MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates its target protein at its lysine residues, which leads to target degradation.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, the immunoprecipitated Orai3 shows ubiquitination. Next, we investigated the role of MARCH8 in Orai3 ubiquitination. We overexpressed MARCH8 in bafilomycin-A1 treated PANC-1 cells and performed Orai3 immunoprecipitation. The western blot analysis shows that MARCH8 overexpression increases Orai3 ubiquitination compared to the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This data suggests that MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates Orai3. To study the interaction of MARCH8 and Orai3, we performed immunofluorescence assays and found that Orai3 and MARCH8 colocalize in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). Further, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays and observed that MARCH8 and Orai3 interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).

After identifying that the MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates Orai3, leading to its lysosomal degradation, one key question still remains: Does NFAT2 regulate MARCH8 levels, thereby driving Orai3 degradation in PC cells? To answer this question, we again utilized the bioinformatic tools to examine human MARCH8 promoter. The bioinformatic analysis with different algorithms and TF position weight matrix combinations showed one NFAT2 binding site on MARCH8 promoter, which is present at -256bp before the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Further, the multi-species alignment of the MARCH8 promoter highlighted that this binding site is conserved across multiple mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, expression analysis of NFAT2 and MARCH8 using the database “GEPIA” showed a positive correlation between NFAT2 and MARCH8 mRNA expression in pancreatic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). To validate the bioinformatic findings, we conducted dual luciferase assays in which the human MARCH8 promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. These assays were performed in PANC-1 cells with NFAT2 overexpression. We observed an increase in relative luciferase activity upon NFAT2 overexpression in comparison to the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). We next carried out Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to examine NFAT2 binding on the MARCH8 promoter. We overexpressed either EGFP-C1-NFAT2 or the empty vector control (pEGFP-C1) for ChIP assays. The cross-linked and sonicated DNA was immunoprecipitated and amplified using human MARCH8 promoter-specific primers. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed a significant enrichment of the MARCH8 promoter with potential NFAT2 binding site compared to mock IP samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Collectively, the findings from the ChIP and dual luciferase assays clearly demonstrate that NFAT2 binds to the MARCH8 promoter.</p><p id="P23">To delineate the role of NFAT2 in regulating MARCH8 in PC cells, we performed NFAT2 overexpression and VIVIT transfection studies in MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and CFPAC-1 cell lines. qRT-PCR analysis showed that overexpression of NFAT2 in MiaPaCa-2 (non-metastatic) decreased MARCH8 mRNA levels compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). While NFAT2 overexpression increased MARCH8 mRNA levels in invasive PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7K</xref>) and metastatic CFPAC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7Q</xref>). Likewise, western blot analysis showed the same trend; NFAT2 overexpression decreases Orai3 protein levels in MiaPaCa-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F, G</xref>) while it increased Orai3 protein expression in PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7L, M</xref>) and CFPAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7R, S</xref>). Next, we performed qRT-PCR analysis upon VIVIT transfection in MiaPaCa-2 and observed an increase in MARCH8 mRNA levels compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). However, VIVIT transfection decreased MARCH8 mRNA levels in PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7N</xref>) and CFPAC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7T</xref>). Similarly, western blot analysis demonstrated the same trend i.e. VIVIT transfection increases Orai3 protein levels in MiaPaCa-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I, J</xref>) while it decreases Orai3 protein levels in PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7O, P</xref>) and CFPAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7U, V</xref>). Taken together, these data establish NFAT2 as a repressor of MARCH8 transcription in non-metastatic cells and as an activator in invasive and metastatic PC cells.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Epigenetic landscape of MARCH8 promoter dictates NFAT2-driven Orai3 regulation in non-metastatic v/s metastatic PC cells</title><p id="P24">If a transcription factor regulates its target gene differently across distinct cells, it could be because of differences in the epigenetic modifications in promoter region of the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gibney &amp; Nolan, 2010</xref>). One of the most common epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation, and changes in the methylation profile especially in the promoter region leads to differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lakshminarasimhan &amp; Liang, 2016</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the potential contribution of DNA methylation in NFAT2’s dichotomous role in regulating MARCH8 transcription. To check whether the MARCH8 gene promoter is methylated, we used the DNMIVD database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Ding et al., 2020</xref>) and found that the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in pancreatic tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Consequently, the expression of MARCH8 is lesser in pancreatic tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). Hence, the expression profile of MARCH8 and the methylation status of the MARCH8 promoter are inversely correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Further, we looked for CpG islands in MARCH8 promoter using Methprimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li &amp; Dahiya, 2002</xref>) and UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Karolchik et al., 2009</xref>) and found one CpG island extending from -108 bp to +483 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Collectively, bioinformatic analysis suggests that the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in pancreatic cancer and regulates its expression.</p><p id="P25">To corroborate the lead from the bioinformatic analysis, we treated MiaPaCa-2 cells with DNA methylation inhibitor, decitabine. Decitabine (5-Aza-2′-Deoxycytidine) is a deoxycytidine analog that integrates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity, thereby preventing DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Jones &amp; Taylor, 1980</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis shows that decitabine treatment in MiaPaCa-2 for 72hr significantly increases MARCH8 mRNA levels compared to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). We next examined the methylation status of the MARCH8 promoter in non-metastatic, invasive, and metastatic cells. We performed MeDIP (Methyl DNA immunoprecipitation) using antibodies against 5-methylcytosine. We observed that the methylated MARCH8 promoter was highly enriched in MiaPaCa-2 compared to PANC-1 and CFPAC-1, suggesting that the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in non-metastatic cells compared to invasive and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). Finally, to investigate whether DNA methylation prevents NFAT2 from regulating MARCH8 in non-metastatic cells, we overexpressed NFAT2 in decitabine-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells. We found that MARCH8 protein levels increased compared to both vehicle control and empty vector control plus decitabine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8G, H</xref>). Consequently, due to an increase in MARCH8 levels, Orai3 protein levels decreased in NFAT2 overexpressed decitabine-treated cells compared to both vehicle control and empty vector control plus decitabine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8G, I</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrates that the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in non-metastatic cells and thereby NFAT2 does not upregulate MARCH8 in these cells. This in turn prevents NFAT2-induced Orai3 degradation, which is observed in invasive and metastatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase abrogates pancreatic cancer metastasis</title><p id="P26">Our study has identified MARCH8 as a critical regulator of Orai3, which drives PC metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>). Although MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase has been studied in some cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">W.

Wang et al., 2022</xref>), its role in PC remains largely unappreciated. Therefore, we examined the relationship between elevated MARCH8 expression and the survival time of PC patients using data from the ‘OncoLnc’ database. This analysis revealed that the patients with low MARCH8 expression survived for a shorter duration as compared to patients with high MARCH8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). This highlights that higher MARCH8 levels are associated with better prognosis in PC patients. It further suggests that MARCH8 could play a role in PC progression, and metastasis that eventually leads to mortality. To investigate MARCH8’s role in PC progression and metastasis, we generated stable CFPAC-1 cell lines using lentiviral transduction, expressing either a non-targeting control shRNA (shNT) or an shRNA specifically targeting MARCH8 (shMARCH8). Western blot analysis confirmed a marked reduction in MARCH8 protein levels in CFPAC-1 shMARCH8 cells compared to the shNT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B, C</xref>). After confirming the knockdown, we performed scratch wound assays to explore the role of MARCH8 in CFPAC-1 cell migration. Cell migration post-scratch was monitored by assessing wound closure temporally. The results showed that CFPAC-1 shMARCH8 cells closed the wound more effectively than shNT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9D</xref>), shMARCH8 cells closed 50% of the wound within 24 hours, while shNT cells closed less than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9E</xref>). This demonstrates the involvement of MARCH8 in regulating pancreatic cancer cell migration. Finally, to examine the role of MARCH8 in PC metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we carried out zebrafish xenograft experiments by injecting stable CFPAC-1 cells into the peri-vitelline space (PVS) of 2-day post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9F</xref>) and monitored metastatic events three hours post-injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Martinez-Lopez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">White &amp; Patton, 2023</xref>).

Altogether, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data highlights that MARCH8 acts a negative regulator of PC metastasis.</p><p id="P27">To summarize, in this study we have identified that the same transcription factor regulates Orai3 transcription and protein degradation. Firstly, we report that NFAT2 binds to Orai3 promoter and controls its transcription in non-metastatic, invasive and metastatic PC cells. But additionally, NFAT2 activates Orai3 lysosomal degradation system facilitated by MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase in invasive and metastatic PC cells. Through gain of function and loss of function experiments, along with bio-chemical and high-resolution imaging studies, we establish that MARCH8 ubiquitinates and subsequently degrades Orai3. Notably, we show that epigenetic differences in the MARCH8 promoter allow NFAT2 to regulate MARCH8 transcription and promote Orai3 protein degradation in invasive and metastatic cells, while this mechanism is absent in non-metastatic cells. In non-metastatic PC cells, the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated and hence hinders NFAT2 guided transcription while in invasive and metastatic PC cells, MARCH8 promoter is relatively hypomethylated. Furthermore, we report a critical role of MARCH8 in PC metastasis, as our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings suggest that MARCH8 restricts PC metastasis.

A previous study from our group revealed a critical role of Orai3 channel in regulating pancreatic cancer development and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reported that Orai3 is transcriptionally upregulated in pancreatic tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic samples. The upregulation of Orai3 is well-documented in other types of cancers as well but the molecular players and signaling modules driving Orai3 regulation are still unknown. In this study we discovered that NFAT2 regulates Orai3 expression. NFAT2 belongs to NFATc group of transcription factors. Interestingly, four isoforms of NFATc i.e. NFAT1, 2, 3 and 4 are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive and are activated upon increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Müller &amp; Rao, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Tanwar et al., 2024</xref>). Using <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis we found potential binding sites of NFATc on the Orai3 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we shortlisted NFAT2 as it significantly upregulates Orai3 at both mRNA and protein levels in HEK-293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>) and GEPIA database showed positive correlation of NFAT2 and Orai3 mRNA in pancreatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Interestingly, the NFAT2 overexpression and NFAT inhibition studies in pancreatic cancer cell lines showed a surprising dichotomy in regulation of Orai3 by NFAT2 in non-metastatic v/s invasive and metastatic cells We observed that in invasive and metastatic cells like PANC-1 and CFPAC-1, NFAT2 acts as bimodal regulator to maintain Orai3 levels as NFAT2 overexpression leads to decrease in Orai3 at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G, K, L</xref>). This negative feedback loop in invasive and metastatic cells could be because invasive and metastatic cells have higher endogenous Orai3 levels compared to non-metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>). A further increase in Orai3 levels by NFAT2 would allow excess amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering into the cell which could lead to apoptosis. While in non-metastatic cells like MiaPaCa-2, NFAT2 transcriptionally upregulates Orai3, leading to increase in Orai3 at protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Therefore, our data demonstrates that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive transcription factor induces transcription of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel thereby indicating presence of a positive feedback loop in these cells. However, further studies are required to decipher the source of rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling toolkit involved in increasing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels for activating NFAT2.</p><p id="P30">Another interesting observation from our study is that inhibition of NFAT activity by VIVIT leads to transcriptional upregulation of Orai3 in non-metastatic, invasive and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, F, K</xref>). We performed luciferase assay in VIVIT transfected PANC1 cells and observed increase in relative luciferase activity in VIVIT transfected cells compared to empty vector control. This indicates that inhibition of NFAT’s activity by VIVIT peptide activates or allows other endogenous transcription factors to bind on Orai3 promoter and upregulate Orai3 transcription. Nonetheless, our data elegantly demonstrates that NFAT is a critical regulator of both Orai3 transcription and degradation.</p><p id="P31">It is important to highlight that just like transcriptional regulation, Orai3’s protein degradation process is not appreciated yet. The bimodal regulation of Orai3 by NFAT2 in invasive and metastatic pancreatic cancer cells led to characterization of Orai3 protein degradation machinery. Using lysosomal and proteasomal degradation inhibitors, we observed that NFAT2 induces lysosomal degradation of Orai3 in both invasive and metastatic pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B, C, D</xref>). Orai3 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, and most PM proteins are degraded in lysosomes, although the mechanism and the players involved in the degradation process are different. Typically, the PM target proteins are ubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligases and are then delivered to the late endosomes/multivesicular body (MVB) via endocytosis. The endosomes containing ubiquitinated PM proteins eventually fuse with lysosomes and are finally degraded by lysosomal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Our unbiased and robust bioinformatics narrowed down to MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a potential regulator of Orai3 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Indeed, MARCH8 overexpression and knockdown experiments show that MARCH8 induces Orai3 degradation in non-metastatic, invasive, and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Mechanistically, MARCH8 ubiquitinates Orai3 and induces lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further, by performing co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assay, we showed that MARCH8 and Orai3 physically interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, D, E</xref>). This data established that MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase physically interacts with Orai3 at plasma membrane and induces lysosomal degradation.</p><p id="P32">Next, we investigated whether NFAT2 transcriptionally regulates MARCH8 and thereby induces Orai3 protein degradation. To examine this, we did <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis and found that NFAT2 has one potential binding site on human MARCH8 promoter, which is conserved across mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Further, NFAT2 overexpression and VIVIT transfection studies in non-metastatic, invasive and metastatic PC cells establish that NFAT2 acts as a repressor in non-metastatic cells while acting as an activator in invasive and metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This clearly explains that the NFAT2 induced Orai3 protein degradation in invasive and metastatic cells is due to increase in MARCH8 expression. Similarly, decrease in Orai3 protein levels in non-metastatic cells upon NFAT inhibition is due to MARCH8 upregulation. The transcriptional regulation of MARCH8 by NFAT2 presents an intriguing area for exploration beyond cancer biology. Both NFAT2 and MARCH8 are prominent players in human immunology. NFAT2 regulates the transcription of critical immune receptors such as ICOS, PD-1, CXCR5, CD40L, and chemokines like IL-4 and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Vaeth &amp; Feske, 2018</xref>). While MARCH8, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets MHC-II and CD80 receptors and plays a crucial role in antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lin et al., 2019b</xref>). Therefore, investigating the relationship between NFAT2 and MARCH8 in immune cells would be beneficial for advancing our understanding of cancer immunotherapy, immune disorders and infectious disease biology.</p><p id="P33">The dual role of NFAT2 as a repressor and activator of MARCH8 in pancreatic cancer cells depending on the cell type points out that there could be epigenetic differences in the MARCH8 promoter region. Indeed, using <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis we found that indeed the MARCH8 promoter is epigenetically modified, more specifically shows DNA methylation. DNA methylation is one of the most common epigenetic modifications in the genome and generally DNA methylation suppresses gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nishiyama &amp; Nakanishi, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we found that MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in pancreatic tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>) and consequently, the expression of MARCH8 is lower in tumor samples compared to normal pancreatic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), showing negative correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Using MeDIP assay, we show that there are differences in DNA methylation levels of MARCH8 promoter in non-metastatic, invasive and metastatic cell lines. Our results demonstrate that the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in non-metastatic PC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). To examine if this methylation hinders NFAT2 from regulating MARCH8 transcription in non-metastatic cells, we overexpressed NFAT2 in MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with DNA methylase inhibitor (decitabine). Western blot analysis revealed that NFAT2 overexpression in decitabine-treated cells led to an increase in MARCH8 levels compared to other control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8G, H, I</xref>). In summary, the MARCH8 promoter is hypermethylated in non-metastatic PC cells, preventing NFAT2 from promoting MARCH8-mediated Orai3 protein degradation in these cells.</p><p id="P34">Interestingly, MARCH8 regulates cancer progression both positively and negatively depending upon the type of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">C.

MARCH8’s role in regulating tumorigenesis depends on its degradation targets. For instance, in breast cancer cells, MARCH8 ubiquitinates STAT3 and CD44, suppressing tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">W. Chen et al., 2021</xref>) while in hepatocellular carcinoma, MARCH8 induces degradation of PTEN, promoting malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). However, role of MARCH8 in pancreatic cancer biology remains poorly appreciated. Here, our functional studies with stable knockdown of MARCH8 signifies its role in pancreatic cancer migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9D, E</xref>). More importantly, our <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish xenograft experiments show that stable knockdown of MARCH8 increases metastatic potential of the pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9G, H</xref>). It is important to note that we have earlier reported the Orai3 positively drives PC progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arora et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, MARCH8 controls PC metastasis at least partially by modulating Orai3 expression and activity.</p><p id="P35">To summarize, we reveal that NFAT2 regulates both the transcription and lysosomal degradation of the Orai3 oncochannel in a context-dependent manner. In non-metastatic cancer cells, NFAT2 drives Orai3 transcription, increasing its levels. In contrast, in invasive and metastatic cells, NFAT2 promotes Orai3 degradation by upregulating the MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Biochemical assays and super-resolution microscopy confirm that MARCH8 physically interacts with Orai3, leading to its degradation. This regulatory shift is linked to the epigenetic differences, as the MARCH8 promoter is highly methylated in non-metastatic cells, preventing NFAT2 from inducing Orai3 degradation. The dual regulation of Orai3 by same transcription factor NFAT2 underscores a complex pathway in pancreatic cancer cells that controls disease progression and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="S13"><title>Materials and Reagents</title><p id="P36">Calcium Imaging reagents like thapsigargin and 2-APB were purchased from Sigma.
