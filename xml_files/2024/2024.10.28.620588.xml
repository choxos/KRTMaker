Subsequently the centriole undergoes conversion to a centrosome requiring its radial expansion and elongation, mediated by a network requiring interactions between Cep135, Ana1/Cep295, and Asterless/Cep152. Here we show that mutant alleles encoding overlapping N- and C-terminal parts of Ana1 are capable of intragenic complementation to rescue radial expansion. This permits recruitment of Asl and thereby centriole duplication and mechanosensory cilia formation to restore the coordination defects of these mutants. This genetic combination also rescues centriole duplication in the male germ line but does not rescue the elongation of the triplet microtubule-containing centrioles of primary spermatocytes and consequently these males are coordinated but sterile. Such centriole elongation is rescued by the continuous, full-length Ana1 sequence. We define a region that when deleted within otherwise intact Ana1 does not permit primary spermatocyte centrioles to elongate but still allows recruitment of Asl. Our findings point to differing demands upon the physical organization of Ana1 for the distinct processes of radial expansion and elongation of centrioles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Centrioles are conserved organelles required to form centrosomes, the microtubule organizing centers of interphase and dividing cells, and as basal bodies to form cilia, which have multiple roles in motility and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Azimzadeh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Loncarek and Bettencourt-Dias, 2018</xref>).

During mitosis, a conserved centriole protein known as Ana1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Cep295 in human cells plays a central role in centriole to centrosome conversion. In this process, the daughter centriole matures to become capable of recruiting peri-centriolar material (PCM), a complex molecular condensate that can nucleate cytoplasmic microtubules, and initiating duplication in the subsequent G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Izquierdo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). We have previously documented how, in Drosophila, the inner centriole protein, Cep135, has its C-terminal part at the centriole’s core and its N-terminal part extending outwards to interact with the N-terminal part of Ana1. Ana1 in turn extends further outward with its C-terminal part interacting with the C-terminal part of Asl. These three molecules are sequentially recruited to the daughter centriole such that, following its disengagement from the mother centriole, the daughter becomes capable of assembling PCM and recruiting Plk4, Ana2 and Sas6 to generate the next generation of daughter procentrioles in G1 (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Ana1 recruitment also requires a complex formed between Ana3 and Rcd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Panda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). The Rcd4 protein is also required for the cohesion of doublet and triplet microtubule blades although its precise molecular arrangement and mechanism of action within the centriole is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Panda, Ladinsky and Glover, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6"><italic>ana1</italic> mutants display a lack of coordination as a result of failures in centriole duplication and subsequent formation of microtubule doublet-containing cilia in the mechanosensory chordotonal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Saurya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>). In addition to its function in centriole assembly, Ana1 also has a role in centriole elongation. Centriole length directly correlates with Ana1 expression, with reduced Ana1 levels leading to shorter centrioles, and Ana1 overexpression causing a centriole elongation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saurya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>) As part of this study, Saurya and colleagues also showed that expression of a GFP−Ana1 fusion lacking the N-terminal 639 amino acids can support centrosome assembly and cilium function and so rescue coordination of an <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant. This led them to conclude that the N-terminal part of Ana1 is not required for these processes. Here, we re-examine this finding in the light that <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> is not a null mutant but has a premature termination codon allowing it to express the N-terminal part of Ana1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We then use a genetic approach to define an overlapping region between N- and C-terminal parts of Ana1 necessary for the fragments to drive centriole duplication and formation of mechanosensory cilia. However, these fragments fail to permit elongation of the microtubule triplet-containing giant centrioles of primary spermatocytes. We further define a region that when deleted within otherwise intact Ana1 also fails to permit primary spermatocyte centrioles to elongate but still allows recruitment of Asl. We have therefore been able to define two distinct functions for Ana1; one involving the separate N- and C-domains required for the recruitment of Asl in centriole duplication, the other required for elongation without affecting the recruitment of Asl. Thus, distinct regions of Ana1 with differing physical organisation are required for PCM and Plk4 recruitment and for centriole elongation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Intra-genetic complementation of <italic>ana1<sup>mcB</sup></italic></title><p id="P7">We have previously described how Ana1 is recruited to the centriole through an interaction between its N-terminal part and the N-terminal part of the core centriole protein Cep135 that together with Asl form a linearly arranged trimer that extends from the core of the centriole to its periphery (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). In this study, we showed that an N-terminal fragment of amino-acids 1-935 could be recruited by Cep135. This led us to consider how this could relate to the subsequent conclusion of Saurya and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saurya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>) that the N-terminal 639 amino acids of Ana1 are not essential for centrosome assembly and cilium function reflecting the fact that expression of a C-terminal Ana1 fragment (amino-acids 640- 1729) could rescue the coordination defects of the <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant. We noted, however, that, the <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant had been described to have a premature STOP codon in a position that could enable expression of the first 1129 amino acids of the Ana1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This led us to consider if the functionality of the N-terminal part of the protein is retained in <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> and whether Saurya and colleagues had been observing intra-genic complementation.</p><p id="P8">To address the question of whether that the N-terminal part of the protein was truly needed for centriole duplication and formation of the neurosensory cilia, we generated a null allele of <italic>ana1.</italic> We did this using CRISPR/Cas9-directed mutagenesis to delete the region encoding the first 762 amino acids of the protein and replace it with a DsRed gene having a transcriptional terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). No transcription of <italic>ana1</italic> could be detected in these flies confirming that it is a null mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> flies, which were all able to eclose from pupal cases and yet were still severely uncoordinated, the <italic>ana1<sup>null</sup></italic> flies were so uncoordinated that only 41% of the flies could eclose from the pupal case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, some minimal function persists in <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic>, possibly representing low level readthrough of the stop codon, that enables flies to emerge from the pupal case but they are then too uncoordinated to properly walk, fly or mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">video 1</xref>). The eclosion and coordination phenotype of <italic>ana<sup>null</sup></italic> was completely rescued by the introduction of a transgene expressing the full length Ana1 fragment (<italic>endo-ana1</italic>), tagged with RFP, under the control of the endogenous <italic>ana1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Our design of the <italic>ana1<sup>null</sup></italic> allele enabled removal of the transcription-blocking, DsRed cassette by Cre-recombinase mediated DNA recombination, enabling expression of a C-terminal part of <italic>ana1</italic> comprising amino-acids 763-1729 (<italic>Ana1<sup>Δ1-762</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Around 69% of flies expressing this C-terminal part of Ana1 were able to eclose but once again, all were severely uncoordinated. However, when this C-terminal fragment was expressed in an <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant background, all flies eclosed and exhibited clear rescue, albeit partial, of their coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1BD</xref>, - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure supplement 1B; -video 1</xref>). This intragenic complementation of <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> and <italic>Ana1<sup>Δ1-762</sup></italic> supports the hypothesis that <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> directs the formation of an N-terminal fragment of Ana1 that when expressed with an overlapping C-terminal part is able to rescue Ana1’s function in coordinating movement.</p><p id="P10">The Ana1 protein contains five coiled-coil domains that have the potential to enable homodimerization of the molecule and so they also could potentially link the overlapping N-and C-terminal fragments of Ana1 studied here to provide a functional rod-like molecule. Our <italic>ana1<sup>null</sup></italic> mutant was designed so that Cre-lox mediated recombination would eliminate the DsRed gene to generate an <italic>ana1<sup>Δ1-762</sup></italic> derivative that would specifically express the majority of exon 4 of the <italic>ana1</italic> gene. However, this strategy has the effect of interrupting coiled-coil domain 3 of the resulting C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore considered the possibility that intact coiled-coil regions in this part of the molecule, including coiled-coil region 3, could be important to restore full coordination when independent N- and C-terminal parts were co-expressed. To test this hypothesis, we built a series of constructs encoding N-terminal parts of Ana1 of differing lengths that extended to include successive coiled-coil domains 2 to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also built a set of complementary constructs of the C-terminal part extending N-terminally to include the same coiled-coil domain-containing regions. We introduced these into flies under the control of the endogenous <italic>ana1</italic> promoter using targeted φC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis to insert the transgenes encoding the N-terminal fragments into a defined region of the third chromosome and transgenes encoding the C-terminal fragments and the full length fragment into the second chromosome to ensure comparable levels of their expression. We also inserted some of these constructs downstream of the polubiquitin promoter to achieve higher expression levels. We then carried out a series of complementation tests to determine the extent of overlap between N- and C-terminal parts to give optimal rescue of coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure supplement 1, -video-1</xref>). These intragenic complementation tests revealed that fragments overlapping in either or both the second and third coiled-coil domains plus the region immediately C-terminal of coiled-coil region 3 can completely rescue the coordination of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure supplement 1, - video 2</xref>). We conclude that the presence of intact coiled-coil domains 2 or 3 enables the N-and C-terminal parts of Ana1 to interact and rescue Ana1’s function in providing coordination.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Intragenic complementation of <italic>ana1</italic>’s N- and C-terminal coding regions re-establishes centriole duplication and mechanosensory cilia formation</title><p id="P11">Coordination in flies requires the function of type I ciliated mechanosensory neurons located in the femoral chordotonal organs (fChOs). Loss of coordination can reflect failure of the centriole duplication cycle to generate the basal bodies of these cells, failure of ciliogenesis, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the fChOs, neurons are clustered together in pairs, surrounded by an actin cone within structures known as scolopidia. Each neuron has a proximal basal body, derived from the daughter centriole, and a distal basal body, derived from the mother, which templates the cilia. We showed that fragments overlapping at coiled-coil domain 3 could completely rescue the uncoordinated phenotype. To test the extent of this rescue in the femoral chordotonal organs, we co-expressed fragments with the minimal overlapping sequences required to completely restore coordination. In control fChOs expressing full length Ana1 tagged with RFP, the proximal and distal basal bodies could be identified at the base of each cilium by both Ana1-RFP fluorescence and immunostaining to reveal dPLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-lower row</xref>). In the severely uncoordinated <italic>ana1<sup>null</sup></italic> flies expressing RFP-tagged Ana1<sup>1−935</sup> having coiled-coil domains 1-3, we found irregularities in basal body numbers and the proximal and distal centrioles could not be distinguished, together indicative of a centriole duplication defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A - central</xref>). However, co-expression of RFP-tagged Ana1<sup>1−935</sup> together with a 715-1729 aa C-terminal fragment, fully rescued coordination and restored the structure of the proximal and distal centrioles in the fChO. As these two Ana1 fragments overlap in coiled-coil region 3 and the sequences extending immediately C-terminal to it, it seems that these overlapping fragments can interact to restore a molecule capable of restoring the structure of basal bodies able to template cilia formation.</p><p id="P12">To confirm the generality of the rescue of function by overlapping fragments and confirm its underlying cellular basis we used electron microscopy to examine the basal bodies and cilia of fChOs in more detail in <italic>ana1<sup>+</sup>, ana1<sup>null</sup>, ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic>, and <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup>; ana1<sup>C715−1729</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup>; ana1<sup>C715−1729</sup></italic> flies show a complete rescue of coordination. This is similar to the rescue seen in <italic>ana<sup>1−935</sup>; ana<sup>715−1729</sup></italic> flies, reflecting the fact that both genetic combinations express the minimum overlapping sequence required to restore coordination. Transverse sections of scolopidia reveal them to contain a pair of basal bodies extending to a pair of ciliary axonemes in wild type fChOs as expected. The null mutant scolopidia showed a complete loss of basal bodies and cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, -<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">video-1</xref>). On the other hand, we could find cases of <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant scolopidia that could have a remaining single basal body and cilium, some with normal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and some with structural defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3-figure supplement-1, -video-2</xref>). Expression of the C-terminal 715-1729 amino acid fragment of Ana1 in the <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> background fully rescued coordination and restored centriole and ciliary pairs in the fChO scolopidia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3C, - figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the C-terminally truncated Ana1 protein expressed in the <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant leads to defects in centriole duplication as it only expresses the first 1120 aa of the protein due to the premature STOP codon. However, the allele does retain a lower level of residual function in centriole duplication and cilium formation in the fChOs, that could either be due to this N-terminal fragment having some function <italic>per</italic> se, or to some readthrough of the stop codon. In either event, full function can be restored by expression of an overlapping C-terminal fragment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interaction between the N- and C-terminal fragments rescues centriole duplication, but not elongation of triplet microtubules in the testes</title><p id="P13">The axonemes of <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s fChO cilia and the sperm develop from centrioles of quite distinct appearance. In the fChOs, for example, centrioles develop into basal bodies of approximately 120 nm in length from which the axonemes of the neurosensory cilia develop. Both basal bodies and cilia of the fChOs are built from doublet microtubules. In the male germline, a series of 4 rounds of stereotyped mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis result in cysts of 16 cells having centrioles also of about 120 nm in length. The 16-cell cyst of spermatocytes undergoes an extended G2 phase of around 72 h during which time the two pairs of triplet microtubule-containing centrioles carried by each of these cells elongate to form so-called giant centrioles about 1.3 μm in length. The meiotic divisions segregate individual single centrioles into the spermatids which undergo elongation as the triplet microtubule containing axoneme develops into the sperm tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We found that the co-expression of Ana1<sup>1-935</sup> and Ana1<sup>715-1729</sup> restored coordination to enable flies to mate but we were surprised to find that males of this genotype were sterile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4- figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, none of these fragments in any combination could rescue centriole elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To this end we constructed transgenes able to express Ana1 deleted for amino-acids 1210-1340 (referred to as ΔAB); amino-acids 1341-1471 (referred to as ΔCD); and amino-acids 1472-1602 (referred to as ΔEF) and expressed these in an <italic>ana1<sup>nul1</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Interestingly flies expressing either Ana1- ΔCD or Ana1- ΔEF showed dramatic male sterility suggesting the possibility that the CD region might play a role in additional aspects of centriole function besides length control. That said, we conclude that Ana1 molecules that are fully capable of interacting with each other through the 5 coiled-coil domains require sequences in the EF region extending into the CD region to interact with other proteins required for the elongation of microtubule triplet-containing spermatocyte centrioles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">The term <italic>centriole to centrosome conversion</italic> was coined to describe how the daughter centriole is converted during mitosis into a structure able to nucleate cytoplasmic microtubules and duplicate, the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The process primarily requires recruitment of a rod-like array of molecules extending outward from the centriole’s core to provide a foundation on which to recruit <italic>pericentriolar</italic> material (PCM) to make a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). However, the concept of centriole to centrosome conversion has come to embrace centriole elongation because key centriole components, notably Drosophila Ana1 and its human counterpart, CEP295, are also required for centriole growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saurya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alvarez-Rodrigo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). The genetic approach that we now describe predicts key aspects of the structure of Ana1/CEP295 that dictate the separable roles of this molecule in engaging Asl/Cep152 to recruit Plk4 and establish the PCM and in enabling the growth of centrioles that have triplet microtubules.</p><p id="P18">Our previous description of the assembly of the linear complex of Cep135, Ana1, and Asl of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centriole provided a basis for centriole to centrosome conversion (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Within this network, the N-terminal part of Ana1 physically interacts with the N-terminal part of Cep135, whereas the C-terminal part of Ana1 interacts with the C-terminal part of Asl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our attention was therefore drawn to the conclusion of Saurya and colleagues that the N-terminal part of Ana1 is not required for centrosome assembly and cilium function in flies. This resulted from a finding that expression of a GFP−Ana1 fusion lacking the N-terminal 639 amino acids could support these processes in an <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saurya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016b</xref>). However, our present findings indicate that <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> is not a null mutation. The original description of the <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> allele would predict its ability to encode an N-terminal fragment of 1129 amino-acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Indeed, either <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> or a DNA construct built to mimic this allele, but lacking the sequence 3’ to the stop codon, can be complemented through the independent expression of an overlapping C-terminal part of the molecule. Our findings with these and other constructs suggest that the optimal overlap between the N- and C-terminal parts to achieve this intragenic complementation include coiled-coil regions 2 and 3 and their immediate downstream sequences suggesting that this region is critical to achieve a stable overlapping interaction. This would establish linkage between four components - Cep135, the N-terminal Ana1 part, the C-terminal Ana1 part, and Asl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) - permitting the correct spatial orientation of the Cep135-binding, N terminal part of Ana1 and the Asl-binding C-terminal part that are necessary for centriole to centrosome conversion. Moreover, the ability of the overlapping N-and C-terminal parts to restore formation of the sensory cilia of the chordotonal organs not only indicates rescue of centriole duplication, which requires centriole to centrosome conversion, but also, as we observed, rescue of the ability to assemble the chordotonal cilia that are built from doublet microtubules.</p><p id="P19">The independent expression of these overlapping N- and C-terminal parts of Ana1 was also sufficient to rescue the formation of 4 centrioles in the 16 immature primary spermatocytes. However, overlapping parts of Ana1 were insufficient to drive the elongation of centrioles in the extended G2 phase of primary spermatocytes of either <italic>ana1<sup>null</sup></italic> or <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutants. Centriole growth in these mutants could, however, be rescued by full-length Ana1suggesting that the continuity of the Ana1 primary sequence is required for centriole elongation but not for centriole to centrosome conversion.</p><p id="P20">Whereas centrioles of somatic cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> contain doublet microtubules, the male germ line exhibits centrioles and axonemes comprised of triplet microtubules. However, EM studies by two of us (HR and JF, data not shown) have shown that the short centrioles seen in <italic>ana1<sup>mecB</sup></italic> mutant primary spermatocyte centrioles also displayed doublet microtubules. The expression of full length Ana1 not only rescues centriole elongation but also microtubule triplet formation. A number of other centriole proteins have been implicated as having functions in centriole elongation and in several of these cases, there is evidence of a link between centriole growth and formation of triplet microtubules. Overexpression of Sas4/CPAP, for example, results in elongated centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kohlmaier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) whereas its deficiency results in centrioles with incomplete microtubule triplets that still can convert to centrosomes but fragment as the microtubule blades come apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Vásquez-Limeta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Moreover, a specific mutation of CPAP has been described with reduced tubulin interaction that results in shorter centrioles and cilia with doublet and not triplet-microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Centrobin protein is also required to generate triplet microtubules and promote elongation of spermatocyte centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Its mammalian counterpart, CNTROB is also not only required for centriole duplication, but also for elongation and microtubule stability through interactions with tubulin and CPAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jeffery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gudi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These requirements for Centrobin and Sas4/CPAP for centriole elongation and C-tubule stabilization to form microtubule triplets predict they will exhibit functional interactions with Ana1. Indeed, Ana1 can interact indirectly with Sas4, which binds to Ana1’s partner, Asl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dzhindzhev <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, future studies are required to investigate such possibilities.</p><p id="P21">Our findings lead to two hypotheses about the structural organisation of Ana1 that require testing in future structural studies. First, the continuity of the primary amino-acid sequence in a single polypeptide is not required for centriole to centrosome conversion <italic>per se</italic> because it can be achieved by separate N- and C-terminal fragments that overlap in the central coiled-coil region 3 and sequences C-terminal to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This defines a minimal region required for the N- and C-terminal parts of Ana1 to interact and give full function in centriole duplication and establishment of the axonemes of sensory cilia with doublet microtubules. It suggests the possibility that the full length wild-type protein might form homodimers to achieve its normal function, although the most critical factor would be to achieve the correct spatial organisation of Cep135- and Asl-interacting regions as we have previously described (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Second, our study points to a need for continuous Ana1 protein sequence throughout the region carrying the 5 coiled-coil domains to permit the coupled processes of doublet to triplet microtubule conversion and elongation of triplet-microtubule centrioles. We speculate that this might facilitate the longitudinal stacking of Ana1 and its complexed proteins to facilitate the elongation of triplet-containing microtubules of the giant spermatocyte centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of both these processes. In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells, the roles played by the Ana3:Rcd4 complex in recruiting Ana1/Cep295 remain poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Panda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Moreover, Atorino and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Atorino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) have proposed that Cep295 plays a role in stibilizing the microtubule wall structure in human cells independently of Cep135, which together with the cartwheel is lost from centrioles in contrast to its retention in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. This suggestion would be in line with our hypothesis for a role of the stacked Ana1 ortholog complex in centriole elongation. Our studies with deletion mutants in the extreme C-terminal region identified a requirement for the region around amino-acids 1472-1602 (region EF) for centriole elongation. The extreme male sterility of not only flies expressing Ana1- ΔEF, but also those expressing Ana1- ΔCD suggests that the CD region might play a role in yet other aspects of centriole function, besides length control, that needs more investigation. Interestingly, the EF interval overlaps with a region identified as required to recruit Polo kinase to the distal part of the spermatocyte centriole. The mutation of 34 serine to threonine residues in potential Polo kinase binding sites in this region abolishes Polo recruitment and centriole elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alvarez-Rodrigo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, this study did not identify Polo’s substrates in the vicinity of Ana1. Thus, how Polo kinase might facilitate the potential interactions of Ana1 with itself, with proteins such as Centrobin and Sas4, or with other neighbouring centriole proteins to promote triplet microtubule formation and centriole elongation requires future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>DNA constructs</title><p id="P23">Full length <italic>Ana1</italic> cDNAs and their fragments of varying lengths were used to generate entry clones using the Gateway System (Life Technologies).

Overlapping N- and C-terminal parts are structurally incapable of stacking and consequently do not permit centriole elongation.
