Previous research has predominantly focused on the cognitive aspects of mind-wandering, overlooking the potential embodied or interoceptive components that contribute to our ongoing thought patterns. In this study, we addressed this gap by exploring “body-wandering”—thoughts related to internal bodily sensations such as breathing, heartbeat, and gastrointestinal functions. To assess body-wandering, we applied a retrospective multi-dimensional interoceptive experience sampling approach in 536 healthy participants concurrently with resting-state functional brain imaging. Our findings revealed that body-wandering is distinct from cognitively focused thoughts, underscoring the unique role of embodied processes in ongoing experience. Embodied thought patterns were associated with increased negative affect, heightened physiological arousal, and reduced ADHD symptoms. In contrast, cognitive-focused thoughts were linked to decreased negative affect, lower arousal, and higher depression symptoms. Notably, body-wandering corresponded with a unique neural signature involving increased connectivity between somatomotor, interoceptive, and thalamocortical brain networks. These results emphasise the importance of incorporating embodied processes into theoretical models of mind-wandering and suggest that individual differences in body-wandering significantly impact emotional states and mental health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mind-wandering</kwd><kwd>interoception</kwd><kwd>emotion</kwd><kwd>brain connectivity</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The human mind is a ceaseless wanderer, with ongoing thought constantly shifting between self-generated thoughts and externally directed experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Christoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Smallwood &amp; Schooler, 2015</xref>). While research on patterns of ongoing thoughts has flourished in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>), studies have largely focused on cognitive features of experience and so have neglected the possibility that embodied processes can influence our thought experiences. In this study, we address this theoretical gap in our understanding of ongoing thought by establishing the concept of interoceptive “body-wandering” - thoughts and sensations related to our internal bodily state - and investigate its affective, physiological, and neural correlates during a period of wakeful rest.</p><p id="P3">Ongoing thought patterns are recognised to be multifaceted, with contemporary work highlighting that they can reflect incoming sensory information, such as when we watch movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wallace et al., 2024</xref>), and maintain detailed information regarding tasks we perform either in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Mckeown et al., 2023</xref>) or during periods of work in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mckeown et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mulholland et al., 2023</xref>). Ongoing thought patterns can also reflect self-generated processes that allow for creativity and innovative problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gable et al., 2019</xref>), however, they can also precipitate intrusive unpleasant features that are linked to problems in mental health such as with depressive rumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Killingsworth &amp; Gilbert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mulholland et al., 2023</xref>). Psychopathological consequences of ongoing thoughts also include associations with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Biederman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Bozhilova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lanier et al., 2021</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that difficulties in patterns of ongoing thought in individuals with ADHD may stem from dysfunctions in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a neural system critical for regulating arousal and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bellato et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Martella et al., 2020</xref>). Dysregulation in the LC-NE system can lead to a predisposition towards hypoarousal, which may contribute to the characteristic symptoms of ADHD, including inattentiveness and disrupted thought patterns. Supporting this notion, individuals with ADHD have reduced vagally mediated heart rate variability (high-frequency power) than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bellato et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Robe et al., 2019</xref>), indicating decreased parasympathetic activity and altered autonomic nervous system regulation.</p><p id="P4">While internally generated contributions to ongoing thought are now a well-documented feature of human experience, they often focus primarily on cognitive features of experience, neglecting the possibility that experiences can have important embodied features. This oversight is especially important given the mounting evidence for an interoceptive component of emotional experience and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Critchley &amp; Garfinkel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Khalsa et al., 2018</xref>). An over focus on cognitive features of ongoing thought has important implications for theoretical perspectives on ongoing thought patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). For example, brain regions implicated in cognitive aspects of experience include areas associated with executive control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Turnbull et al., 2019</xref>), and areas involved in autobiographical memory, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Konu et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the possibility that ongoing thought patterns can have embodied features raises the possibility that brain regions involved in interoception, somatosensation and action may also contribute to ongoing experience even when we are unoccupied by an external task.</p><p id="P5">Consistent with the possibility that embodied processes contribute to our ongoing thought processes, there are important similarities between the neural mechanisms of interoception and those linked to cognitive features of ongoing thought, including both regions of the default mode and saliency networks. For example, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activate with interoceptive processing during various forms of self-related cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Babo-Rebelo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Babo-Rebelo, Richter, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Babo-Rebelo, Wolpert, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Park et al., 2018</xref>). These regions are a core part of the default mode network, with the medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobules, which are implicated in ongoing thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Christoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, the discovery of an “interoceptive and allostatic” brain network has been reported, with key nodes situated both within the default mode and salience networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kleckner et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, recent perspectives on waking cognitive experiences at rest are known to depend on the interaction between the default mode and saliency networks, as well as to the dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hardikar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Turnbull et al., 2019</xref>). Our study, therefore, explored the possibility that ongoing thought patterns that reflect attention to our body and its sensations depend on a combination of regions that play an established role in ongoing thought processes, as well as those that are linked directly to interoception.</p><p id="P6">To address the gap in our understanding of how embodied processes contribute to ongoing thought experiences, we probed interoceptive, affective, and cognitive contents of thoughts that occur during wakeful rest. We expanded the multi-dimensional experience sampling (mDES) approach to also probe the interoceptive and embodied dimension of ongoing thought experiences. These were administered following a period of wakeful rest while brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition to the neural and experiential characteristics of “body-wandering” and “cognitive-wandering”, we also sought to identify their affective and physiological correlates. With this data, we hoped to address the scientific gap in understanding how embodied processes contribute to our experience, and thereby improve theoretical accounts of the brain and the experiential basis of the ongoing thought patterns that play a central role in our conscious experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Item level analyses</title><p id="P7">We expanded upon the established approach of assessing affective and cognitive mind-wandering by probing interoceptive and embodied content, using a multidimensional interoceptive experience sampling (MDIES) approach, with the aim of characterising the extent of body-related versus more traditional cognitive dimensions of mind-wandering. To assess these dimensions, we first calculated indices of cognitive and interoceptive thoughts by averaging the embodied and cognitive items separately (see Methods Mind-Wandering Summaries for the body average and cognitive average details and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (Right)). We found that interoceptive thoughts were reported less frequently overall than typical cognitive content. This is supported by a significant Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing embodied and cognitive item averages (body item average: Median (Mdn) = 36.5, Range = 0-79.2, cognitive item average: Mdn = 47.1, Range = 3.8-100; W(535) = 39209, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, rB = -0.455). Within the body-related items, non-specific thoughts about bodily movement were significantly more prevalent than all interoceptive thoughts of specific organs, with the exception of movement with breathing-related thoughts which was not significant but followed the same pattern (Wilcoxon signed rank tests W range = 75063 to 101878, <italic>p range</italic> = .002 to &lt;.001, rB range = 0.157 to 0.667, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Respiration (i.e., thoughts about breathing) was the most dominant of the interoceptive mind-wandering content (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (Left)).</p><p id="P8">While most participants reported a positive emotional experience during rest, there was substantial variability in individual affective tone (negative difference score: Neg - Pos Mdn = -15.820, Range = -100 to 100). Interestingly, interoceptive body-wandering correlated with an increase in negative thoughts, and compatibly, a reduction in positive affective content. Specifically, the following body-related items significantly correlated with less positive thoughts: arousal, heart, bladder, skin, and stomach (rs range = -0.175 to -0.298, <italic>pFDR range = all</italic> &lt;.001). Correspondingly the subsequent embodied items were significantly associated with heightened negative content: body, breath, heart, bladder, skin, and stomach (rs range = 0.118 to 0.225, <italic>pFDR range</italic> = .012 to &lt;.001). Despite this, spontaneous thoughts concerning movement significantly correlated with more positive thoughts (rs = 0.102, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .030) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for body-affect item correlation statistics). All correlations persisted when controlling for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, thoughts about the body and interoceptive sensations are overall related to negative affective ongoing thought (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (Middle)).</p><p id="P9">In the opposing direction, items reflecting cognitive (past, future, other, self) or descriptive (image, distant, focus, vague, ruminate, vivid) aspects of mind-wandering demonstrated more positive (rs range = 0.097 to 0.305, pFDR range = .049 to &lt;.001) and/or less negative ongoing thoughts (rs = -0.140 to -0.218, pFDR range = .004 to &lt; .001) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> for full item correlation statistics, including partial correlations controlling for age, gender, and BMI). Thus, body-related and cognitive aspects of mind-wandering have an anti-correlated relationship with emotional thought experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Psychological network analysis</title><p id="P10">We next conducted a network analysis to identify structural patterns and relationships among items reflecting mind-wandering experiences. This revealed a network of 21 nodes-each representing a specific mind-wandering item-with 58 non-zero connections (out of 210 possible edges). This analysis also included the evaluation of the most central and influential individual items. For example, positive mind-wandering emerged as the most central node, exhibiting the strongest direct connections (strength centrality), the most indirect connections (closeness centrality), and the most active as a crucial intermediary between other nodes (betweenness centrality i.e., shortest path to other nodes). Detailed mind-wandering (vague), and bladder-related thoughts were also highly central, suggesting these facets of mind-wandering are highly relevant for other aspects of ongoing thought. In contrast, words, movement, and breath-related thoughts were the least central nodes with respect to overall interactions with other dimensions of ongoing thought. Furthermore, past-oriented mind-wandering was expected to be the most influential when considering the sign of the direct connections to other nodes, while ruminating thoughts the least influential (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> for network centrality indices).</p><p id="P11">The most prominent negative and positive edge weights involved connections between positive-negative (-0.300), vague-image (0.229), heart-bladder (0.165), positive-bladder (-0.156), and bladder-vague (-0.143) nodes. This highlights the strongest correlations between pairs of mind-wandering dimensions, exhibiting important relations among affective, embodied and the detailed nature of ongoing thought. To assess the robustness and stability of the overall network, we also performed bootstrapped analysis (2500 repetitions) of the confidence intervals for the estimated edge weights, and of the correlation stability coefficients of the centrality indices. This showed that although large edge-weight confidence intervals indicate high variability in edge weight estimation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), the stability coefficients for each centrality index were relatively stable (all exceeded 0.5, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). For significant edges and centrality index significance, please refer to the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6-10</xref>.</p><p id="P12">Next, to identify subclusters or communities of nodes within the overall thought network, we applied a spinglass community detection algorithm. This data-driven approach identified 5 communities of nodes. Interestingly, this discovered a subnetwork community of body-related nodes with negative affect. This body-wandering subnetwork included most of the interoceptive body items except for thoughts regarding the breath, which clustered with temporality (past/future thoughts) and the vague or focused nature of visual thoughts. Content concerning the overall body and thoughts of movement formed a small subnetwork. Finally, the temporal distance and vivid nature of thoughts formed a small subnetwork and positive affect clustered in a subnetwork community with thoughts concerning personhood, verbal and ruminating content.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mental health individual differences</title><p id="P13">Mind-wandering has been extensively related to psychopathology and mental health, particularly in the domains of ADHD and depression. We examined the associations between symptoms of ADHD and depression with embodied (body-wandering), cognitive, and negative mind-wandering constructs. ADHD symptoms were assessed via the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>), while depressive symptoms were measured via the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bech et al., 2015</xref>) (see methods mental health assessment section for scoring details).</p><p id="P14">Body-wandering ratings were significantly negatively correlated with ADHD and depressive symptoms (ADHD: rs = -0.138, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .003, depression: rs = -0.132, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .004). Contrastingly, cognitive-wandering was significantly positively correlated with ADHD and depressive symptoms (ADHD: rs = 0.143, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .003, depression: rs = 0.156, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These correlations persisted when partialling out age, gender, and BMI (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). A backward stepwise multiple linear regression incorporating both ADHD and depression symptoms as predictors of body-wandering to control for symptom comorbidity, indicated that only ADHD significantly predicted body-wandering scores (b = -0.120, t = -2.718, p = .007; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.014, F(1,507) = 7.389, <italic>p</italic> = .007), while depression was not retained in the final model. In contrast, in the model predicting cognitive-wandering, only depressive symptoms were significant predictors (b = 4.853, t = 3.920, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.029, F(1,507) = 15.366, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; .001), while ADHD was not retained in the final model (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). These findings suggest that ADHD and depression have distinct relationships with ongoing thoughts patterns: ADHD symptoms are associated with reduced body-wandering, while depressive symptoms are associated with increased cognitive-wandering.</p><p id="P15">Post-hoc analyses examining correlations between ADHD symptoms and individual items from the body and cognitive-wandering scales (i.e., MDIES items) revealed that mind-wandering about the heart had the strongest negative correlation with ADHD symptoms (rs = -0.211, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001), followed by thoughts regarding the bladder (rs = -0.106, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .035), and the skin (rs = -0.104, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .038). For depressive symptoms, temporal mind-wandering about the past (rs = 0.164, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001) and future (rs = 0.123, <italic>pFDR</italic> = .014) contributed most to the association with cognitive-wandering (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). Intriguingly, depressive symptoms also correlated with less negative mind-wandering (negative difference score: rs = -0.098, <italic>pFDR</italic> = 0.047). Post-hoc correlations suggested this was driven by a weak positive correlation between depressive symptoms and positive affective mind-wandering (rs = 0.094, <italic>pFDR</italic> = 0.049).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Physiological individual differences</title><p id="P16">We also evaluated the influence of individual differences in interoceptive physiology (cardiac, respiratory, and gastric metrics) on embodied and cognitive-wandering (see Methods Physiological Measurements section). Body-wandering significantly correlated with a higher heart rate, higher sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio), lower parasympathetic heart rate variability (RMSSD, high frequency power), as well as a higher mean respiratory depth, higher variability in both respiratory depth and duration, and a higher gastric maximum power in normal gastric range (normogastria). Contrastingly, in the opposing direction to body-wandering, we observed cognitive-wandering correlations with higher parasympathetic heart rate variability (RMSSD, high frequency power), lower sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio), lower mean and variability of respiratory depth, and lower normogastric maximum power (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> for full physiological mind-wandering correlation statistics). Importantly, these correlations persisted even when controlling for age, gender, and BMI (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p><p id="P17">A backward stepwise multiple linear regression including the significant physiological metrics from the body-wandering correlations as predictors, indicated a final model with RMSSD, mean respiratory depth, respiratory duration variability, and normogastric maximum power as significantly predicting body-wandering (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.150, F(4,239) = 10.565, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; .001). Similarly, RMSSD, mean respiratory depth, and normogastric maximum power were retained from a backward stepwise regression with cognitive-wandering (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.164, F(3,242) = 15.814, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; .001) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We conducted post-hoc correlations of physiological metrics with individual MDIES items. The highest physiological correlation with body-wandering was skin-related thoughts with RMSSD heart rate variability (rs = -0.237, pFDR &lt; .001), and with mean respiration depth (rs = 0.233, pFDR &lt; .001). Whereas, the highest correlation between cognitive-wandering and physiological measures were mean respiration depth with past-oriented thoughts (rs = -0.216, pFDR &lt; .001) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref> for all post-hoc physiology correlations).</p><p id="P19">Finally, negative affective mind-wandering significantly correlated with an increased heart rate, LF/HF ratio, respiratory depth (mean and variability), and decreased parasympathetic heart rate variability (high frequency power and RMSSD) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cortical fingerprints of body-wandering</title><p id="P20">To elucidate the neural correlates underlying embodied mind-wandering, we employed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify resting-state connectivity patterns associated with interoceptive and cognitive thoughts. This analysis revealed a significant, cross-validated CCA mode that captures a neural fingerprint of interoceptive thoughts, characterized by heightened connectivity among interoceptive, somatomotor, and subcortical networks (canonical variate in-sample r(293) = 0.386; out-of-sample r(194) = 0.354; p = 0.001; robustness = 80%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The highest canonical loadings, reflecting the strongest associations, were observed for embodied and negative affective thoughts, specifically sensations related to the stomach (loading = 0.576), physiological arousal (0.442), breathing (0.345), movement (0.300), and negative affect (0.286) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings indicate that body-wandering is linked to a distinct neural connectivity profile, characterized by a pattern of increased thalamo-cortical coupling interconnecting interoceptive and somatomotor brain regions.</p><p id="P21">Examining the connectivity edges with the highest canonical loadings, we found that the strongest connections were between somatomotor/interoceptive regions and subcortical areas. Specifically, these included connections from the right thalamus and right caudate to the bilateral precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex, as defined by the Juelich Histological Atlas) and bilateral postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex), with top 1% absolute loadings ranging from 0.558 to 0.703. Additionally, we observed high-loading edges connecting the right paracingulate gyrus and bilateral postcentral gyrus, notably with a loading of 0.679 for the right postcentral gyrus (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref> for detailed connectivity loadings). We also assessed the connectivity degree among the top 1% highest loading connections, measured by the total number of above-threshold edges for each node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).

To do so, we correlated each participant’s weighting on the behavioural dimension of the CCA mode (i.e., the combined body/cognitive mind-wandering CCA variate) with their body-wandering and cognitive-wandering averages, we found a strong correlation with the body-wandering average (rs = 0.481, pFDR &lt; 0.001) and a weaker correlation with the cognitive-wandering average (rs = 0.152, pFDR &lt; 0.001). This indicates that the latent CCA variate is more closely associated with body-wandering than with cognitive-wandering, reinforcing the idea that the neural connectivity patterns identified are specifically linked to embodied thought processes.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Gradient map association</title><p id="P23">To situate the body-wandering brain variate within the greater topological hierarchy of the brain, we next applied a gradient-based analysis. To do so we investigated the association of the body-wandering CCA result with respect to previously defined gradient brain variation dimensions validated from the Human Connectome Projects resting state connectivity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). These modes of brain variation are often referred to as gradients: Gradient-1 (Association to Primary cortex), Gradient-2 (Visual to Motor cortex), Gradient-3 (Frontoparietal to Default Mode Networks) and Gradient-4 (Dorsal Attention Network/Visual to Default Mode Networks), and Gradient-5 (Lateral Default Mode to Primary sensory cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wallace et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, we implemented spin-tests to statistically determine the relationship of the top 1% brain regions from the CCA result to the gradient brain variation dimensions. We did this by averaging the gradient values across the top 1% brain parcels from the CCA, and consequently determined the likelihood of a value of this magnitude occurring by chance via a spin-test null distribution with 2500 permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The top loading brain regions from the body-wandering CCA were significantly associated with Gradient-1 (p &lt; .001).

Using a novel experience sampling (i.e., MDIES) battery that accounted for the possibility that our thoughts relate to somatic and visceral sensations, we found that body-wandering was distinguishable from more cognitive aspects of ongoing thought in terms of their associations with emotional content, physiological responses, and mental health. For example, body-wandering was associated with a pattern of more negative thoughts, reduced ADHD symptoms, and higher arousal reflected in increased heart rate, breathing depth, breathing variability, and gastric motility, as well as reduced parasympathetic cardiac activity. In the opposing direction, cognitive features of experience (i.e., cognitive-wandering) were linked to more positive thoughts, but also more trait depression symptoms, and reduced arousal reflected in decreased breathing depth and gastric motility, as well as increased parasympathetic cardiac activity. We also revealed that individual differences in brain connectivity relating to body-wandering patterns involved interoceptive, somatomotor, and subcortical regions. Together these findings suggest that there is a distinct and separable mode of ongoing cognition that is coloured by our internal bodily processes and is likely made possible through the process of introspection.</p><p id="P26">The entanglement of emotion with embodied experiences has been discussed for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Damasio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">James, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Niedenthal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962</xref>), with some describing the perception and interpretation of interoceptive bodily changes as integral to emotion. This aligns with our observation of increased body-wandering with more negative thoughts. Compatibly, prior research indicated that individuals with heightened perception of their internal bodily signals report more intense emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pollatos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Schandry, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wiens et al., 2000</xref>). However, a recent comprehensive meta-analysis uncovered a nuanced and heterogeneous relationship of interoception and emotion intensity, indicating a significant association primarily when experimentally induced via emotional images or facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Parrinello et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, other emotion induction methods such as social exclusion, negative feedback, or during rest, reveal no differences in objective interoception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Parrinello et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Zamariola, Frost, et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, even without objective interoception differences, individuals with a higher subjective sense of perceiving their internal signals experience more negative emotions post social exclusion or negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zamariola, Luminet, et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the role of awareness of bodily signals and emotions is complex and potentially context-dependent, and is further exacerbated by challenges in assessing interoception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Desmedt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Ring &amp; Brener, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Zamariola et al., 2018</xref>). Our results highlight that in a potentially anxiety-inducing MRI-scanner environment, interoceptive body-wandering has negative emotional impacts, aligning with research on anxiety and bodily hyper-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dunn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pollatos et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Despite identifying a negative emotional link with body-wandering, we discovered that individuals with elevated depression and ADHD symptoms engaged in less body-wandering. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, this observation is actually consistent with evidence of reduced interoceptive perception and heartbeat potential attenuation in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Pollatos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kutscheidt et al., 2019</xref>). Some theoretical accounts describe both ADHD and depression as stemming from an underactive autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bellato et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dawson et al., 1977</xref>). This diminished autonomic reactivity to environmental stimuli could lead to increased cognitive-wandering, which is further corroborated by our findings of increased cognitive-wandering with lower arousal, and a greater presence of ADHD and depression symptoms. Indeed, we observe reduced arousal with increased cognitive-wandering, and enhanced arousal with body-wandering, reflected in our heart rate and heart rate variability metrics. It is therefore plausible that autonomic arousal inversely regulates body-wandering and cognitive-wandering, and dysfunction in this regulatory process may contribute to mental health symptoms. Importantly, arousal-mediated mind-wandering may influence state and trait emotional experiences differently. For example, body-wandering during heightened physiological arousal may trigger immediate negative emotions relevant to the present context, but it may also reduce attention lapses into broader cognitive-wandering, such as thoughts about temporal and social aspects of life. This pattern has been previously related to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Poerio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Smallwood &amp; O’Connor, 2011</xref>), and is supported by our findings of increased temporal-oriented thoughts in individuals with elevated depression symptoms.</p><p id="P28">Our study makes an important theoretical contribution to our understanding of the brain mechanism behind specific patterns of ongoing thought by highlighting the role sensory regions make to our conscious experience. Prior studies have highlighted that patterns of self-generated episodic thought patterns are often linked to a decoupling between regions within association cortices, particularly the default mode network from the dorsal attention network, a process that is supported by regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hardikar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Turnbull et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies have shown that regions of visual and auditory cortex support situations when our ongoing thoughts are coupled to events in the outside world such as during movie watching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wallace et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, we observe that our ongoing thoughts can be spontaneously directed to bodily sensations, and that increased body-wandering is associated with a functional connectivity profile that is commonly seen in interoceptive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Engelen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Khalsa et al., 2009</xref>) consisting of regions within viscero-sensory cortices (i.e., somatomotor and interoceptive networks) and subcortical regions (i.e., thalamus, caudate, putamen). This observation is important because it extends our understanding of the neural regions that support different types of ongoing thought patterns. In particular, it suggests that sometimes our spontaneous thoughts can be influenced by the state of our body, possibly through the process of interoception.</p><p id="P29">It is important to note that our study retrospectively probed body-wandering content with the aim of mapping their neural, psychological, and physiological fingerprints. Thus, future research should aim to qualitatively dissect the contents of interoceptive body-wandering in more detail. For example, it would be valuable to determine whether these thoughts pertain to specific interoceptive sensations, or broader body-related themes, such as body-image, recalling the enjoyment of a meal, or feeling one’s heart race during an emotional moment. Additionally, using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mulholland et al., 2023</xref>) to capture real-time introspective contributions in daily life could provide insight into the contexts where body-wandering occurs most frequently.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, we are the first to characterise the neural, psychological, and physiological fingerprints of body-wandering. We observe a distinct pattern of ongoing thought that focused on bodily sensations that was dissociable from the cognitive features of experience that make up the bulk of studies of mind-wandering. This distinction spanned affective, physiological, and psychological dimensions, and highlighted an important contribution of somatomotor and interoceptive networks in shaping the stream of ongoing conscious experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P31">We recruited 566 (360 females, 205 males, 1 other gender) participants (median age = 24, age range = 18-56) as part of the Visceral Mind Project, a large-scale neuroimaging study conducted at the Centre of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University.

An Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) is used to set a regularisation tuning parameter for estimating a weighted network.</p><p id="P51">To determine the influence of each node on the network, we computed four centrality indices: strength, betweenness, closeness, and expected influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Opsahl et al., 2010</xref>). Strength signifies the node’s direct connections to other nodes (absolute sum of nodes direct edge weights). Betweenness measures how often a node appears in the shortest path between other nodes (sum of number of times a node is in the middle of two other nodes), indicating its importance in connecting other nodes. Closeness represents nodes with the most indirect connections (sum of nodes distance: inverse of the sum of inverted edge weights). Lastly, expected influence is calculated as the sum of edge weights including both positive and negative weights, signifying the anticipated impact on activating/deactivating other nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Robinaugh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P52">We assessed the network’s accuracy and stability through edge-weight accuracy and centrality stability evaluations. First, we estimated 95% confidence intervals using non-parametric bootstrapping with 2,500 bootstraps for edge-weight accuracy. We then evaluated centrality stability by conducting case-dropping subset bootstrapping with 2,500 bootstraps and determining the consistency of centrality indices in each subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Epskamp et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we tested for significant differences across centrality indices and edges.</p><p id="P53">We investigated community structures of nodes identified via a Spinglass modularity-based community detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Reichardt &amp; Bornholdt, 2006</xref>). This algorithm is suited for networks with both positive and negative edge weights.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Physiological and psychological fingerprints</title><p id="P54">We investigated the physiological and psychological fingerprints of average body-wandering, average cognitive-wandering, and negative affective mind-wandering via false-discovery rate corrected Spearman’s correlation matrices. Additional partial correlations controlled for age, gender, and BMI. Post-hoc correlations were performed with individual mind-wandering items with any significant psychological score or physiological metric from the averaged mind-wandering correlations. Finally, we conducted backward stepwise multiple linear regressions to determine significant psychological and physiological predictors of body vs cognitive-wandering.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Canonical correlation analysis</title><p id="P55">In this study, we used the CCA-PLS toolbox to fit cross-validated Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) models relating whole-brain functional connectivity matrices to individual body-wandering and cognitive-wandering (MDIES) items. The CCA-PLS toolbox is a MATLAB-based software designed for investigating multivariate associations between multiple modalities of data, such as brain imaging and behavioural measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Mihalik et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, CCA aims to find linear combinations of each multidimensional variable (i.e., canonical variates, which are weighted sums: connectivity (i.e., V = X * B) and body/cognitive-wandering (i.e., U = Y * A)) that are maximally correlated with each other, but uncorrelated with all other combinations (X and Y represent the inputted data, while A and B represent the canonical weights/vectors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Linke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Mihalik et al., 2022</xref>). The toolbox incorporates various CCA/PLS models, including the cross-validated and optimised PCA-CCA techniques applied here.</p><p id="P56">We began by preprocessing the whole-brain functional connectivity matrices and individual MDIES items, ensuring that each dataset was standardised to have zero mean and unit variance. Furthermore, we regressed nuisance covariates (i.e., gender, age, bmi, data collection cohort) from both the connectivity and MDIES item variables. Subsequently, we applied the cross-validated CCA approach within the predictive framework (i.e., machine learning) provided by the CCA-PLS toolbox. This predictive approach involved randomly splitting the data into an optimization/training set (i.e., 60% of the overall data) and a holdout/test set (i.e., 40% of the overall data) 5 times (i.e., 5-fold cross-validation). These optimization and holdout sets are known as the ‘outer data splits’, used for statistical inference (i.e., determining the number of significant associative CCA effects/modes). The p-values were calculated via permutation testing (i.e., 1000 permutations), as the fraction of the shuffled permuted out-of-sample correlations exceeding the out-of-sample correlation in the non-permuted holdout set. Because we implemented 5 holdout sets, the p-value for each holdout set was Bonferroni corrected (i.e., <italic>a</italic> = 0.05/5 = 0.01). An associative CCA effect was considered significant if the p-value was significant in at least one of the holdout sets. If a significant associative CCA effect was found, the CCA iteratively removes the effect from the data via deflation and repeats this approach to find orthogonal CCA associative effects.</p><p id="P57">Furthermore, because we conducted PCA before CCA (to reduce the connectivity data and body/cognitive mind-wandering item data dimensions), we further divided the optimization set into a training set (i.e., 60% of the optimization set) and a validation set (i.e., 40% of the optimization set) 5 times (i.e., 5-fold hyperparameter optimization). These ‘inner data splits’ were used to select the optimal hyperparameters (i.e., number of PCA components for each dataset) by maximising the average out-of-sample correlation in the validation sets (i.e., model generalizability). In addition to evaluating model generalizability via the predictive approach, we assessed the stability of the CCA models by measuring the average similarity of weights across different training sets. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness (i.e., number of significant data splits) of the CCA model (80%).</p><p id="P58">To visualise the results, we plotted the maximally correlated canonical variate via a scatter plot, and the connectivity and body/cognitive-wandering structure correlations (i.e., Pearson’s correlations between inputted variables and respective canonical variates) using a chord plot, and bar plot/word cloud, respectively. Bar plots and word clouds were used to display the individual mind-wandering item loadings (structure correlations of raw items with the mind-wandering variate), while chord plots provided a graphical representation of the connections between brain regions and their corresponding loadings (structure correlations of raw functional connectivity data with the functional connectivity variate), thresholded at showing the top 99th percentile of the connectivity loadings. To visualise the brain networks contributing to the CCA result, we organised top connectivity loadings in the chord plot according to yeo-7 networks (Yeo et al., 2011). In addition, recently there has been interest in the properties of an ‘interoceptive-allostatic network’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kleckner et al., 2017</xref>). To define this network we reviewed the neuroanatomy and functional imaging literature on interoception and defined cortical regions in the interoceptive network as follows: insular cortex, cingulate cortex, frontal orbital cortex, frontal medial cortex, postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex), and central opercular cortex (secondary somatosensory cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Craig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Engelen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Khalsa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kleckner et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we illustrated the highest contributing nodes by summing the amount of edge connections above the 99th percentile cutoff for each node. This was plotted on a standard mni152 brain template using MRIcroGL at the following MNI coordinates: 8, -20, 28. These visualisations allowed for a clearer understanding of the associations between the whole-brain functional connectivity matrices and individual body/cognitive-wandering items, highlighting the key brain-behaviour relationships identified by our cross-validated CCA model.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Gradient map association</title><p id="P59">We investigated the localisation of the body-wandering CCA result in relation to five brain variation gradient maps from the Human Connectome Project resting connectivity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). These gradients (five cortical and subcortical surface atlases) were extracted from Neurovault (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neurovault.org/collections/1598/">https://neurovault.org/collections/1598/</ext-link>). The combined 200-cortical-region Schaefer-16-subcortical-region atlas was converted to surface space using the freesurfer function ‘<italic>mri_vol2surf’</italic> (this removed the bilateral caudate as these deep subcortical regions were not represented in surface space). For each of the five gradient maps, we averaged the gradient values of the top CCA brain parcels (parcels which passed the top 1% threshold of the connectivity CCA loadings) and generated a null distribution with 2500 permutations via a spin-test which shuffles the gradient values. The p-values were generated by comparing the overall gradient average across the top CCA brain regions, with the 2500 null averages generated from the spin-test. The five p-values computed from repeating this process for each of the five gradient atlases, were Bonferroni corrected (i.e., <italic>a</italic> = 0.05/5 = 0.01).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199683-supplement-Supplementary_Material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d47aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research is financially supported by a Lundbeckfonden Fellowship (R272-2017-4345) and a European Research Council Grant (ERC-2020-StG-948788) awarded to MGA.

However, research has predominantly taken a cognitive perspective, overlooking the embodied influences on conscious experience. Our study addresses this gap by demonstrating the unique contribution of body-related and interoceptive thoughts to waking cognition. This "body-wandering" was associated with increased negative affect, heightened physiological arousal, and reduced ADHD symptoms, along with a distinct neural signature involving interoceptive, somatomotor, and subcortical networks. Conversely, cognitive mind-wandering was linked to decreased negative affect, lower arousal, and increased depressive symptoms. Incorporating embodied processes into models of mind-wandering provides a more comprehensive theoretical framework and reveals how these experiences influence our emotional state and mental health.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Ongoing thought item ratings including body-related, cognitive, and affective content (MDIES) after resting state MRI.</title><p>(Left) Boxplots of MDIES item ratings (pink: body-related items and blue: classical cognitive/affective items).
