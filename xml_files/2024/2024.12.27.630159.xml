Amongst them are sealed leaves preventing desiccation that are interspersed with adjustable breathing pores (=stomata) that enable plant-atmosphere gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</xref>). Additional evolutionary innovations like plant organ succulence and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), a highly water-use efficient photosynthetic lifestyle, further unlocked extremely water-scarce environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Griffiths and Males, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heyduk, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sage et al., 2023</xref>). CAM plants open stomata primarily at night and fix carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into an organic acid intermediate stored in vacuoles. During the day, stomata are mostly closed, the storage intermediate is decarboxylated, and the free CO<sub>2</sub> is assimilated in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Borland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Osmond, 1978</xref>). Most succulent plants employ CAM photosynthesis and many CAM plants form stomata, where the central guard cells (GCs) are flanked or surrounded by putative subsidiary cells (SCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Males and Griffiths, 2017</xref>). Stomata in the emerging leaf succulent CAM model <italic>Kalanchoë laxiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boxall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hartwell et al., 2016</xref>), for example, consist of two kidney-shaped GCs surrounded by three unequally sized (=anisocytic), circularly arranged SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). These SCs are distinct in size and shape compared to the puzzle-shaped pavement cells (PCs), and thus fulfil the original definition of stomatal SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esau, 1965</xref>). Yet, even though SCs are overrepresented in CAM plants, it remained unclear if they indeed serve as helper cells to support stomatal opening and closing like in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Durney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Franks and Farquhar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Unlike many CAM plants, the C<sub>3</sub> eudicot and Brassicaceae model <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> does not form SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Consequently, the two GCs are surrounded by puzzle-shaped PCs only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, three basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors guide stomatal development. <italic>AtSPEECHLESS</italic> (<italic>AtSPCH</italic>) determines stomatal precursors (=meristemoids) and drives asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">MacAlister et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>AtMUTE</italic> ends asymmetric divisions, establishes the guard mother cell (GMC) and induces the symmetric division forming the GC pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Han et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pillitteri et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, <italic>AtFAMA</italic> represses symmetric division potential and controls GC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>). While this bHLH module is conserved from mosses to flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chater et al., 2017</xref>), it was amplified, sub-functionalized, modified and rewired to generate different stomatal morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chater et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Raissig et al., 2016</xref>). In grasses, for example, MUTE is not required for GMC identity but rather acquired cell-to-cell mobility to establish subsidiary mother cells (SMCs) in cells adjacent to the GMC, which then divide asymmetrically to contribute perigene SCs (i.e. from a distinct cell lineage to those that lead to GCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, though, both SCs and GCs are formed by the same precursor cell (= meristemoid), which seems to undergo many rounds of spiralling amplifying divisions, resulting in mesogene SCs (i.e. from the same lineage as GCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cheng and Raissig, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rudall et al., 2013</xref>). Yet how often, and in which pattern, meristemoids divide, why some divisions yield SCs and which genetic programs control these divisions remained elusive.</p><p id="P6">Here, we use the eudicot succulent CAM model <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> (Oxford Botanical Garden, OBG accession) to determine the functional relevance of SCs, the division patterns that form SCs and the genetic program that enables SC divisions. We sequenced <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> OBG’s diploid genome, established efficient transgenesis protocols, and optimized horticultural protocols to efficiently induce flowering and viable seed production and reduce the life cycle to less than 6 months. Together, this makes <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> OBG an ideal model system to dissect developmental mechanisms in a leaf succulent plant. Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) staining revealed K<sup>+</sup> shuttling between GCs and SCs during stomatal movements, suggesting that the SCs are indeed physiological helper cells, as in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Raschke and Fellows, 1971</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of developing leaves showed that additional rounds of amplifying divisions, which do not occur in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, generated the mesogenous, anisocytic SCs. Mutant, reporter and overexpression analysis of the duplicated <italic>KlaxMUTE1</italic> and <italic>KlaxMUTE2</italic> genes provided strong support for the conclusion that <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> MUTEs control an asymmetric division program that generates SCs. <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic>’ novel function in driving SC divisions was species-context-dependent and could not be transferred to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Finally, transcriptome analysis indicated that <italic>Klax-MUTE1</italic> activated specific cell-cycle programs associated with asymmetric rather than symmetric cell divisions and delayed GC differentiation. Together, our work uncovered, for the first time, the intricate genetic mechanisms that govern the formation of functionally relevant, anisocytic SCs in the Crassulaceae family that likely play a pivotal role in the CAM photosynthetic lifestyle.</p><sec id="S2"><title>K<sup>+</sup> shuttling during stomatal movements suggests subsidiary cells to be functionally relevant</title><p id="P7">To determine if <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> SCs are indeed helper cells that contribute to stomatal opening and closing, we precipitated the major stomatal osmolyte potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) in open and closed stomata in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D and E</xref>). Incubation of epidermal leaf peels with Fusicoccin and ABA successfully opened and closed stomata, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Upon treatments, K<sup>+</sup> precipitation showed that K<sup>+</sup> primarily resides in SCs in closed stomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and moves to GCs in open stomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). This strongly suggests that, much like in grasses, SCs contribute to osmolyte shuttling and thus turgor control of stomatal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Raschke and Fellows, 1971</xref>). Quantification of K<sup>+</sup> levels in open and closed stomata, however, suggested that residual K<sup>+</sup> remains in SCs even when stomata are open (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Additional rounds of asymmetric meristemoid divisions generate subsidiary cells</title><p id="P8">Mature <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> stomata consist of two paired GCs surrounding the pore and three unequally sized and circularly arranged SCs. In addition, the complete stomatal complex is surrounded by 2 to 3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We previously suggested that protodermal cells undergo 5 to 6 rounds of stem-cell-like asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) following a Fibonacci spiral pattern, where the first 2 to 3 divisions generate stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) and the following three ACDs generate SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cheng and Raissig, 2023</xref>). To unequivocally describe stomatal development in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, we employed manual time-lapse imaging of developing leaves expressing a plasma membrane reporter gene (<italic>35Sp:mCherry-AtPIP1;4</italic>) to follow developing stomatal complexes over 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, Movie S1). Indeed, a meristemoid mother cell executed an initial entry division (stage 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The smaller cell then divided asymmetrically two more times forming SLGCs while maintaining a small, stem-cell-like meristemoid (stage 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Much like in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, SLGCs can directly differentiate into PCs or execute a spacing division to establish an additional meristemoid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>). After the entry division and two SLGC divisions, the meristemoid divided three additional times to produce SCs, which could not execute further spacing divisions (stage 4 to 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). After three SC divisions, the meristemoid then adopted GMC identity, rounded up (stage 7), and divided symmetrically to form GCs (stage 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). We therefore suggest two distinct meristemoid stages; a meristemoid1 stage that produces SLGCs and a meristemoid2 stage that produces SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, the developmental mechanisms and genetic modules that control the meristemoid1-to-meristemoid2 transition and the SLGC versus SC divisions remained unknown.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>klaxmute1;klaxmute2</italic> cannot form functional stomatal complexes and shows aberrant asymmetric divisions</title><p id="P9">In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the <italic>MUTE</italic> transcription factor ends meristemoid ACDs and controls the meristemoid-to-GMC transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Han et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pillitteri et al., 2007</xref>).

In <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, the duplicated <italic>MUTE</italic> homologs <italic>KlaxMUTE1</italic> and <italic>KlaxMUTE2</italic> show an extended C-terminal amino acid tail as is the case for all grass <italic>MUTE</italic> homologs, but unlike most other eudicot homologs, suggesting a function more similar to grasses rather than <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>). We used gene editing to induce mutations in both <italic>KlaxMUTE</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). While the single mutants did not show a mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4A</xref>), <italic>klaxmute1;klaxmute2</italic> double mutants arrested growth as young seedlings and failed to form mature stomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4B</xref>). Instead, we observed additional, misoriented ACDs that violated the Fibonacci spiral pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H and J</xref>). This indicated a role for the <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic> beyond controlling the meristemoid-to-GMC transition observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>KlaxMUTE1</italic> and <italic>KlaxMUTE2</italic> reporter genes are expressed during subsidiary cell divisions</title><p id="P10">To observe when and where <italic>KlaxMUTE1</italic> and <italic>Klax-MUTE2</italic> are expressed, we generated transcriptional and translational reporter lines for both <italic>KlaxMUTE</italic> homologs. Strikingly, both transcriptional reporters (<italic>KlaxMUTE1p:m-Cit-eGFP</italic><sup><italic>nls</italic></sup> and <italic>KlaxMUTE2p:mCit-eGFP</italic><sup><italic>nls</italic></sup>) started to be expressed in meristemoids after the first three ACDs (i.e. entry division and two SLGC divisions) concomitant with the meristemoid1-to-meristemoid2 transition (stage 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> to C). The two <italic>KlaxMUTE</italic> promoters remained active throughout all meristemoid2 divisions that generate SCs and peaked in GMCs (stage 4 to 6-7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). A similar expression window was observed with translational reporters (<italic>KlaxMUTE1p:mCit-KlaxMUTE1, KlaxMUTE2p:m-Cit-KlaxMUTE2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Weak expression of both translational reporter lines was first detected during the meristemoid1-to-meristemoid2 transition (stage 3) and was maintained until after the symmetric GMC division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Both translational reporters increased in expression strength during the SC divisions, yet seemed to be downregulated post-mitotically in the newly formed SCs–potentially to prevent ectopic divisions in SCs. During GMC formation (stage 6-7), we observed strong nuclear and weak cytoplasmic signals in GMCs and a re-appearing signal in SCs. The signal intensity decreased quickly in all cells after the symmetric GMC division (stage 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>), but remained longer in divided GCs and sometimes weak signal remained in the smallest SC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5</xref>). Together, the expression window of <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic> coincided exactly with all SC divisions, suggesting a novel role that facilitates the formation of anisocytic SCs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Overexpression of <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic> induces ectopic asymmetric divisions</title><p id="P11">The key experiment in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> that firmly determined MUTE’s role in ending ACDs and committing GMC identity was its overexpression.

Together, this strongly suggested that the <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic> induce an asymmetric division program to form SCs rather than establishing GMC identity and ending ACDs, as is the case in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Indeed, observing young developing leaves (0.5 cm) showed numerous ectopic ACDs and many more, and much smaller, cells in the leaf epidermis compared to similar-sized wild-type leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6A to C</xref>). Despite these massive changes to leaf epidermal development, the overexpression lines grew reasonably well but formed slightly cupshaped, curved leaves, which might be caused by imbalanced abaxial and adaxial tissue growth patterns as a consequence of ectopic divisions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">While we cannot fully determine the identity of the ectopically formed small cells, circumstantial evidence suggested them to be SC-like cells.

The numerous ectopic small cells in the overexpression lines mostly remained white indicating SC-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, PCs are known to endoreduplicate and are thus of higher-order ploidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Melaragno et al., 1993</xref>).

Considering the substantial evolutionary distance between monocot grasses and eudicot Crassulaceae succulents, and the distinct ontogeny of their perigene and mesogene SCs, respectively, this is a remarkable example of a convergent genetic mechanism. We propose that <italic>KlaxMUTE1</italic> and <italic>KlaxMUTE2</italic> control the transition from meristemoid1, which executes a <italic>SPCH</italic>-like ACD program generating SLGCs, to meristemoid2, which generates SCs instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>AtMUTE</italic> terminates asymmetric divisions, commits meristemoids to GMCs and promotes their symmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Han et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pillitteri et al., 2007</xref>). The diverse role of the different MUTE proteins, however, seemed not to be encoded within the proteins themselves, as the ACD promoting versus ACD inhibiting function could not be transferred from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, or vice versa. Instead, MUTE proteins activate divergent, species-specific downstream genetic programs to modify developmental programs required to generate GCs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and SCs in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>. This is of little surprise considering that changes to cis-regulatory elements of putative target genes are likely less deleterious and more flexible than mutating the transcription factor itself, and mutations within cis-elements are observed repeatedly as a strategy generating phenotypic divergence within plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Marand et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wittkopp and Kalay, 2011</xref>).

Potentially, SC differentiation is induced directly, post-mitotically, as a daughter cell of a meristemoid2 division. Alternatively, <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic>’ presence in SCs might be required during the GMC stage (stage 6-7), and/or the GMC itself might be involved in the establishment of SC identity through cellular signalling processes. Indeed, expression of both <italic>KlaxMUTEs</italic> increased in stage 6-7 SCs, which could be due to reinforced cell-autonomous translation, or additional cell-to-cell mobility, as is known for grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>KlaxMUTEs’</italic> translational reporter signal in both nucleus and cytoplasm of GMCs was consistent with those of other mobile transcription factors like BdMUTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>), or AtSHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nakajima et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Finally, staining for K<sup>+</sup> within open and closed stomata revealed that the SCs of succulent leaves of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> are indeed functionally relevant, and likely act as stomatal helper cells.

Unlike in grasses, where the perigene SCs stem from a distinct cell lineage to the one that generates GCs, the <italic>klaxmute1;klaxmute2</italic> double mutant aborted both SC and GC formation as they are consecutively formed by the same cell lineage. To show unequivocally the physiological role of SCs using genetic ablations, even more sophisticated transgene approaches like cell-type-specific amiRNAs or well-timed rescue of GMC formation, will be required. We speculate, however, that SCs might be pressurized when GCs are closed to minimize stomatal conductance efficiently and prevent daytime transpiration. Indeed, the substantial larger total volume of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> SCs compared to GCs and the fact that SCs are rarely completely devoid of K<sup>+</sup>, even when forced open, indicate a more prominent role of SCs during stomatal closing.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, our work shows that, much like in monocots, MUTE can be flexibly deployed to facilitate the development of SCs in CAM succulents in the eudicot family Crassulaceae.

The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit with optional on-column DNAse digest [Qiagen]. The quantity and quality of the purified total RNA was assessed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Qubit 4.0 fluorometer with the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q10211] and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer System using a Fragment Analyzer RNA Kit [Agilent, DNF-471], respectively. Sequencing libraries were made with 500 ng input RNA using a Revelo mRNA-Seq for MagicPrep NGS kit B [Tecan, PN 30186622] according to the Revelo mRNA-Seq for MagicPrep NGS User Guide [Tecan publication number MO1535, v1] with 15 cycles of PCR. The resulting cDNA libraries were evaluated using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Qubit 4.0 fluorometer with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32854] and an Agilent Fragment Analyzer [Agilent] with a HS NGS Fragment Kit [Agilent, DNF-474], respectively. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced paired-end using an illumina NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (200 cycles; [illumina, 20040719]) on an illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. The quality of the sequencing run was assessed using illumina Sequencing Analysis Viewer (illumina version 2.4.7) and all base call files were demultiplexed and converted into FASTQ files using illumina bcl2fastq conversion software v2.20. The quality control assessments, generation of libraries and sequencing was conducted by the Next Generation Sequencing Platform, University of Bern. Approximately 23 - 33 million reads were generated per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S3</xref>). RNA-seq data have been deposited in GEO under accession code GSE.</p><p id="P71">The reads were mapped against the <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> OBG genome using HISAT2 and counted using htseq-count on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</ext-link>.
