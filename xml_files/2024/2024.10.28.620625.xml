Here, we use nanoscale DNA-tracing in single dividing cells to directly visualize how the 3D fold of genomic DNA changes during mitosis, at scales from single loops to entire chromosomes. Our structural analysis reveals a characteristic genome scaling minimum at 6-8 Mbp in mitosis. Combined with data-driven modeling and molecular perturbations, we can show that very large and strongly overlapping loops formed by Condensins are the fundamental structuring principle of mitotic chromosomes. These loops compact chromosomes locally and globally to the limit set by chromatin self-repulsion. The characteristic length, density and increasingly overlapping structure of mitotic loops we observe in 3D, fully explain how the rod-shaped mitotic chromosome structure emerges by self-organization during cell division.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Upon cell division, chromosomes undergo major shape changes into compact and stiff rod-like entities enabling their segregation into daughter cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Normal mitotic chromosome structure depends on loop-extruding Condensin complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Studies using quantitative imaging of Condensins in single cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> or biochemical cross-linking of genomic DNA followed by sequencing (HiC) in synchronized cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> have hypothesized hierarchical looping models to underlie mitotic chromosome structure. According to these models, the two Condensin isoforms should fold chromosomal DNA initially into larger loops (~500 kb) and then subdivide them into smaller (~100 kb) loops. Early classical EM-studies on extracted chromosomes already suggested a loop-like organization of mitotic chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, but the high density of DNA in mitotic chromosomes has precluded a direct visualization of its fold in natively fixed cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, the in situ internal organization of mitotic chromosomes remains unresolved, and it remains unclear how the higher-order functional properties of mitotic chromosomes for genome inheritance emerge from the molecular scale structure. Fluorescence based DNA tracing enables direct visualization of genome organization in single cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> but has so far not been applied to mitotic chromosomes. We have previously established a mild, structure-preserving DNA tracing workflow (LoopTrace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>), based on targeted single strand resection of DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which allows high-fidelity nanoscale tracing of single chromatids in situ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we apply LoopTrace to visualize the organization of mitotic chromosomes from the kilobase to full chromosome scale in single dividing cells, and use this structural data for polymer simulations, allowing us to propose a self-organization model for mitotic chromosome folding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Multiscale DNA tracing from interphase to metaphase</title><p id="P3">To obtain the first direct view of chromosome refolding from interphase to metaphase, we designed FISH probe libraries for tracing entire human chromosomes (using chromosomes 2 and 14 as examples) at 1 Mb genomic resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), 10 Mb regions at 200 kb resolution, as well as 1.2 Mb regions at 12 kb resolution. After refining our protocols for non-denaturing DNA tracing at the nanoscale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> for mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>), we could routinely generate multiscale chromosome traces from interphase to metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Importantly, sequential imaging of the 12 kb resolved regions achieved a median of 85% trace-completeness and better than 25 nm 3D precision, sufficient to reliably resolve individual DNA loops (estimated to be ~100-500 kb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C, D</xref>). As expected, interphase chromosomes appeared overall as distinct ellipsoid territories within the cell nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and DNA looping structures consistent with known TADs were readily visualized at 12 kb resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, F</xref>). Upon entry into mitosis such genomically reproducibly positioned clusters of small loops were no longer present and instead variably positioned, longer and increasingly backfolded DNA loops appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> prophase to metaphase at 1.2 Mb and 10 Mb resolutions). At the same time, chromosomes started to individualize into long, thin and often irregularly bent and variably compacted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). During prometaphase, chromosomes became more contiguously axially compacted, when their arms thickened and straightened, which continued until they reached a compact, rod-like and often overall V-like shape in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G, H</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Having 3D traces from hundreds of mitotically staged single cells allowed us to quantitatively analyze changes in the DNA fold during mitosis, including the abundance, size and internal nesting of loops, as well as the radius of gyration as a general measure of chromosome compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Interestingly, mitotic chromosomes exhibited a significant increase in the number and size of loops from prophase onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-D</xref>). This was followed by an increase in nesting of loops with overlapping bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref> loop measurement illustration, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-D</xref>) starting in prometaphase when the major wave of Condensin I binding occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Nesting expectedly coincided with a significant decrease of the radius of gyration, indicating that loop-scale compaction occurs mainly in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-D</xref>). However, the decrease of the radius of gyration began already in prophase, indicating that both loop size increase and loop backfolding and nesting underlie mitotic chromosome compaction. Analyzing these parameters revealed that the structural features that change during mitosis are well sampled at this genomic resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The multiscale DNA tracing of mitotic chromosomes also provided an opportunity to examine the question of higher order regularity of the DNA fold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. We did not observe a highly regular organization at either the whole chromosome, the 10 Mb regions or at the scale of single loops within 1 Mb subregions, suggesting that loops are stochastically organized relative to the geometric chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, metaphase). Consistently, statistical analysis of symmetry parameters relative to the central axis did not show significant helicity at the full chromosome scale (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mitotic chromosome scaling dips at 6-8 Mb</title><p id="P6">If mitotic chromosomes become more compact at each scale, their genomic versus physical 3D distance scaling should also change from interphase to mitosis. To probe distance scaling of chromosomal DNA for additional structural features that might arise during mitosis, we plotted all pairwise Euclidian distances versus the respective pairwise genomic distance for all traces obtained at the three genomic scales, grouped by cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). This analysis revealed a characteristic scaling behavior of mitotic chromosomes. As expected from the increase in close contacts, mitotic chromosomes showed a significantly higher compaction at the 200 kb - 1Mb scale starting in prophase, which was essentially completed in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, this correlated with a slight decompaction of chromatin at short genomic distances of less than 200 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F, G</xref>). At the 1 - 10 megabase scale, mitotic chromosomes showed an increasing long-range compaction in prophase to prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Not predictable from the loop-scale physical distance metrics, the scaling analysis revealed a higher order local minimum at 6-8 megabases indicating increased backfolding of chromatin. This scaling “dip” at large genomic distance appeared in prometaphase and became even more pronounced in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F, G</xref>). It was also clearly present at the whole chromosome scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>), showing that it is a general structural feature and not specific to the three analyzed 10 Mb regions. The whole-chromosome scaling plot furthermore showed that while chromosomes are already significantly more compact in prophase than in interphase at a scale below 10 Mb, they are not yet maximally compacted along their entire length and display a rather irregular scaling behavior above 10 Mb early in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). By contrast, in prometa- and metaphase, global chromosome compaction is largely completed, with a smooth linear scaling behavior above the 6-8 Mb mitotic dip.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mitotic chromosome structural features depend on Condensins</title><p id="P8">The presence of the directly traced, on average 300 kb long, mitosis-specific loops that became increasingly nested would be expected to be the result of loop extrusion activity by Condensin complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To test which structural features of mitotic chromosomes depend on loop extrusion across the sampled scales, we depleted Condensins prior to mitosis in HeLa Kyoto cells with the Condensin subunit SMC4 endogenously tagged with an auxin-inducible degron in all alleles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We then performed multiscale chromatin tracing of Condensin-depleted metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>) and analysed the 3D trace parameters as well as their genomic-physical distance scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B, C</xref>). As expected, Condensin depletion resulted in a dramatic loss of individual mitotic loops and their nesting and a corresponding decrease in number of close contacts, demonstrating that mitotic DNA loops and their nesting depend on Condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Strikingly, when we examined the distance scaling relationship, the characteristic mitotic dip at 6-8 Mb was also completely abolished in ΔSMC4 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). In addition, the smooth linear distance scaling behavior above 10 Mb became rather variable after Condensin depletion, consistent with the irregular and no longer clearly rod-like shape chromosomes exhibited in the corresponding 3D traces of entire chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Consistently, ΔSMC4 chromosomes also failed to reduce their radius of gyration as a measure of general compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, not only individual mitotic loops and their internal nesting, leading to local compaction, but also the characteristic mitotic 6-8 Mb dip and the compaction of entire chromosomes depend on Condensins.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loop extrusion and self-repulsion correctly predict mitotic chromosome structure</title><p id="P9">How then could micrometer-scale rod-shaped mitotic chromosomes arise from molecular scale architecture of individual DNA loops? Previous theoretical work has shown that, in principle, a self-avoiding polymer fibre constrained by cross-links<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> or loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> could form a rod-like shape through entropic self-repulsion. This is because crosslinks/loops backfold the fibre on the one hand, while on the other hand the increased density of loops leads to more frequent collisions and a self-repulsion of loops that seeks to maximize the polymer’s available conformational space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">While it is clear from our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> that the Condensin complexes are required for the formation of stiff mitotic chromosome rods, if the generation of loops alone is sufficient to explain our newly determined 3D structure and scaling properties of mitotic chromosomes remained unclear. To test this mechanistically, we set up a polymer model of mitotic chromosomes constrained by the currently available quantitative experimental data on Condensins (see below) to compare it to our DNA tracing data. Building on pioneering work by the Mirny group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and their open-source simulation framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/open2c/polychrom">https://github.com/open2c/polychrom</ext-link>), we simulated a realistic human chromosome of 100 Mb as a chain of 100,000 beads (e.g. 1 kb/bead), ensured volume exclusion through repulsion between monomers. and physically scaled the unconstrained polymer by high resolution ΔSMC4 traces (Fig S3A). We dynamically simulated Condensin-driven loop extrusion by the sequential action of initially two stably bound Condensin II complexes per megabase for 10 minutes (prophase to nuclear envelope break down) and then ten dynamically bound Condensin I complexes for an additional 30 minutes (prometa- to metaphase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>). Where available, we used parameters for Condensin abundance and DNA residence time determined in vivo, and used single molecule in vitro measurements for their uni-directional extrusion rate and high passing frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Otherwise, our model was assumption-free especially regarding the structure of the polymer.</p><p id="P11">We found that this realistic and data driven polymer model has an excellent fit to our tracing data across the three experimentally measured scales from prophase to metaphase with an extrusion rate of 4±2 kbps and free passing of Condensins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie S1</xref>). The simulation shows that Condensin-driven loop extrusion is sufficient to generate the experimentally observed mitotic chromosome fold and overall shape. Importantly, the simulation shows that the number of Condensin II complexes present in these cells, that are stably bound throughout mitosis, can extrude overlapping loops of on average 6-8 megabases when they freely pass each other. The size and overlapping nature of these loops directly explains the distance scaling minimum we observed in pro-/metaphase. By contrast, the number of Condensin I complexes present in cells, that are bound only for minutes, lead to nesting inside these large loops, thereby increasing the DNA density and number of loops and thus their self-repulsion. Our simulations furthermore show that loop extrusion and chromatin self-repulsion are sufficient to induce a straightening of the mitotic chromosome rod as its length shortens and its width increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which is caused by increased self-repulsion of DNA at the concave side of the bent chromosome. Thus, the simulation explains the rod-shape and rigidity of chromosomes by a balance of the long-distance compaction forces of large, overlapping loops and the self-repulsion of these loops due to the entropic resistance of the polymer chain to be packed too densely.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The extrusion-repulsion model predicts realistic Condensin localization</title><p id="P12">If the core mechanism of self-organization is indeed Condensin driven loop extrusion, our polymer model should also be able to predict other structural features of mitotic chromosome architecture. We asked the simulation to output the predicted sub-chromosomal localizations of the two types of Condensin complexes in metaphase chromosomes. Without prior assumptions on Condensin positioning, the model predicted that Condensin II should localize more centrally with the chromosome, while Condensin I should localize more peripherally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4F, G</xref>). Strikingly, these predictions match previous experimental measurements of Condensin isoform localizations within the chromosome by super-resolution microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We can conclude that self-organization of chromosomal DNA by extrusion of long overlapping loops by Condensin II, nested by abundant and dynamic short-range loops by Condensin I and their self-repulsion is sufficient to explain how the experimentally observed structural and higher order emergent properties of mitotic chromosomes are generated.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Global compaction is influenced by self-repulsion</title><p id="P14">In addition to loop extrusion, chromatin modifications have been reported to influence global mitotic chromosome organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We therefore asked if we could accurately predict the effect of a change in chromatin modifications, independent of changes to loop extrusion. We thus modeled an experimentally accessible chromatin modification, i.e. the net negative charge of histones, which can be changed with inhibition of histone deacetylases (TSA), which leads to hyperacetylation of normally positively charged lysines on histone tails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. More negatively charged chromatin should result in a higher self-avoidance, due to electrostatic and/or steric effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To predict the effect of higher self-avoidance in our model, we increased the monomer repulsion in our simulated polymer and observed a uniform expansion of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-E</xref>). Importantly, the model predicted that this global expansion of chromatin can occur without affecting the Condensin driven loop organization, and thus predicts that the main structural effect of higher self-repulsion should be to limit the density to which DNA loops can be packed. To validate this prediction experimentally, we performed mitotic chromosome tracing in cells in which histone deacetylase had been inhibited with TSA. TSA treated cells indeed exhibited unchanged Condensin-driven structural features such as loop abundance, size and nesting, as well as a preserved characteristic scaling dip at 6-8 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-D</xref>). By contrast, TSA-treated mitotic chromosomes exhibited a clear, multiscale decompaction of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>), leading to a 20% expansion of chromatid width and length, consistent with model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D, E</xref>). Thus, our model can discriminate the distinct contributions of loop extrusion and chromatin state in shaping mitotic chromosomes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observation that TSA treatment leads to global decompaction of mitotic chromosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Here, we present DNA tracing data of native mitotic chromosomes. Combining multiscale 3D DNA tracing in single cells with mechanistic exploration of data-constrained polymer simulations, we have found that the fine-scale structure and the large-scale emergent properties of mitotic chromosomes, including their characteristic rod-like shape can be explained by a simple self-organization mechanism driven by the counteracting forces of Condensin-driven loop extrusion and self-repulsion of DNA.</p><p id="P16">Extrusion of on average 6-8 Mb long Condensin II loops, that overlap with each other multiple times in a gapless manner along the whole chromosomal DNA molecule is a key structuring element of this model. This shortens the axial length of the polymer and enforces stacking of DNA when reaching the self-repulsion limit. Importantly, the progressive formation of long, overlapping loops require processive loop extrusion as long as Condensin is bound to DNA, which has been shown to occur in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Passing of Condensin motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> is also key to generate gapless overlaps between loops, especially in the light of the reported unidirectional extrusion of Condensins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Combined, the processivity while bound and passing allow Condensin loops to reach the average 6-8 Mb size that recapitulates the observed distance scaling minimum. The redundancy in loop overlaps also explains the robustness of mitotic chromosome shape, despite varying Condensin abundances observed between single mitotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, redundantly overlapping loops provide an explanation for the mechanical resilience of mitotic chromosomes without requiring a contiguous Condensin-based axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Our results are consistent with earlier contact-frequency analyses of cell populations by HiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and provide a fully self-consistent model for how the action of the two Condensin isoforms explain major features of both nanoscale and macroscale organization of mitotic chromatin without additional assumptions of a central axis or external confinement of chromatids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Our model predicts that through the generation of increasingly long loops from prophase to metaphase, Condensin II effectively decreases the length of chromatids while increasing their width. In contrast, the more abundant and dynamically bound Condensin I complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> lead to smaller, short-lived loops nested inside these large loops, that induce a lateral compaction and increase the self-repulsion of the polymer. This self-repulsion in turn will constrain the maximal longitudinal compaction Condensin II can achieve. Our model thus provides a mechanistic explanation for previous observations of global changes to chromosome shape resulting from isoform-specific Condensin depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Previously, a higher-order regular folding of mitotic chromosomes into a helix or a perverted helix has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. While our direct 3D tracing data does not provide support for a regular helix, our polymer simulation can be used to explore under what conditions it could emerge. Key would be that Condensin II motors would extrude loops of highly reproducible length, which would result in regular undulations in pairwise distance scaling from an initial minimum (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>). However, this does not match the experimental data we obtained in cultured human cells. Rather, our direct 3D tracing suggests a wide distribution of Condensin II loop lengths, resulting in the characteristic distance scaling dip at the average loop size of 6-8 Mb, without the formation of a regular, handed helix in individual chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, by providing the first direct visualization of the internal fold of mitotic chromosomes, we have been able to propose a realistic model of the self-organization principles of DNA that allow faithful genome inheritance.

The counteracting forces of gathering the linear DNA molecule into long, overlapping loops and limiting their packing by self-repulsion are sufficient to explain the experimentally determined structures by polymer self-organization.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P20">HeLa Kyoto cells (HK WT: S.

Prior to sequential imaging, 25-35 3D stacks of DAPI-stained nuclei (405 nm excitation), Condensins (488 nm excitation, see Immunofluorescence section) and fiducial beads (561 or 640 excitation) were acquired as reference images for cell classification.

In brief, nd2 image files were converted to OME-ZARR format. Sequential images were registered by cross-correlation, and residual sub-pixel drift was corrected by calculating the mean offset of 3D gaussian centroids of segmented fiducial beads. Images were deconvolved using an experimental PSF extracted from registering and averaging 200 fiducial bead 3D images. Tracing regions were identified and segmented based on regional barcodes using an empirical intensity threshold. Each tracing region was background-corrected by subtraction of a blank frame, and up to 3 potential spots were identified per frame by local peak detection. Centroids of each spot were super-localized by fitting a 3D gaussian function. After filtering for poor fits, the fit closest to the median position of all high-quality unambiguous fits was retained for each frame. Chromatic aberration between Cy3B and Atto643 signals was corrected by least square fitting of the centroid of fiducial beads imaged in both channels, and traces were assigned to nuclei classified as “interphase”, “prophase”, “prometaphase” or “metaphase” based on chromosome organization of each nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Full chromosome trace data analysis</title><p id="P29">Image conversion, registration and deconvolution were performed as for the higher resolution regions. To reduce the required number of tracing cycles, full chromosome sequential frames included the full chromosome regional barcode, 15 Mb segment barcodes and 30 spot barcodes repeating every 30 Mb (spanning 2 segments). Decoding the combined spot and segment identity identified the genomic coordinate of each spot. Full chromosome regions were segmented from regional barcodes using a random forest classifier (scikit-learn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>) trained on 5-10 small foreground and background regions in one field of view. All potential peaks in the region were detected on background-corrected spot frames by local peak detection in scikit-image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and fit by a 3D gaussian. Fits were quality controlled and corrected for chromatic aberration as above. To assign each fit to a 15 Mb segment, the intensity of each fit coordinate was measured in each potentially matching segment frame and assigned a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the peak intensity in all segment frames. To account for the potential presence of FISH signal from multiple chromosomes in the same region of interest, remaining ambiguous fits (i.e. more than one high-quality fit assigned to the same genomic coordinate) were assigned by spectral clustering based on spatial and genomic position into an increasing (1-5) number of clusters until most (75<sup>th</sup> quantile) fits were unambiguously assigned to a chromosome trace. Remaining ambiguous fits were removed by selecting the fits with the highest z-score. Finally, traces were assigned to the cell cycle stage of their parent nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Trace analysis</title><p id="P30">For analysis, 1 Mb and 10 Mb-scale fits were quality-controlled based on fit standard deviation and signal to background ratio, while whole chromosome fits were used directly. Median pairwise Euclidean distances were calculated for all 3D coordinates within a single trace and used to calculate distance scaling plots. A cut-off of minimum 30 points per trace was used. Median pairwise Euclidean distances were also used to compute trace metrics for the 1 Mb regions, with a minimum cut-off of 80 points. To assess potential compaction below the highest tracing resolution, we calculated the sum of sequential 3D distances in each trace (contour length). This measure indicated that no major compaction/de-compaction happened on length scales below the sampling resolution of our chromatin tracing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>), validating that our 12 kb resolution sampled the major fine-scale folding changes during mitosis.</p><p id="P31">Whole chromosome axes were estimated by a 20 Mb rolling mean, and chromosome radius was calculated by the distance from each point to the closest point on the axis. Axial scaling of whole prometa- and metaphase chromosomes were calculated by robust linear regression (Siegel slopes) of physical distance scaling data from 20-60 Mb genomic distances. Loop metrics for the 1 Mb scale were based on a 100 nm 3D distance cutoff to identify loop anchors spanning at least 30 kb genomic distance, and the relative position of loop anchors determined assignment to base loop, z-loop or nested loops categories. Helicity of full chromosome traces was estimated by measuring the standard deviation of radial angles of points sampled at regular genomic intervals. 1 Mb and 10 Mb-scale traces were matched to their corresponding full chromosome traces by spatial proximity of their centroids. 3D nucleus and trace visualizations were done using mayavi after applying a rolling distance filter which removed spurious fits deviating more than 3 standard deviations from the median position of 11-point windows.
