However, its inherently destructive nature hampers the ability to trace regulatory dynamics between mother and daughter cells. Taking advantage of the invariant cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans, we constructed a lineage-resolved single-cell multimodal map of pre-gastrulation development, which allows the tracing of chromatin and gene expression changes across cell divisions and regulatory cascades. We characterise the early dynamics of genome regulation, revealing that zygotic genome activation occurs on an accessible chromatin landscape pre-patterned both maternally and zygotically, and we identify a redundant family of transcriptional regulators that drive a transient pre-gastrulation program. Our findings demonstrate the power of a lineage-resolved atlas for dissecting the genome regulatory events of development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Starting from a single cell, a whole animal is generated by differential interpretation of the genome sequence. While we are beginning to understand the regulatory networks underlying differentiated cell types, we still know little about the genomic controls of development. Unlocking the dynamics of genome regulation is central to understanding how organisms are built.</p><p id="P5">Single-cell profiling provides the means to address this. Profiling gene expression in tissues and organisms has transformed our understanding of cell-type diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rood et al. 2024</xref>), and the ability to profile chromatin accessibility (an indicator of regulatory element activity) in parallel has enabled investigation of the genome regulatory controls of the observed cellular gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Flynn et al. 2023</xref>). However, profiling is inherently destructive, hampering study of the dynamic regulation that controls development. Computational approaches are used to infer cellular progression, and the impressive recent application to co-profiling data from Drosophila and zebrafish embryogenesis has made key progress towards tracking genomic changes across developmental trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Liu et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kim et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Calderon et al. 2022</xref>). However, the methods are unable to establish direct transitions through cell divisions. The ability to co-track gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes between mother and daughter cells would illuminate how the genome is read.</p><p id="P6">Due to its invariant lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sulston et al. 1983</xref>), C. elegans is an organism where this can be done. Profiles of cells from embryos of different ages can be captured and then mapped to their position on the lineage tree, thereby linking mother and daughter cell profiles. A pioneering study profiling gene expression across C. elegans embryogenesis showed the feasibility and power of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Packer et al. 2019</xref>). However, the map lacked genome state information so the genome regulatory processes that drive the observed cellular differences could not be determined.</p><p id="P7">To investigate the genomic and transcriptomic unfolding that underlies the beginning of development, we have generated a map of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single nuclei up to the gastrulation stage. We show that zygotic genome activation occurs on a pre-patterned accessible genome, with some accessible sites maternally inherited and some newly induced in the zygote. We uncover a transient gene expression program shared by pre-gastrulation cells that starts at ZGA, and a family of redundant transcriptional regulators that control the program. The map also reveals stepwise genomic regulation across the different early lineages. Our results illuminate the initial events of genome regulation and demonstrate the power of lineage-resolved multimodal analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A lineage resolved single-cell multimodal atlas of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pre-gastrulation development</title><p id="P8">We generated a single-cell multimodal atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in early development using the 10X Genomics multiome platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Using embryo collections containing predominantly pre-gastrulation embryos, we co-profiled nuclear transcription and chromatin accessibility in single nuclei (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">methods</xref>). Following quality controls, we obtained 48775 high-quality nuclei across five biological replicates, with a median of 1091 detected genes and 1809 ATAC fragments per profiled nucleus.</p><p id="P9">After clustering analyses, we annotated pre-gastrulation cells and a small number of cells at the beginning of gastrulation using cell-type markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1 and 2</xref>) from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tintori et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Packer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cole et al. 2024</xref>) and RNA FISH validation experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The remaining post-gastrulation cells were assigned to a lineage group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Packer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cole et al. 2024</xref>), some small groups of cells in the pre-gastrulation map (e.g., bilaterally symmetric cells) had indistinguishable expression profiles. The earliest cluster consists of nuclei from 2-cell embryos (AB and P1 are unresolved); almost no nuclei from one-celled zygotes were profiled as most had divided by the time nuclei were isolated. In all, the early embryo multimodal map contains 58 different clusters, which contain 192 to 1431 nuclei per cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We observed that some clusters exhibited profiles similar to two annotated sister cells. For example, we labeled one cluster as MSx because it shared characteristics with both MSa and MSp, and another as ABxxxx, representing all 16 AB cells at that stage. These clusters showed high expression of replication-coupled histone genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that they may represent cells recently born and in an early cell cycle stage. To test this, we performed RNA FISH for pes-10 across the AB16 cell cycle, as it is more highly expressed in the shared ABxxxx cluster than in individually annotated AB16 cells. Supporting our hypothesis, early AB16 cells exhibited higher pes-10 levels compared to late AB16 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">After training a random forest classifier on a limited, high-confidence set of early cell cycle clusters, we developed a model to annotate early cell cycle nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). For simplicity we labelled classified cells as “early” and others as “late”, as the specific cell-cycle period captured by the model remains unknown. Using these annotations, we observed gene-specific differences in transcription and chromatin accessibility between early and late cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Further refining the model should illuminate the interplay between genome regulation and the cell cycle.</p><p id="P12">To assess the temporal resolution of our map, we analyzed chromatin and gene expression dynamics during the well-studied early intestinal transcription factor cascade in C. elegans. The early part of the cascade begins with the activation of med-1 and med-2 in the EMS cell at the 4-cell stage by the maternal transcription factor skn-1 and culminates in the expression of elt-2 when there are four intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McGhee 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Our results align with known expression timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McGhee 2013</xref>) and reveal striking temporal dynamics across the cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, the promoters of med-1 and med-2 are open and the genes are transcribed in EMS but promoters are closed and transcription halted in its daughter E. In E, transcription of the targets end-1 and end-3 begins. end-3 is transiently expressed, turning off in Ex, while end-1 continues to be expressed in Ex, where a new regulatory element opens briefly before closing in the Exx daughters. elt-7 begins transcription in the Ex though its promoter opens earlier, in E. Finally, the promoter of elt-2 opens, and its transcription begins, when there are four E daughters (Exx). Such stepwise changes are seen in all lineages (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), underscoring the map’s fine temporal resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Zygotic genome activation starts on a pre-patterned genome</title><p id="P14">In animals, the single-celled totipotent zygote is initially transcriptionally quiescent, regulated by maternally inherited proteins and RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kojima et al. 2024</xref>). A critical event in the transition from maternal to zygotic control is the transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome, termed zygotic genome activation (ZGA). While the mechanisms of ZGA vary across species, they often involve the opening of regulatory elements by pioneer factors during early cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhou &amp; Heald 2023</xref>). In C. elegans, ZGA begins in the three somatic blastomeres at the 4-cell stage. The fourth blastomere, germline precursor P2 remains quiescent. This is triggered by the nuclear entry of TAF-4, an essential component of the RNA polymerase machinery held in the cytoplasm by OMA-1/2 proteins until their degradation in late 2-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guven-Ozkan et al. 2008</xref>). However, the genomic regulation underlying ZGA is not known.</p><p id="P15">To explore early chromatin dynamics, we first compared patterns of accessibility in somatic cells in early embryonic stages through analysing the Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP). Although a similar number of ATAC fragments were recovered at each stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), the fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) varied by approximately two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). FRiP was highest at the 2-cell stage, dropped sharply at the 4-cell stage (coinciding with ZGA), and then gradually increased as embryogenesis progressed. The differences in relative accessibility in peak regions indicates that chromatin organisation changes during early cleavages, with a major change at the 4-cell stage, when ZGA begins.</p><p id="P16">We next investigated the relationship between the chromatin accessibility changes and gene expression. In line with ZGA, we detected an increase in the number of expressed genes at the 4-cell stage, after which the number gradually dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that the high number of detected genes at the 4-cell stage was primarily due to expression of a larger number of lowly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The finding that 4-cell embryos undergoing ZGA have the lowest FRiP and the highest number expressed genes suggests that they may have a less organised and more permissive genome that temporarily permits widespread, potentially spurious gene expression. The change in chromatin accessibility patterns may be due to the sudden onset of transcription at the 4-cell stage, which is likely to disrupt nucleosome organisation. We note that H3.3 levels reduce during early cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gleason et al. 2023</xref>), which could potentially also play a role in these patterns.</p><p id="P17">To study ZGA in more detail, we identified the promoters accessible at the 4-cell stage and investigated the origin of their accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Surprisingly, most of the 5,801 promoters we detected to be open in any cell at the 4-cell stage were accessible not only in the transcriptionally active somatic blastomeres but also in the transcriptionally quiescent germline precursor P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, the accessibility patterns were largely shared with the quiescent 2-cell embryos, indicating that promoter accessibility is established prior to ZGA.</p><p id="P18">We hypothesized that this early accessibility may be maternally inherited. Indeed, 74% of the accessible sites at ZGA were also accessible in the adult maternal germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), consistent with maternal inheritance; mRNA from the associated genes was also detected as maternal RNA in zygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>). The remaining 26% of sites accessible at ZGA were closed in the maternal germline and newly opened in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>); consistent with zygotic specificity, maternal mRNA was rarely detected for these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We observed that expression of genes with inherited promoters was largely uniform in our map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>) and indeed across stages as well as tissues in adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with ubiquitous expression, gene ontology analyses showed enrichment for genes with diverse housekeeping functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Expression of genes with promoters that open in the zygote gradually increases in early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>) and the majority have tissue restricted expression in adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). This set is enriched for proteolysis functions, transcription factors, and other types of nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We also observed different patterns of motif enrichments in the inherited and zygotic promoter sets, which provide leads for future investigations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, the inherited promoters were more highly enriched for two motifs previously shown to be associated with ubiquitous gene expression (GAGA and TT-periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Serizay et al. 2020</xref>)) whereas the zygotic motifs had more frequent presence of HLH and CUT homeodomain transcription factor motifs.</p><p id="P21">To summarise, our findings indicate that ZGA occurs on a pre-patterned accessible genome. This regulatory architecture includes maternally inherited accessible elements and zygotically established sites. We propose that the release of TAF-4 from cytoplasmic sequestration enables transcription within this pre-existing chromatin landscape for the transition to zygotic genome control.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A transient gene expression program regulated by CUT homeodomain transcription factors</title><p id="P22">We observed that pes-10, one of the first strictly zygotic genes identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seydoux &amp; Fire 1994</xref>), displayed zygotically established promoter accessibility and contained a CUT motif in its promoter. Notably, pes-10 exhibited a striking expression pattern, characterized by transient high expression in pre-gastrulation cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This distinctive pattern suggested the involvement of a specific regulatory program.</p><p id="P23">To investigate this further, we searched for other genes with similar transient expression patterns. We performed differential expression analysis comparing gene expression between pre-gastrulation and post-gastrulation cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). This analysis identified 551 genes with a pattern of high expression across pre-gastrulation stage cells followed by a drop at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We next used MEME-chip to find motifs enriched in the promoters of the transient genes. The CUT motif was highly enriched, second only to a GA-biased motif, and was present in 38% of promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes seven CUT homeodomain family genes: five are ubiquitously expressed, ceh-48 is neuron-specific, and ceh-49 is specific to the embryo and the late adult germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cao et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ghaddar et al. 2023</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that CUT family members act through the CUT motif to redundantly regulate pan-neuronal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Leyva-Díaz &amp; Hobert 2022</xref>). By analyzing strains with increasing numbers of CUT gene knockouts, the study found progressively stronger gene expression defects, with the most severe defects observed when all six neuronally expressed CUT genes were mutated (“6X CUT”). The remaining unmutated embryo-specific gene, <italic>ceh-49</italic>, is highly expressed in early embryos and is itself a transient gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Except for <italic>ceh-48</italic>, the CUT genes are expressed in the pre-gastrulation embryos at varying levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We used ChIP-seq to investigate CUT protein binding patterns in early embryos and ask whether they associate with promoters of transient genes, selecting CEH-38, which has broad expression, and CEH-49, which has transient expression in pre-gastrulation cells. We found that the CUT proteins were present at the <italic>pes-10</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Genome-wide there was a high degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 7 and 8</xref>). We identified 4403 genes with a promoter bound by a CUT protein, with 1257 promoters showing high ChIP-seq signal for both CEH-38 and CEH-49, and 1783 promoters showing CEH-38 signal and low or no CEH-49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Among the transient genes, 48% (N=265) had a promoter bound by at least one of the two CUT proteins, and the majority were bound by both (201 in the CEH-49-enriched vs 78 in the CEH-49-depleted set).</p><p id="P26">To assess potential roles of the CUT family in regulating a transient gene expression program, we created a knockout of the pre-gastrulation CUT gene <italic>ceh-49</italic> as well as knocking out <italic>ceh-49</italic> in the 6X CUT strain to make a 7X CUT strain. We then conducted gene expression profiling in early embryos from these three strains together with wild-type and assessed the effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 11A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 10-13</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Hundreds of genes were differentially expressed in 6X CUT and 7X CUT mutants (n=366 and n=547, respectively), but essentially no differences were observed in the single <italic>ceh-49</italic> mutant. Consistent with CUT proteins promoting transcription, the majority of genes were downregulated (78% in 6X CUT and 67% in 7X CUT), with 235 shared between the two mutants. Of these, 63 have transient expression. As a group, the transient genes with CUT promoter binding were significantly downregulated in both the 6X CUT and the 7X CUT backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), supporting a role for the CUT proteins in promoting the transient program.</p><p id="P28">In line with the reported functional redundancy in the CUT family in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Leyva-Díaz &amp; Hobert 2022</xref>), we observed that further removal of <italic>ceh-49</italic> from the 6X CUT in the 7X CUT strain phenotype caused significant downregulation of 30 transient genes, most of which were downregulated in the 6X CUT strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 11 and 13</xref>). The transient genes without CUT binding were not downregulated in the CUT mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating these genes are under distinct regulatory control.</p><p id="P29">To further characterize this regulatory program, we annotated the CUT associated transient genes using WormCat. These genes were strongly enriched for proteolysis-related functions, including many components of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and a large number of F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). The class is also enriched for genes involved in mRNA regulation and nucleic acid binding. Notably, this included six orthologs of the ZFP36L1/Tis11B family, which are RNA-destabilizing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baou et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P30">These functions align with processes required during the maternal to zygotic transition, when the proteome is remodeled and maternal RNAs are regulated or degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kojima et al. 2024</xref>). It has also been observed that SCF complexes are highly abundant and critical for maternal protein degradation during early embryogenesis in diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Xie et al. 2019</xref>). We propose that the CUT-regulated transient program ensures sufficient levels of key regulators that facilitate this key transition, enabling the zygote to take control of development from the mother.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Our lineage-resolved multimodal single-cell atlas is a powerful resource for elucidating the regulatory events of early C. elegans development. The integration of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across the early lineage reveals the step-by-step changes in genome regulation as development unfolds.</p><p id="P32">Through analysing the map, we found that zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs on a pre-patterned chromatin landscape that is generated by inheritance of maternally accessible elements together with the pre-ZGA establishment of new sites in the zygote. This provides a template ready for initiation of transcription at the 4-cell stage when TAF-4 is able to enter the nucleus. Many of the maternally inherited accessible sites are promoters for ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes, suggesting these promoters may always be open. The mechanism is unknown but could be via an active process, and/or by sequence features that destabilise nucleosomes. In contrast to inherited accessibility, the opening of promoter chromatin in the zygote is likely driven by maternally provided transcription factors, e.g., translation of maternal RNA for the SKN-1 transcription factor leads to its presence in EMS and P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bowerman et al. 1993</xref>) where it likely opens the promoters of its targets such as MED-1/2. In support of this, the MED-2 promoter also opens in the P2 germline precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>), though med-1 is not transcribed in P2 due to germline transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mello et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Seydoux et al. 1996</xref>).</p><p id="P33">We also uncovered a transient gene expression program starting at ZGA driven by redundant CUT homeodomain transcription factors. We suggest that this program, enriched for genes involved in protein degradation and RNA regulation, contributes to the cellular remodelling required during the maternal to zygotic transition. It is striking that the CUT family is also redundantly required in C. elegans for the unrelated process of pan-neuronal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Leyva-Díaz &amp; Hobert 2022</xref>).
