Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes three T6SSs. The H1-T6SS delivers toxins in response to attacks mediated by the T6SS of aggressive bacteria, suggesting that P. aeruginosa can resist T6SS assaults. The mechanisms of resistance are poorly characterized. Here, we performed a CRISPRi screen to identify pathways involved in resistance to T6SS effectors of Acinetobacter baylyi and Vibrio cholerae. We show that members of the GacA/GacS regulon, such as the mag operon or aas, and GacA-independent factors, such as the outer membrane protein OprF, confer resistance to different types of T6SS toxins. Interestingly, some of these T6SS resistance mechanisms lead to higher antibiotic susceptibility, suggesting complex evolutionary links between T6SS and antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4"><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a Gram-negative, ubiquitous, opportunistic pathogen that can colonize open wounds and the respiratory airways, and is particularly problematic for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses three Type VI Secretion Systems (T6SS), molecular nanoweapons that deliver toxic effectors to neighbouring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The first one, called H1-T6SS, plays a predominantly antibacterial role, while the H2- and H3-T6SSs are important for internalization and colonization of a eukaryotic host, although they also deliver trans-kingdom effectors that target both eukaryotic and bacterial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Generally, T6SSs are composed of a membrane complex and a baseplate that trigger the assembly of an Hcp tube that is loaded with a tip complex, composed of a VgrG trimer and PAAR proteins, as well as a set of effectors that can be fused to Hcp, VgrG or PAAR or can be loaded separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The Hcp tube is surrounded by a sheath that, upon contraction, propels the Hcp tube as well as the tip complex and all loaded effectors to the extracellular space or into a neighbouring cell. Bacteria are typically protected from their own effectors by a set of dedicated immunity proteins that are encoded adjacently to the effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These immunity proteins are highly specific, with few examples of cross-protection to related effectors with similar mechanisms of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Interestingly, the H1-T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was reported to respond to incoming attacks from neighbouring bacteria, regardless of whether they are sister cells or members of a different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, the H1-T6SS comprises a sensor module, composed by TagQRST, that senses membrane damage and triggers the assembly of a retaliatory H1-T6SS through post-translational modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it was proposed that this retaliation strategy is a poor evolutionary strategy, as it prevents <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from attacking first and forces it to resist incoming T6SS attacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we hypothesize that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> must be equipped with specific mechanisms that protect against attacks with foreign T6SS effectors, at least until the H1-T6SS is able to strike back.</p><p id="P7"><italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> ADP1 and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> 2740-80 are Gram-negative environmental bacteria that each encode one antibacterial T6SS cluster with multiple effectors that is highly active <italic>in vitro.

Thus, they have different types of effectors, and the resistance mechanisms of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> against these two organisms might differ.</p><p id="P8">In this work, we competed H1-T6SS-deficient <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 carrying a CRISPRi plasmid library targeting all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes with T6SS-positive or –negative <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ADP1 or <italic>V. cholerae</italic> 2740-80. Deep sequencing of the plasmid library revealed genes required to resist incoming T6SS attacks. Interestingly, most of these genes belong to the regulon of the GacS/GacA two component system, including the previously identified <italic>arc1</italic> and <italic>arc3</italic> clusters and <italic>pa3267, aas</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, as well as the <italic>mag</italic> operon. The outer membrane protein OprF also contributes to T6SS resistance. Our data suggest that these pathways are general protection mechanisms against multiple effectors and thus differ from specific immunity proteins. In addition, we identified a link between these resistance mechanisms and antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> resists T6SS attacks in the absence of its H1-T6SS</title><p id="P9">The H1-T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can promptly and efficiently retaliate to incoming T6SS attacks, eliminating the competing bacterium before it can efficiently kill <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we constructed a mutant lacking <italic>tssM1</italic>, a structural membrane component of the H1-T6SS, that is unable to assemble its H1-T6SS and retaliate to incoming attacks.

Furthermore, although this strain is more susceptible than its parental to attacks from the T6SS of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ADP1, it is still far more resistant than <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1A and 1C</xref>), as evidenced by the almost complete elimination of <italic>E. coli</italic> when competed in a 10:1 attacker:prey ratio and the strong killing observed in a 1:1 ratio.

We performed two rounds of 3h long incubation of predator and prey at 1:1 and 10:1 ratios, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The sgRNA loci of the recovered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells were PCR-amplified (before competition and after the first and second rounds of competition) and the amplicons were sequenced by Illumina sequencing.

The same sgRNAs were identified in both cases, although differences were more pronounced after two rounds of competition. This included known T6SS resistance-related genes such as <italic>gacA, gacS, aas, arc1A</italic> or <italic>arc3A</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> as well as novel genes such as the <italic>mag</italic> operon or <italic>oprF</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>GacA is a key regulator involved in T6SS resistance</title><p id="P12">Interestingly, many of the genes that we identified were reported to be under the control of the GacA/GacS two component system (TCS), including <italic>arc1A, arc3A</italic> and <italic>aas</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

We previously showed that these <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strains are able to assemble its T6SS as efficiently as the parental strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the Δ<italic>gacA</italic> strain is killed similarly when single effectors are absent, although Tse2 might play the most predominant role, as an <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strain lacking <italic>tse2</italic> kills <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Furthermore, we also competed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>gacA</italic> with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains encoding individually inactivated effectors through point mutations that were previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and we found that the inactivation of each effector leads to similar levels of killing of the Δ<italic>gacA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>).

In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the <italic>mag</italic> operon is composed of 6 genes, <italic>magABCDEF</italic>. MagD displays weak homology with type II α2-macroglobulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, homologs of eukaryotic α-macroglobulins, whereas the rest of the genes of the operon are important for the folding and stability of MagD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.

However, bacterial type II α2-macroglobulins lack key residues that conform the active site of eukaryotic α2-macroglobulins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and their function is thus unclear.</p><p id="P17">We constructed a strain lacking both <italic>tssM1</italic> and <italic>magD</italic>, and competed it against different mutants of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.

To confirm this result, we also performed a CPRG-based lysis assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a colorimetric assay where lysis is measured based on the conversion rate of the membrane impermeable CPRG dye by a LacZ enzyme that is released upon lysis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

PA3267 (Aas) was also previously identified in a transposon screen, but no clear role in T6SS resistance was attributed to it, although it was hypothesized that it is important for resistance to lipases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

OprF is folded in two conformers, a minor population (around 5%) that is folded into a one-domain structure with a channel that acts as porin; and a major population (around 95%) that is folded into two domains including a PG-anchoring domain.

However, the mechanisms that allow <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to withstand the initial attack are not well understood. Only one recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> identified three operons involved in resistance to T6SS attacks from <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, called <italic>arc1, arc2</italic> and <italic>arc3</italic>, and determined that <italic>arc3</italic> is particularly important to resist the delivery of lipase effectors, likely through the detoxification of lysophospholipids that are generated as a result of the activity of these lipases. However, the effector types that <italic>arc1</italic> and <italic>arc2</italic> confer resistance against, and whether there are other mechanisms involved in the resistance to other effector types, is not known. Here, we performed a CRISPRi screen to identify novel factors involved in T6SS resistance in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, using the laboratory models <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> as aggressor species.

Furthermore, we found other factors that are not known to be regulated by GacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), such as the outer membrane protein OprF.</p><p id="P29">Through quantitative killing assays and kinetic CPRG-based lysis assays, we could validate that these factors are indeed involved in resistance to T6SS attacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

In their study, Ting <italic>et al</italic>. did not determine the effector type that <italic>arc1</italic> is active against and, although they hypothesized that <italic>aas</italic> is active against lipases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, they did not find a clear phenotype against <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>. This suggests that the specific catalytic mechanism of the lipases in question might be relevant for the mechanism of action of the corresponding resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">Our results also show that the GacA regulon is important for the resistance against effector classes other than lipases. We found that the <italic>mag</italic> operon, that is regulated by GacA, is particularly important to resist against certain PG-targeting effectors such as VgrG3 from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and Tae1 from <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. Interestingly, the central gene of this operon, <italic>magD</italic>, displays homology with human α2-macroglobulins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, innate immunity factors that defend against proteases through a trapping mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, the catalytic residues of this protein family are not conserved in bacterial type II α2-macroglobulins that <italic>magD</italic> belongs to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, raising questions about the true function of this protein family in bacteria. Here, we found that MagD contributes to resistance to T6SS PG-targeting effectors, although the exact molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, MagD was previously found to co-immunoprecipitate with TssM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, a structural transmembrane component of the H1-T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, suggesting that these two components might co-localize where a foreign T6SS attack was detected and contribute to the defense against the injected effectors (in the case of MagD) and the assembly of a counterattack H1-T6SS machine (in the case of TssM1).</p><p id="P31"><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also possesses other resistance mechanisms that are not known to be regulated by GacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), such as the outer membrane protein (OMP) OprF. OprF is the most abundant OMP in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and carries out multiple functions including an outer membrane porin as well as anchoring the outer membrane to the PG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here, we found that OprF contributes to resistance to multiple T6SS effector classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 4A and B</xref>). We confirmed this phenotype by complementation with a wild-type or mutant variant of OprF that no longer binds PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), and found that this variant is similarly able to promote survival against both <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, suggesting that other functions of OprF besides OM anchoring must be important for survival to T6SS attacks.</p><p id="P32">Our study also provides the first evidence for the genetic relationship between <italic>oprF</italic> and the <italic>gacA/S</italic> TCS. A strain lacking <italic>oprF</italic> displays a growth defect in LB that is more pronounced in LB without salt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). In LB without salt, this strain spontaneously reverts to wild-type-like growth at high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) and, although these colonies also display WT-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), they are still unable to survive T6SS attacks from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our whole genome sequencing analysis showed that these suppressors carry a loss-of-function deletion of <italic>gacS</italic>, which explains why these strains are susceptible to T6SS attacks. Indeed, the GacA/S TCS is responsible for the growth defect of the Δ<italic>oprF</italic> strain, since deletion of <italic>gacA</italic> restores this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Further research is needed in order to determine why the expression of the GacA regulon leads to a growth defect in the Δ<italic>oprF</italic> genetic background.</p><p id="P33">Next, we also assessed whether our newly identified resistance mechanisms also play a role against <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> E264. As expected from a transposon screen performed by Ting <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, <italic>magD</italic> does not play a role in defending from attacks from <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>. However, both GacA and OprF are important for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>arc2</italic> operon identified by Ting <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> did not appear in our screen. Taken together, our results show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses an array of T6SS resistance mechanisms, frequently under the control of the GacS/A TCS, that help it survive attacks from a variety of aggressor species that it can encounter in the environment. However, these resistance mechanisms might only protect against certain species or against effectors with specific modes of action.</p><p id="P34">Interestingly, other general stress response factors such as those previously found to protect <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> were not highlighted in our screen. In the case of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, those factors were identified upon overexpression of TseL in the host periplasm, a condition that is likely more deleterious for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> than a single T6SS attack where only a few molecules of TseL may be injected at the same time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This would suggest that members of the GacA regulon mount a first layer of defence and that, when they are overwhelmed, general stress response mechanisms of the cell come into play. Performing a similar screen in a Δ<italic>gacA</italic> genetic background where dedicated protection mechanisms are not expressed might highlight such general stress response mechanisms.</p><p id="P35">We also wondered whether these T6SS resistance mechanisms could be involved in resistance to other antimicrobials such as antibiotics. We screened a panel of 30 antibiotics against the WT, Δ<italic>magD</italic>, Δ<italic>tssM1</italic> Δ<italic>arc1A</italic> Δ<italic>arc3A</italic> Δ<italic>aas</italic> and Δ<italic>oprF</italic> and strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>) and found that, surprisingly, strains lacking these T6SS resistance mechanisms display a slight growth advantage in the presence of selected antibiotics as compared to WT (chlorhexidine for Δ<italic>magD</italic>; fluoroquinolones and merbromin for Δ<italic>tssM1</italic> Δ<italic>arc1A</italic> Δ<italic>arc3A</italic> Δ<italic>aas</italic>; colistin for Δ<italic>oprF</italic>; and gentamicin for all three strains), suggesting that these T6SS resistance mechanisms may worsen the toxicity of selected antibiotics. As a consequence, we hypothesize there are trade-offs to obtaining T6SS resistance mechanisms that may lead to higher antibiotic susceptibility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Similar trade-offs were also identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> that evolved resistance against T6SS attacks from <italic>V. cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">It is known that colistin kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting LPS and disrupting the OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.

More research is needed to clarify why an <italic>oprF</italic> mutant, that displays defects in OM stability, is more resistant to colistin. On the other hand, a Δ<italic>oprF</italic> strain is also more susceptible to antibiotics such as the ribosome-targeting tetracycline, or the beta-lactams piperacillin or azlocillin. These phenotypes cannot be explained by the porin function of <italic>oprF</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, since the strain should be more resistant to these antibiotics if <italic>oprF</italic> was required for drug uptake. Overall, our findings serve as proof-of-concept that the study of the mechanisms of resistance to the T6SS can lead to insights about antimicrobial resistance in bacteria.</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, in this work we identified multiple novel resistance mechanisms in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> against T6SS attacks from <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which are also linked with resistance to classical antimicrobials.
