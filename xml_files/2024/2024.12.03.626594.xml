However, researchers commonly misconceive the relationship between mating success (MS) and reproductive success (RS) as always being causal, leading to a misinterpretation of the BG. The BG is phenomenological and therefore uninformative about the mechanisms leading to correlations between MS and RS. Here, we simulate sequential matings in males from biological systems with varying levels of anisogamy and sperm competition, to better understand the underlying processes that modulate male BGs. We show that the BG does not solely reflect the causal influence of MS on RS as is typically interpreted, but is also a consequence of covariances between male MS and male ejaculate traits, female fecundity, or female post-mating decisions. For example, we show that the BG is substantially shallower when the ejaculate size of males negatively co-varies with their MS, such as in species with alternative male reproductive tactics. Such covariances can lead to a misinterpretation of the measured BG, because here, it does not merely represent the strength of selection on intra-sexual competition for mates. We suggest how such covariances can be visually assessed, and accounted for using partial Bateman gradients, to better interpret the influence of MS on RS, thus the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection. Among other simplifications, our simulations have a male-only focus, but they provide insights into the mechanisms driving inter- and intra-specific variation in the BG, clarify its meaning, and improve our understand of sexual selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cryptic female choice</kwd><kwd>polygyny</kwd><kwd>polyandry</kwd><kwd>selection gradient</kwd><kwd>sexual selection</kwd><kwd>sperm competition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The Bateman gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bateman, 1948</xref>; henceforth BG or <italic>β<sub>ss</sub></italic>) is a cornerstone of sexual selection theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Arnold and Duvall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Henshaw and Jones, 2019</xref>). Typically, the BG is measured as the slope of the ordinary least-square (OLS) linear regression of the relativised number of offspring produced (i.e. reproductive success: RS) on the relativised number of mates (i.e. mating success: MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Arnold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Wade and Shuster, 2005</xref>). Multiple studies on wild (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Mobley and Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Rios-Cardenas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Rodriguez-Munoz et al, 2010</xref>; Schulte-Hostedde et al, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">Webster et al, 2007</xref>) and lab animals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrade, 2005</xref>; Bussiere et al, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Davies et al, 2023</xref>; Fritzsche et al, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Jones et al, 2002</xref>, 2004; Pelissie et al, 2012), as well as plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">Tonnabel et al, 2019</xref>) have demonstrated the usefulness of the BG in understanding pre-copulatory sexual selection. Specifically, the BG is used to interpret the selective fitness advantage gained from intra-sexual competition for mates. Due to males being less gamete limited than females, male BGs are typically positive, and steeper than that of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Janicke et al, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, males have greater variance in their RS and MS compared to females. These observations have led to the predictions of stronger strength of and opportunity for pre-copulatory sexual selection on males than females. However, not all studies agree with these predictions (e.g. Apakupakul et al, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Douglas et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Gopurenko et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Jones et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Nason and Kelly, 2020</xref>). Additionally, recent studies argue that the BG is often misinterpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collet et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Klug et al, 2010</xref>; Tang-Martinez, 2016), because of its failure to partition pre- from post-copulatory episodes of sexual selection, or reveal what specific processes generate correlations between MS and RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Arnold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collet et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Fromonteil et al, 2023</xref>; Tang-Martinez, 2006; 2016).</p><p id="P3">Within a sex, BG measures the statistical relationship between an individual’s MS and RS. This relationship is interpreted as the potential fitness benefits gained by individuals, when they acquire more mates. However, there are very few empirical tests that experimentally manipulate MS to test its causal influence on RS (but see Andrade and Kasumovic, 2005). Instead, most studies, including Bateman’s (1948), use standing variation in MS and RS to assess their relationship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Mobley and Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Rios-Cardenas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Rodriguez-Munoz et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Schulte-Hostedde et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">Webster et al, 2007</xref>). Here, however, the correlation between MS and RS is not just the consequence of a causal effect of MS on RS while holding other variables constant, but can partly arise due to MS co-varying with other traits (e.g. female traits) that influence RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anthes et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Davies et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Evans and Garcia-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Henshaw et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">McDonald and Pizzari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Parker and Tang-Martinez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For instance, some studies show that dominant males mate with more fecund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collet et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Gerlach et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Kraak and Bakker, 1998</xref>) or less promiscuous females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Greenway et al, 2021</xref>). This can lead to dominant males, who are usually better at mate acquisition than subordinate males, having a higher RS partly due to mating with higher quality females or less promiscuous females, rather than just due to mating with more females. Likewise, females might favour sperm of dominant or ornamented males compared to subordinate or less ornamented males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dean et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Pizzari and Birkhead, 2000</xref>). Here, similarly, dominant/ornamented males would gain higher RS not only due to mating with more females, but also due to a higher paternity share with each female. Similarly, females allocating a larger proportion of their available eggs to be fertilised by more dominant males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Horvathova et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Skinner and Watt, 2007</xref>), might further lead to a confounded positive relationship between MS and RS. Unless the influence of such male-female interactions on the BG are explicitly understood, we cannot interpret the measured BG as merely representing the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection for mates.</p><p id="P4">The BG does not partition selection on post-copulatory traits, from selection on pre-copulatory traits that improve MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Collet et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Davies et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Devigili et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Evans and Garcia-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Pelissie et al, 2014</xref>). In males, MS is typically a consequence of the expression of traits such as male social status, weaponry, lifespan, mate-finding ability and latency, attractiveness, mate-coercion ability, and male or female choosiness (Arnold, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collet et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Douglas et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Gao et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Gowaty and Hubbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">Tang-Martinez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">2016</xref>). The numbers of offspring a male produces with each female (the cumulative of which is RS) or his paternity share, are also a consequence of the expression of other reproductive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Pischedda and Rice, 2012</xref>). These could include male traits such as ejaculate quality and quantity, sperm competitiveness, ejaculate allocation strategies, mate guarding, or paternal investment, as well as female traits such as egg number, egg allocation, degree of cryptic female choice, polyandry, or maternal investment. Distinguishing the influence of male ejaculate and female post-mating traits on reproductive RS, independent of MS, is crucial for determining whether the BG reflects only precopulatory sexual selection on mate acquisition or also postcopulatory sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Davies et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Evans and Garcia-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Marie-Orleach et al, 2024</xref>). For instance, male mating success might co-vary negatively with male ejaculate size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Gowaty and Hubbell, 2005</xref>), such as in species with alternative male reproductive tactics whereby dominant males, who are better at monopolizing females (and thus have higher MS), allocate small ejaculates to each female. In the presence of sperm competition, such differential ejaculate allocation might lead to a lower paternity share for dominant compared to subordinate males, who mate with fewer females but allocate larger ejaculates to each female (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alonzo and Warner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Durant et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Froman et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gage et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Klaus et al, 2011</xref>; Lupold et al, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Preston et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Saunders and Shuster, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">Warner et al, 1995</xref>). Such negative covariances (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Kvanermo and Simmons, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Parker et al, 2013</xref>) might lead to underestimating the fitness benefits gained by increasing the number of mating partners. Such covariances might explain why subordinate males in species with alternative reproductive tactics often have similar lifetime reproductive success compared to dominant males, despite having lower mating success (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Da Silva et al, 2024</xref>). Male pre- and post-copulatory traits could also co-vary positively due to condition dependence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bath et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">De Nardo et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Devigili et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Janicke and Chapuis, 2016</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Simmons et al, 2017</xref>). For instance, individuals in higher condition might develop better pre-and post-copulatory traits than individuals in lower condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Hare and Simmons, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Janicke et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Mehlis et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Morimoto et al, 2016</xref>). Under such covariances, the BG would represent the strength of both, pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection, rather than just pre-copulatory selection for more mates (i.e. its typical interpretation).</p><p id="P5">Recording the specific mating order in which individuals encounter mates in a mating sequence might allow us to assess whether covariances between male MS and other traits exist (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Pelissie et al, 2014</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Sanghvi et al (2024a)</xref> find in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that males with higher MS produce more offspring with females early in the mating sequence, but produce fewer offspring with females later in their mating sequence, compared to males with lower MS. This pattern, of males with higher MS having higher intercepts but steeper slopes for offspring production with each female through the mating sequence, might be caused by male MS covarying positively with male ejaculate allocation. If the exact mating order of females is known, assessing the patterns of offspring production through the mating sequence might allow inferring the type of covariances between MS and other variables, and the magnitude of their effect on the BG. However, inferring the presence and magnitude of covariances by recording the exact mating order has not been demonstrated before.</p><p id="P6">We use simulations to investigate the potential mechanisms driving variation in the male Bateman gradient (BG), and how these might distort the interpretation of the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection. Specifically, we aim to disentangle the relationship between male mating success (MS) and reproductive success (RS), by exploring how covariances between male MS and other male or female reproductive traits and post-mating decisions contribute to variation in the BG. Importantly, we simulate mating sequences to assess whether tracking the order in which females encounter males improves our understanding of the BG. Previous studies have reviewed and provided verbal models or experimental tests for how some covariances might influence the BG (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anthes et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Evans and Garcia-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Henshaw et al, 2018</xref>; McDonald and Pizzari, 2015). Here, we include a broader range of covariance scenarios and place emphasis on the usefulness of recording the mating sequence. It is often assumed that the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection for mate acquisition is stronger in high than low anisogamy species, for the gamete-abundant sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Henshaw et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Janicke, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Lehtonen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Lehtonen &amp; Parker, 2024</xref>). However, whether sperm competition can modulate the influence of anisogamy on the BG remains unclear. Therefore, we consider biological systems with varying degrees of anisogamy and sperm competition to provide a more generalizable understanding of the BG across taxa. While our simulations focus on males, the principles highlighted herein are applicable to females too.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P7">We used agent-based simulations to investigate how covariances between male MS and various other male or female reproductive traits affect RS, thus modulating the BG.

In the null scenario, the relationship between MS and RS was causal, and male mating success did not co-vary with any other male or female traits. In each of the remaining eight scenarios, male MS co-varied positively or negatively with one of the male or female traits described above. The difference in the BG between the null scenario and any covariance scenarios reflects the correlation between MS and RS arising from to confounding (non-causal) effects.

These models were constructed to understand whether confounded relationships between MS and RS can still allow interpretation of the true strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection, if the confounding variable is accounted for. To do this, we only used data from the high anisogamy system with sperm competition because this is arguably the more common of the four systems observed. We fit models for each scenario separately. In a model with Gaussian error distribution, we first fit relative reproductive success (<italic>rs</italic>) as our dependent variable, relative mating success (<italic>ms</italic>) as the only fixed effect, and replicate ID as a random effect (to account for non-independence between different males from the same replicate). We then compared the BG estimated in this model to one where all other traits (<italic>Q, V, T, L, F, P</italic>) as well as <italic>ms</italic> were included as fixed effects. Since the null scenario had no covariances between traits, we predicted that adding these traits would not affect the BG compared to the simpler model with only <italic>ms</italic> as a fixed effect. Next, we created these linear models for each covariance scenario. First, we built a model with only <italic>ms</italic> as a fixed effect; second, a model with <italic>ms</italic> and the co-varying trait as fixed effects; and third, a model with <italic>ms</italic> and all traits (<italic>Q, V, T, L, F, P</italic>) as fixed effects. We predicted that the model with only MS as a fixed effect would produce an inflated or deflated BG compared to the BG of the null model, due to unaccounted covariances. In the second model, accounting for the co-varying trait would give a partial BG similar to that measured in the null scenario. In the third model, adding non-co-varying traits would not further alter the BG compared to the second model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S19"><title>Low anisogamy, no sperm competition</title><p id="P47">Positive covariances between male mating success (MS) and <italic>Q</italic> (starting ejaculate size)<italic>, V</italic> (proportion of potent sperm)<italic>, F</italic> (number of eggs in female)<italic>, P</italic> (proportion of allocated eggs)<italic>, or L</italic> (proportion of sperm retained) led to significantly steeper BG, while negative covariances between MS with <italic>Q</italic> or <italic>V</italic> resulted in significantly shallower BG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7, S8</xref>), compared to the null scenario.

The Bateman gradient (BG) is typically used to interpret the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection, i.e. the potential improvement in fitness obtained by acquiring more mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Wade &amp; Shuster, 2005</xref>). Males, due to having steeper BGs, are typically hypothesized to experience more intense pre-copulatory sexual selection than females, leading to predictions of males competing for mates and being promiscuous, more than females. However, consistent with previous critiques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anthes et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Henshaw et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Tang-Martinez, 2016</xref>), we show that without accounting for covariances, the measured BG can be misleading. This is because under covariances, the BG reflects not just the strength of sexual selection on intra-sexual competition for mates, but also the strength of other forms of selection, such as post-copulatory sexual selection on traits like ejaculate size and fertilization efficiency of sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anthes et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Pischedda and Rice, 2012</xref>). Modulation of the BG due to such covariances has important implications for quantifying sex-differences in sexual selection. For instance, if a steeper BG in males than females (as typically predicted) in a species are caused by covariances between male MS and ejaculate traits rather than a causal effect on RS, then the difference in BGs between sexes cannot be interpreted as stronger precopulatory sexual selection on males than females.</p><p id="P54">A fundamental puzzle in sexual selection is why male BGs vary within (e.g. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Davies et al, 2023</xref>) as well as between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>). Our simulations provide some explanations for inter- and intra-specific variation in BG, solely based on the presence or absence of some covariances in certain populations. For instance, in populations where males vary in their condition, high condition males might have more competitive ejaculates as well as higher MS, compared to low condition males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Puniamoorthy et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Reznick et al, 2000</xref>). Such covariances due to condition dependence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Hare and Simmons, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Janicke et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Mehlis et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Morimoto et al, 2016</xref>) would lead to the measured BG being steeper in these populations compared to populations of the same species where male condition is more homogeneous. On the other hand, in species with alternative mating tactics, negative covariances between male MS and ejaculate size, quality, or allocation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alonzo and Warner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Durant et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Froman et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gage et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Klaus et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Lupold et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Preston et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Saunders and Shuster, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">Warner et al, 1995</xref>) could lead to a shallower male BG compared to species without such tactics. For instance, males in dominant roles in species with alternative mating tactics often achieve similar overall reproductive success as males in subordinate roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Da Silva et al, 2024</xref>). In such scenarios, the relationship between MS and RS could be curvilinear (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>) with male fitness being maximised at average MS. The BG might also be inflated in species with condition-based assortative mating, where males in high condition (who have high MS) mate with females in high condition (who have high fecundity) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collet et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Gerlach et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Greenway et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Kraak and Bakker, 1998</xref>). Importantly, when populations or species differ in their BGs due to the presence of certain covariances, the BGs cannot be interpreted as different strengths of precopulatory sexual selection on acquiring mates between these populations/species.</p><p id="P55">Variation in BGs between different species could also be due to differences in anisogamy or sperm competition between taxa. Anisogamy underpins the evolution of divergent reproductive strategies, and an increase in the degree of anisogamy is predicted to lead to a steeper BG for the sex with more numerous gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Henshaw et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Janicke, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Lehtonen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Lehtonen &amp; Parker, 2024</xref>). Our findings suggest that in the absence of sperm competition, males in high anisogamy systems indeed gain more fitness benefits by improving their MS, compared to males in low anisogamy systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, if sperm competition is present within high anisogamy systems, the differences in BG between high and low anisogamy systems becomes less apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Our findings generally agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Arnold (1994)</xref>, who suggested that a positive, linear relationship between MS and RS for males can only be expected when their RS is not limited by gamete production rate (e.g. in high anisogamy systems without sperm competition).</p><p id="P56">The importance of partitioning the measured BG into episodes of selection on pre-versus post-copulatory traits has been previously emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Evans and Garcia-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Pelissie et al, 2014</xref>). By including post-copulatory processes such as cryptic female choice via differential sperm retention or female fecundity stimulation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Eberhard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Firman et al, 2017</xref>), and their covariances with MS, our simulations highlight the under-appreciated role of female agency in impacting male BG. Our results further show that it is difficult to disentangle pre- from post- copulatory episodes of sexual selection when using the BG, a phenomenological (rather than process-based) metric.</p><p id="P57">While our simulations demonstrate that covariances between MS and other ejaculate or female traits can severely distort interpretation of the strength of sexual selection, this does not diminish utility of the BG. We suggest methods for researchers to assess and account for covariances when calculating the BG. First, visually examining offspring production of males with each female in the mating sequence can allow identification of the presence, and importantly, the type of underlying covariances (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In the absence of covariances, no systematic differences should exist in the rate of change or the intercept for offspring production across the mating sequence, between males with varying mating success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Sanghvi et al, 2024a</xref> who show this). When change in offspring production through the mating sequence is linear, the presence of covariances can further be statistically tested for by fitting: <disp-formula id="FD17"><mml:math id="M18"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>rank</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>MS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>rank</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>MS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>O<sub>ik</sub></italic> is the number of offspring produced by each focal male mated with each female, rank is the rank/order of the female encountering the male in his mating sequence, and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> is the random effect of male ID to control for male-level non-independence in offspring production. Here, a significant effect of <italic>rank<sub>ik</sub></italic>: MS<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> or of MS<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> might suggest presence of covariances between MS and other variables that indirectly influence male RS. Second, we suggest that studies include the co-varying trait in the linear model when calculating <italic>β<sub>ss</sub></italic>, and interpret the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection only using the partial BG (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Henshaw et al, 2018</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al (2017)</xref> caution against using this method, we show that in the absence of better alternatives, this approach provides a reasonable approximation of the causal effect of manipulating MS on RS. When the influence of the co-varying trait on RS is linear, the partial BG would represent the causal influence of MS on RS.</p><p id="P58">Fitness is not only determined by the number of offspring produced, but also by the reproductive value of each offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Gillespie et al, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection on acquiring mates will be determined by the influence of MS on RS, as well as of MS on offspring quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Kokko and Jennions, 2008</xref>). This distinction is crucial when MS influences offspring quality and RS in contrasting ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Arnold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Queller, 1997</xref>). For example, when males who mate with more females produce more offspring but are less able to provision each offspring thereby reducing offspring quality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Lynch, 2016</xref>), males with average mating success would likely produce the most numbers of grand offspring despite producing fewer offspring than males with the highest MS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Stiver and Alonzo, 2009</xref>). Here, despite the BG being positive and the relationship between MS and RS being linear, interpreting the BG as evidence of strong sexual selection on mate acquisition would be misleading. This is because selection is likely to favour a strategy that maximizes the production of grand offspring produced rather than merely of offspring (i.e. RS). Similarly in females, polyandry (i.e. increasing female MS) could confuse the paternity of males, leading to various males provisioning a female’s offspring, which consequently improves offspring quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Hosken and Stockley, 2003</xref>). Here, despite polyandry not directly improving female RS and the BG being shallow, polyandry might still lead to increased numbers of grand offspring via improved offspring quality (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Jennions and Petrie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Parker and Tang-Martinez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Simmons, 2005</xref>). In such a case, interpreting a shallow female BG as weak pre-copulatory sexual selection would be misleading. We therefore recommend that covariances between MS and offspring quality, in addition to those between MS and RS, be considered within the BG framework.</p><p id="P59">Our simulations were limited in their complexity because we did not manipulate degree of polyandry, sperm precedence, male and female lifespans, sperm storage duration, the rate of ejaculate and egg replenishment, offspring survival, or offspring reproductive success. Future studies could test how covariances between MS and these traits might influence the BG and the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection. For instance, if males who are more attractive (and thus have higher MS) also possess genes that improve offspring survival until detection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Head et al, 2005</xref>), the BG would be modulated. Our simulations focussed only on male BG. However, female BG can also be influenced by covariances between RS and other male or female traits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collett et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Fromonteil et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Gerlach et al, 2012</xref>). Future studies could simulate various male- and female-specific covariances in polygynandrous systems to test whether sex-differences in the strength of sexual selection become less apparent after accounting for such covariances (by using partial BGs). Finally, we emphasize that studies which experimentally manipulate MS are alarmingly lacking and encourage researchers to compare BGs obtained from experimental manipulation of MS (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrade and Kasumovic, 2005</xref>) versus from spontaneously available variation in MS, to understand how covariances might modulate the BG in nature.</p></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P60">Our study adds to the growing body of research advocating for a more nuanced understanding and application of the Bateman Gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anthes et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Parker &amp; Tang-Martinez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Henshaw et al, 2016</xref>). We illustrate that BG measurements which fail to account for covariances between MS and various other traits, can oversimplify its interpretation and misattribute the selection agent to solely being pre-copulatory competition for mates. However, under covariances, the BG partly represents selection on various ejaculate traits and post-copulatory processes. The impact of these co-varying traits depends on the biology of the system, such as the degree of anisogamy and its interaction with level of sperm competition, which could partly explain taxonomic variation in the BG. Overall, we use specific biological examples to demonstrate the range of scenarios where BGs are likely to be misleading; quantify the magnitude and direction of how covariances might modulate the BG (thus the degree by which sexual selection might be misinterpreted when using the BG); reveal how fundamental biological differences between species modulate the BG; and suggest methods by which studies can assess the presence, magnitude, and type of covariances as well as account for them to better interpret the BG. Our simulations offer generalisable insights into the mechanisms that cause variation in the BG, improve our understanding of what the BG represents and what it does not, as well as provide novel insights into sexual selection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS201772-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d158aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the fly lab for their helpful comments.

the causal influence of varying MS on RS, reflecting the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection acting on competition for mates. However, the relationship between MS on RS need not always be causal. MS can correlate with RS due to covariances between MS and other reproductive traits of both males and females. These covariances might inflate or deflate our interpretation of the strength of sexual selection. When such confounding occurs, interpretations of the resultant BG as the strength of sexual selection on mates can be misleading. Boxes inside the orange highlighted areas are typically interpreted as pre-copulatory sexual selection; those inside the grey areas are interpreted as post-copulatory sexual selection.
