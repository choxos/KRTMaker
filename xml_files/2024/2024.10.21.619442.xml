Basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) of the salivary gland are rare tumours that can be difficult to distinguish from each other and other salivary gland tumour subtypes. Due to their rarity, the genetic profiles of BCA and BCAC have not been extensively explored. Using whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of BCA and BCAC cohorts, we identify a novel recurrent <italic>FBXW11</italic> missense mutation (p.F517S) in BCA, that was mutually exclusive with the previously reported <italic>CTNNB1</italic> p.I35T gain-of-function (GoF) mutation. These driver events collectively accounted for 94% of BCAs. <italic>In vitro</italic>, mutant FBXW11 had a dominant negative affect, characterised by defective binding to β-catenin and the accumulation of β-catenin in cells. This was consistent with the nuclear expression of β-catenin observed in BCA cases harbouring the <italic>FBXW11</italic> p.F517S mutation and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The genomic profiles of BCAC were distinct from BCA, with hotspot <italic>DICER1</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic> mutations and putative driver mutations affecting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signalling pathway genes. A single BCAC, which may represent a malignant transformation of BCA, harboured the recurrent <italic>FBXW11</italic> mutation. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of BCA and BCAC, which, despite histopathologic overlap, may be unrelated entities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Approximately 4-9% of all head and neck neoplasms are salivary gland tumours (SGTs), which include a wide range of benign and malignant entities that are further classified into distinct histopathological subgroups. Due to their rarity, overlapping presentation and the difficulty of their diagnosis, salivary gland basal cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma are of particular interest amongst these cancers. Cells of the intercalated duct have been proposed to be the primary cells of origin for BCA, a benign tumour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. BCAC, its presumed malignant counterpart, is thought to arise <italic>de novo</italic> in most instances, and in rare cases, arises from malignant transformation of BCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Of note, cases of BCA and BCAC have been linked to Brooke-Spiegler syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by germline disruption of the tumour suppressor gene <italic>CYLD</italic>.</p><p id="P4">The vast majority of salivary gland BCA and BCAC arise in the parotid gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. BCA generally manifests as a slow-growing, well-defined, mobile, painless mass. In contrast, most BCAC are infiltrative and facial nerve involvement occurs in 25% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Local recurrence of BCAC has been reported in up to 50% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and occurs within 6-24 months after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Advanced BCAC is occasionally accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy and distant metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The clinical characteristics and natural history of these tumours highlight the need for a precise and prompt diagnosis for effective patient care, with effective surgical intervention being curative and metastatic spread of BCAC clinically challenging to manage.</p><p id="P5">Histopathologically, BCAs are well circumscribed or encapsulated showing tubulotrabecular, cribriform, membranous and/or solid growth patterns. Peripheral palisading of dark cells with luminal paler cells and ducts has been described in BCA, as have vesicular nuclei. The histological patterns of BCAC range widely and includes tubular, membranous, or solid growth patterns, with anaplasia being rare. As with BCA, nuclei are vesicular, while approximately a quarter of BCAC cases are accompanied by perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Diagnosis of BCA and BCAC may be aided by immunohistochemistry (IHC), through the assessment of β-catenin expression and markers of epithelial and myoepithelial differentiation; however, positivity for nuclear β-catenin has been found in both BCA and BCAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In other SGT subtypes, oncogenic, tumour-specific gene fusions have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and are increasingly used in combination with histology and IHC as a diagnostic aid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Genetic studies of BCA have reported a recurrent missense activating mutation (p.I35T) in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, the gene encoding the β-catenin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Although the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> p.I35T mutation has not been found in BCAC, it has been reported in only a subset of BCA cases (37-80%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and, therefore, is of limited utility as a diagnostic tool. To date, genetic profiling of BCAC cases has revealed mutation of <italic>PIK3CA, ATM, CYLD</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, but given the rarity of this tumour type and the small number of genes profiled, the roles of these mutations in tumour development is unknown.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we sequenced the tumour and germline exomes and tumour transcriptomes of 32 cases of BCA and 11 cases of BCAC from multiple centres, an impressive collection given that these tumours represent approximately 1% of all salivary gland neoplasms and arise at a frequency of &lt;1 per 100,000 individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We identified and functionally characterised a recurrent somatic mutation in <italic>FBXW11</italic>, a novel driver event in BCA that is mutually exclusive with mutation of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>. In BCAC, we identified mutations at known hotspots in <italic>HRAS, DICER1, PIK3CA</italic> and somatic alterations that are predicted to promote tumourigenesis through diverse mechanisms. By examining somatic variants and copy number alterations, germline variants and gene fusions, we provide an unprecedented molecular portrait of these rare and diagnostically challenging head and neck tumours.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Case selection and histopathological analysis</title><p id="P7">We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 75 patients, ascertained from six institutions across five countries. After sequencing and quality control, our cohort consisted of 65 cases; 55 cases with tumour and matched normal DNA and 10 tumour-only cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Cases underwent a central pathology review by J.A.B. and I.W., who reviewed each case independently, arriving at a consensus diagnosis where their initial classification did not agree. This analysis, together with the genetic information from whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, such as the presence of fusions diagnostic of other SGT types (described below), resulted in an analysis cohort of 43 cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), each with matched normal tissue, including 32 BCAs, 9 BCACs and 2 salivary glands tumours with a differential diagnosis of BCAC and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (BCAC/EMC) due to the presence of the oncogenic <italic>HRAS</italic> p.Q61R mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Each case was from a different patient. IHC for β-catenin expression was not available for the majority of cases prior to pathology review by J.A.B and I.W. Data from transcriptome sequencing was available for all but 1 tumour. The BCAs were from 17 males (mean age of 65.7 years) and 15 females (mean age of 53.9 years), and the BCACs (including 2 BCAC/EMC) were from 6 males (mean age of 55.2 years) and 5 females (mean age of 55.4 years) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The majority of the tumours were from the parotid gland. Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains of a BCA and a BCAC from this study are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>.</p><p id="P8">The 20 tumours (12 with matched normal) that were excluded from the final cohort of BCAs and BCACs included diagnostic mimics such as salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas (PAs), adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs), an epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC), cases with differential diagnoses of myoepithelioma and carcinoma ex-PA (PA/ME/CXPA), and two cases that could not be definitively classified (NOS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Of note, several PAs were identified to have morphological features indicative of PA with a <italic>HMGA2</italic>::<italic>WIF1</italic> gene fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which was subsequently confirmed following the analysis of the transcriptome sequencing data. Other cases had fusions involving <italic>PLAG1</italic>, which is commonly seen in PA/ME/CXPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Four of the 65 cases had <italic>HRAS</italic> hotspot mutations (three <italic>HRAS</italic> p.Q61R and one p.G13R; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), which are frequently found in EMCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> but have also been identified in other SGTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Due to this uncertainty, two BCAC cases with <italic>HRAS</italic> p.Q61R were retained for downstream analysis as BCAC/EMC, as described above, and a third, with <italic>HRAS</italic> p.G13R, was classified as a BCAC.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Overview of somatic alterations in BCA and BCAC</title><p id="P9">Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, we identified somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), multinucleotide variants (MNVs) and insertion/deletion variants (indels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The BCAC cohort included two lung metastases (PD56526a and PD56541a) and one recurrence (PD56535a; BCAC/EMC), which had higher mutation rates (1.5-2.4 mutations/Mb) than all but one primary BCAC/EMC (PD56546c; 7.5 mutations/Mb).

No other COSMIC mutational signatures, other than ubiquitous signatures found in all tumour types (SBS1 and SBS5), were identified in either the BCA or BCAC cohorts.</p><p id="P11">Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were infrequent in BCA, with a mean of 1.4% of the genome amplified or deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, a mean of 9.7% of the genome of BCACs were altered, with the highest proportion (29%) found in a lung metastasis (PD56541a). We identified a chromothripsis-like event (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) on chromosome 3 of PD56545a, a BCAC/EMC, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), however, additional analyses, such as whole-genome sequencing, is required to confirm these events.</p><p id="P12">Unlike other SGTs, such as PA and ACC, recurrent gene fusions were not prevalent in BCA or BCAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). High-confidence fusion genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), identified through exome-based transcriptome sequencing from tumour samples, were identified in 3 BCAs and 3 BCACs.

In the presence of Wnt, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus where it activates Wnt target genes.

F517 is in a solvent-exposed region in the WDR domain that is directly involved in β-catenin binding and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> D32 and G34 are key sites for the interaction of β-catenin and FBXW11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). F517 constrains a spatially close residue, R468, in a position that favours the formation of a salt bridge with D32 in β-catenin. The MD simulations predicted that the replacement of F517 with serine increases R468 mobility and the adoption of alternative conformations, causing this residue to move away from the β-catenin D32 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Thus, this change was expected to disfavour the salt-bridge that stabilises the FBXW11-β-catenin complex and supports the hypothesis that the p.F517S substitution reduces the binding of FBXW11 to β-catenin.</p><p id="P18">Next, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to confirm that the mutant FBXW11 causes a reduction in FBXW11-β-catenin binding and subsequent accumulation of β-catenin resulting from the reduction of β-catenin polyubiquitination.

This analysis demonstrated equivalent protein levels in cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX), indicating that the amino acid substitution did not impact proper protein folding or cause accelerated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, top panel). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed using lysates collected from overnight-starved (serum-free Dulbecc”s Modified Eagle Medium) HEK293T cells transiently expressing V5-tagged FBXW11<sup>WT</sup> or FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, middle panel), or co-expressing either FBXW11<sup>WT</sup> or FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> together with Flag-tagged β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, bottom panel). Binding of the FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> mutant to endogenous β-catenin was reduced compared with FBXW11<sup>WT</sup>, and, consistent with the model in which the inability of FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> to bind β-catenin impairs β-catenin degradation, we observed reduced polyubiquitination and consequent accumulation of endogenous β-catenin in cells expressing the mutant protein compared to FBXW11<sup>WT</sup>-expressing controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, middle panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).

All cases we tested that harboured a mutation in either gene appeared similar, all having little or no membranous positivity with variable mild to moderate cytoplasmic staining and variable strong nuclear positivity staining, particularly in peripheral palisading dark cells around tumour cell islands. This pattern is consistent with increased accumulation of β-catenin in the BCA tumour cells. In contrast, normal salivary gland exocrine gland cells showed no nuclear staining. Similarly, all but one BCAC case for which IHC for β-catenin was performed (1/8) had membranous positivity and negative nuclear staining.

Notably, in contrast to what has been observed in CRC, mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>FBXW11</italic> were limited to a single hotspot position in each gene. While sequencing of additional BCACs is required to confirm the frequency of <italic>FBXW11</italic> p.F517S, if this mutation is exclusive to BCA (and rare cases of BCAC that have arisen from BCA), our finding suggest that genetic testing for <italic>CTNNB1</italic> p.I35T and <italic>FBXW11</italic> p.F517S may be used to confirm nearly 94% of BCA cases helping to distinguish BCA from other mimickers.</p><p id="P34">In line with previous findings, the genetic profiles of BCACs were more varied and complex than BCAs. The lack of common driver genes and mutations, other than a single BCAC with <italic>FBXW11</italic> p.F517S, confirms that most BCACs arise <italic>de novo</italic> rather than from malignant transformation of BCA. In this study, <italic>CYLD</italic> mutations were found in only 2 of 11 BCAs and none of the 32 BCACs. A previous study suggested that 36% of BCAs and 29% of BCACs had nonsense mutations in <italic>CYLD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, however, because only 8 of the 45 BCAs and BCACs used in the previous study were paired with matched normal tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, the variants found may potentially be germline variants. In addition to <italic>CYLD</italic>, we identified mutations in <italic>IKBKB</italic>; both genes play roles in the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signalling pathways. However, nuclear expression of β-catenin was negative in cases with these mutations, which suggests that the NF-κB pathway, rather than the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, might be activated via functional dysregulation of <italic>CYLD</italic> and <italic>IKBKB</italic> in BCAC. Previous studies have observed nuclear β-catenin expression in subsets of both BCAC and BCA with a wide range of nuclear positivity rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

The inconsistent findings amongst studies strengthens the argument that a combination of tools including histopathology, IHC and genetic profiling can aid diagnosis of SGTs, particularly rare subtypes.</p><p id="P35">This study is the first to profile somatic CN alterations in BCA and BCAC using NGS.

The mutant FBXW11 displayed defective β-catenin binding, leading to the stabilisation of β-catenin, thus, serving as an alternative mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signalling activation.

COS-1 cells were treated with CHX (10 μg/ml) to assess protein stability. Serum-free DMEM was utilized to starve cells.</p><p id="P61">Cell lysates and co-immunoprecipitation assays. After treatment with CHX, COS-1 cells were lysed in radio-immune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, pH 8.0, complemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. For FBXW11/β-catenin co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, HEK293T cells were serum-starved and lysed in IP buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g (20 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were collected, and their protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. In co-IP experiments, equal amounts of total proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-β-catenin or anti-V5 antibody cross-linked to Protein G Sepharose beads (2 h, 4 °C). The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed six times with IP buffer. Finally, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with sample buffer by incubating at 95 °C (10 min) and stored at -20 °C until immunoblotting analysis.</p><p id="P62">Immunoblotting assays were performed as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>. In brief, cell lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system. Blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h and incubated with specific antibodies overnight. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Densitometric analysis of protein bands was performed using NineAlliance UVITEC software (UVITEC, Cambridge, UK).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Immunohistochemistry for β-catenin</title><p id="P63">β-catenin immunohistochemistry was performed on a Leica BOND III™ stainer (Leica Biosystems) using the validated ‘IHC Protocol F’ for human tissue, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

salivary gland basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) cohorts.</title><p>BCA and BCAC cases are shown to the left and right of the dotted line, respectively. Genes shown in the oncoplot are genes known to be mutated in salivary gland tumours and/or are COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (CGC) genes and mutated in at least 1 BCA or BCAC. Genes that were mutated exclusively in the dMMR case, PD56546c, are not shown. TMB is the tumour mutation burden in mutations per megabase (Mb). Genes are grouped by pathway. TMB was calculated using mutations found in coding exons and 2 bp upstream and downstream of exon boundaries to account for splice site mutations. Fusion genes in red text are those found in the Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit human fusion library (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Samples marked as “Discovery set only” did not pass strict criteria for transcriptome sequencing quality control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) and may have a higher false discovery rate as a result. The copy number panel indicates the tumours that had copy number loss of chromosome arms 5q and/or 16q, which was significant in the BCAC cohort. BCAC/EMC is differential diagnosis of salivary gland basal cell adenocarcinoma and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199648-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Tumour mutation burden, mutation spectra and recurrent copy number alterations.</title><p>(a) Tumour mutation burden in salivary gland basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC).

Shown on the left is a complex of FBXW11-SKP1 with a β-catenin peptide phosphorylated on S33 and S37 (PDB ID 6WNX). The location of recurrently mutated sites at CTNNB1 I35 and FBXW11 F517 are indicated in red text. Substitution of phenylalanine with serine at position 517 increases the mobility of R468 and the adoption of alternative conformations (right, lower) compared to the wild type (WT) protein (right, top). (b) FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> is a stable protein (top panel). Western blot and relative quantitative analyses of V5-tagged FBXW11 protein levels in transfected COS-1 cells, basally and after cycloheximide (CHX) (10 μg/ml) treatment. GAPDH was used as loading control. The letter M denotes prestained protein markers. FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> has impaired ability to bind to β-catenin (middle and bottom panels). Lysates from transiently transfected HEK293T cells expressing V5-tagged FBXW11<sup>WT</sup> or FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> proteins and serum-starved overnight were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibody and assayed by western blotting using the antibodies indicated (middle panel). Note the reduced polyubiquitination of the endogenous immunoprecipitated β-catenin and the higher level of β-catenin in lysates from cells expressing FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup>. Lysates from transiently transfected HEK293T cells co-expressing FBXW11<sup>WT</sup> or FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> proteins with Flag-tagged β-catenin and serum-starved overnight were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibodies and assayed by western blotting using the antibodies indicated (bottom panel). Representative blots from one of three independent experiments are shown. (c) Left: FBXW11 is part of the Skp1-cullin 1-F-box (SCF) complex that regulates β-catenin levels by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. FBXW11 functions as substrate adaptor and is required for binding of phosphorylated β-catenin to the SCF complex, β-catenin phosphorylation is mediated by the destruction complex, which includes APC, AXIN, GSK3 and CK1. Right: the decreased binding of FBXW11<sup>F517S</sup> to β-catenin inhibits the activity of the SCF complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199648-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemical patterns of β-catenin in salivary gland basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC).</title><p>(a) Case PD56510a, a BCA with a <italic>CTNNB1</italic> p.I35T mutation, demonstrating patchy nuclear β -catenin expression in both abluminal basal cells and stromal cells.
