However, it is unclear why only ~30% of individuals progress to symptomatic pathology, why this can take decades to become apparent, and why there is such a wide range of disease outcomes. Disease pathology is a long-term cumulative process resulting from collateral damage caused by inflammatory immune responses that continually eliminate transient parasite infections in the heart and/or gastrointestinal tract. The guiding principle behind anti-parasitic drug development is that sterile cure is required to prevent progression to symptomatic pathology. Evidence suggests that the cumulative damage required to reach the symptomatic threshold is determined by a number of factors, including host and parasite genetics, which govern the intensity and location(s) of infection. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy could involve long-term intermittent treatment, which may not confer sterile cure, but is able to suppress the parasite burden to a level where the disease does not become symptomatic within the life-time of the infected individual. To test this hypothesis, we used an experimental murine model that displays both cardiac and digestive tract pathology. Mice were given intermittent treatment with posaconazole, under conditions that reduced the parasite burden by &gt;99%, but did not confer sterile clearance. Our results show that this did not provide long-term protection against the key cardiac or gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease, and that sterile cure should remain the single goal of the drug development community.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, poses a public health challenge across Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In addition, due to migration, it is increasingly detected in non-endemic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Parasite transmission occurs primarily via triatomine bug vectors, but other routes of infection such as congenital transmission, consumption of contaminated food and drink, organ transplantation and blood transfusions also pose significant risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Following <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, individuals enter the acute stage, which typically lasts 2-8 weeks, and is characterized by widespread parasite dissemination in blood and tissues. Symptoms at this stage are usually mild or non-specific, although outcomes can be fatal in some cases, due to myocarditis or encephalopathy. Immune responses eventually control, but do not eliminate the infection, and most individuals then remain asymptomatic for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Approximately 30% of those infected ultimately develop chronic Chagas disease, although this can take decades to become symptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection results in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) in 20 - 30% of cases, and ~10% lead to digestive Chagas disease (DCD), with the symptoms sometimes occurring in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the underlying causes of CCC, including direct parasite-mediated injury, parasite-induced inflammatory tissue damage, and autoimmune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The most widely accepted view is that pathology results from cumulative damage to heart tissue caused by pro-inflammatory immune responses driven by the presence of parasites. This in turn leads to fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy, although disease progression follows a complex pathway that can also involve arrhythmias and thromboembolisms, and is difficult to predict at an individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). During chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, the parasite burden is extremely low and challenging to detect. In murine models, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and in some strains, skeletal muscle, act as permissive reservoirs where infection foci persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Cardiac infections in the chronic stage appear to be periodic rather than persistent, with detectable infection ranging from 10% - 80%, depending on the mouse-parasite strain combination. Persistent cardiac infection is not required for the development of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Rather, intermittent cardiac infection, perhaps a result of parasite trafficking from more immune-tolerant niches, seems to be sufficient. The resulting pro-inflammatory responses, continually eliminate these periodic infections, but often to the detriment of surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Cardiac muscle and nervous tissue have low regenerative capacity, a feature that may explain the progressive nature of the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the case of DCD, outcomes can include changes in motility, secretion and absorption, particularly in the colon and oesophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Irreversible denervation in the enteric nervous system has been proposed to lead to progressive dysfunction in gut motility, involving difficulty in swallowing, slower GI transit and faeces retention, finally leading to megacolon or megaoesophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Recently, a murine model of digestive Chagas disease has been developed in which a digestive transit delay and faeces retention is associated with chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> persistence in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This model provides a platform for dissection of DCD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P7">For several decades, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections have been treated with the nitroheterocyclic drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Despite their long-standing use, there are several issues which contribute to a high level of treatment failure (10-50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). These include treatment duration (60-90 days), toxicity that leads to patient non-compliance, and variable efficacy across the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> species. In addition, both these pro-drugs are bio-activated within the parasite by the same mitochondrial nitroreductase (TcNTR-1), which could lead to cross-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). To address these challenges, there is an international effort, driven by large drug-development consortia, to extend the range of therapeutic options. A promising candidate that emerged early in this process was the anti-fungal drug posaconazole, an inhibitor of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Posaconazole exhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> antiparasitic activity in the low nanomolar range, displayed promising <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, had a good safety profile, and was already licenced for human use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Unfortunately, it ultimately failed in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), and more sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice revealed an inability to provide regular sterile cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P8">There is abundant evidence from animal experiments that curative benznidazole treatment can block the development of cardiac pathology, particularly if delivered early in an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Similarly, in the case of murine DCD, curative treatment in the acute stage halts disease progression, reverses the gut motility defect, and leads to a recovery in the density of colonic myenteric neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In contrast, although non-curative treatment results an initial improvement in GI tract symptoms, this is transient, with infection relapse leading to a return of pathology. Collectively, these experiments provide a strong rationale for the consensus that the presence of the parasite is required to drive the immune-mediated tissue damage that results in Chagas disease pathology.</p><p id="P9">The Target Product Profile for new Chagas disease drugs describes a candidate that provides parasitological cure during the asymptomatic chronic stage of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). This is in accordance with our current understanding of disease pathogenesis, which predicts that timely intervention should block further development of pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The discovery of new drugs that conform to this profile has been demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Given the progressive nature of Chagas disease, an alternative treatment strategy could involve long-term intermittent administration of therapeutics that are able to reduce the parasite burden sufficiently to slow the acquisition of tissue damage, so that symptomatic pathology and organ dysfunction does not arise during the life-time of the patient. To test this hypothesis, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infected mice were treated long-term with posaconazole under conditions in which the parasite burden was greatly reduced, but not eliminated. The results strongly indicate that sterile cure is necessary to protect against the development of both cardiac and GI tract pathology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">To determine if suppressive intermittent therapy could prevent or moderate the progression of Chagas disease pathology, posaconazole was selected because of its anti-parasitic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). In addition, we had previously shown that this drug could reduce splenomegaly in mice chronically infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, even when sterile cure was not achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We used female C3H/HeN mice infected with the bioluminescent <italic>T. cruzi</italic> JR-Luc strain (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In this infection model, the acute stage parasite burden peaks 3 - 4 weeks post-infection (wpi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), and mice develop chronic cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and digestive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) pathology.</p><p id="P11">The experimental outline is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Beginning 21 days post-infection (dpi), mice were treated with posaconazole, once daily for 12 days (20 mg/kg). By the end of this period, bioluminescence levels had been reduced by &gt;99%, close to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). One cohort of mice was given no further treatment (initial treatment group). The infection relapsed in all these mice, such that within 2 - 3 weeks of drug withdrawal, the parasite burden had returned to levels similar to those in non-treated control mice. There was then a reduction in parasite load, as the infection transitioned to the chronic stage (&gt;11 wpi), with infection foci displaying a typically dynamic spatiotemporal profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). After the initial treatment, a second cohort of mice was treated at monthly intervals (monthly treated group), for 5 days at 20 mg/kg, until the experimental end-point (31 wpi). With each mouse, monthly treatment resulted in a reduction in bioluminescence-inferred parasite burden to background levels, followed by a relapse. There was a tendency for the rebound in parasite burden to increase with time, such that later in the experimental schedule, it peaked at levels higher than in non-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In the third cohort, after the initial treatment period, mice were treated weekly with a single 20 mg/kg dose (weekly treatment group). With this regimen, parasites were barely detectable by <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging until 22 wpi, and as with the monthly dosing cohort, the extent of relapse then tended to increase, although this was not consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Treated mice were examined by <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging at the experimental end-point (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This confirmed that all mice in the treatment groups were still infected. Bioluminescent foci were detectable in the GI tract and skin in all cases, whereas in other organs and tissues, including the heart, infection was more sporadic. At the end-point, the overall level of infection in mice that received only the initial 12-day dosing, or received monthly intermittent treatment was similar to non-treated mice. Mice that received the single weekly dose had fewer detectable foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), possibly reflecting that they had received their final posaconazole dose 3 days before the end-point at 31 wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The limit of detection by <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging is &lt;12 parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To determine if the trend of relapses to become more pronounced over time was linked to acquired resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), 12 parasite clones were isolated from a range of mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials and Methods</xref>). None of the clones displayed increased tolerance to posaconazole, as inferred from treatment of infected COLO-N680 cell cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Mice were assessed regularly throughout the experimental period for GI transit time delays as a marker for digestive Chagas disease after oral gavage with the red dye tracer carmine (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), non-treated mice developed a delay during the acute stage, which peaked 4.5 wpi. After partially subsiding, severity increased later in the chronic stage (24 wpi and beyond) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Non-curative posaconazole treatment (initial treatment group) led to a rapid reversal of the GI transit delay, back to levels observed in the non-infected controls. However, the effect was temporary; the transit time reverted to that in non-treated mice by week 12, with severity increasing further by the experimental end-point (30 wpi). A detailed temporal breakdown and statistical analysis of the transit delay data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>. In the cohort of mice that were given additional monthly treatment, the reversal of the transit delay was maintained until beyond week 18, but then reached a level similar to that of non-treated mice by week 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Treated mice given weekly doses of posaconazole, followed the same trend. At 30 wpi, several mice from all infected groups displayed transit time delays beyond the four-hour cut-off period, implying the development of severe chronic DCD pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">At the experimental end-point, we also investigated the impact of the treatment regimens on the development of a constipation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) by assessing retention of faecal pellets in the colon after 2 hours fasting. Pellet numbers in each of the treated cohorts were found to be more than twice those in colons from non-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and not statistically different from mice that were non-treated. In this infection model, we previously observed that non-curative benznidazole treatment during the acute stage leads to a transient improvement in GI tract motility and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), but during the chronic stage, the extent of pathology reverts to that in non-treated mice. Our results here show that this chronic stage outcome also occurs even when suppressive intermittent treatment is administered at weekly or monthly intervals for the duration of the infection.</p><p id="P16">To evaluate the ability of suppressive posaconazole treatment to block development of cardiac pathology, quantitative analysis of collagen content was used as an indicator of pathological myocardial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In non-infected age-matched control mice, the collagen content was notably consistent (15 cardiac images examined per mouse) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), and 3 - 4 times lower (<italic>p</italic>=0.01) than in non-treated infected mice. There was greater variation in the levels of fibrosis in infected mice, an observation that has been made previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and which reflects the situation found in human infections. No significant difference in collagen content was observed between non-treated mice and those from the initial treatment group. Similarly, in the infected mice exposed to the weekly or monthly posaconazole treatment regimens, the extent of collagen deposition was not significantly different from the non-treated cohort, with no apparent benefit arising from the intermittent regimen.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Chronic Chagas disease pathology is highly variable and can take decades to develop. Symptomatic pathology results from tissue damage caused by inflammatory immune responses to infections of the heart or GI tract, and accumulates over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The highly variable disease outcomes are thought to reflect the impact of host and parasite genetics, together with a range of environmental and life-style factors. Drug development strategies are based on a perceived need to achieve sterile cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). An alternative strategy could be the long-term use of drugs, which might not eliminate the infection, but is able to maintain the parasite burden below a threshold required to drive symptomatic pathology during the life-time of the infected individual. A crucial requirement of such drugs would be an acceptable safety profile under long-term use, for example, similar to that of statins.</p><p id="P18">To test this hypothesis, we selected posaconazole, a well-tolerated anti-fungal drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) that reduces <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections to very low levels, but typically does not eliminate the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The initial treatment conditions (20 mg/kg for 12 days) reduced the parasite burden below the level of detection by <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, but was followed by relapse in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Monthly treatment resulted in the parasite burden being temporarily reduced to background levels, only for it to rebound, sometimes higher than in the non-treated control mice, when drug pressure was released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Despite these relapses, the continued ability of treatment to knockdown the parasite load suggested that long-term intermittent dosing did not result in the development of posaconazole-resistance. This was confirmed by assessing the posaconazole sensitivity of parasites rescued from infected mice at the experimental end-point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Posaconazole is considered to be a trypanostatic drug, and activity against intracellular parasites <italic>in vitro</italic> reaches a plateau where increasing drug concentration no longer results in further growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). With <italic>T. cruzi</italic> JR-Luc, intracellular growth inhibition of the isolated parasite clones plateaued between 65-75% at all concentrations tested between 8 and 500 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Increases in the extent of recrudescence after multiple suppressive treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) might therefore reflect a selective bottleneck that allows parasites with a slightly higher <italic>in vivo</italic> growth rate to dominate the population.</p><p id="P19">DCD is an enteric neuropathy that in the C3H/HeN:TcJR-Luc host:parasite model results in a GI transit delay that first becomes apparent during the acute stage of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This is then followed by partial recovery, before further deterioration sets in as mice progress through the chronic stage. Drug-induced functional restoration following curative treatment with benznidazole in the acute stage is associated with recovery of neuronal density in the myenteric plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In the current study, we also observed a biphasic curve in GI transit time during the course of non-treated infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Non-curative suppressive treatment with posaconazole, initiated during the acute stage (3 wpi), led to a rapid reversal of dysfunction, such that GI transit times returned to levels comparable with the non-infected control group. By week 12 however, the transit time in mice that had received only the initial posaconazole treatment returned to that in non-treated infected mice, and then underwent further deterioration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Both the monthly and weekly intermittent treatment groups exhibited reversal of the acute stage GI transit delay, and also displayed a lag in the onset of the chronic stage symptoms. However, by week 24, gut motility subsequently declined to levels exhibited in non-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). By the end-point, GI transit in the monthly and weekly intermittent treatment groups was significantly impaired in comparison with the non-infected group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In benznidazole-cured mice, there is no deterioration in GI transit time during the chronic stage, indicating that a durable restoration of GI function is possible if a prompt sterile cure is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The partial improvement in GI transit times in non-treated mice towards the end of the acute stage, followed by further decline later in the chronic stage, suggests that two different mechanisms may be driving the GI transit pathology. This has parallels with CCC, where pathology in the acute stage is associated with myocarditis, and in the chronic stage, with cumulative damage and maladaptive fibrotic tissue repair that leads to cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In the chronic stage, several mice in all the infected groups displayed GI transit time delays that were beyond the 4-hour cut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating the development of more severe DCD pathology than observed earlier in the infection. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of the GI tract leads to cumulative neuron loss in the enteric nervous system, resulting in a progressive decline in gut motility, particularly associated with the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). To further investigate the functional deterioration of peristalsis, end-point assessment of faecal retention in the colon was also carried out. This constipation phenotype, similar to that in human DCD, revealed no significant improvement in mice that received non-curative treatment, compared to non-treated controls. All the treated groups showed a significant increase in faecal retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore, under the conditions tested, long-term suppressive posaconazole treatment does not lead to improvement in chronic DCD symptoms, as judged by GI transit delay or faecal retention.</p><p id="P21">In C3H/HeN mice chronically infected with the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> JR-Luc strain, the profile of organ/tissue parasite distribution is more disseminated than in other murine models, and up to 80% of mice display cardiac-localised infections when assessed by <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Mice display extensive cardiac fibrosis, a marker of CCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), irrespective of whether their hearts are infected at the point of analysis. Consistent with the DCD data, our results show that long-term non-curative intermittent posaconazole treatment also provides no significant protection against cardiac fibrosis at the experimental end-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, despite suppression of the overall parasite burden, particularly with the weekly treatment regimen, there was no significant reduction in the severity of either GI tract or cardiac pathology. One possibility might be that the transient and fluctuating nature of recrudescence could impact the dynamics of the inflammatory immune response, such that this negates any beneficial outcome arising from a reduction in the overall parasite burden.</p><p id="P22">In summary, we have examined the impact of two intermittent posaconazole treatment regimens on three key aspects of chronic Chagas disease pathology (GI transit delay, faecal retention and cardiac fibrosis). Our study demonstrates that these suppressive regimens do not prevent or alleviate long-term development of DCD or CCC, even when the parasite burden is considerably reduced. This outcome highlights that an ability to provide sterile cure should remain a pre-requisite of any anti-parasitic Chagas disease drug that is advanced to the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P23">Animal studies were carried out under the UK Home Office licence P9AEE04E, in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mouse husbandry, infections and treatment</title><p id="P24">The <italic>T. cruzi</italic> JR strain (Discrete Typing Unit I; DTU I), modified to express the red-shifted luciferase gene <italic>PpyRE9h</italic> (TcJR-Luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), was used in all experiments.
