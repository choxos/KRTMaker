At the individual level, success in STEM education is associated with positive life outcomes, including income, health, and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). For governments worldwide, promoting student engagement in STEM is increasingly recognized as an investment in human capital development—an imperative for nations looking to remain competitive in the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Thus, perhaps now more than ever, it is essential for social scientists to study how to foster engagement and talent in STEM to inform the development and implementation of evidence-based policies and educational programs.</p><p id="P5"><strike>To this end</strike>, research has investigated spatial ability as a predictor of aptitude, interest, and choice in STEM educational and career pursuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Although theoretical discordances exist regarding the exact structure of the construct, spatial ability can be broadly defined as “the ability to generate, retain, retrieve, and transform well-structured visual images” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Typically, spatial ability tests assess individuals’ abilities to mentally rotate or reconfigure shapes or objects, visualize them from different perspectives, and make judgments about the operations of mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Dating back to the earliest modern cognitive tests, spatial ability tests were and continue to be found in almost all batteries of general intelligence, historically and psychometrically situating it as a domain of general cognitive ability, or <italic>g</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Much of the work on the association between spatial skills and STEM educational outcomes has conceptualized spatial ability within a simplified version of Carroll’s hierarchical model of <italic>g</italic>, in which tests are categorized within three content domains: mathematical, spatial, and verbal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Despite high inter-correlations between these three domains, longitudinal research in samples of gifted youth has consistently uncovered markedly different cognitive domain profiles between STEM and humanities students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). That is, individuals scoring higher in the spatial domain relative to the verbal domain had a greater inclination towards STEM disciplines compared to humanities disciplines with respect to interest, degree choice, and occupation. In contrast, the opposite was true for those who scored higher in verbal relative to spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Other studies have found that spatial ability added incremental predictive validity for STEM success beyond that explained by mathematics-verbal proxies of cognitive abilities (e.g., the SAT; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)). Altogether, this literature suggests that spatial ability, though putatively a domain of general cognitive ability, has specific relevance for STEM success.</p><p id="P7">The current study addresses three key gaps in the extant literature on the relationship between spatial ability and STEM. First, although spatial ability is generally acknowledged to contribute to <italic>g</italic>, the extent to which spatial ability predicts STEM success beyond other cognitive abilities remains unclear. To address this first aim, we tested the associations between spatial ability and STEM outcomes at three levels of granularity: first, we examined the link between spatial ability and STEM outcomes; second, we assessed their associations after accounting for verbal ability; and third, we tested whether their associations remained after considering general cognitive ability, the most stringent control. We compared the predictive utility of spatial ability across STEM and humanities subjects to unpack the specificity of the prediction further.</p><p id="P8">Second, measures of spatial ability used in research have largely focused on narrow conceptualizations of the construct (i.e., object-oriented abilities) while neglecting other domains of spatial skills (e.g., large-scale visualization and navigation abilities) that have traditionally been difficult to measure. Thus, little is known about the predictive role of navigational skills for STEM outcomes, nor whether differential predictive utility exists across different spatial domains and STEM subjects (i.e., are certain domains associated with certain STEM subjects more highly than others?). In the current study, we leverage previous work conducted by our research team, who investigated the structure of spatial ability measured with two innovative online batteries of 16 spatial ability tests (these batteries and their development are described in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods and Materials</xref> section) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, our previous work uncovered a hierarchical structure of spatial ability in which three broad domains (navigation, object manipulation, and visualization) were largely captured by a higher-order general factor of spatial ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In the present study, we explore the predictive ability of these three domains of spatial ability (as well as that of the general spatial ability factor) on STEM engagement and achievement, measured as subject choice, degree choice, and academic achievement. Our second aim was to investigate the extent to which these three domains of spatial ability differentially predict STEM engagement and achievement.</p><p id="P9">Finally, limited work has examined the contribution of genetic and environmental factors in explaining individual differences in spatial ability. To date, behavioral genetic studies of spatial ability have typically been limited by small sample sizes and measures that vary widely across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). As a result, estimates of etiological influence have varied widely (e.g., a meta-analysis on twin studies of “spatial reasoning” found heritability estimates ranging from 0.12 to 0.94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)), while efforts to consolidate these estimates are undermined by a lack of measurement invariance across studies. Our previous work examined the genetic and environmental influences underlying the variation (and covariation with <italic>g</italic>) in our comprehensive spatial ability batteries described above using the twin design to address this issue. Results suggested that spatial ability and its domains were partly heritable and, critically, displayed a large degree of genetic independence from <italic>g</italic> (45%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Given this, our third aim in the present study was to examine the extent to which shared genetic and environmental factors accounted for the links between spatial ability and STEM outcomes before and after accounting for shared variance with <italic>g</italic> or verbal ability.</p><p id="P10">Analyses were pre-registered with the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/48kwa/">https://osf.io/48kwa/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Creating the structure of spatial ability, verbal ability, and g through confirmatory factor analysis</title><p id="P11">Leveraging our previous work, we first conducted confirmatory factory analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) on our measures of (a) spatial ability, (b) verbal ability, and (c) general cognitive ability (<italic>g</italic>) before extracting factor scores from each model (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods and Materials</xref> for additional details and SI Appendix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1-S4</xref> for factor loadings, model fit statistics and correlations between factors).

A general pattern of attenuation in variance was observed going from uncorrected to verbal-corrected to <italic>g</italic>-corrected models, indicating that both verbal ability and <italic>g</italic>—but especially <italic>g</italic>—index a large portion of phenotypic variance shared with spatial ability. Critically, however, corrected associations remained significant and non-negligible in terms of variance explained for many STEM outcomes, for example choosing a STEM subject in middle (GCSE) and high school (A levels), but not for humanities outcomes.</p><p id="P15">Interestingly, the largest associations after correcting for other cognitive abilities were observed for outcomes related to engagement and choice (e.g., STEM pipeline) rather than achievement scores (e.g., <italic>GCSE Mathematics</italic> and <italic>GCSE STEM mean</italic>). The largest of these corrected associations was observed for <italic>STEM pipeline</italic> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.04 after correcting for <italic>g</italic>), a 4-level ordinal variable we created that denotes how far students proceed in STEM education (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods and Materials</xref> for a detailed explanation of how this variable was computed). Similarly, associations remained for <italic>choosing a non-compulsory STEM GCSE</italic>, <italic>choosing a STEM A(S)-Level</italic>, and <italic>choosing a STEM degree</italic> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.03 after correcting for <italic>g</italic> for all), highlighting how spatial ability, independent of <italic>g</italic>, seems to have specific predictive utility for engagement and interest in STEM rather than achievement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> highlights the distributions of the spatial ability score as a function of STEM pipeline score. Spatial abilities differed significantly at every stage of the STEM pipeline with the lowest scores on average observed for those students who left the STEM pipeline before middle school and the highest spatial ability scores observed for those students who chose a STEM degree.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Object manipulation abilities provide the most accurate prediction of STEM outcomes</title><p id="P16">When investigating potential differences in the associations across the three broad domains of spatial ability for different outcomes, we found limited evidence for differential predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>); the pattern of associations across the different domains was consistent across all outcomes. Notably, however, the associations for the object manipulation factor were slightly—but systematically—larger than those observed for the other three factors.</p><p id="P17">We, therefore, ran post-hoc analyses associating all 16 individual spatial ability items with two core outcomes that emerged from our previous analyses: <italic>GCSE STEM mean grade</italic> and <italic>STEM pipeline</italic>. We found that tests of object manipulation ability consistently resulted in greater associations with STEM outcomes than individual visualization or navigation ability tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the most predictive tests were <italic>2D drawing</italic> (β=0.39. 95% CI [0.35, 0.44], <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.19) and <italic>paper folding</italic> (β=0.39. 95% CI [0.33, 0.45], <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.14), while the least predictive were scanning (β=0.06. 95% CI [-0.01, 0.13], <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.00) and map reading (β=0.08. 95% CI [0, 0.16], <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.01).

Spatial ability factors and some educational outcomes showed no evidence for shared environmental influence, while the remaining outcomes showed modest shared and unique environmental influences. Full univariate statistics can be found in SI Appendix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S11</xref>.</p><p id="P20">Then, we conducted bivariate correlated factors twin models to explore the shared etiology underpinning the phenotypic associations between spatial ability and educational outcomes. Due to the lack of domain specificity observed in our phenotypic analyses, we limited these analyses to our general spatial ability factor. We observed moderate to strong genetic correlations across almost all pairings of spatial ability and STEM educational outcomes (<italic>r</italic>A = 0.15 to 0.71) and, accordingly, high bivariate heritability estimates (bivariate <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.62 to 0.86), indicating that shared genetic factors accounted for the largest proportion of the phenotypic correlation between the two variables, between 62 and 86%. Moreover, these estimates were substantially higher for spatial ability-STEM pairings than for spatial ability-humanities pairings (<italic>r</italic>A = 0.04 to 0.40; bivariate <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.26 to 0.65), indicating that genetic overlap with spatial abilities was greater for most STEM subjects than humanities subjects.</p><p id="P21"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> depicts the genetic overlap between the general factor of spatial ability and STEM and humanities outcomes. Results for the shared environment were more varied, with some outcomes (for both STEM and humanities) showing substantial or even complete overlap. In contrast, non-shared environmental overlap was zero or near-zero for all outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figures S6-S7</xref>). Visualizations for these ACE components are displayed in SI Appendix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S8 and S9</xref>, while full model statistics are presented in SI Appendix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>.</p><p id="P22">Finally, we conducted trivariate Cholesky decompositions to explore this shared aetiology after accounting for verbal ability or <italic>g</italic>. Mirroring our phenotypic analyses, we observed greater shared genetic variance for <italic>g</italic>-corrected models compared to verbal-corrected models. In other words, the specific shared genetic influence between spatial ability and educational outcomes were lower when accounting for <italic>g</italic> than when accounting for verbal ability.

First, does spatial ability consistently predict STEM success above and beyond other cognitive abilities? Second, which domains of spatial ability, if any, are more predictive of STEM success? And third, to what extent do shared genetic and environmental factors account for the specific associations between spatial ability and STEM success?</p><p id="P24">Our results show that spatial ability is highly predictive of STEM success. These associations remained significant even after correcting for verbal ability or <italic>g</italic>, with the largest associations observed for STEM engagement rather than achievement variables. At a more granular level, object manipulation is a more accurate predictor than other spatial domains for almost all outcomes. At the etiological level, shared genetic factors consistently account for the largest proportion of the phenotypic associations between spatial ability and STEM success, though much of this genetic variance is also shared with general cognitive ability.</p><sec id="S8"><title>The associations between spatial ability and STEM success persist after correcting for other cognitive abilities</title><p id="P25">We first examined the direct association between spatial ability (and its domains) and STEM success without controlling for other cognitive abilities. As expected, we found that spatial ability was highly predictive of STEM outcomes and to a much larger degree than humanities outcomes. Across all spatial ability domains, the largest direct predictions were observed for <italic>GCSE Mathematics</italic> and <italic>GCSE STEM mean grades</italic> (computed as the average of GCSE Mathematics, Statistics, Technology and all science subject grades (i.e., Statistics, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Physics, Chemistry and Biology)). In comparison, the prediction for <italic>GCSE humanities mean grade</italic> (computed as the average of GCSE English Language, English Literature, all language subjects, and all other humanities subject grades (i.e., English, French, Spanish, German and History)) was roughly half of the <italic>GCSE STEM mean grade</italic>.</p><p id="P26">We also found that predictions for individual science subject grades (e.g., <italic>GCSE Biology grade</italic>) were much lower. This finding is likely explained by smaller sample sizes and reduced variance. At the time GCSE examinations were taken in our sample, only individuals pursuing the most advanced science qualifications were awarded individual subject grade GCSEs (others received either a “Core Science” GCSE or an “Additional Science” GCSE). Thus, individuals with data for <italic>GCSE Biology grade, GCSE Chemistry grade</italic> and <italic>GCSE Physics grade</italic> comprise only a small portion of the overall sample. Moreover, ostensible talent-based self-selection in this subsample would likely have reduced variance in predictor and outcome variables. Both explanations also apply to the relatively low A-Level outcome predictions, given that choosing to pursue A-Levels is non-compulsory.</p><p id="P27">Next, we examined how the associations between spatial ability and STEM outcomes persisted after accounting for verbal ability or <italic>g</italic>. We found that many predictions across the four spatial ability factors, though attenuated in effect size, remained highly significant for STEM outcomes but not humanities outcomes. This suggests that spatial ability is associated with humanities outcomes almost entirely due to the former’s shared variance with other cognitive abilities, while some unique variance accounts for its associations with STEM outcomes. Moreover, the attenuation in predictions was greater when correcting for <italic>g</italic> than for verbal ability, reflecting that <italic>g</italic> is perhaps an overly stringent control.</p><p id="P28">Most notable amongst our corrected analyses was the finding that the highest predictions across all spatial ability factors were for variables related to STEM engagement rather than achievement. The highest was for our <italic>STEM pipeline</italic> variable, a 4-level ordinal variable indicating how far an individual proceeds in STEM education, followed closely by the binary choice variables that were used to compute this variable (<italic>chose a non-compulsory STEM GCSE</italic>, <italic>chose a STEM A(S)-Level</italic>, and <italic>chose a STEM degree</italic>). Considering the relatively low corrected associations for STEM <italic>achievement</italic> variables, spatial ability may play a particularly important predictive role in STEM <italic>interest</italic> and <italic>engagement</italic>. This has profound implications for improving overall STEM outcomes, given that persistence and retention are necessary antecedents to achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, we acknowledge that choice, persistence and retention are not independent of performance.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Object manipulation skills are the strongest predictor of STEM success</title><p id="P29">The second question we aimed to explore in our phenotypic analyses was the extent to which we would observe differential predictions between our three domains. Our deep phenotyping allowed us to explore whether certain aspects of spatial ability were more predictive than others. we observed that object manipulation systematically explained more variance in STEM outcomes than the other factors, although the differences were only significant when looking at individual tests. In fact, when we examined these associations at the level of each spatial ability test, we found that several of the most predictive items that comprised the object manipulation factor (e.g., “2D drawing”, “pattern assembly”, and “paper folding”) <italic>were</italic> significantly more highly associated with STEM outcomes than the items that comprised the navigation and visualization factors. This suggests that honing in on developing these specific skills may have particular utility for prediction and intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Genetic and environmental associations</title><p id="P30">Finally, at the etiological level, we explored the extent to which shared latent genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and unique environmental factors (E) contributed to the phenotypic correlations between spatial ability and educational outcomes, both before and after accounting for shared etiological variance with <italic>g</italic> and verbal ability. We first conducted univariate twin models on all of our cognitive and educational outcome measures, observing, as expected, high heritability estimates for all of them (i.e., phenotypic variance in the trait was largely accounted for by genetic variance). We then conducted bivariate twin models pairing each educational outcome with spatial ability to decompose this genetic variance into that unique to the outcome and that shared with spatial ability. Therein, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, we observed a higher degree of genetic overlap between spatial ability and STEM outcomes compared to spatial ability and humanities outcomes. However, when we added <italic>g</italic> to the model (i.e., extending it from a bivariate to a trivariate twin model), we found that the majority of the shared genetic variance between spatial ability and the outcome was already accounted for by genetic variance shared with <italic>g</italic>. Much like our findings from our phenotypic analyses, this attenuation in unique genetic variance contributed by spatial ability was less pronounced when we controlled for verbal ability rather than g. Given that previous work on our measure of spatial ability in the same sample found that 45% of its genetic influence was independent of genetic influence on g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), the near-total genetic overlap with g in our trivariate models was somewhat unexpected, though it can be reconciled by considering that the remaining 55% of its genetic influence (i.e., the portion that is shared with g) may be the portion contributing to its phenotypic association with educational outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P31">The present study has several limitations. First, our correlational analyses prohibit causal interpretations of spatial ability’s effects on STEM success. This is compounded by the fact that our spatial ability data was collected in our sample after GCSEs were taken. As such, our findings do not preclude the possibility that early STEM success may also influence the development of stronger spatial ability skills, especially when considering extant literature on the reciprocal relationship between general intelligence and educational achievement across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Future work can address this weakness by employing a cross-lagged model on multiple measurements of both spatial ability and STEM achievement across development.</p><p id="P32">As previously discussed, our work is further limited by the variance and sample size restriction for individual STEM discipline data. As a result, we could not detect potential differential predictions for different STEM subjects (e.g., spatial ability being more predictive of, say, Physics achievement than Biology achievement). Given that extant literature has uncovered considerable differences in spatial-mathematics-verbal cognitive profiles between gifted degree holders in life science STEM fields (verbal &gt; spatial) compared to physical science and engineering STEM degree holders (spatial &gt; verbal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), future work should aim to corroborate this level of granularity in prediction.</p><p id="P33">Finally, regarding our genetic analyses, the usual limitations of the twin model apply. These include the lack of generalization as we only include British sample; and the potential for non-random mating, which can bias estimates of heritability in both directions. These limitations are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Implications</title><p id="P34">The implications of our findings fall into two categories: intervention (i.e., improving outcomes, particularly in disadvantaged groups) and identification (i.e., identifying and nurturing highly gifted individuals primarily for human capital development).</p><p id="P35">With regards to intervention, several recent studies and meta-analyses have suggested that spatial ability, in contrast to <italic>g</italic>, appears to be malleable to long-term improvement when subject to early childhood training and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Given our finding that spatial ability—and, in particular, object manipulation ability—appears to have particular utility as a specific predictor of STEM interest and choice rather than achievement, policy makers looking to increase engagement and retention in the so-called STEM pipeline may find it particularly prudent to focus on intervening in the development of the interest and choice of these skills at a young age. It is important to note here that our finding of high heritability does not preclude the possibility of intervention. Heritability is a statistic derived from decomposing the observed variance in a given sample under given environmental conditions—not a static measure of immutability or determinism. Regarding identification, spatial ability may be a useful indicator of potential STEM talent in educational and professional settings. Whether it be schools looking to funnel precocious youth down advanced STEM educational pathways or businesses looking to increase productive output, tests of spatial ability may be beneficial for their predictive value in addition to that provided by general tests of cognitive ability (i.e., by realizing its extra predictive ability above and beyond <italic>g</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P36">In conclusion, the present study investigated the specific predictive utility of multiple domains of spatial ability on STEM success and the etiological underpinnings of this relationship. We found that spatial ability (e.g., object manipulation ability) was highly associated with STEM outcomes; these associations persisted even after correcting for other cognitive abilities, particularly for outcomes related to continued engagement in STEM education, highlighting the importance of interest and choice of students; and that shared genetic factors largely drove these associations. Our work underscores the distinctive nature of spatial ability and demonstrates its utility as a specific predictor of STEM educational outcomes, particularly regarding interest and choice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S15" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P37">Participants were part of the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a longitudinal study of more than 10,000 twin pairs representative of the UK population born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. The TEDS sample has been assessed over a dozen times from infancy through early adulthood on a wide range of measures. See Rimfeld et al. (2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) for more details on the TEDS sample. The present study focuses on a subsample of TEDS twins who completed two spatial ability batteries at the ages of 19-22. For phenotypic analyses (i.e., linear and logistic regressions), one twin was randomly selected from each pair to account for relatedness, while full twin pairs were used for our genetic analyses. The maximum N was 1,968 individuals for phenotypic analyses and 3,936 individuals for genetic analyses. See SI Appendix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1-S11</xref> for full descriptive statistics and model statistics for each variable and pairwise comparison. All individuals with major medical, genetic or neurodevelopmental disorders were excluded from the dataset.

Our continuous measures were comprised of individual grade scores, composite grade scores, the number of STEM/humanities GCSEs/A-Levels taken, and a “STEM pipeline” variable which is described below. Composite scores were computed as the mean of pre-existing composites in the TEDS data dictionary (e.g., “GCSE STEM mean” was derived from pre-existing variables for mathematics GCSE mean, science GCSE mean, and technology GCSE mean), while variables for number of STEM/humanities GCSEs and A-Levels taken were computed by summing the total number of individual subjects taken. The STEM pipeline was computed as a 4-level ordinal variable where one’s score represents the termination of their STEM education: 1 indicates that the individual did not choose any non-compulsory STEM GCSEs, 2 indicates that the individual chose at least one non-compulsory STEM GCSE, 3 indicates that the individual chose at least one STEM A-Level, and 4 indicates that the individual chose to pursue a STEM Bachelor’s degree or higher. To ensure that our pipeline variable accurately captured retention and drop-out as opposed to study attrition, we restricted our sample to only those individuals with available data at all 4 stages of the pipeline.

By assuming that the shared family environment of both MZ and DZ twins are equal, a difference in intraclass correlations in trait outcome (i.e., a greater MZ correlation than DZ correlation) can be inferred as the effect of additive genetic influence (commonly denoted as A, or heritability) on the variance in the trait.

This is done by comparing the cross-trait cross-twin correlations between MZ and DZ twins, with a higher MZ correlation implying shared additive genetic covariance between the traits. The bivariate model produces a statistic called genetic correlation (R<sub>A</sub>), which indexes pleiotropy by denoting how genetic effects on one phenotype correlate with genetic effects on the other, independent of the heritability of the traits. When this genetic correlation is weighted by the heritability of each phenotype, an estimate of bivariate heritability (the amount of covariance accounted for by genetic factors) is produced.</p><p id="P53">Cholesky decomposition is an alternate solution to the correlated ACE model that places a special distinction on the ordering of variables such that variance can be decomposed into shared and independent ACE effects.
