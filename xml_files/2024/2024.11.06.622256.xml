Related taxa tend to also live in similar ecological niches – this trend is termed <italic>Niche conservatism</italic>. Both concepts are widely used to understand crucial aspects of evolution and speciation and are well-established in animals and plants. The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions. We propose “community conservatism” to refer to this, and leverage a database with millions of samples and hundreds of thousands of pairs of microbial taxa to assess their relatedness and the similarity of the communities they occupy.</p><p id="P2">Our findings reveal that community conservatism can be observed globally in all environments and phyla tested, to varying extents. Ecologically specialized taxa show a stronger community conservatism signal than generalists, and the signal can be discerned over nearly all taxonomic ranks. Analyzing community conservatism shows promise to advance our understanding of evolution, speciation, and the mechanisms governing community assembly in microorganisms. Furthermore, we propose it can be used to reintegrate ecological parameters into Operational Taxonomic Unit delimitation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Phylogenetic lineages tend to retain their ancestral ecological niches over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This so-called niche conservatism is often discussed in the context of a broader concept, phylogenetic signal, where closely related species tend to resemble each other morphologically and functionally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Numerous studies demonstrated niche conservatism and phylogenetic signal in animals and plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Therein, the analysis and distribution of various traits, such as habitat preferences, morphology (e.g. leaf shape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and physiology, shed light on crucial aspects of evolution including speciation. Additionally, these studies help to predict how eukaryotes may adapt to rising challenges such as the spread of invasive species or climate change <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Apart from animals and plants, microorganisms also fulfill crucial roles in almost all areas of life, from driving biogeochemical cycles to influencing human health and diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Despite their importance, much less is known about the ecology and long-term evolution of microbes: only limited anecdotal evidence exists for niche conservatism and phylogenetic signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. For instance, studies indicate that some traits can be conserved over long time periods in microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In computationally inferred microbial interaction networks, closely related organisms have been predicted to interact with one another more often (Phylogenetic assortativity) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, most of these observations were restricted to a few environments and/or lineages.</p><p id="P5">The assumption that phylogenetic signal and niche conservatism are present globally is used in many popular algorithms, such as UniFrac and PINA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Characterizing microbial niche conservatism and phylogenetic signal on a global scale is thus crucial, yet challenging due to the lack of information about the traits of uncultured microbes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, microbes frequently transfer genes horizontally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which makes it difficult to infer traits from genomic information alone. The mix of vertical and horizontal inheritance furthermore impedes delineation of species boundaries and the assessment of evolutionary relationships <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. As a result, even the concept of species in microbes is still a matter of ongoing debate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Arguably, the currently used pragmatic method of delimitating Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by solely considering sequence similarity at an approximate species-level threshold could also be improved by reintegrating ecological information.</p><p id="P6">Here, we look for an alternative to trait-based assessment of ecology, since environmental parameters are often not known and morphological features are scarce. Instead, we focus on what high-quality data we do have: millions of DNA-sequenced microbial community samples from all over the globe, and phylogenetic marker genes such as 16S rRNA enable us to know precisely in which communities a given microbial species occurs. Community structure can accurately distinguish different ecological niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and has successfully been used to determine niche ranges in generalist and specialist animals and microbes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, communities are generally thought to be functionally relatively constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Following this line of work, we here treat community composition as a proxy for the realized niche of a microorganism – the latter being determined through multiple, often unknown effects, ranging from the abiotic environment to microbial interactions. Thus, we hypothesized that by using a community-centric approach we can approximate phylogenetic signal and niche conservatism in microbes by analyzing the tendency of closely related organisms to occur in similar communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We show with an extensive analysis that more closely related taxa indeed occur in more similar communities. Remarkably, this trend is consistently detectable in all investigated phyla and environments. We suggest the term “community conservatism” for this phenomenon and show that remnants of microbial community preferences can be traced back billions of years. Furthermore, we show varying trends of community conservatism in different phyla, infer generalism- and specialism-specific signals and provide hundreds of OTU-pairs with potential interest for diverse research areas. Lastly, we outline the potential use of community conservatism as a second parameter – next to sequence similarity – in OTU clustering, to reintegrate ecological information in the future.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S2"><title>Community structure as a proxy for niches and functional potential</title><p id="P9">We investigated global microbiomes utilizing the MicrobeAtlas project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.microbeatlas.org">https://www.microbeatlas.org</ext-link>), a database with a web-interface now containing over two million environmental microbiome sequencing samples, and over 400,000 taxa clustered into hierarchical OTUs using different similarity thresholds (from 90% to 99% full length 16S rRNA sequence similarity, whereas 97 to 99% traditionally correspond to “species-level” taxonomic groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>). By using such standardized occurrence data on a global scale, classical ecological questions can be investigated, such as the function of the ocean microbiome and which microbes are crucial for dissolving organic carbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">We worked with OTUs defined at 99% sequence similarity (16S rRNA similarity) and initially assessed in which samples the OTUs occur globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Next, we compared OTUs in a pairwise manner and calculated two main parameters for each pair: (i) the relatedness of the involved OTUs, and (ii) the similarity of the communities in which they occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Relatedness is estimated from a large, high-quality phylogenetic tree, from which we randomly sampled pairs of OTUs to obtain a uniform distribution of phylogenetic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). We then assessed the ß-diversity of all communities in which we detected them. For each pair, all samples containing the first OTU are compared to all samples containing the second OTU, measured as Bray-Curtis similarity (BCS: 1 - Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). Previous work showed that BCS can adequately distinguish ecological niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and it can be computed at scale using optimized software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Lastly, pairwise plotting of relatedness and average community similarity values of each OTU-pair– combined with curve fitting – is used to assess the community conservatism signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To illustrate the general workflow, we compared four example OTUs with one another, at varying levels of relatedness: <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> subclade 1, <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> subclade 2, <italic>Companilactobacillus crustorus</italic> and <italic>Sar324</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The two <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> clades, belonging to the Bacillota, are closely related commensals found in the oral cavity of humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> with very similar communities (average BCS of 0.15). <italic>C. crustorus</italic> is a more distantly related Bacillota OTU found in diverse environments, including the human microbiome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, despite sharing some community members (BCS 0.03), <italic>C. crustorus</italic> occupies different niches and appears to be more generalist. Lastly, <italic>SAR324</italic> is a predominately marine bacterium which is found in different layers of the ocean <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. It is only distantly related to the other OTUs, and as expected also its inhabited communities are very dissimilar (BCS 0.005). Hence, our hypothesis that more closely related OTU-pairs occur in similar communities is supported in this small example.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Community conservatism is present on a global scale</title><p id="P12">To extend this workflow to a global scale, we chose 25,000 strictly quality-filtered, taxonomically annotated OTU pairs. We first assessed their sample-by-sample co-occurrence, showing that related species tend to occur more frequently in the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). While likely biologically relevant, this signal would compound our observations by inflating ß-diversity values when comparing identical samples. To mitigate this effect, we chose a conservative approach and only compared samples which do not belong to the same research project (i.e., do not share the same “project-ID” at the Sequence Read Archive).</p><p id="P13">We aimed to select the OTU-threshold which best reflects the ecological niche for the computation of ß-diversities. While we observed the same community conservatism trends with 90%, 97% or 99% OTU definitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>), it has been hypothesized that microbial ecological niches are most clearly reflected at the genus level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In our dataset, 90% sequence similarity between OTUs roughly corresponded to a genus/family level divergence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, more sequence reads can be unambiguously assigned when using 90% OTUs, thus we decided to use this level for all community similarity calculations going forward.</p><p id="P14">Our results demonstrate the presence of community conservatism in microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>): OTU-pairs that are more closely related (x-axis, towards left) are more similar in their communities (y-axis, towards top). To visualize this observation, we fitted a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) as well as an exponential decay function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>) to the data. We found both fitted curves strongly deviate from a null-model based on expected average community similarities between random samples (exponential decay coefficient: −4.23). Trends remain similar when using medians or other percentiles to aggregate community similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To obtain a statistical estimation of community conservatism, OTU-pairs were furthermore binned according to their latest shared taxonomy. Significant deviation (p&lt;0.0001) above the baseline was observed for each taxonomic level to the next, all the way up to phylum level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This indicates that community preference is traceable back – and has potentially been passed on – for billions of years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The largest differences in the average BCS exist between species and genus levels, suggesting that species-level adaptations are particularly important for community preferences.</p><p id="P16">We showed that OTU-pairs belonging to the same species are often found in very similar communities, and hence competition due to their overlapping niches might be expected. The coexistence of many direct competitors should not be feasible according to classical ecological models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. While this conflicts our observation that closely related strains are also often co-occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), there have been more observations showing said co-occurrence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Recent research has shown that horizontal gene transfer might alleviate the competition between related microbial species and allow the coexistence of many closely related competitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. However, competition or exclusion of closely related taxa at a small scale – which remains undetected in our 16S rRNA based analysis – cannot be excluded.</p><p id="P17">Next, we checked how well the taxonomic relatedness of OTUs (based on available NCBI annotations) overlapped with the tree branch lengths that we use to estimate relatedness. Overall, taxonomic ranks follow phylogenetic distances as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, it is also apparent that in some cases taxonomic classifications and 16S rRNA sequence similarities do not fully agree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). This is consistent with known deviations between trait-based taxonomies and purely sequence-based clustering <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Environmental preferences are entangled with community conservatism</title><p id="P18">Consistent with the concept of niche conservatism, we postulated that related OTUs would tend to inhabit similar environments. To test this hypothesis, we used MicrobeAtlas environmental annotations to compute per-environment OTU abundances. Next, we categorized each OTU into one of five primary environments: soil, animal, plant, marine, and freshwater. Our analysis revealed a consistent trend for related species to be found in the same main environment, partially driving the observed community conservatism trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These findings suggest that broad-scale niche conservatism, the tendency of OTUs to remain in their primary environments, is also evident in microorganisms. While we utilized only broad habitat classifications due to the often-unreliable nature of publicly available metadata, previous observations of niche conservatism at a smaller scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> indeed indicate that, given sufficient high-quality data, this concept could extend to more specific ecological niches.</p><p id="P19">We were furthermore curious whether community conservatism extends beyond these broad environmental preferences, i.e. whether it still persists even when the primary environment is normalized for. To investigate this, we limited the analysis to OTU pairs that were either assigned to the same main environment or to pairs belonging to different environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P20">This analysis revealed that community conservatism is consistently observable even <italic>within</italic> different environments, interestingly with varying trends. Conversely, as expected, OTU-pairs annotated to different main environments had the lowest overall community similarities. Most environments exhibited similar BCS-ranges of their OTU-pairs, with the notable exception of soils, which showed almost twice the community similarity of other environments. While soil microbial communities can vary significantly even at centimeter scales, they are globally more similar than often assumed and are usually dominated by a few taxa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Additionally, most soil samples are agricultural and therefore particularly homogeneous. Interestingly, the community conservatism of OTUs mainly annotated to plants already plateaus at approximately genus-level phylogenetic similarity. This could potentially be rationalized by OTUs preferring certain plant types at a broader phylogenetic level. However, it is important to note that only 2,781 OTUs are predominately annotated to plants, which is 4-fold less than in any other environment (next lowest: freshwater 11,671 OTUs). This may increase the likelihood of artifacts stemming from a somewhat higher number of redundant comparisons across large phylogenetic groups.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Phyla-specific characteristics of community conservatism</title><p id="P21">We showed that community conservatism is present in microorganisms on a global scale, irrespective of their main environment and extending as far back as the phylum level. The next question we wanted to address is whether we can infer characteristics of the ecology, speciation and community assembly processes across the different phyla. For this, we next repeated the previous analysis separately for each phylum represented by a minimum of 500 OTUs in the MicrobeAtlas database. In total, these were 3 Archaeal and 16 Bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). As we showed previously, the environment in which the phyla are mainly found strongly influences community conservatism. To mitigate that effect, we calculated phylum-specific null models, considering the expected community similarity values by accounting for the main environments of the compared OTUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P22">By normalizing our community similarity metrics against these phylum-specific baselines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), we obtained normalized community conservatism curves. Intriguingly, these curves trend differently across phyla, with those containing less than 3,000 OTUs showing increased noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Yet, most phyla show a clear decrease in community conservation when assessing increasing taxonomic distances from species level to phylum level. We see a steep descent in some phyla (e.g. Crenarchaeota, Firmicutes), while in others the decrease is more gradual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We hypothesized that quantifying the steepness of this trendline, as well as differences to the baseline, would help us to characterize ecological characteristics of each phylum. Since not all OTUs were taxonomically annotated to the species level, we instead used the density gradients obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and binned the OTUs accordingly to approximate the taxonomic levels. In all investigated phyla we observed highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) decreases in community conservatism when comparing the species level to the phylum level. We furthermore quantified the decrease of community conservatism from species level to genus level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We reasoned that for phyla with only early, conserved community preferences which are not currently changing, comparison at the species and genus level should yield similar conservatism signals. However, we found 15 phyla that were still significantly different in their community conservation when comparing species level versus genus level, suggesting ongoing changes in community preferences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>). For instance, Crenarchaeota have large increases at both levels (Species/Genus Ratio 1.47, Species/Phylum ratio: 4.25), showing a strong and ongoing tendency to change communities and to specialize into different niches. But all investigated archaeal phyla show sharp increases (species/phylum ratios &gt; 3), aligning with their tendency to be found in extreme environments and their adaptability to new environmental factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. On the other hand, phyla such as Acidobacteria, predominately found in soils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, show a comparatively shallow increase (Species/Genus Ratio 1.05, Species/Phylum ratio: 1.6). This indicates that members of this phylum have long been restricted to their respective niches and do not usually adapt and evolve quickly into new habitats or roles.</p><p id="P24">This examination provides a quantifiable measure of similarity among related OTUs, a concept central to methods like UniFrac. UniFrac compares communities by considering phylogenetic relationships (i.e., closely related species are assumed to be similar and thus contribute less to diversity) through tree branch length calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, UniFrac defines relatedness for all microbes equally, while our study reveals that different phyla exhibit varying rates of community similarity with decreasing relatedness. We propose that the values presented in our analysis could be utilized to develop an ecologically informed version of UniFrac in the future. This enhanced method would apply phylum-specific weights when calculating tree branch lengths, potentially offering a more nuanced approach to community comparison.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Specialists and generalists have distinguishable community conservatism trends</title><p id="P25">Conceivably, the observed differences between phyla in terms of community conservatism might hint at general differences in their degree of ecological specialization: When members of a phylum show little specialization (i.e., they are generalists) we would expect their communities to be fairly diverse, with community-community distances averaging out at certain level set by the overall diversity of the available data. Conversely, in phyla predominantly composed of specialists, closely related pairs would be hypothesized to share very similar communities, whereas the communities of pairs with a larger phylogenetic distance between them are expected to be very dissimilar due to very distinct niches.</p><p id="P26">To check for this, we first devised a habitat generalism score for each OTU, based on their normalized abundances across different environments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We then selected the top 10% OTUs (“Generalists”), and the bottom 10% OTUs (“Specialists”), and calculated the community conservatism of both groups. Strikingly, the results reveal a clear separation: Generalists show small, steady increase of community conservatism, with a relatively high baseline even in non-related pairs, whereas specialists show a much steeper trendline, with non-related pairs found in very different communities, whereas closely related pairs appear in very similar communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Applying this observation to individual phyla (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that phyla with shallow increases in community conservatism, such as Proteobacteria and Tenericutes, could be more generalist in nature. On the other hand, phyla with specialist-like trendlines, such as Fusobacteria and several Archaeal phyla, might indeed have specialist lifestyles. In support of this, curve steepness is significantly correlated to per-phylum aggregated generalism scores (ρ= 0.46, p <sub>spearman</sub> =0.048, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In the future, these trends could inform a more fine-grained generalism score than we utilized here, able to also take smaller niches into account.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Outliers can be ecologically informative</title><p id="P28">Most of the sufficiently sampled OTUs conform to the trends above - but it may also be interesting to look at outliers: species pairs which are closely related but dissimilar in their communities are hinting at relatively recent evolutionary pressures to change niches. Similarly, distantly related species which are similar in their communities might depend on each other or have a shared niche requirement independent of phylogeny. We provide a list of both types of outliers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 4&amp;5</xref>) and highlight two examples in detail below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P29">On the bottom-left corner of the overall distribution plot are two <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> subclades, which are closely related. Yet, against global conservatism trends, they occupy different communities, hence hinting at a strong ecotype difference between both strains. To better understand their respective niches, we investigated all samples in which the OTUs are detected through metadata keyword summaries. This analysis indicates that P. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> clade 1 is adapted to the human host and enriched in samples of patients with cystic fibrosis, while P. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> clade 2 is a generalist found in many non-human environments. This overlaps with existing research showing that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can be found in both niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the OTU-pair of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> are unrelated, belonging to distant phyla. Nevertheless, they share many community members and are both abundant in the human oral cavity and lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), where they occasionally even form biofilms together <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">This and other examples led us to the hypothesis that community similarity is informative when identifying ecologically interacting OTU-pairs: OTUs with more similar background communities should be more likely to interact. To investigate this, we analyzed all investigated OTU-pairs with FlashWeave, a software package that statistically predicts ecological interactions between OTUs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. And indeed, OTU-pairs predicted to interact this way show much higher community similarity (p<sub>Mann-Whitney U</sub>&lt;0.0001, Cohen’s d: 1.37), also when correcting for phylogenetic relatedness (pMann-Whitney U&lt;0.0001, Cohen’s d: 0.56, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Together, these observations and the underlying data could prove useful to improve the inference of interacting or niche-defining OTU pairs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Outlook and conclusion</title><sec id="S9"><title>Can we reintegrate ecological information into species delimitation?</title><p id="P31">The species concept in bacteria and archaea is still under debate. Some argue for a strict operational approach utilizing phylogenetic marker genes, usually by implementing a chosen species-level threshold (e.g.,97% for 16S rRNA, 96.5% for average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the whole genome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Others argue that this procedure is too simplistic, and that phenotypic and ecological information should be considered as well <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. In any case, most agree that delimitating species using specific thresholds (e.g. within the Genome Taxonomy Database) is pragmatic and operational, but not always ideal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. While in some cases bacterial strains that belong to the same assigned species unit may differ strongly in their environmental role, others might be traditionally assigned to two different species, while performing the same principal role in the ecosystem.</p><p id="P32">Previous research has argued that a distribution-based approach could be used to improve OTU-delimitation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Here we propose to build upon these ideas, and instead of solely relying on marker similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), to reintegrate ecological information into species delimitation in the future. We suggest to achieve this specifically using community conservatism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), resulting in a combined clustering strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Operationally, we envision a two-step OTU clustering approach: First, a purely sequence based OTU-clustering would serve as an initial cursory analysis point, used solely to obtain pairwise community similarity values. These ecological similarities could then be integrated with pairwise genomic similarities into a new weighted metric that guides delineation of ecologically informed OTUs (eOTUs). This combined approach should yield a more natural OTU-clustering, ideally alleviating some of the disagreements between “classical”, phenotypically and ecologically informed taxonomy versus sequence similarity-based OTU clustering. The choice of how highly to weigh sequence similarity versus community similarity will be subject to empirical and theoretical considerations. Similarly, while we here used pragmatic, data-driven measures for sequence identity and community similarity, the choice of metrics is flexible. A hypothetical example with 4 OTUs, using the example metric “0.5 * 16S rRNA sequence identity + 0.5 * average BCS” is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref> and highlights how niche preferences could result in an alternative clustering outcome. We acknowledge that full implementation will require fine-tuning and benchmarking work that is outside of the scope of this article. For now, we wish to highlight that community preferences and their conservation trends are easily assessed from cross-sectional data (in contrast to other relevant phenotypes) and show promise for more ecologically meaningful species delimitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P33">We found that community conservatism is universally present in all investigated phyla and environments, on a global scale. We postulate that this community conservatism signal could be useful to infer how quickly a given microbial lineage usually adapts to new environmental conditions (or communities). Potential applications include microbiome engineering, where such inferences could improve predictions of species addition or removal effects in a given community, based on their niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Of note, there are sampling biases associated with publicly available compositional data. For example, imbalance of sampled environments and differences in sequencing depths or protocols may influence community similarity values. However, such biases are independent of taxonomic relatedness, and thus should not generate the trends presented here.</p><p id="P35">Niche conservatism and phylogenetic signal are well-established concepts in the study of animals and plants, but their assessment in microbes has been limited by the challenges in ascertaining phenotypes and niches in free-living organisms. The concept of community conservatism offers an alternative approach to investigating these patterns in microbial communities, as well as the prospect of reintegrating ecological information into species delimitation.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>MicrobeAtlas data retrieval</title><p id="P36">We searched the NCBI Sequence Read Archive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> or samples and studies containing any of the keywords ‘metagenomic’, ‘microb*’, ‘bacteria’ or ‘archaea’ in their metadata and downloaded the corresponding raw sequence data.

Within the MicrobeAtlas database all microbial sequencing samples (and their communities, respectively) matching strict quality filters are retained for testing, resulting in a global picture of the communities in which each OTU occurs. <bold>b</bold>. We compared OTU-pairs using two main parameters: Their relatedness, estimated by the tree branch length, and the average of all ß-diversity calculations from the communities in which they are found. <bold>c</bold>. After selecting test pairs following a uniform phylogenetic distribution, we visualize all selected pairs in a scatter plot. Each dot is one OTU-OTU pair, with their relatedness shown on the x-axis and the average similarity of their communities on the y-axis.
