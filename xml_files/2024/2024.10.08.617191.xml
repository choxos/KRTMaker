poorly understood. In this study, we introduce ‘oncoembryology,’ an approach that systematically compares embryonic and cancerous tissues to identify shared molecular programs and assess their functional relevance in disease. Applying this strategy to colorectal cancer, we identified SoxC transcription factors (Sox4, Sox11, Sox12) as critical regulators of both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. SoxC transcription factors regulate diverse downstream targets, including Tead2, Mdk, and Klf4, thereby regulating crucial steps of colon development. Abrogating SoxC function in murine models reduced tumor growth and prevented liver metastasis. Concordantly, a SoxC-driven oncoembryonic gene signature correlated with poor survival in colorectal cancer patients, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting SoxC-regulated pathways in cancer treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The phenotypical parallels between cancer cells and embryonic cells, first observed by pathologists such as Virchow, Lobstein, and Recamier in the 19th century, have recently been substantiated at the molecular level, revealing shared transcriptional signatures and genetic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Virchow, 1859</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Krebs, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Gold and Freedman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Nieto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weinberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nieto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aiello and Stanger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hanahan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fazilaty and Basler, 2023</xref>). While the controlled reactivation of embryonic programs is crucial for successful tissue regeneration, improper regulation or failure to silence these programs can lead to pathologies including malignant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fazilaty and Basler, 2023</xref>). Although the reactivation of <italic>oncoembryonic</italic> programs is a recognized phenomenon, the underlying mechanisms and their functional consequences remain poorly understood. Previous research, beyond a few well-known processes such as <italic>epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity</italic>, has primarily correlated embryonic genes expression and cancer progression without conducting simultaneous functional analyses in the embryo to clarify the actual roles these programs play in both contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fazilaty and Basler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mustata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Baulies et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">AR Moorman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Burdziak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fazilaty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Youssef et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Cano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ocaña et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>). This gap in understanding underscores the need for research to unravel the role of oncoembryonic programs in cancer.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we adopted a systematic approach, first identifying common genetic components between embryonic development and cancer of the colon, then conducting functional analysis within the controlled embryonic context to uncover key regulatory mechanisms. The embryonic environment offers a robust platform for isolating functional components that are difficult to dissect in the complex tumor setting. Once validated, we returned to the cancer model to assess their relevance to disease progression and therapeutic potential. We term this reiterative approach ‘oncoembryology.’ Through this, we identified SoxC transcription factors (TFs) as key regulators of both embryonic colon development and colon cancer progression. By studying SoxC TFs in their native embryonic context, we pinpointed essential downstream factors as potential therapeutic targets in colon cancer. This work highlights critical aspects of oncoembryonic programs and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for strategies that could translate into more effective cancer treatments.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SoxC transcription factors are oncoembryonic regulators involved in colorectal cancer</title><p id="P5">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the top cause of cancer death in young adults, and its prevalence is increasing. Currently, patients with metastatic cancer have poor survival rates, making it clear that new therapies are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Biller and Schrag, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Siegel et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Vuik et al., 2019</xref>). Leveraging the oncoembryology concept, we systematically compared the cell and molecular profiles of the colon during development (embryonic hindgut), healthy adult colon, and CRC. To faithfully model the conventional metastatic disease in mice, we employed colonoscopy-guided submucosal injection of organoids in syngeneic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Borrelli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Roper et al., 2018</xref>), using organoids harboring mutations in <italic>Apc</italic>, <italic>Tp53</italic>, <italic>Kras</italic>, and <italic>Smad4</italic> to enhance tumorigenesis and invasiveness, reflecting the common mutational landscape of CRC in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hashimoto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nakayama and Oshima, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Phipps et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1A-F</xref>).</p><p id="P6">As a first step, we sought to identify the genes specifically expressed both in the embryonic hindgut and in CRC - the oncoembryonic genes. To this end we compared single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from the mouse developing hindgut at embryonic day (E) 14.5, healthy adult colon, and advanced colon tumors. We found two epithelial cell clusters enriched in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first cluster corresponded to cells with embryonic features and contained most embryonic cells (cluster 1, oncoembryonic). Validating the classification of these as oncoembryonic cells, the cells expressed previously reported oncoembryonic markers such as <italic>Clu</italic> and <italic>Tacstd2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bala et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fazilaty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fazilaty and Basler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mustata et al., 2013</xref>). Functional gene ontology analysis of the highly expressed genes in oncoembryonic cells pointed to processes like “integrin cell surface interactions”, “DNA damage-induced apoptosis regulation”, “macrophage chemotaxis” and “nucleosomal DNA binding” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2C</xref>). Functional protein association network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>) of the proteins encoded by the highly expressed genes in oncoembryonic cells showed two main branches linked via proteins such as Spp1, Mdk and Fn1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2D</xref>), suggesting their importance as drivers of tumor progression. The second tumor-specific cluster expressed tuft cell markers such as Pou2f3 and Dclk1 (cluster 2; tuft-like tumor, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2A-B</xref>). However, this cluster did not contain any embryonic cell. Genes expressed in tuft-like tumor cells were linked to immune regulation and cellular signaling, in line with the known function of tuft cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To explore the full extent of embryonic-cancer overlap, we performed a comparative dual differential expression analysis, comparing the transcriptomes of all epithelial cells from embryonic hindgut and colon cancer cells to that of healthy adult colon epithelial cells. We identified over 1,500 oncoembryonic genes that were expressed in both embryonic and cancerous states, with minimal or no expression in healthy adult tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), mainly involved in processes such as “DNA replication”, “chromatin remodeling” “RNA processing” and “transcription regulation” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S3A-B</xref>). Notably, genes like <italic>Clu</italic>, <italic>Tacstd2, Marcksl1, Tead2</italic> and <italic>Sox4</italic> were prominently expressed in oncoembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-C</xref>). Regulatory network inference predicted strong activity of regulons driven by TFs including Sox4, Sox11, Mycn, Tead2 and Hmga2 in oncoembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3C</xref>). Interestingly, Sox4 and Sox11, which together with Sox12 form the SoxC subfamily, are specifically expressed in embryonic epithelium and mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To investigate the impact of SoxC gene reactivation in tumors, we assessed the relationship between elevated expression of these factors and CRC patient survival. Strikingly, high expression of SoxC TFs in human CRC tissues correlated with poor patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Compared to healthy adult tissues, where only low Sox4 levels are detectable, strong expression of both Sox4 and Sox11 is reactivated in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3D-F</xref>). Taken together, these data led us to further investigate the role of SoxC TFs as master regulators of an oncoembryonic program in colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Studying SoxC in the embryo reveals its <italic>bona fide</italic> genetic program</title><p id="P9">The embryonic tissue provides a more stable and reproducible system for studying SoxC function than the complex tumor environment. Therefore, to discern the <italic>bona fide</italic> genetic program orchestrated by the SoxC subfamily, we first sought to understand the functional role of these TFs in embryonic development.</p><p id="P10">Using a conditional mouse model, we induced simultaneous ubiquitous knockout of all three SoxC TFs (SoxC-KO) to avoid complications due to redundancy among family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bhattaram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Miao et al., 2019</xref>). Recombination was induced at E10.5, when SoxC expression peaks in the developing intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4A</xref>). SoxC-KO embryos displayed significant developmental abnormalities such as underdeveloped limbs, malformed eyes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bhattaram et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we observed shorter intestinal length in KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4B-C</xref>). In the intestine, SoxC-KO embryos exhibited decreased stromal width and fewer mesenchymal cells between the epithelium and the smooth muscle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4D</xref>). Taken together these results confirm the pivotal role of SoxC in development.</p><p id="P11">To elucidate the full genetic network regulated by SoxC TFs, we conducted a multi-omics approach, integrating scRNAseq, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATACseq), and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIPseq) from SoxC-KO and wild-type (WT) embryonic hindguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We identified significant gene expression changes linked to intestinal development and suggesting premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S4F-H</xref>). In SoxC-KO epithelium, we observed appearance of additional clusters and a marked upregulation of more differentiated and adult cell markers like <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, and <italic>Klf5</italic> compared to WT cells, while embryonic markers such as <italic>Nnat</italic>, <italic>Tead2</italic>, and <italic>Mdk</italic> were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4E-H, S5A and S5C-D</xref>). Notably, the integration of SoxC-KO scRNAseq data with previously published datasets revealed the premature appearance of adult-like cell clusters, demonstrating the role of SoxC TFs in maintaining the embryonic state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The ATACseq results highlighted substantial chromatin accessibility changes in SoxC-KO samples, reinforcing the role of SoxC TFs in modulating both gene expression and chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Regions with gained chromatin accessibility are associated to genes linked to differentiated intestinal cellular processes, while lost accessibilities are linked to developmental processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S6A-B</xref>). By integrating ChIPseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6C</xref>), ATACseq, and scRNAseq data, we mapped specific genomic regions where SoxC modulates gene expression and chromatin dynamics, in direct or indirect manner. The latter is based on presence or absence of SoxC ChIPseq peaks, respectively. Noteworthy SoxC targets include <italic>Tead2</italic> (direct) and <italic>Mdk</italic> (indirect) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Remarkably, the majority of differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the SoxC-KO cells. Similarly, we observed more gained chromatin accessibility than lost in the KO tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). This analysis positions SoxC as a key gatekeeper of the embryonic progenitor state, actively repressing the transition to adult stem-like states and differentiation.</p><p id="P13">Further analyses on tissues confirmed the upregulation of Klf4 and Klf5 and the downregulation of Tead2 and Mdk at both the protein and transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2J-O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S6D-E</xref>). Taken together, these results underscore the critical role of SoxC TFs, and their downstream components, in regulating the embryonic progenitor state during intestinal development and set the stage for investigating their role in the cancer context.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SoxC oncoembryonic signature predicts progression of CRC</title><p id="P14">Using the intersection of omics datasets from embryos, we constructed a molecular landscape of the SoxC program, identifying genes directly or indirectly downstream of SoxC TFs, including both gene activation and repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). For instance, genes such as <italic>Smad1/5/3</italic>, <italic>Tgfbr3</italic>, <italic>Tead2</italic>, <italic>Mdk</italic> regulate proliferation and growth; <italic>Mif</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Gldc</italic> are involved in cell survival; <italic>Il1r1</italic>, <italic>Il19</italic>, <italic>Rarb</italic> play roles in immune modulation; while <italic>Hdac9/11</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Smarcd1/3</italic> are key regulators of chromatin remodeling. Moreover, genes like <italic>Fscn1</italic>, <italic>Cldn4</italic>, <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Cdh1</italic> modulate cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The identified genetic profile highlights the critical role of the SoxC oncoembryonic program in orchestrating multiple fundamental cellular functions during embryonic development, and suggest that it may similarly drive CRC progression by promoting malignant behavior.</p><p id="P15">To evaluate the prognostic significance of the SoxC-regulated oncoembryonic gene expression program, we generated a SoxC-oncoembryonic gene signature including only positively regulated genes to score CRC data from patients. A 71-gene signature was derived through cross-omics gene intersection of multiple datasets, including: the oncoembryonic signature as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), genes downregulated in scRNAseq from SoxC-KO embryonic hindgut compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), and genes associated with chromatin regions that lost accessibility in SoxC-KO embryonic hindgut as determined by ATACseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This signature includes predicted direct targets of SoxC TFs such as <italic>Tead2</italic>, <italic>Fscn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), <italic>Basp1</italic>, <italic>Hdac9</italic>, <italic>Gldc</italic>, and <italic>F2r</italic>. It also includes numerous indirectly regulated genes (no identified peak in ChIPseq), most notably <italic>Mdk</italic>, which based on predicted protein association network analysis could play a central role (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We computed SoxC-oncoembryonic signature scores for patient samples and examined their correlation with disease progression. In a cohort of 1167 colon cancer patients, high average expression of the SoxC-oncoembryonic signature was significantly associated with decreased survival compared to patients with low signature expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Further analysis of scRNAseq data from 29 CRC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) and three healthy colon samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that the majority of tumor samples exhibited elevated expression of the SoxC-oncoembryonic signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings underscore the potential of the SoxC oncoembryonic signature as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>SoxC-deficiency reduces CRC progression and prevents metastasis</title><p id="P17">To directly assess the role of SoxC TFs in tumorigenesis and metastasis, we generated SoxC-KO AKPS organoids.

Control AKPS organoids, in which intergenic regions were targeted using the same method with the same number of perturbations, displayed behavior akin to parental organoids: all injections led to primary tumor engraftment, with some animals developing macroscopic liver metastases. In contrast, SoxC-KO tumors displayed significantly reduced tumor size, and none of the animals exhibited detectable liver metastases, highlighting the critical role of SoxC in both tumor growth and metastatic spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Bulk transcript analysis of SoxC-KO tumors confirmed reduced expression of SoxC TFs and downregulation of key targets such as <italic>Tead2</italic> and <italic>Mdk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7B</xref>).

We therefore wanted to further explore their role in SoxC program. <italic>In situ</italic> protein localization analysis showed that both Mdk and Tead2 share the same expression pattern as SoxC TFs: high expression in the embryonic hindgut, downregulated in healthy adult tissue, and reactivated in CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Consistent with the worse survival associated with high SoxC signature expression, elevated <italic>MDK</italic> levels were also correlated with poor survival in CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

In line with this, inhibition of Mdk in hindgut explants resulted in epithelial flattening and impaired development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). As a secreted ligand, Mdk likely influences various cell populations in the tumor microenvironment, particularly immune cells as evidenced by our functional genetic network and cell-cell communication analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2D and S8C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Similarly, high <italic>TEAD2</italic> expression correlated with poor survival in CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>).

By filtering based on differential expression in SoxC-KO versus WT, as well as embryo versus adult tissues scRNAseq, we identified Hoxa13, Elk4, Hnf4a, Tcf3, Esrra, and Klf3/4/5/6 as potential intermediaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S8H</xref>). Except for Tcf3, all these transcription factors were upregulated in SoxC-KO compared to WT hindgut and adult cells compared to the embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S8I-J</xref>). This suggests a mechanism where these TFs, repressed by SoxC in the hindgut, act to suppress embryonic programs in adult tissues. This hypothesis was supported by the inverse correlation of protein localization between Klf4 and Sox11 in mouse CRC samples: healthy adjacent colon regions showed high Klf4 but low Sox11, while cancerous lesions exhibited high Sox11 and low Klf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8K</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Overall, these results confirm the importance of SoxC-regulated Tead2 and Mdk in hindgut development and suggest a mechanism of reactivation in CRC, highlighting their potential roles in tumor progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Reawakened embryonic programs have long been assumed to contribute to cancer phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Virchow, 1859</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Krebs, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Gold and Freedman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weinberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Nieto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nieto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aiello and Stanger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hanahan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fazilaty and Basler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fazilaty, 2023</xref>), yet how these programs would promote tumor progression has remained elusive. In this study, we applied a new approach—<italic>oncoembryology</italic>—to identify and dissect the reactivated embryonic programs in CRC. To fully harness the potential of oncoembryology, we compared single-cell transcriptomics from hindgut development, CRC tumor progression, and healthy adult colon tissues. SoxC TFs emerged as regulators of both embryonic development and CRC. Returning to the embryonic context allowed us to define the core components of the SoxC program using conditional loss-of-function models and a multi-omics approach. Cross-system comparisons then enabled us to pinpoint <italic>bona fide</italic> downstream targets of SoxC, which were then validated through functional assays.</p><p id="P25">While the Sox family has been implicated in intestinal development, the specific role of the SoxC subfamily has not been previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Fu and Shi, 2017</xref>). SoxC TFs, particularly Sox4 and Sox11 are known regulators of neural development and early organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bergsland et al., 2006</xref>, p. 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bhattaram et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that SoxC TFs are master regulators in maintaining the embryonic progenitor state during intestinal development as well as driving cancer progression. Although SoxC factors were previously linked to wound healing and other cancer types including breast and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Miao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Oliemuller et al., 2020</xref>), their critical role in colorectal cancer has remained underexplored.</p><p id="P26">We found that SoxC factors potentially regulate a range of essential cellular processes, including proliferation and growth, cell survival, adhesion and migration, lineage plasticity and immune modulation. Several predicted direct targets of SoxC in the embryo are well-established regulators of these key functions: Basp1 (involved in neuronal development and plasticity), Hdac9 (a histone deacetylase linked to chromatin remodeling and immune regulation in cancer)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), Gldc (critical for cancer cell survival and stemness)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and F2r (thrombin receptor PAR1, implicated in tumor growth and metastasis)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hua et al., 2021</xref>). A key finding of our study is the observation that SoxC TFs negatively regulate many gene expression programs. For example, we found that Klf4, a transcription factor crucial for maintaining epithelial homeostasis in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hickey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Katz et al., 2002</xref>), was upregulated in SoxC-KO.</p><p id="P27">Loss of function of the SoxC TFs in the embryo, therefore, disrupted the balance between progenitor maintenance and differentiation, leading to premature differentiation of epithelial cells. This regulatory mechanism likely contributes to tumor progression in CRC. Given the established role of Klf4 in repressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and maintaining epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agbo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Borrelli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), its inhibition by SoxC may further drive tumor aggressiveness by promoting a loss of epithelial cohesion.</p><p id="P28">We also looked at the loss of function of the SoxC TFs in tumors: the tumors were smaller and had reduced metastatic potential. Indeed, we failed to find any liver metastases in SoxC-KO models. Supporting analyses demonstrate that the SoxC oncoembryonic gene signature, derived from our integrative analyses is a robust predictor of poor survival in CRC patients. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting SoxC programs. Two downstream targets Tead2 and Mdk are of particular interest.</p><p id="P29">Targeting Mdk and Tead factors has been explored as a therapeutic strategy in other tumor systems. Mdk is known to promote an immune-evasive microenvironment in melanoma, leading to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and poor makes tumors more sensitive to immunotherapy.

Combining TEAD inhibitors with targeted therapies, such as EGFR or MEK inhibitors, has shown synergistic effects in preclinical models. Multi-component inhibition may offer more effective therapeutic benefits by tackling both drug resistance mechanisms and multiple cancer-causing factors at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Pobbati et al., 2023</xref>). A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular program, particularly the oncoembryonic factors and their interactions, is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and enabling the development of more effective combinatorial therapies. Targeting oncoembryonic factors, in particular, offers the potential for disease-specific treatments, sparing healthy cells that do not express these factors.</p><p id="P31">Taken together, our results highlight the critical role of the SoxC oncoembryonic program in regulating multiple cellular functions during embryonic development and suggest that this program similarly drives malignant behavior in colorectal cancer.
