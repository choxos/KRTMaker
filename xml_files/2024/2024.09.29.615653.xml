However, their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Using computational studies, <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA immunoprecipitation and biochemical assays, here, we establish that Musashi1 (Msi1) interacts with viral genomic RNA through direct binding to the SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR. Importantly, binding of Msi1 to the viral 3’UTR results in translational repression mediated by inhibition of Poly (A) binding protein (PABP). Conversely, Msi1 knockout promotes robust viral replication and increased viral protein expression. Using 2D cell cultures, stem cells and 3D organoids, we show that depletion of Msi1 in intestinal cells augments infection. This finding explains why the human intestine serves as a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, wherein differentiated enterocytes, which have negligible levels of Msi1, are highly affected. Contrarily, stem cells which are enriched for Msi1 expression, are known to be less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite expressing the entry receptors. Our findings show how translation repression of SARS-CoV-2 by stem cell RNA binding proteins such as Msi1 could help evasion of infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Musashi</kwd><kwd>Translation</kwd><kwd>Viral load</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">RNA viruses constitute the major fraction of the transmissible emerging pathogens, comprising of about 223 geocoded viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Since RNA viruses cause several infections and lead to high mortality, understanding molecular mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis is paramount to develop effective intervention strategies. In this context, the role of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) which interact with the viral RNA genome and modulate viral life cycle assumes significance to understand viral biology and design efficient inhibitors. Host RBPs are important for viral biology due to the dependence of the viral RNA genome on host cellular machinery for translation. Thus the host RBPs predominantly affect the outcome of viral infection by affecting viral replication, stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). For instance, many flaviviruses are enriched for Musashi binding elements, which are recognized and bound by post transcriptional regulators Musashi1 (Msi1) and Musashi2 (Msi2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We previously showed that Msi1, a stem cell RBP, binds to the Zika RNA and promotes its replication by specifically binding to the 3’UTR of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of Msi1 in Zika non-permissive HEK293 cells promoted viral replication demonstrating how RBPs could influence cellular/tissue landscape of viral infection. Notably, RNA viruses are adept at molecular mimicry, exemplified by the rapid acquisition of RBP binding elements that sponge cellular RBPs often resulting in beneficial outcomes for the viruses. For example, the more infective Brazilian strain of Zika had acquired an additional Msi binding element (GUAG) in its 3’UTR and showed an increased binding to the protein. This enables Zika viral RNAs to compete with the host RNAs for Msi1 binding resulting in additional viral burden in the neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Conserved RNA binding domains (RBDs) encoded within RBPs enable sequence-dependent recognition of an RNA. These RBDs typically recognize relatively short nucleotide sequences or preferentially bind to more simplified nucleotide patterns, such as purine-rich or pyrimidine-rich tracts of RNA. For instance, Msi1 and Msi2 bind RNA consensus sequences: 5'-[GA]U(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)AGU-3’, through two conserved tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs; RRM1 and RRM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In addition to the RRM sequences and cognate sites, the tissue context might also play a role in viral infection. For example, fetal neural progenitors are the prime targets of Zika virus, while SARS-CoV-2 primarily infect differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Once the virus enters pulmonary site by engaging its Spike protein with ACE2 or the transmembrane serine protease protein 2 (TMPRSS2), it can be either cleared from the mucociliary tract or can enter gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract can serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, since the fecal samples of about 48%-54% of COVID-19 patients were positive for viral RNA, and about 15%-17% of patients exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The virus can then trigger a cytokine storm leading to moderate to severe pathologic manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The genomic RNA (gRNA) of SARS-CoV-2 serves as a bifunctional template, facilitating the synthesis of both full-length negative-sense RNAs (ncrRNAs) required for genome replication and various sub-genomic negative-sense RNAs (sgRNAs) that are subsequently translated into corresponding sub-genomic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Akin to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 depends on host proteins for the assembly of its replication and translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Several studies have thoroughly characterized the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-protein interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). These studies show that the negative-sense ncrRNAs are associated with an exceptionally diverse and extensive array of host proteins, which are involved in regulating viral production, apoptotic signaling, and immune responses. This underscores the critical role that negative-sense RNAs play during infection. For instance, the viral 5'UTR interacts with host proteins from the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) family, while the viral 3’UTR interacts with host proteins associated with stress granules and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) families. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Notably, the conserved elements in 3’UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 comprises several domains that are important for controlling viral RNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 gRNA contains conserved Musashi binding elements (MBEs) in its 3’UTR. We further show that Msi1 binds to the MBEs in the viral 3’UTR and this interaction limits the viral load, by repressing the translation of the virus.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Estimation of binding sites opening energies based on single strandedness</title><p id="P7">Following the method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), we employed a biophysical model that characterizes RNA at the secondary structure level, building upon the thermodynamic nearest neighbour energy model from the ViennaRNA Package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).

The two putative MBEs (henceforth referred as M1 and M2) were located in the (i) conserved loop1 of Stem and Loop 1 structure (SL1; M1) and (ii) the more divergent hypervariable region (HVR; M2) (Supplementary Figure 1A). The SL1 structure is essential for viral replicability, while the HVR region may contribute to viral pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Notably, both the MBEs are conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but not in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Bat or Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next estimated the free energy required to force the MBE to be single-stranded (opening energy) using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Strikingly, across all variants including Omicron, we identified that GUAG in the MBEs exhibited low opening energies with Z scores ranging from –1.10 to 1.53, reflecting their accessibility in the genome throughout the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Figure 1B). Contrarily, both the AUAG and the recently shown AGAA motifs, which have the propensity to bind to Msi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), showed a higher median distribution of binding energies, alluding to a possible unfavourable context for Msi1 binding (Supplementary Figure 1C). To examine if Msi1 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR, we transfected GFP-tagged Msi1 into HEK293 cells and performed <italic>in-vitro</italic> RNA pull-down with biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR, using Zika 3’UTR as a positive control. Indeed, we observed binding of Msi1 to both SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR and Zika 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). To confirm that the endogenous Msi1 could bind to the 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2, we performed RNA pull down with the colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) which expresses endogenous Msi proteins. We find that both Msi1 and Msi2 can bind to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings suggest that the 3’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 contains well-conserved Musashi binding sites and is amenable to binding to Msi proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Msi1 binds to 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P29">Since, Msi1 is (i) known to regulate replication of RNA viruses (Zika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>)) and (ii) involved in intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), the organ which serves as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, we focussed on the role of Msi1 on the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To check if Msi1 binds directly to the 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2, we performed RNA pulldowns with His-tagged Msi1 and the <italic>in vitro</italic> biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR. We identified that Msi1 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR at a concentration as low as 5 pmol of RNA and saturated at 10 pmol of RNA with 60 nM of Msi1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). We did not detect any binding of Msi1 with the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2 under the same conditions (Supplementary Figure 2C). To narrow down the preference of Msi1 binding in the 3’UTR, we next performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for the two sites (M1 and M2) and compared them to Zika 3’UTR. The variation in the RMSD and RMSF of Msi1 in complex with M2 in the HVR in comparison to Zika 3’UTR was lesser than that of Msi1 in complex with M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2D-2E).</p><p id="P30">To consolidate these findings, we performed site-directed mutagenesis perturbing M1 and M2 individually as well as in combination (Supplementary Figure 2D). While disruption of the M2 site in HVR drastically reduced the binding of Msi1 to the 3’UTR, disruption of the M1 site in SL1 showed a modest reduction in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The dual mutant (M1 and M2) showed almost complete abrogation of binding indicating that these sites could be the primary contributors to Msi1 binding to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR. We further validated these findings using endogenous Msi1 protein from Caco-2 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). To examine if the Msi1 binding to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> during viral infection, we performed RNA immunoprecipitations in Caco-2 cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. Using viral Nucleocapsid and Envelope transcripts and the viral 3’UTR as probes, we showed that upon infection, Msi1 immunoprecipitated SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E-2G</xref>). Crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) established the direct interaction of Msi1 with the 3’UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish the binding of Msi1 to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR, at the two Musashi binding elements present in the SL1 and HVR.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Depletion of Msi1 levels increases viral load</title><p id="P31">To establish the physiological relevance of Msi1 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR, we generated Msi1 knockouts (KO) in Caco-2 cells using lentivirus-based CRISPR-Cas9. Importantly, the protein levels of Msi1 remain unchanged upon different time points of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). Subsequently, we generated the Msi1 KOs and verified the protein levels of both Musashi proteins, Msi1 and Msi2 in the KO pools as well as in individual knock-outs. The guides specifically targeted Msi1 and we could not detect any change in Msi2 protein levels upon loss of Msi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then subjected the parental cells expressing Cas9 and Msi1 knockout pool and the individual clones to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Multiplicity of infection, MOI=1). Viral transcript analysis post-infection revealed a significant increase in the transcript levels of Envelope and RdRp across the Msi1 KO pool and the individual clones, suggesting an increase in viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This increase in viral replication was validated by increased dsRNA positivity in the Msi1 KO cells compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We then performed western blot analysis and compared the nucleocapsid levels between control and knockout cells at 24h and 48h post-infection. We observed a ~2-3-fold increase in nucleocapsid protein levels in the knock-outs starting from 24h time point, peaking at 48h time point to ~4 folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Ileum and colon are known to show elevated expression of the entry receptors for viruses, specifically ACE2, alluding to enhanced infection of the intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). To examine the effect of Msi1 on ACE2 levels, we performed immunoblot assay and found that there was no change in ACE2 expression in Msi1 KOs upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that Msi1 might not regulate the entry of viruses into cells by modulating ACE2 levels. To confirm the infectivity of the virus, we performed a plaque formation assay to check the differences in infectious viral titres between control and knock-out cells. We observed a significant increase in plaque formation in the Msi1 knockouts compared to the control, indicating an increase in infective viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). While these findings of Msi1 repressing viral load in Caco-2 cells could be attributed to high levels of expression of Msi1 in Caco-2 cells, we wanted to examine the effect of Msi1 in a more physiological setting.</p><p id="P32">Previous studies have demonstrated that intestinal organoids are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with enterocytes being the primary targets, resulting in the production of infectious viral particles and damage of intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The Musashi (Msi) family of proteins plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal regeneration and homeostasis after insults by driving the exit of intestinal stem cells from quiescence to enter cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). In this context, here, we first assessed the impact of Msi1 depletion on SARS-CoV-2 infection using definitive endoderm (DE) cells, the precursors of intestinal cell lineages. To achieve this, we utilized lentiviral vectors encoding either Msi1-specific shRNA or scrambled shRNA to knock down Msi1 expression in DE cells, followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Immunofluorescence staining for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker of viral replication, and Sox17, a DE marker, were performed. While only 1% of DE cells were positive for dsRNA at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, approximately 5% of Msi1-depleted DE cells exhibited dsRNA positivity. Importantly, Sox17 expression was largely unaffected by Msi1 depletion, indicating that the effect of Msi1 on stem cell population remains unchanged while only the infection of cells was affected. These findings led us to further investigate the role of Msi1 in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection within intestinal organoids. For this, we generated mid-hindgut organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and depleted Msi1 using shRNA (iPSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3B). Notably, we observed a significant increase in nucleocapsid and dsRNA positivity in Msi1-depleted organoids compared to control organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3C-3D). Collectively, these results suggest that Msi1 acts as a negative regulator of SARS-CoV-2 infection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, highlighting its potential role in modulating viral susceptibility in the intestinal epithelium.</p><p id="P33">Given that Msi1 knockout (KO) cells exhibited a significant increase in viral titres, we reintroduced the Msi1 transgene into the knockout background to assess whether the inhibitory effect of Msi1 could be restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Upon re-expression of Msi1 in the KO background, we observed a 50% reduction in the expression levels of the viral Envelope and RdRp transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result was corroborated by a plaque assay, which showed a reduction in cytopathic effects (CPEs) upon Msi1 reintroduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, immunoblot analysis of cells following transgene expression and subsequent infection demonstrated decreased levels of viral nucleocapsid protein in the presence of Msi1, confirming the inhibitory role of Msi1 in suppressing viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Msi1 mediates SARs-CoV-2 inhibitory effects through repression of viral translation</title><p id="P34">Given that Msi1 possesses two conserved RRMs capable of interacting with RNA, we next examined whether these minimal RNA recognition motifs are sufficient to recapitulate the effects of the full-length protein on SARS-CoV-2. We performed a rescue experiment in Caco-2 cells expressing RRMs (Msi1 20-190) along with GFP and GFP-Msi1 and examined the changes in the levels of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Surprisingly, the RRMs alone did not show any significant change in the transcript levels of the viral genes, indicating that the activity of the intact Msi1 protein is required for the observed inhibitory effects on the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since Msi1 is a known translational repressor, we investigated if its binding to viral 3’ UTR could impact the viral translation. For this, we performed a luciferase reporter assay by transfecting the 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 along with Msi1. Overexpression of Msi1 led to a 20%-30% reduction in the expression of the firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase reporter from the wild-type 3’UTR. However, we did not observe any significant difference in reporter expression in the MBE double mutant 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, the Msi1 gene construct with only the two RNA recognition motifs was not sufficient for repressing the reporter driven translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These findings suggest that full length Msi1 is essential to repress translation of viral transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Msi1 represses PABP1-mediated translation of SARS-CoV-2 minigene</title><p id="P35">Given that the interactions between the 5' UTR and 3’ UTRs, along with their associated molecular interactions, are known to influence viral replication and translation, we performed a SARS-CoV-2 minigene reporter assay. In this construct, a Gaussia luciferase reporter is flanked by 5' and 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and a segment of Nsp1. This construct closely mimics the viral replicon, which can be used as a surrogate for viral translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Once we confirmed that the expression levels of the wild type and the double mutant minigene transcripts were not significantly different, we performed translation analysis using Gaussia reporter as surrogate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). While we observed a 30-40% Msi1-driven decrease in Gaussia luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), the double mutant 3’UTR, was not responsive to the Msi1 regulated Gaussia luciferase expression. Taken together, these observations suggest that Msi1 binding to the M1 and M2 sites of SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR represses translation. This suggests that Msi1 may reduce viral load through 3’ UTR-driven translational repression in vivo. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are polyadenylated, which can influence their stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). For several coronaviruses, the interaction between the poly (A) tail and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has been shown to regulate viral translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). It is well established that Msi1 competes with PABP1, leading to translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). To investigate whether Msi1 mediates SARS-CoV-2 translational repression through this mechanism, we co-transfected PABP1 with the minigene and observed a 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, when Msi1 was co-transfected, this upregulation was reversed, indicating that Msi1 can inhibit PABP1-mediated translation of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">Previous studies have shown that Msi1 promotes replication of Zika virus, albeit the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Here, we show the translational repressor function of Msi1 in a viral context. Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 engages both canonical and non-canonical pathways of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The 3’UTR of coronaviruses contains a number of cis-acting elements which are essential for RNA synthesis and translation. Moreover, the hypervariable region (HVR) which contains stem loop motif II (S2M) is a binding hub for host translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In this context, since Msi1 binds in the close vicinity to HVR, it is likely that Msi1 can compete for binding with other translational regulators and inhibit translation of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, here we show that the Msi1 can repress SARs-CoV-2 translation by inhibiting PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The minigene assay encompassing 5'UTR and 3’UTR with Gaussia reporter mimics the viral genomic RNA and shows that Msi1 binds to 3’UTR and represses translation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. While the mere use of 3’UTR in the reporter assay shows a 25-30% downregulation, usage of complete viral minigene shows a 40-60% reduction, possibly because the minigene constructs better mimics the <italic>in vivo</italic> circularization of the genome.</p><p id="P37">Recent studies highlight that targeting the 3’UTR, which is conserved across most variants of SARS-CoV-2, could be used as an intervention strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Extensive RNA-protein interaction characterization of SARs-CoV-2 across various human cell lines has been done recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). While Msi1 has been identified as a potential interactor in Huh7 cells, Msi1 has not been detected as an interactor in other cell lines, such as HEK293 and Calu3. The potential reasons for this discrepancy could be (i) cells do not express endogenous Msi1, as is the case in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), (ii) downregulation of Msi1 protein upon SARs-CoV-2 infection, as shown here in both Calu3 and Huh7 cell lines and (iii) expression of truncated forms of Msi1, for instance, the Msi1 expressed in Calu3 lacks the C-terminus, which might influence the viral RNA- host protein interaction (Supplementary Figure 5A). Furthermore, unlike Zika, wherein only Msi1 is bound to the 3’UTR, both Msi1 and Msi2 are shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR. This is noteworthy since, Msi1 and Msi2 are thought to be functionally redundant, although their expression pattern varies. For instance, while Msi1 is thought to be a stem cell marker, Msi2 is found to be more ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Indeed a single-cell gene expression analysis of intestinal cells revealed that Msi1 expression is restricted to Transient Amplifying (TA) cells and stem cells, while Msi2 has a widespread expression across cell types, with the highest being in the cycling TA population. Moreover, enterocytes that are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 show negligible expression of Msi1 (Supplementary Figure 5B). Likewise staining of cerebral organoids showed neural progenitors express high levels of Msi1 compared to Msi2 (Supplementary Figure 5C). This is interesting since neural progenitors have been shown to be less amenable to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p><p id="P38">To recapitulate physiology better, we performed an analysis of single-cell RNAseq data of intestinal organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that at a 12h time point, Msi1 transcript significantly goes down (Supplementary Figure 5D). Integrating our findings pertaining to Msi1 mediated repression of SARs-CoV-2 translation and that of single-cell RNA sequencing data of intestinal organoids upon viral infection, it is tempting to speculate that the virus most likely downregulates Msi1 during the onset of its gRNA translation. However, when the innate immune response sets in at 24h time point, enhanced expression of Msi1 is observed. This is interesting in the context of the expression pattern of Msi1, which is primarily expressed in stem cells. It is now well known that different stem cells have cell type-specific groups of interferon-stimulated genes, which makes the stem cells resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). For instance, in addition to directly binding and repressing translation, Msi1 could also activate specific modules like Protein Kinase R, which are activated by dsRNA and can restrict viral translation by inducing a shutdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Thus, an interplay between innate immune response and RBPs such as Msi1 could play vital roles in viral containment, which needs to be further explored.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jingxin Wang Lab for the Gaussia minigene construct and Amit Kumar for assistance with the logistics in the BSL3 lab.
