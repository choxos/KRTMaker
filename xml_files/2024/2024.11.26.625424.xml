Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wild type and aneuploid mouse embryos, we show that sex chromosomes significantly shape the preimplantation embryo transcriptional landscape. A hierarchy of effects are identified, distinctly mediated by the Y chromosome, the dosage of X chromosomes, X-chromosome imprinting, and by <italic>Xist</italic>, the non-coding RNA that initiates X-inactivation. The sex chromosomes have strong <italic>trans</italic> effects on autosomal gene expression throughout preimplantation development. The Y chromosome has an unexpectedly pronounced impact on the trophectoderm, the precursor of the placenta, and this property is shared with genes expressed from the inactive X chromosome. The paternal and maternal X chromosomes differentially promote preimplantation growth, and we identify multiple novel candidate X-linked imprinted genes mediating this effect. Our findings show that sex chromosomes impact the embryo from the beginning of life, long before the appearance of overt sex differences.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Sex chromosomes play a crucial role in a wide range of biological processes, affecting gene activity and protein production at the cellular level to an organism’s anatomy, physiology, and disease risk. This influence is evident in the many physical differences between males and females across species and in the phenotypes seen in individuals with atypical numbers of sex chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Most research has focused on the impact of sex chromosomes later in development or in adulthood. However, morphological studies suggest that sex chromosomes also affect the early embryo. For example, mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, cow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> XY embryos are developmentally advanced relative to XX embryos. Additionally, at the post-implantation stage, embryos with a single X chromosome of maternal origin (X<sup>m</sup>O) are developmentally advanced relative to those with a single X of paternal origin (X<sup>p</sup>O). Thus, the X chromosome carries as-yet undiscovered imprinted genes that regulate developmental pace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These sex chromosome effects are evident before gonad formation, and are thus entirely independent of sex hormones.</p><p id="P4">We currently lack insight into these sex chromosome effects, because transcriptional analysis of embryos with distinct sex chromosome complements has not been performed. The preimplantation period is of particular interest, since X-dosage compensation is not yet complete, thereby allowing sex chromosomes to exert a stronger influence on sex differences. X-dosage compensation is critical for embryo development, and in mice is achieved by two collaborative mechanisms. The first, X-chromosome upregulation, occurs in both males and females, and ensures that gene expression from the single active X chromosome is balanced with that from the autosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The second, X-chromosome inactivation, occurs only in females, and ensures that gene expression from the two X chromosomes is balanced with the single X in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. X-inactivation is initiated by the long non-coding RNA <italic>Xist</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In early mouse embryos, X-inactivation is imprinted, with the paternal X chromosome chosen for silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Imprinted X-inactivation initiates from the four-cell stage and is retained in the trophectoderm, the precursor of the placenta. However, it is reversed in the epiblast, the cell population that will give rise to the embryo proper, where random X-inactivation then occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. How X-dosage compensation plays out in embryos with atypical sex chromosome complements is not well understood.</p><p id="P5">Here, we use mouse models carrying distinct sex chromosome combinations to reveal the impact of the Y chromosome, X-dosage, X-imprinting and <italic>Xist</italic> on mouse preimplantation development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An scRNA-seq dataset of sex chromosome variant embryos</title><p id="P6">To determine how sex chromosomes impact embryonic gene expression, we performed scRNA-seq on embryonic day (E) 2.0, 2.5 and 3.5 embryos derived from well-established parental sex chromosome variant lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In our colony these timepoints correspond to 4-cell, morula and blastocyst stage embryos, respectively. From a larger cohort of embryos, we extracted genotypes carrying two X chromosomes, one X and one Y chromosome, one X chromosome of maternal origin, and one X chromosome of paternal origin (hereafter denoted as X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup>, X<sup>m</sup>Y, X<sup>m</sup>O and X<sup>p</sup>O; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). Comparing these genotypes allowed us to identify X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> - X<sup>m</sup>Y differences, Y-dosage and X-dosage effects, and X-imprinting effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We ensured that the proportions of each genotype were consistent at each gestational age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). 1595 single cells (generated from a total of 191 embryos), with an average of 40,358 expressed genes, were retained after quality control. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) revealed that samples separated according to gestational age, and that the expected trophectoderm and inner cell mass populations were apparent at E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>; see later for exceptional genotypes).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>XX-XY differences</title><p id="P7">We examined gene expression differences between X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> embryos. We focused initially on X-dosage compensation, which was assayed using X-to-autosome (X:A) ratio calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In males, X-upregulation balances X to autosomal output by increasing the X:A ratio from 0.5 to 1.0. X-upregulation initiated early in X<sup>m</sup>Y males, with the X:A ratio already &gt;0.5 at E2.0 and approaching 1.0 by E3.5. A similar profile was observed in X<sup>m</sup>O embryos, demonstrating that X-upregulation occurs independent of the presence of a second sex chromosome. In X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> female embryos, X-upregulation also initiated early, with the X:A ratio &gt;1.0 at E2.0 and E2.5. As a result, the X:A ratio was significantly higher in X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> than X<sup>m</sup>Y embryos at these timepoints. Subsequently, the X:A ratio in X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> embryos decreased towards 1.0. This decline was due to X-inactivation, because it did not occur in X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> females carrying a paternal <italic>Xist</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Our findings are consistent with reports that X-upregulation precedes X-inactivation during mouse preimplantation embryo development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">We examined differential gene expression between X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> embryos. The number of differentially expressed (DE) genes was highest at E2.0 and thereafter decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further examination of DE genes revealed notable findings. X-genes were over-represented on a <italic>per chromosome</italic> basis at all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), presumably because X-dosage compensation was not yet complete. However, most DE genes were autosomal. Gene ontology analysis revealed distinct pathways enriched at successive stages of development (E2.0: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; E2.5 onwards <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Among the E2.0 enriched pathways, we observed several categories related to metabolism and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We expected that Y-genes would account for the reproduction categories, because the Y chromosome is specialised for the male germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Indeed, the most strongly male-biased genes included six of the 14 genes on the mouse Y chromosome short arm; <italic>Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, Uty, Kdm5d, Uba1y</italic> and <italic>Usp9y</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). These Y-genes encode proteins with dosage-sensitive housekeeping functions, and two (<italic>Uba1y</italic> and <italic>Usp9y</italic>) exhibit testis-biased expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Strongly female-biased genes included <italic>Xist</italic> and its upstream regulator <italic>Ftx</italic>, which are imprinted and expressed only from X<sup>p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, they also included members of X-linked multicopy families that were previously described as testis-biased, including the <italic>Fthl17</italic> iron-binding, <italic>Rhox</italic> homeobox and <italic>Pramel3</italic> transcription regulator genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>; see later). We conclude that sex chromosomes act <italic>in trans</italic> to create sexually dimorphic autosomal expression profiles in the early embryo, and that some sex-linked genes with canonical reproductive functions are also expressed at this time.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The impact of Y- and X-dosage</title><p id="P9">To examine how the expression of Y-genes in the early embryo influences the preimplantation transcriptome, we compared gene expression between X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>O embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A relatively modest effect on gene expression was observed at E2.0 and E2.5. However, there was a disproportionately high number of DE genes at E3.5 within the trophectoderm (420 genes; compared with 57 in the inner cell mass). This finding revealed an unexpected role for the Y chromosome in regulating the trophectoderm transcriptome. When we compared X<sup>m</sup>O to X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> embryos, we observed a similar trophectoderm-biased effect (444 DE genes; compared with 45 in the inner cell mass; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, the trophectoderm is uniquely sensitive to loss of either the Y chromosome or the paternal inactive X chromosome.</p><p id="P10">We hypothesised that the trophectoderm haploinsufficiency effect was mediated by genes shared between the Y and paternal inactive X. In support of this conclusion, there was a large overlap in DE genes between the trophectoderm cells of X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>X<sup>p</sup> compared to X<sup>m</sup>O embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This effect is likely mediated by X-Y homologous gene pairs in which the X-copy escapes X-inactivation, resulting in a double dose of sex-products in both sexes (X + Y in males, X + X in females). Indeed, four of the Y-genes we found expressed in embryos: <italic>Uty, Kdm5d, Ddx3y</italic> and <italic>Eif2s3y</italic>, have X-linked homologues that escape X-inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these shared targets span many biological pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>), presumably because X<sup>m</sup>O mice are simultaneously haploinsufficient for multiple, dosage-sensitive X-Y homologues. The Y chromosome and paternal inactive X chromosome therefore impart overlapping effects on trophectoderm transcription.</p><p id="P11">Our sex chromosome variant crosses also generated OY embryos, which carry no X chromosome. By comparing these to X<sup>m</sup>Y embryos, we were able to reveal for the first time the transcriptional effect of having no X chromosome. Previous work has shown that OY embryos arrest at the 8-cell stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, but whether this results directly from a lack of X-linked transcripts or indirectly from a <italic>trans</italic> effect of X-genes on autosomes is unclear. On the UMAP, OY embryos formed a separate cluster from other genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). At E2.0, most genes differentially expressed between OY and X<sup>m</sup>Y embryos were X-linked; however, by E2.5, we observed strong changes in autosomal gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This finding further emphasised the <italic>trans</italic>-effect of X-genes on autosomes. Functional enrichment analysis at E2.5 revealed several pathways affected by absence of the X, with the most significant being those related to cellular stress responses, the cell cycle, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). OY embryos exhibited upregulation of aneuploidy-associated proteotoxic response genes, such as <italic>Hsf1</italic> and <italic>Hspb1</italic>, and downregulation of replication licensing genes <italic>Cdc6</italic> and <italic>Mcm3,</italic> suggestive of replicative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. They also exhibited upregulation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, a key regulator of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and the apoptotic factor <italic>Trp53</italic>, along with its downstream pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family targets <italic>Bbc3</italic> (<italic>Puma</italic>) and <italic>Pmaip1</italic> (<italic>Noxa</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Additionally, genes related to autophagy and mitophagy, such as <italic>Trp53inp1</italic> and <italic>Ddit4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Our findings suggest that embryos lacking an X exhibit signs of aneuploidy-induced stress, associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The impact of X-imprinting</title><p id="P12">To establish X-imprinting effects on preimplantation development, we then analysed the X<sup>p</sup>O model. Previous work showed that X<sup>p</sup>O embryos are developmentally delayed relative to X<sup>m</sup>O, X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>Xp embryos at E7.5 and E10.5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We discovered that developmental delay was also evident in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos before implantation. Using immunostaining for markers of the inner cell mass (NANOG) and trophectoderm (CDX2), we found that X<sup>p</sup>O embryos had fewer cells than X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>Xp embryos at E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, while E3.5, X<sup>m</sup>Y, X<sup>m</sup>Xp and X<sup>m</sup>O cells segregated into trophectoderm and inner cell mass, E3.5 X<sup>p</sup>O embryos exhibited transcriptional delay, with a higher proportion of cells mapping to the uncommitted cluster and a lower proportion of cells mapping to the inner cell mass cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The trophectoderm of the X<sup>p</sup>O embryo also exhibited developmental delay, expressing wild type levels of the early trophectoderm marker <italic>Cdx2</italic> but lower levels of late trophectoderm markers <italic>Elf5</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Two mechanisms could contribute to this delay. One possibility is that X-expression in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos is globally reduced by imprinted X-inactivation, leading to a paucity of X-gene products. Indeed, X<sup>p</sup>O embryos exhibit imprinted <italic>Xist</italic> expression from the 8-cell to the blastocyst stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, but whether this triggers X-inactivation of the single X is unknown. A second possibility is an <italic>Xist</italic>-independent effect, mediated by a growth repressor expressed only from the paternal X, and/or growth promoter expressed only from the maternal X.</p><p id="P14">To investigate the X-inactivation model, we assayed X-expression in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos. We found that X-inactivation was indeed initiated. This was evident from X:A ratios, which decreased during X<sup>p</sup>O preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Using RNA-FISH, we confirmed that X<sup>p</sup>O embryos express <italic>Xist</italic>. Furthermore, they initiated silencing of the X-linked gene <italic>Atp7a</italic>, which has been shown to be inactivated by <italic>Xist</italic> early in female development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. The single X chromosome in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos also accumulated ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine-119, an <italic>Xist</italic>-dependent repressive epigenetic mark indicative of X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">To resolve whether the growth delay was <italic>Xist</italic> dependent, we generated X<sup>p</sup>O embryos carrying a paternal <italic>Xist</italic> deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In the resulting X<sup>p</sup>O <italic>Xist</italic><sup>Δ</sup> embryos, the X:A ratio increased during embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This behaviour mirrored that observed in X<sup>m</sup>O embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The paternal X is therefore competent for upregulation if X-inactivation is abolished. Notably, <italic>Xist</italic> deletion rescued the low blastomere count phenotype in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos at E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, it did not rescue the transcriptional delay. E3.5 X<sup>p</sup>O <italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic> embryos exhibited a similar phenotype to X<sup>p</sup>O embryos, with a higher proportion of uncommitted cells, a lower proportion of inner cell mass cells, and lower expression of late trophectoderm markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-d</xref>). Thus, an <italic>Xist</italic>-independent X-imprinting effect influences development of the preimplantation embryo.</p><p id="P16">We next established whether this <italic>Xist</italic>-independent effect was also responsible for the growth delay originally observed in X<sup>p</sup>O embryos later in gestation, at E10.5. Indeed, X<sup>p</sup>O <italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic> embryos were growth delayed at E10.5, being of comparable size to X<sup>p</sup>O embryos and significantly smaller than their wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>).

We used a pooled genotype approach to identify genes displaying biased expression from the paternal or maternal X chromosome.

These were noteworthy in several regards. First, they showed a bias (15 out of 19 genes) towards being expressed from Xp. Second, Xp-expressed genes included several multicopy gene families: beyond the ampliconic <italic>Fthl17</italic> and <italic>Rhox</italic> clusters, we observed Xp-biased expression of <italic>Pramel3</italic> and <italic>Tceal</italic> cluster genes, as well as the duplicated <italic>Dmrtc1c2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). The fact that these genes were expressed from Xp explained why they were initially identified as female-biased in our X<sup>m</sup>Y and X<sup>m</sup>Xp comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).

We find that most sex differences in gene expression are autosomal. Thus, sex chromosomes influence the preimplantation embryo predominantly via <italic>trans</italic> autosomal effects. This influence is even more pronounced in embryos lacking a second sex chromosome, as exemplified in X<sup>m</sup>O, OY and X<sup>p</sup>O embryos. We also find that the trophectoderm transcriptome is heavily influenced by both the Y chromosome and the paternal inactive X chromosome. Our data indicate that this effect is mediated by X-Y homologues in which the X-encoded copy escapes X-inactivation. Strong candidates for this effect include <italic>Utx/y, Kdm5c/d, Ddx3x/y</italic> and <italic>Eif2s3x/y</italic>, which satisfy this criterion and are also deeply conserved regulators of chromatin modification, RNA stability and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Our results also reveal the extent of X-imprinting in the early embryo. By removing <italic>Xist</italic>, we identify candidate maternal X-encoded growth promoters and paternal X-encoded growth repressors for future study. We find that, like autosomal imprinted genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, candidate X-imprinted genes are predominantly paternally expressed. The concept of a paternal X-encoded repressor is of interest when considering why imprinted X-inactivation evolved to specifically silence the paternal rather than maternal X chromosome. An imprinted, maternal X-expressed product would be present in both sexes. However, a paternal X-expressed product would be present only in females. If this paternal X-product were a growth repressor, it would selectively disadvantage growth in females. By choosing the paternal X chromosome for silencing, imprinted X-inactivation may prevent this outcome, thereby balancing the growth potential of male and female embryos.</p><p id="P21">Finally, we show that paternal X-expressed imprinted genes include several multicopy gene clusters that are also expressed in developing male germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The significance of this finding warrants future investigation. The X chromosome encodes a disproportionately large number of male germline genes, particularly for those expressed in mitotically-differentiating spermatogonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, and developing spermatids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. During male meiosis, the X and Y chromosomes are silenced by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.

Multicopy and some single-copy X-genes are unusual, exhibiting activation during spermatid differentiation and thus evading the repressive after-effects of MSCI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The permissive epigenetic state that enables this expression in spermatids may have an enduring effect, leading to ongoing expression after fertilisation when the paternal X is handed down to early female embryos.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Animals</title><p id="P22">Mice were maintained in the Francis Crick Institute Biological Research Facility in accordance with United Kingdom Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986 (Project Licence P8ECF28D9).
