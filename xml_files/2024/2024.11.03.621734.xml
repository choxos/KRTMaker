Using the transcriptional phenotypes, we created a minimum distortion embedding map of the pluripotent state, demonstrating rich recapitulation of protein complexes, such as strong co-clustering of MRPL, BAF, SAGA, and Ragulator family members. Additionally, we uncovered transcriptional regulators that are uncoupled from cell fitness, discovering potential novel pluripotency (JOSD1, RNF7) and metabolic factors (ZBTB41).

Characterization of this relationship for each cell type is essential for understanding development, disease mechanisms, and informing the engineering of cell state. A cell type of particular interest is human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which possess the remarkable ability to differentiate into any cell type, making them invaluable for disease modeling and regenerative medicine applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Substantial progress has been made in identifying key transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate pluripotency and enable direct reprogramming. For instance, the roles of POU5F1 (also known as Oct4), SOX2, and NANOG in maintaining stem cell pluripotency are well-documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, while FOXA1/2/3, MYOD1, and NEUROD1 have been identified as factors initiating reprogramming into ecto-, meso-, and endoderm lineages respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, our understanding of pluripotency is far from complete, and the dynamic processes and gene interactions governing cell state transitions in hiPSCs are still not fully understood. We conservatively estimate that the functional role of less than 2000 genes have been deeply characterized within the stem cell context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and hypothesize that there exist yet unknown pathways critical to stem cell regulation.</p><p id="P3">Perturb-Seq, a high-throughput method combining CRISPR-based genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing, offers a powerful approach to elucidate these unknown pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. By systematically knocking down or activating genes (perturbations) and quantifying the resultant changes in gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> at single-cell resolution, researchers can map the functional relationships between genes and cell states at an unprecedented scale. The single cell nature allows screening of individual perturbations to be done in a pooled manner, allowing thousands of perturbations to be assayed in parallel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, Perturb-Seq is not without its challenges; for one, there is no standard agreed upon analysis methodology due to (among other reasons) (i) zero inflated gene expression distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, (ii) incomplete perturbation penetrance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and (iii) challenges with algorithmic scaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Further, although a genome-wide perturbation cell atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> would be an invaluable resource for understanding the fundamental regulation of a cell type of interest, there has to date only been one published study at the pan-genome scale (covering 9,867 expressed genes in K562 lymphoblast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>), likely due to high financial cost and technical difficulty of genome-scale Perturb-Seq. Specifically, within hiPSCs the largest Perturb-Seq experiment to date covers only 27 genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, though an analogous study in hESCs overexpressing a library of 1,836 transcription factors yielded strong insights into transcription factors biasing differentiation trajectories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">We therefore foresee an expressed genome-scale perturbation cell atlas in hiPSCs as an invaluable resource for understanding pluripotency and informing rational cell state engineering. To this end, we generated a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) Perturb-Seq dataset spanning the entire expressed genome in KOLF2.1J hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, accompanied by a parallel fitness readout. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we validated key perturbations at multiple levels, including protein complex mapping through size-exclusion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) and functional metabolic tracing using isotopologue analysis. These validation experiments confirmed that transcriptomic clusters derived from Perturb-Seq reflect interacting protein complexes and metabolic phenotypes in hiPSCs. Additionally, we developed a proof-of-concept machine learning architecture that predicts perturbations capable of driving cells towards desired transcriptional states, paving the way for rational engineering of cell states. Together, this dataset and its comprehensive validation provide a powerful resource for dissecting pluripotency regulation and exploring targeted cell state modifications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Pilot Screens of a Panel of Chromatin Modifiers and Metabolic Enzymes CRISPRi Perturb-Seq in KOLF2.1J iPSCs</title><p id="P5">Our experimental and computational methodologies for the expressed-genome scale screen were first optimized using two pilot screens on a curated gene list (based on their known involvement in disease pathways) of 108 chromatin modifiers and 97 metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). To perform genetic perturbations, we elected a CRISPRi strategy for the host of reasons outlined by Replogle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, primarily that through scRNA-seq the extent of perturbation can be quantified for CRISPRi. We engineered a KOLF2.1J line that stably expresses KRAB<sup>ZIM3</sup>-dCas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (henceforth simply referred to as KOLF2.1Js; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). For each gene, six sgRNAs were designed via a combination of selecting sgRNA designated by Replogle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and from CRISPick<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> tool, which ranks gRNAs based on on-target efficiency and off-target effects, along with a total of 109 non-targeting control (NTC) sgRNAs. KOLF2.1J cells maintained in pluripotent maintenance media (mTeSR) were harvested at day 4 post-transduction and processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed robust expression of pluripotency factors NANOG and POU5F1 via immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). For the chromatin modifiers screen, we sequenced to a depth of median &gt;20,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)/cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). We loaded ~100K cells/channel into four channels of a 10X HT 3’ chip, which yielded a final coverage of &gt;100 single cells with a single sgRNA assigned for &gt;90% of perturbations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). The KRAB<sup>ZIM3</sup>-dCas9 CRISPRi repression system induced fairly reliable repression, with ~70% of perturbation targets experiencing &gt;30% repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). We observed that generally, at least one of the top 3 CRISPick candidate sgRNA induced sufficient repression, and therefore in the expressed genome-scale screen elected to use only three sgRNA per gene.</p><p id="P6">To identify strong perturbations (i.e., those that likely alter cell state relative to NTC), we developed a custom computational pipeline that aimed to balance resolution with computational runtime owing to the massive scale of the datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> for full details. Briefly, after isolating single, live cells harboring a single sgRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2A,B,C</xref>), we isolate a population of NTC cells that: (i) harbor NTC sgRNA that do not induce a fitness impact, (ii) are present in all three experimental batches, and (iii) do not have a deviant transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). These are designated as core NTC cells. We then isolate perturbing sgRNAs that: (i) induce at least 30% mean on-target knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>), and (ii) induce a transcriptional profile more deviant than 75% of core NTC sgRNA from the same batch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, we filter for cells experiencing a transcriptional profile more deviant than 75% of core NTC cells from the same batch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). After filtering for perturbations with at least 25 remaining cells, differential expression analysis was performed via DESeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (adj. p &lt; 0.05) using core NTCs from the same batch as the reference for each perturbation. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). Perturbations with at least 10-25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as strong perturbations. Finally, experimental batches were integrated by normalizing transcriptional profiles to core NTC cells within each batch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In the energy distance test, DNMT1 and UHRF1 were both identified as significant, demonstrated the largest energy distance, and were the #1/#6 perturbations inducing the most DEGs. Further, these two perturbations demonstrated co-clustering in a cell level UMAP projection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1I</xref>), and were located adjacent in the MDE of this dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1J</xref>). This result corroborates previous results, as UHRF1 is known to recruit DNMT1 for DNA methylation maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We additionally observed co-clustering of deacetylases, such as the class IIa HDACs HDAC4/HDAC7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1J</xref>). These observations, in conjunction with the observed lack of co-clustering between perturbed and NTC cells in general (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1I</xref>), gave us confidence that our experimental and computational pipelines were suitable for a larger scale screen.</p><p id="P8">We further tried to optimize the yield of single-cells with a single sgRNA assigned by titrating the number of cells loaded per 10X channel from between 50K to 200K per channel in the pilot screen of 97 metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1K/L</xref>). We found that loading 200K cells per channel yields a high multiplet rate and poor yield of usable cells. Loading 150K cells per channel did yield the highest number of usable cells, though at lower efficiency than loading 100K cells. Thus, for the expressed genome-scale study we aimed to load between 115K-125K cells per channel (which was, at the time, in line with 10X’s recommended maximum loading). Analysis of the perturbations to metabolic enzymes revealed smaller overall effect sizes compared to the chromatin modifiers as evidenced by the reduced overall number of strong perturbations and number of DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1M</xref>). We did observe that perturbations to TGFBR2 induced the second largest number of DEGs. Considering that TGFβ signaling is critical for pluripotency maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, we would anticipate knockdown to TGFBR2 to induce a divergent cell state from wild type (WT) cells, which we observed at the cell level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1N</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pan-Expressed Genome CRISPRi Perturb-Seq in KOLF2.1J iPSC</title><p id="P9">Building on our learnings from the pilot screen, we next scaled our efforts to generate a comprehensive Perturb-Seq dataset of KOLF2.1J hiPSC cells with an expressed genome-wide CRISPRi library targeting 11,739 unique genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each gene, three sgRNAs were designed via CRISPick, along with a total of 478 non-targeting control sgRNAs. KOLF2.1J cells maintained in pluripotent maintenance media (mTeSR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) were harvested at day 6 post-transduction and processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of ~11 million cells were processed. Post filtering, our approach yielded more than 2.5 million single cells, each harboring one sgRNA, with a median of over 5,000 UMIs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). On average, 88% of perturbations had a coverage of over 100 associated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), and 81% achieved greater than 30% mean target knockdown efficiency as assessed by expression of target transcript from scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Following computational analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), we identified 1,332 strong perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>); perturbations with at least 10 DEGs were classified as strong perturbations. The strongest perturbations identified in the screen highlight well-established pluripotency or developmental factors, such as POU5F1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, NANOG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, PTPN1 (also known as PTP1B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, ZNF521 (also known as EZHF or evi3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, PSMD8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and SMARCE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, confirming their critical roles in maintaining the pluripotent state of iPSCs. To further understand the functional impact of these strong perturbations, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on them using the Metascape tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). The network plot reveals clusters of enriched pathways and processes, which include chromatin modifying enzymes (Log10(p-value)=-16.64), DNA damage response (Log10(p-value)=-11.28), and mTORC1-mediated signaling (Log10(p-value)=-8.79), among others. Notably, pathways related to embryonic morphogenesis (Log10(p-value)=-10.99), cell fate commitment (Log10(p-value)=-9.66), endoderm differentiation (Log10(p-value)=-9.81), and mitochondrial metabolic processes (Log10(p-value)=-12.17) were identified. All together, this observation highlights the robustness of the screen in generally capturing key regulators essential for pluripotency, validating the central role of these genes in the self-renewal and pluripotency network of hiPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Functional gene inference through analysis of transcriptional signatures in KOLF2.1J</title><p id="P11">For the 1,332 strong perturbations, we computed the pairwise Pearson correlation matrix using the top 2,000 highly variable genes as features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The presence of distinct clusters across the diagonal suggests that certain gene perturbations have highly correlated transcriptional outcomes, indicating potential involvement in related biological processes or pathways. The correlation matrix was then embedded into a Minimal Distortion Embedding (MDE) map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, resulting in the organization of these perturbations into 50 distinct clusters identified by Leiden clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1I</xref>). Functional enrichment analysis was then performed on these MDE-derived clusters via gProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and used to label the function of the perturbation clusters based on CORUM complexes and Gene Ontology terms. We observed an enrichment of protein complexes and biological pathways within the MDE-derived clusters compared to random pairs, suggesting that biologically meaningful relationships between perturbations were effectively captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cellular transcriptional profiles were additionally visualized using UMAP, illustrating how perturbations induce diverse cellular states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Leiden clustering identified distinct transcriptional clusters, suggesting that perturbations drive cells into unique transcriptional identities. When comparing NTC cells, which are densely concentrated in a central cluster, to perturbed cells, which are more widely dispersed, it became evident that the identified strong perturbations introduced substantial transcriptional changes. We then visualized the complete network of regulatory interactions between all strong perturbations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Each strong perturbation was represented by a node, with outgoing edges to other strong perturbations that it regulates (i.e., an edge from A to B implies B is a DEG of A). Using PageRank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> on the reversed graph, we prioritized the influence of perturbations on the network. Put simply, nodes are given high importance for regulating many other nodes. Nodes that regulate nodes with high importance are also given higher importance. Upon visualization, we see a comprehensive picture of the regulatory interactions governing KOLF2.1J hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). When assessing the top 50 regulators (as determined by PageRank, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), we identify several core pluripotency factors, such as POU5F1 and NANOG, thatare essential for maintaining stem cell identity, differentiation effectors, such as PTPN1 and ZNF521, and key chromatin modifiers, such as SMARCE1 and ARID2, supporting their relevance in stem cell regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

We observed that a large number of perturbations in these clusters regulate both POU5F1 and ZNF521 expression, placing them at the center of the pluripotency regulatory network, reinforcing their critical role in stem cell maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Comprehensive Fitness Profiling in KOLF2.1J</title><p id="P12">While transcriptional profiling provides valuable insights into the functional relationships and regulatory networks of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), it requires capturing a sufficient number of cells to reliably profile the transcriptome. As such, this approach is inherently biased, and can potentially miss perturbations that have a profound negative fitness impact, as corresponding perturbations would result in significant cell loss. To address this limitation and gain a more comprehensive understanding of gene essentiality and functional dependencies in iPSCs, we in tandem with Perturb-Seq performed a pan expressed genome fitness screen in KOLF2.1Js cell line. Genome scale CRISPR fitness screens have previously been shown to give rich insights into genes serving as critical regulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> Using the same cell population that was assayed in the CRISPRi expressed genome-scale Perturb-Seq study, bulk genomic DNA was harvested on day 6 and further on day 14 to assess changes in sgRNA abundance, which reflects the impact of gene knockdown on cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The fitness impact of each gene was determined by combining the gRNA enrichment and depletion data to obtain a gene-level fitness effect. Over time, there was a noticeable change in the number of genes exhibiting significant changes in fitness. At day 6, 1,067 genes were identified as significantly depleted (fitness z-score &lt; -1), which increased to 1,428 by day 14, indicating the progressive identification of essential genes. Similarly, the number of enriched genes (fitness z-score &gt; 1) increased from 77 at day 6 to 204 at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This gradual accumulation of both enriched and depleted genes over time suggests that certain gene perturbations may induce delayed effects on cellular fitness. It also indicates that prolonged screening durations can capture a broader spectrum of gene functions, as genes involved in slower cellular processes or long-term adaptations may only become apparent at later time points. We then performed a functional enrichment analysis of perturbations that are enriched and depleted at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), which revealed distinct biological processes associated with both the depleted and enriched gene sets. The genes identified as essential in KOLF2.1Js (shown in red) correspond to fundamental biological processes, including translation, cell cycle, and DNA replication, highlighting their critical roles in maintaining cellular viability and proliferation. In contrast, enriched perturbations exhibit a different functional profile, indicating that these genes are involved in chromatin remodeling (SAGA complex components) as well as pathways related to apoptosis and DNA damage response. This suggests that many of these genes may function as tumor suppressors, where their disruption could provide a fitness advantage to the cells. For instance, TP53, BAX, BAK1, PMAIP1, and BBC3 (also known as PUMA) are well-established apoptosis and DNA damage response genes that, when depleted, are known to enhance proliferation and survival in pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. The SAGA complex, in particular, has also been previously identified as an important regulator in pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

This comparison revealed that many of the essential genes identified in KOLF2.1Js overlap with the core set of essential genes found across diverse cell types, underscoring the identification of a fundamental group of genes crucial for cellular survival. However, a significant subset of genes that were exclusively essential in KOLF2.1Js iPSCs were also identified. Functional enrichment analysis of these KOLF2-exclusive essential genes showed notable enrichment in pathways such as mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating a heightened metabolic sensitivity in stem cells, and the Fanconi anemia pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), which underscores the high sensitivity of iPSCs to DNA damage and repair mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. We validated the effectiveness of our CRISPRi system by qPCR and observed strong and consistent repression of more than 24 genes including MRPL11 and MRPL14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures S3C, S3D, S3E, S3F</xref>). In addition, enrichment in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was also observed, corroborating the link between cholesterol metabolism and the maintenance or proliferation of pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Using Metascape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichment tools, we then explored the PPI network of the most depleted and enriched perturbations, and found functional interdependencies among these genes, demonstrating that they not only share similar fitness impacts when perturbed but are also closely connected as known physical interactors within cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We then examined the fitness impact at day 6 and 14 corresponding to each of the PPI clusters identified compared to NTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). NTC sgRNA abundance remained steady throughout the experiment, indicating minimal impact on cell fitness. In contrast, the clusters corresponding to mitochondrial translation and the Fanconi anemia pathway showed a progressive depletion at both day 6 and day 14, highlighting their essentiality for iPSC survival. Meanwhile, clusters related to the positive regulation of apoptosis and the SAGA complex exhibited progressive enrichment over time, suggesting that perturbations in these pathways confer a fitness advantage. In addition to the fitness impact observed at the functional cluster level, we also examined the fitness effects at the individual gene level within these clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures S3A, S3B</xref>) providing detailed fitness z-scores for specific perturbations from the mitochondrial translation, Fanconi anemia, apoptosis regulation, and SAGA complex clusters.</p><p id="P14">We next compared the quantification of fitness between day 6 bulk genomic DNA extraction to cell abundance from guide RNA calling from the post-QC single-cell RNA-seq screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). A strong correlation (r=0.88) between the fitness estimates obtained from both methods was observed, demonstrating the robustness of scRNA-seq in accurately assessing fitness and, similarly, validating the reliability of the bulk screen. However, it was also evident that perturbations with deep negative fitness impacts were often missed in the single-cell RNA-seq data, as these perturbations resulted in capturing fewer than 25 unique cells by day 6. We then investigated the correlation between the number of DEGs and fitness impact, and did not observe any significant correlation, which we hypothesize is due to the unique biology of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <bold>right panel</bold>). In PSCs, essential genes are often involved in maintaining core cellular functions including pluripotency, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation, where even slight perturbations can significantly impact cell fitness. However, recent insights suggest that the maintenance of pluripotent identity may be regulated independently from cell fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. While fitness screens traditionally emphasize survival and proliferation, they may overlook key pluripotency regulators that do not directly influence cell viability. This observation was also well illustrated in the recent Rosen et al. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, highlighting that pluripotent identity and fitness may be governed by distinct mechanisms, with some genes contributing to the maintenance of the pluripotent state without impacting cell fitness. Together, these findings indicate that in pluripotent stem cells, fitness impact is more closely tied to disruptions in fundamental cellular machinery rather than the scale of transcriptional reprogramming. This reflects the sensitive and highly regulated nature of PSCs in balancing pluripotency and survival, where certain transcriptional regulators maintain pluripotency independently of fitness, expanding our understanding of the regulatory landscape of stem cell identity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>KOLF2.1J Specific Perturbation Signatures and MDE Cluster Specific Fitness Impacts</title><p id="P15">To gain insights into cell type specific regulatory networks, the strong perturbations identified in our genome-scale KOLF2.1J Perturb-Seq study were compared with those observed in a K562 genome-scale Perturb-Seq experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that strong perturbations are predominantly cell-type specific, with 1,069 unique to KOLF2.1J and 1,703 exclusive to K562, while only 263 perturbations are shared between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). While we acknowledge the important caveat that the computational pipelines used to determine strong perturbations in the two studies are different, we anticipate that perturbations inducing strong transcriptional impacts will be generally similarly identified regardless of the pipeline used making these comparisons informative. When examining the KOLF2-exclusive strong perturbations, we observed that they are primarily involved in processes related to development and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Specifically, these perturbations are enriched in pathways such as cell fate commitment, chromatin remodeling, pluripotency regulation, transcriptional regulation of pluripotent stem cells, and germ layer formation, highlighting perturbations that are essential for maintaining and regulating the pluripotent state. This enrichment highlights the distinct developmental and differentiation potential of a pluripotent stem cell compared to a more lineage-restricted cell line, such as K562<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Using the perturbation-level MDE map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), a cluster-level representation was constructed where each node corresponds to the a cluster in the MDE, and the size of the node represents the number of member perturbations, retaining the overall layout observed in the original map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). Edges are drawn between a node and its two nearest neighbors (as we observe neighbors tend to exhibit similar global transcriptional profiles, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>), and each node is labeled with terms enriched using GO (Gene Ontology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>), CORUM (Protein Complex Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>), and LLM GSAI (Large Language Model Gene Set Annotation and Interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>) tools, reflecting the main biological processes or cellular components associated with each cluster. Notably, Clusters 48, 42, 20, 46, and 34 are all related to mitochondrial function, and their connection on the MDE map underscores their close functional relationships, which aligns with their biological relevance in cellular energy production and regulation. Additionally, clusters representing mTORC signaling (Cluster 34), late endosome (cluster 34), and mitochondrial complex I assembly (MT Complex; Cluster 46) perturbations are located near each other, which is particularly interesting given the known role of mTORC being activated at late endosomes and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Additionally, we found clusters related to Developmental Regulation (Cluster 38) and Pluripotency factors (Cluster 31), which are positioned nearby on the MDE map. Out of the 29 perturbations found in these two clusters, 15 rank among the top 30 strongest perturbations observed in the pan-expressed Perturb-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). In these two perturbations clusters, key transcription factors involved in pluripotency maintenance and neural development such as POU5F1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and POU3F2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> were identified, as well as important developmental factors such as RBPJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, PTPN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and ZNF521<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The perturbed cells from MDE Clusters 31, 38, 34, 46, 12, and 22 were then projected onto the cell-level UMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Each group of perturbations represented by a cluster is observed to colocalize in a well-defined region of the UMAP, distinct from the NTC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating a potential change in cell state. Adjacent clusters in the MDE additionally colocalize in the UMAP. Notably, the clusters associated with pluripotency and developmental processes (Clusters 31 and 38) are positioned distinctly from the NTC on the UMAP, suggesting a shift in cell state away from the pluripotent state represented by the NTC cells. As the UMAP is based on highly variable genes, and not specifically tailored to DEGs, this observation corroborates the significant impact of these perturbations on altering the cellular identity as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>. We then overlaid the median number of DEGs per perturbation for each cluster of the cluster-level MDE. The clusters inducing the strongest transcriptional change are Clusters 31 (Pluripotency Factors), 38 (Development), and 49 (Pluripotency Factors) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, the bulk fitness screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) was leveraged to assess relationships between MDE functional clusters and fitness impact. Over time, a progressive negative fitness impact was observed in clusters with mitochondrial function (8, 42, 20, 46, and 34), the BAF complex cluster (Cluster 40), and the MTOR and endosome cluster (Clusters 46, 34) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary 5D, 5E</xref>). This suggests that perturbations in these clusters increasingly disrupt cell fitness, particularly affecting processes linked to mitochondrial function, chromatin remodeling, highlighting their critical roles in maintaining the cellular fitness of hiPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A ML Architecture Towards Rationale Cell State Engineering of hiPSCs</title><p id="P17">Recently, there have been a number of ML models developed that aim to <italic>in silico</italic> predict the effect of a perturbation on cell state, such as GEARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> and CellOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, among others. Generally speaking, these models aim to learn a representation of the perturbation applied (a graph embedding in the case of GEARS, an optimal transport map in the case of CellOT) to predict the resultant cell state. Inspired by these models, we wondered if in the specific context of hiPSCs, a cell line primed for cell state engineering, there was a unique opportunity to flip this paradigm. That is, can a model predict the perturbation(s) that need to be applied to the wild type (WT) cell to achieve a given cell state of interest?</p><p id="P18">Towards this goal, we propose a general model architecture that learns specifically from perturbation atlases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> <bold>left</bold>). During the training phase, the perturbation atlas is split into perturbed and unperturbed (NTC) cells, which are then passed into a self- or semi-supervised (e.g., gene ontology graph-informed) cell-state encoder to learn a representation (low-dimensional vector embedding) of the perturbed cell state – that is, what makes this perturbed cell state different from the control cells? The encoder is not informed about the identity of the perturbation made to the perturbed cell. This embedding is then passed into a supervised perturbation decoder, which is trained using the ground-truth labels from the perturbation atlas, to determine the perturbation(s) with the highest probability of pushing the WT cell towards this perturbed cell state. Then, for inference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> <bold>right</bold>), the transcriptome of desired cell state (e.g. bulk-RNA seq of a neuronal population) can be passed through the encoder-decoder architecture to predict perturbation(s) with high log-probabilities of inducing that cell state. These perturbations can be experimentally validated, and results can be used to improve model performance. We coin this architecture CHEF (<underline>C</underline>ontrastive <underline>H</underline>uman-cell <underline>E</underline>ngineering <underline>F</underline>ramework), as it predicts perturbation recipes driving a desired cell state.</p><p id="P19">As a proof of principle implementation of this architecture, we used ContrastiveVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> as the cell-state encoder, and a simple logistic regression classifier as the perturbation decoder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> <bold>middle</bold>). ContrastiveVI is a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework that learns a representation specific to perturbed cells that isolates them from control cells called the “salient embedding.” Given its unsupervised nature, the model is inherently generalizable to learning cell state representations of unseen transcriptomes for which the associated perturbation is unknown. Further, an important feature of ContrastiveVI is that as input it takes raw, unnormalized RNA-seq profiles. This improves the utility of this model far beyond simply using the learned MDE to co-cluster a cellular profile near similar perturbations, as the latter requires the same normalization, processing, and batch-correction as the data its trained on (i.e., unseen data would necessarily need to be from the same experiment). Representations learned from this model are then passed into a supervised logistic regression classifier, which is trained to predict the associated perturbation.</p><p id="P20">The training loop and parameters we used are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref>. We initially subset our data down to 33 strong perturbations with at least 100 DEGs and 100 associated cells as our training set to ensure the model was trained on perturbations with a strong phenotypic effect and high sample representation within the dataset. Class balancing was performed by subsampling to 100 cells per perturbation, and feature selection was performed by using the same top 2,000 highly variable genes used to create the MDE. Raw (unnormalized) counts were then passed into the ContrastiveVI model with the batch as a categorical covariate. Hyperparameters were optimized using RayTune/Hyperband<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> and the model was finally trained until the validation loss (negative ELBO) no longer improved. The salient embeddings from the model were visualized using UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), where we observed that the ContrastiveVI model was able to generate similar embeddings for NTC cells that separated them away from perturbed cells. Then, a logistic regression classifier was trained on the salient embeddings to predict the associated perturbation with a 80/20 train-test split, with the confusion matrix and performance statistics reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>. The model exhibited moderate classification accuracy of 25%, which increased to 39% when considering the top 3 accuracy. In our view, this is rather respectable performance as this represents perturbation classification of the transcriptional profile of a single cell. At random, the classification probability would be 1/34 or ~3%. Further, we noted that related perturbations were being confused for each other; for example, JOSD1 is confused for POU5F1, which co-cluster in the MDE.</p><p id="P21">As the ContrastiveVI model contains a regularization term to ensure the salient embedding is represented by a multivariate normal gaussian with identity covariance and the loss function is evaluated by the KL-divergence between embedding spaces (in this special case, the euclidean distance between their means), distances in salient embedding space are representative of distances in the input space. We therefore computed the average salient embedding of each training perturbation to represent the salient embedding of the pseudo bulk profile of cells with the same perturbation. A logistic regression model was then fit to these pseudo bulk profiles to serve as a pseudo bulk perturbation decoder. To simulate previously unseen, pre-validated, bulk-RNA seq profiles of desired transcriptional states, we used pseudo bulk transcriptional profiles of the remaining strong perturbations not previously seen by the model. These perturbations were passed into the pretrained ContrastiveVI encoder, and pseudo bulk perturbation decoder. Classification probabilities for unseen perturbations with class probability for any one class &gt;10% were visualized in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). We observed that for every unseen perturbation visualized, the model suggested perturbations from either the same or adjacent clusters in the MDE, validating the model predictions. The predictions spanned eight different MDE clusters. Further, we observed that unseen perturbations classified as POU5F1 (such as PTPN1) were additionally classified as JOSD1 (same MDE cluster), and FLYWCH2 (adjacent MDE cluster).</p><p id="P22">We additionally created a “naive” model to demonstrate the utility of the current implementation of CHEF. Put simply, the naive model represents a case where one would simply “look up” perturbations with similar DEGs to their desired cell state, rather than learning an embedding of the cell state. In the naive model, we used as features the union of all DEGs of all strong perturbations (5665 unique DEGs). Each perturbation was represented by a binary vector of these perturbations, with a one in indices of DEGs of that perturbation, and zeros otherwise. NTC was represented by a vector of zeros. We then fit a logistic regression classifier on the same training perturbations and used to evaluate the same unseen perturbations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>. We observed that the naive model classified most unseen perturbations as NTC, demonstrating the advantage of learning cell state embeddings (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>).

This approach revealed strong transcriptomic associations among several protein complexes, including mitochondrial ribosome subunits as well as the Ragulator complex. Notably, clusters corresponding to mitochondrial translation functions show high transcriptomic correlation within each cluster, and our data suggest that perturbations particularly to the MDE functional clusters of mitochondrial function (Clusters 8, 42, 20, 46, and 34), the BAF complex (Cluster 40), and the MTOR and endosomes (Clusters 46, 34) (see above; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary 5D, 5E</xref>) increasingly disrupt cell fitness. To validate that these transcriptomic clusters represent actual protein complexes in iPSCs, we conducted size-exclusion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) in KOLF2.1J iPSCs. SEC-MS separates protein complexes by molecular weight and uses a guilt-by-association framework to assign co-eluting proteins into the same complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The SEC-MS data were then analyzed for cosine similarity to assess the systematic co-fractionation of proteins across fractions as physical evidence of their interactions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> for details). We found significant enrichment in high cosine similarities between pairs of proteins within clusters of mitochondrial function and MTOR (Clusters 34, 41, 42, 46 and 48) from our Perturb-Seq data with the cosine similarity heatmap showing distinct clustering patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) with strong internal similarity within the previously identified clusters from the Perturb-Seq MDE. For example, proteins corresponding to the transcripts in clusters related to mitochondria, e.g. Cluster 46 (MT Complex 1) and Clusters 42 and 41 (Mitochondrial ribosomal L proteins; MRPL), co-eluted across multiple fractions, confirming the close physical association of mitochondrial ribosome subunits. The mTORC signaling Cluster 34, encompassing the Ragulator-Rag complex which consists of LAMTOR subunits and regulates MAPK and mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> displayed high cosine similarity among LAMTOR subunits and the fractionation profiles of LAMTOR2, LAMTOR3, LAMTOR4, and LAMTOR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) showed overlapping elution peaks, confirming their co-existence in the same molecular weight fractions and indicating a stable protein complex in iPSCs. Further visualization of these clusters as PPI networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) highlights the interactions within a cluster, e.g. Ragulator components in Cluster 34, as well as among clusters, with strong connectivity observed among MRPL subunits (Clusters 42 and 41), mitochondrial ribosomal small (MRPS) subunits (Cluster 48). Clusters 42, 41, and 48, positioned closely on the Perturb-Seq MDE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>), highlighting this interconnectivity at a functional level and reflected by the strong transcriptional coherence in the co-expression patterns within these perturbation clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, Cluster 34 shows particularly tight correlation of gene expression among Ragulator components, indicating that knocking down any of the subunits leads to the same phenotype, suggesting overall perturbation of the Ragulator complex function. Overall, the SEC-MS data validated the PPIs inferred from Perturb-Seq, such as Ragulator complex, mitochondrial ribosome and MT complex 1, confirming that the observed transcriptomic clusters can correspond to physically stable protein complexes in iPSCs. This integrative analysis demonstrates that transcriptomic clustering from Perturb-Seq can provide insights into protein complex formation such as the functional organization of mitochondrial and signaling-related complexes in stem cells while also providing valuable information of multiple clusters of functionally related proteins without evident or previously known physical association.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Identification of New Genes Involved in Mitochondrial Metabolism</title><p id="P24">The Perturb-Seq atlas serves as a powerful resource not only for identifying protein complexes, but also for uncovering new gene function on a broader scale.

Two prominent clusters emerged from these analyses: one enriched with key pluripotency factors (Cluster 31), and another characterized by genes involved in mitochondrial translation (Cluster 20). Within the mitochondrial translation cluster, we identified several novel genes, such as ZBTB41, PRR13, UBFD1, LFNG, and BOD1L1 which show high correlation with known mitochondrial factors, suggesting potential roles in mitochondrial metabolism. We focused on ZBTB41 as it is a poorly characterized zinc-finger transcription factor, and generated KOLF2.1J cell lines transduced with sgRNA NTC and targeting MRPL11, MRPL37, or ZBTB41. The knockdown of MRPL11, MRPL37, and ZBTB41 was first validated through qPCR, confirming significant repression of target gene expression relative to the control (sg-NTC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>).

This finding was further supported by a similar trend in isotopologue labeling for other key TCA cycle intermediates, including citrate, fumarate, and malate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6D, 6E, 6F</xref>). In addition, we also examined the succinate/fumarate ratio as another indicator of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Compared to sg-NTC, cells perturbed for MRPL11, MRPL37, and ZBTB41 displayed a significant reduction in the succinate/fumarate ratio, further supporting the hypothesis that these perturbations affect mitochondrial metabolic processes. The labeling patterns of the TCA cycle metabolites suggest impaired glucose oxidation and mitochondrial function across these perturbations. Overall, this integrated analysis of gene expression, metabolic flux provides strong evidence that perturbations of MRPL11, MRPL37, and ZBTB41 disrupt mitochondrial metabolism, as reflected by both the gene expression changes in mitochondrial genes and the altered metabolic flux through the TCA cycle. This analysis highlights the role of previously uncharacterized genes like ZBTB41 in mitochondrial function and underscores the broader connection between mitochondrial ribosomal protein function and metabolic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Identification of New Genes Involved in Pluripotency Maintenance</title><p id="P26">Among the 50 clusters identified from the MDE analysis, Cluster 31 stood out with 14 perturbations, many of which target genes with known roles in pluripotency maintenance or differentiation regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This cluster includes essential pluripotency factors, such as POU5F1, which is crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells. Additionally, Cluster 31 includes PTPN1 and POU3F2 (also known as BRN2), which have been implicated in neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential shift towards a neural lineage when perturbed. Other perturbations within Cluster 31, including JOSD1, RNF7, RBM14, PHF20, and ST13, have not previously been linked to pluripotency or differentiation, making their association with known pluripotency regulators intriguing. This clustering suggests these genes may participate in novel pathways governing stem cell maintenance or lineage specification. Given the co-clustering of JOSD1 and RNF7 with well-known pluripotency factors, we performed JOSD1 and RNF7 knockdown experiments in the KRAB<sup>ZIM3</sup>-dCas9 KOLF2.1Js to test their involvement in pluripotency maintenance with sgRNA targeting POU5F1 (sg-POU5F1) as a positive control and NTC gRNA (sg-NTC) as a negative control. We first assessed knockdown efficiency by qPCR and observed robust repression for all target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, we found that POU5F1 expression was reduced not only in sg-POU5F1 cells but also in cells where JOSD1 and RNF7 were repressed. However, knockdown of POU5F1 did not lead to reduced expression of JOSD1 or RNF7. Morphologically, we observed notable changes in the sg-POU5F1, sg-JOSD1 and sg-RNF7 cells compared to controls sg-NTC. These cells exhibited a loss of typical stem cell colony structure, showing a more spread-out and flattened appearance, with larger individual cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). This morphology is characteristic of cells undergoing differentiation, suggesting that repression of JOSD1, RNF7 and POU5F1 disrupts the pluripotent state and drives the cells towards a differentiated phenotype. To explore the transcriptional impact of these knockdowns, we analyzed differentially expressed common DEGs from Perturb-Seq found in Cluster 31. The DEG profile for Cluster 31 perturbations, including JOSD1 and RNF7, showed a decrease in key pluripotency markers such as POU5F1, GRID2, and CD24, alongside an increase in differentiation markers including SOX5, EPHA4, and GREB1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). These transcriptional changes, indicative of a shift from a pluripotent state towards differentiation, were validated in our single-plex validation samples, confirming that JOSD1 and RNF7 knockdown drives a similar transcriptional response to that of POU5F1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). Interestingly, while both JOSD1 and RNF7 knockdowns led to substantial transcriptional and morphological changes associated with loss of pluripotency, the fitness screen did not reveal any significant impact on cell viability for POU5F1, JOSD1, or RNF7 knockdowns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6I</xref>). This highlights the specificity of these genes in maintaining pluripotency rather than cell survival, and it underscores the unique value of Perturb-Seq in identifying these novel pluripotency regulators that may not impact fitness directly. Finally, a strong correlation (r=0.91) was observed between the Perturb-Seq screening data and low-throughput qPCR validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>), underscoring the accuracy and reliability of Perturb-Seq in capturing gene expression changes. This robust correlation validates Perturb-Seq as an effective approach for identifying novel pluripotency regulators, such as JOSD1 and RNF7, within complex transcriptional networks in hiPSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide CRISPRi Perturb-Seq screen in KOLF2.1J iPSCs, targeting 11,739 genes in parallel to systematically dissect the transcriptional and functional landscape of pluripotent stem cells. Using strong perturbations and transcriptomic profiling correlations projected via MDE, we were able to recapitulate established protein complexes and identify genes with redundant functions, providing a detailed map of functional relationships within iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Our approach identified key regulators of pluripotency and revealed how perturbations influence cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). SEC-MS in KOLF2.1J iPSCs validated PPIs identified from the Perturb-Seq derived MDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We further leveraged our Perturb-Seq dataset to train a machine learning model that predicts cell states of unseen perturbations from the training dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), demonstrating a potential cell state engineering application of the perturbation atlas. Notably, the strongest hits from the screen included well-established pluripotency factors such as POU5F1 and NANOG, validating the screen’s ability to capture critical regulators. Additionally, we discovered new metabolic factors that co-clustered with mitochondrial gene perturbations and identified a cluster of pluripotency factors with new perturbations inducing phenotypes similar to POU5F1 repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Through this Perturb-Seq dataset in iPSCs, we were also able to identify new genes involved in pluripotency maintenance. In particular, our MDE analysis identified Cluster 31, which contains well-known regulators of pluripotency, such as POU5F1, and novel candidates like JOSD1 and RNF7, both of which showed similar effects to POU5F1 knockdown. This finding suggests that JOSD1 and RNF7 play a previously unrecognized role in pluripotency maintenance, supported by both morphological changes and transcriptional shifts indicative of differentiation upon its knockdown. JOSD1, a deubiquitinase, and RNF7, a catalytic subunit of an E3 ligase complex, are pivotal for protein homeostasis by modulating ubiquitination dynamics, with JOSD1 reversing ubiquitin modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> and RNF7 facilitating neddylation and substrate recruitment for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. This functional interplay suggests that disrupting these ubiquitin-related pathways could destabilize the tightly regulated protein turnover critical for maintaining pluripotency, as protein quality control is essential in stem cells to preserve a balanced proteome and stem cell identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. Despite their influence on pluripotency, our fitness screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6I</xref>) did not indicate that POU5F1, JOSD1 and RNF7 significantly impact overall cell fitness. Our comprehensive fitness profiling revealed that while many genes are essential for pluripotency, others play distinct roles in maintaining cell fitness. For example, genes involved in chromatin remodeling (e.g., SAGA complex members) were enriched in our fitness screens, indicating that their perturbation enhances cell proliferation while potentially compromising pluripotency. In particular, TADA2B, a core member of the SAGA complex, is the top1 enriched hit from our fitness screen in KOLF2.1Js (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Recent literature has shown that TADA2B-associated chromatin changes influence pluripotency and differentiation independently, with perturbations in the SAGA complex components favoring cell fitness without necessarily supporting pluripotent identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. This reinforces the idea that fitness and pluripotent identity are governed by different pathways and cannot be defined by cell fitness alone. We also observed that the Fanconi anemia pathway and mitochondrial translation genes were critical for iPSC survival, underscoring the heightened sensitivity of iPSCs to metabolic and DNA repair disruptions. Our findings align with the concept that pluripotency dissolution involves a “push-pull” mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, where the loss of pluripotent identity occurs independently of differentiation signaling. This is consistent with our identification of chromatin regulators as key players in pluripotency dissolution, while developmental transcription factors were more strongly associated with differentiation signaling.</p><p id="P29">We also acknowledge certain limitations of this study. As previously discussed, the Perturb-Seq assay is inherently biased towards capturing perturbations that do not induce a negative fitness impact. To have sufficient coverage / statistical confidence, we filter for cells that, in the best case scenario, have 25 associated cells pre-filtering. As a result of our QC/filtering pipeline, most perturbations require more than 25 starting cells to pass this threshold, which is challenging to achieve for perturbations with deeply negative fitness impacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Hence, this study may not fully capture the transcriptional effects of some key pluripotency drivers. This is further influenced by the choice of pluripotency maintenance media containing self-renewal factors such as hFGF and hTGFβ. Inherently, the media conditions are promoting maintenance of the stem cell in a pluripotent state, and thus any perturbations have to overcome the self-renewal effect of the media environment. As all perturbations are assayed in a multiplexed fashion, a key confounding factor diminishing the resolution of characterizing individual perturbations may be external stimuli from cell-cell signaling.</p><p id="P30">Additionally, while our experimental and analysis pipelines do recapitulate well characterized biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), driving confidence that we capture some aspects of true biological signal, we feel there is certainly room for improvement. First, experimentally we have a median 5000 UMIs per cell. While our sequencing depth is above the recommended 1000 UMIs per cell from Peidli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, achieving higher sequencing depths closer to ~10,000 UMIs/cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> will enable finer grain resolution. Second, in our single-plex validations through qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref>), we confirmed robust repression of target genes via the KRAB<sup>ZIM3</sup>-dCas9 system, and therefore anticipate that we achieve sufficient perturbation magnitude. However, a dual sgRNA library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> could be utilized in the future to ensure stronger perturbation magnitude. Additionally, there is a possibility of confounding effects from CRISPRi off-targets affecting neighboring genes, enhancers, insulators, and potentially pseudogenes as well as non-coding RNAs.</p><p id="P31">We seek to emphasize the importance of selecting a substantially large proportion of the screen to comprise of NTC sgRNA, and of having the same NTC sgRNA present in each batch. In our screen, NTC sgRNA comprised ~4% of the library, and were shared across all 3 batches. We observed in our fitness data that though most NTC sgRNA are benign, some aberrant sgRNA can have drastic negative fitness effects (as much as -2.5 Z, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Additionally there may be single cells that receive a benign NTC sgRNA, though nevertheless display a deviant phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). We envision hiPSCs being particularly prone to this phenomenon as they are capable of spontaneous state change / differentiation, and hypothesize that a population of cells in the pluripotent state have more cell-to-cell variability than in the terminally differentiated state. As a result of these factors our starting population of ~150K NTC cells was reduced to ~30K NTC cells post filtering (~10K cells / batch), emphasizing the importance of ensuring a sufficiently large population of NTC cells. We recommend that for future screens, in an ideal case at least 5% of the sgRNA library should consist of NTC sgRNA. When feasible, experiments should be performed in a single batch (i.e. 10X run) to avoid the potentially strong confounding effect of batch effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1H</xref>). In cases where this is not experimentally feasible (i.e. at the genome scale), we found, as others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> that the strategy of leveraging batch level internal controls (i.e. having the same set of NTC sgRNA in each batch) is effective at reducing batch effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Another key bottleneck for this study (and we believe fundamentally all single-cell studies) is the ability to generate faithful cell state embeddings. While we chose the top 2000 highly variable genes as features to get a global picture of phenotypic variation, it is unclear whether this is the optimal feature set to separate perturbation-specific effects. Additionally, we observed that using the top 50 principal components (PCs) as features for each cell, which is the norm in the single-cell field, only accounted for &lt; 10% of the total variation in the dataset. We hypothesize that this is a result of Perturb-Seq focusing on a single cell line, which is much more homogenous than the heterogeneous cell type mixture in (for example) PBMCs, where the top 50 PCs perform well. These two factors undoubtedly diminished our ability to resolve the fine-grain effect of perturbations on phenotype. In our opinion, learning robust cell embeddings is an open problem of seminal importance to the Perturb-Seq field.</p><p id="P33">As outlined by Peidli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, there is to date no standardized Perturb-Seq analysis pipeline, and given the &gt;11,000 perturbations we assayed, we sought to develop a method that is scalable and intuitive. Sources of heterogeneity emerged at both the sgRNA and cell level. Despite the modest cell state representations learned by PCA, we still observed heterogeneity in phenotypic profiles induced by individual perturbations. This was a key challenge that we aimed to address with our computational pipeline. We noted instances where for a given perturbation, while all three sgRNA did induce sufficient target knockdown, each sgRNA would induce phenotypic changes of variable magnitudes. As a part of our pipeline, we leveraged the energy distance to identify sgRNA likely inducing phenotypic alterations. One limitation at the genome scale is the computational complexity of running the energy distance test (i.e. permutation test with 10,000 permutations per sgRNA) for all &gt;30,000 perturbing sgRNA. To engineer around this we decided to use a bootstrapping approach to generate a null distribution from 10,000 random samples of NTC cells to identify an upper-quartile cutoff of energy distance. sgRNA with energy distances exceeding this cutoff were admitted. This reduced the number of energy distances to be computed from on the order of ~300 million to ~50 thousand. Further, cells experiencing incomplete perturbation penetrance are challenging to identify. As one example, cells may appear artificially repressed for their target gene as an artifact of a scRNA-Seq dropout event, and inclusion of these cells can mask perturbation-specific effects. The use of CRISPRi adds an additional consideration, as cells may experience repression of variable magnitude. While Mixscape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> is in our opinion a valuable tool for identifying cells escaping perturbation with high resolution, we found that at the genome scale it was challenging to execute with reasonable runtime. Hence, we developed a Mixscape-inspired method where we first fit a One-Class SVM to NTC cells (just as Mixscape fits a Gaussian to NTC perturbation scores) and used it to predict the probability of a perturbed cell being in the NTC population, using the same threshold as at the sgRNA level to filter. While there is certainly room for improvement, we feel that our approach helped to resolve perturbation specific effects. After filtering for perturbations with at least 25 remaining cells and &gt;10 DEGs, we observed that the identified 1332 strong perturbations did not co-cluster highly with NTC cells on the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), noting that the UMAP is computed on 2000 highly variable genes (not perturbation specific DEGs) as features.</p><p id="P34">The demonstrated ML model, in its current implementation, is quite limited in its capabilities. We subsetted down to training perturbations with a high number of samples and large phenotypic impact to achieve fair model performance. We found that including perturbations with fewer total cells tended to lead to overfitting, and overall poor inference. As a result, the model can only suggest between 34 total perturbations to make. We anticipate that several improvements can be made, such as bootstrapping to generate more synthetic data points, greater fine-tuning of model hyperparameters, and use of semi-supervised learning in the encoder to achieve more robust inference for a greater number of perturbations. Further, this model is not capable of predicting combinations of perturbations, but rather individual perturbations that may be assayed in combinations. Nevertheless, we argue that this model still demonstrates an important initial result, as it is capable of accurately suggesting perturbations across a diversity of cell states. To our knowledge, this encapsulates the first proof of concept model capable of predicting perturbations driving a cell state, and we hope the broader scientific community can iterate and improve on this basal architecture. Future directions may include integration of the hiPSC CRISPRi dataset (this study) with the hESC mORF overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> dataset to encapsulate genetic perturbations in both directions, and use of graph neural networks to incorporate external knowledge from biological knowledge graphs (such as protein-protein interaction networks) to enhance the model towards predicting combinatorial perturbation recipes. A model of this capability, as previously outlined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>, would be invaluable for deterministic cell state engineering.</p><p id="P35">Overall, our study represents a comprehensive perturbation cell atlas of hiPSCs. We feel that this dataset is a rich resource for the scientific community to query the complexities of pluripotency. As an example, we leveraged a MDE map of correlated perturbation profiles to identify novel pluripotency factors. Future studies could include reanalysis of the dataset to focus on genes relevant for a differentiation trajectory of choice, and investigating how perturbations push the undifferentiated stem cell towards that trajectory. For example, combining scRNA-Seq in human-derived teratoma model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> with perturbations would be an efficient method to assess and identify important genes involved in hPSCs differentiation. Further, we envision this dataset to be expanded into a multiomic atlas, integrating data from (for example) chromatin structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> and spatial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> information. Finally, we anticipate great utility in combining datasets across perturbation cell atlases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> to form a comprehensive human cell perturbation atlas to unify human cell biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> We hope that this resource and the associated computational methods developed is used by the broader scientific community to unravel previously unknown biology of the pluripotent stem cell.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P36">KOLF2.1Js were maintained under feeder-free conditions in mTeSR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies).

Briefly, KOLF2 cells were lysed in HNN buffer (50mM HEPES pH7, 150mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.5% NP-40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitor. After sonication to shred DNA, samples were cleared by ultracentifugation (40.000g for 15min at 4C) and 1mg of protein lysate (1mg/ml) was loaded on a 30 MWCO Amicon column (Millipore, UFC803096) to dilute NP-40 with 3 washes of HNN buffer followed by concentration to a volume of 110μL that was injected onto an HPLC system (Agilent, 1260 Infinity II LC system) connected to a BioSep SEC-s4000 size exclusion column (Phenomenex). Each SEC run was performed using a flow of 0.5ml/min of HNN buffer and 5 fractions/min were collected 8.5min after sample loading for a total run time of 26min. Fraction #7 to 78 (72 fraction total) were further processed to be acquired by MS. Proteins in fractions were reduced by adding 100μL of reduction buffer (8M Urea (4M final), 50mM HEPES pH7 and 10mM DTT (5mM final)) and incubated at 37C for 45min before aklylation by addition of 10mM final of iodoaceta and incubated 30 minutes in the dark. Fractions were further diluted with 800μL of 50mM HEPES and incubated overnight after addition of 1μg of Trypsin (Promega, V511X). The next day samples were desaled with C18 96 well plates according to manufacturer instructions and illusions were vacuum dried and stored at −80 °C until MS acquisition. Fractions were resuspended in 60μL of 0.1% formic acid and 5μL of 3x 24 consecutive fractions were pooled to generate an ion mobility gas-phase fractionation (GPF) library was acquired based on the work of Penny et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. Briefly, data was collected from 400 to 1200 m/z using 5 m/z windows with a 1 m/z overlap on each side. The ion mobility range spanned 0.57–1.47 V/cm2, with two quadrupole positions per ion mobility cycle. These windows were evenly distributed across seven acquisition methods, with each method comprising 15 ion mobility cycles. For the SEC fractions, The peptides were sprayed through a 20 mm ZDV emitter kept at 1600 V and 200 degrees C. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode with a TIMS range 0.60 Vs/cm2 to 1.60 Vs/cm2.

Spectronaut protein-group summarized intensities were used for all downstream SEC-MS analyses.</p><p id="P41">The full SEC-MS data matrix (8,251 proteins X 72 fractions) for each of three samples were column-normalized using a robust local-regression method to fit a smooth curve through the global intensity trends across each sample. The goal was to detect and preserve global protein intensity trends across fractions as a smooth curve, and adjust protein intensities to this global trend to account for run-to-run noise in MS recovery efficiency. The first step in normalization was to calculate a summary intensity value per fraction as the column effect from a median polish procedure, using the R function medpolish, on the full log-transformed intensity matrix. Next, cubic polynomial curves were fitted to the summary data using exhaustive sliding windows 20 fractions wide with function rlm from the MASS package of R. The residuals of each fraction to all of the local-regression curves that include the fraction were pooled and the median taken as each fraction’s normalization factor. All protein intensities in each fraction were then adjusted by the corresponding fraction’s normalization factor by subtraction on log transformed data. Protein intensity values were then transformed back to their non-log-transformed values, and scaled per protein and per sample by dividing by the sum of each protein’s intensity in a sample. To calculate a combined cosine similarity between protein elution profiles across the three replicates of 72 fractions each, the normalized matrices were concatenated fraction-wise into a global matrix of 8,251 proteins by 216 fractions. Missing values were set to 0. Cosine similarities were then calculated between all possible protein pairs as the similarity between vectors of length 216.</p><p id="P42">Enrichment of physical interactions detected by SEC-MS in Perturb-Seq derived clusters was calculated by a comparison of the 95th percentile score of within-cluster cosine similarities compared with a random distribution of 95th percentiles calculated on 10,000 permuted clusterings in the same data. Each permutation shuffled the gene labels in the cluster table so that cluster sizes remained the same per cluster name, and the score of each cluster was compared against permutations on the same-named cluster. The portion of permutations with 95th percentile score greater than or equal to the original cluster was used as the p value, p values were adjusted for multiple testing across the 51 clusters by the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method, and those clusters with FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Metabolic tracing/Mitochondrial Flux</title><p id="P43">For isotopic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in mTESR containing 17.5 mM [U13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for 24 hours prior to extraction.

We hypothesize that cells with 0 sgRNA assigned (~25% of all cells) truly do contain a sgRNA as they survived 4 days of puromycin selection, and thus these are cells where the sgRNA simply failed to detect. This may be due to challenges with robustly capturing polyadenylated, linear sgRNA via dial-out PCR. Further, we hypothesize that cells with &gt;1 sgRNA assigned are likely multiplets (two or more cells within a single GEM) as the experimental MOI of &lt; 0.3 would make events where there is &gt;1 sgRNA per cell unlikely. We anecdotally remark that the percent of cells identified with more than 1 sgRNA (~28%) detected correspond similarly to 10x’s reported approximate multiplet rate based on a targeted recovery of 60,000 single cells.

In light of this, we sought to remove NTC sgRNA and NTC cells that demonstrated phenotypic deviation from the norm, with the underlying assumption that NTC sgRNA typically do not induce phenotypic alterations compared to wild-type KOLF2.1J hiPSCs. To do so, we leveraged the results of fitness screening, removing any NTC sgRNA that was not within the middle 50% interquartile range of fitness log2 fold changes (L2FCs). This corresponded to a NTC sgRNA “whitelist” of 236 sgRNA with mean fitness L2FC of 0.3, max L2FC of 1.0, and min L2FC of -0.4. NTC sgRNAs in the aggregated anndata object were subset down to contain only those in the whitelist. We then used an outlier detection model (isolation forest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup>) to filter out NTC cells with a deviant phenotype from the norm. NTC cells were isolated from the perturbed cells, batch-aware highly variable gene (HVG) selection was performed using sc.pp.highly_variable_genes with flavor=‘seurat_v3’ to select 2000 HVGs, embedded via the top-100 principal components, and filtered using an isolation forest (sklearn) with a 30% contamination fraction.

Target knockdown was evaluated relative to the mean target expression within NTC cells from the same batch. Further, we aimed to filter out sgRNA that did not induce a phenotypic effect. For each batch, a random subset of 3000 NTC cells were designated as reference cells. The energy distance was then calculated for each perturbing sgRNA to the reference cells (from the same batch) following the procedure outlined in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Briefly, each perturbing sgRNA was first randomly downsampled to 25 cells. Then, top 2000 highly variable genes were computed and after transformation via log1p and scaling (zero-centering), the top 50 PCs were used as features for each cell. The energy distance was computed between each sgRNA and the reference cells. Additionally, the energy distance was computed between 10,000 random samples of 25 NTC cells (not in the reference cells) and reference cells to create a null distribution. Perturbing sgRNA not within the top quartile of NTC energy distances were filtered out. Next, for each batch, a One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was fitted to all NTC cells with a nu=0.75 (mimicking the same upper-quartile cutoff) to perform novelty detection on perturbed cells from the same batch (using again the top 50 PCs as features). Perturbed cells that were classified as NTC cells were filtered out, indicating cells that are potentially escaping perturbation or not perturbed to a sufficient magnitude.

Finally, we fit a logistic regression classifier (sklearn) using a 80/20 test/train split to the salient features, using as ground truth the known perturbation labels. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, the logistic regression classifier was first fit to the psuedobulked profiles of salient embeddings for each seen perturbation. Then, unseen perturbations were psuedobulked, fed into the ContrastiveVI model encoder, and decoded using the pretrained logistic regression classifier.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199901-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d116aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S35"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Adithya Vellal, Michael Tong, and Joseph Rainaldi for useful discussions and support throughout all stages of the study.
