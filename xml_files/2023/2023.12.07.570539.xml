The origin or precise sequence of events underlying pial collateral development is unclear and has prevented clinicians from adapting new vascularization and regeneration therapies. We use genetic lineage tracing and intra-vital imaging of mouse brains at cellular resolution to show that during embryogenesis, pial collateral arteries develop from extension and anastomoses of pre-existing artery tips, in a VegfR2 dependent manner. This process of artery tip extension occurs on pre-determined microvascular tracks.

In humans, the extent of pial collateral circulation is a predictor of stroke outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Stroke occurs when blood supply is obstructed to a part of the brain and is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide (World Health Organization).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Pial collaterals serve as an alternate route of blood flow and alleviate the symptoms of ischemic stroke by bypassing vascular occlusions. Thus, understanding mechanisms which drive the origin and remodelling of pial collateral arteries is of immense clinical relevance.</p><p id="P4">Results from preclinical studies indicate wide-spread variation in the pial collateral artery network among individuals and organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> These variations are a result of differential expression and function of proteins associated with Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) signalling axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Different mouse strains demonstrate differential Vegfa expression level which corelate with their pial collateral density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Similarly, global overexpression of Vegf ligand increases number of native pial collaterals and improve collateral perfusion post-injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> The receptor mediating the function of Vegf ligand during the formation of pial collaterals is Vegf receptor-2 (VegfR2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> A global knockdown of Vegf or VegfR2 during embryogenesis and in a time-frame when pial collaterals are expected to form, results in reduction in their number and diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Thus, Vegf is a key driver of pial collateral formation and a critical factor which regulates variation in extent of pial vascular network in mice.</p><p id="P5">The vital role of Vegf in murine pial collateral development was discovered almost a decade ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> However, it is still unclear how the various molecular players of Vegf pathway orchestrate the formation or remodelling of pial collateral network. In mice, it is hypothesized that an <italic>arteriole-specific sprouting angiogenesis like</italic> process leads to the formation of the foremost pial collaterals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> However, molecular evidence supporting the identity of these sprouting cells (if arteries or capillaries) is missing. Additionally, the cellular origin or fate of these sprouts is unknown. Finally, the possibility of cooperation from other vascular processes, such as arterialization, arteriogenesis or artery-reassembly, in building pial collaterals, needs to be thoroughly investigated.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we use genetic lineage tracing in conjunction with live imaging of pial vasculature of transgenic mouse embryos and adults to understand mechanisms by which Vegf regulates pial collateral development and maintenance. Our data indicate that the cellular source of pial collateral arteries is primarily pre-existing artery endothelial cells (ECs) which build the first network of pial collaterals at embryonic day (e)15.5 via VegfR2-dependent artery tip extension. The artery tips extend on pre-determined microvascular tracks which then connect and build pial collaterals. While arterial VegfR2 was essential for formation of pial collaterals <italic>de novo</italic>, it was dispensable for its pruning or maintenance through adulthood. Arterial Cxcr4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4), which is critical for coronary artery formation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> was dispensable during pial collateral formation and its maintenance. Together, our data indicate that artery endothelial cells build collateral arteries by utilizing distinct vascular mechanisms in heart and brain.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Pial collateral arteries form during embryogenesis</title><p id="P7">We developed a whole brain imaging technique to reliably visualize all pial arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and S1B</xref>). Due to lack of unique markers, accurately identifying pial collateral arteries is exclusively dependent on their location. Pial collateral arteries are artery segments which interconnect the ends of cerebral arteries and can be seen in the watershed region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). To acquire this spatial information, it was imperative to image the entire pial artery network. Our technique allowed us to precisely identify pial collateral arteries. We specifically focused on collateral arteries which connected and received blood flow from Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), as the coverage of this arterial network is most extensive.</p><p id="P8">We first investigated the developmental stage when pial collaterals first appeared. Mouse brains were harvested at different developmental time points and whole brain immunostaining was performed for Connexin-40 (Cx40) protein, a known marker for mature artery endothelial cell. Analyses of pial arterial network in both hemispheres revealed the appearance of MCA at embryonic day (e)12.5 followed by ACA at e13.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1C, S2A and S2B</xref>). At e14.5, both cerebral arteries were present with no arterial connections between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Subsequently, the first arterial anastomoses appeared at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>) which then remodelled to expand in number through birth/postnatal day (P)0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1C and S2D-S2F</xref>). This method confirmed that both MCA and ACA are present at e14.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>) and the foremost pial collaterals appear at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2H</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To confirm the above results, we next used a knock-in mouse line (<italic>Cx40<sup>eGFP/+</sup></italic>) where eGFP expression was driven by <italic>Cx40</italic> promoter activity. Brains from different developmental stages confirmed our findings from Cx40 immunostaining. MCA appeared at e12.5, ACA appeared at e14.5 and collateral arteries between MCA and ACA appear at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3A-S3F and S1C</xref>). eGFP<sup>+</sup> cerebral arteries (MCA and ACA) were formed by e14.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G</xref>) and the first eGFP<sup>+</sup> collateral artery between MCA and ACA appeared at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3H</xref>). Thus, using two independent methods— Cx40 immunostaining and detecting its reporter activity, we demonstrate that mouse pial collateral arteries form during development, and appear precisely at e15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Intra-vital imaging reveals arterial origin of pial collaterals by artery tip extension</title><p id="P10">Despite several hypotheses, there is lack of compelling data in support of vascular mechanisms which drive pial collateral development. Pial collaterals appear at late embryonic stages. At this developmental stage, rapid vascular changes make it difficult to distinguish collateral-specific events from overall vascular growth, thus making it challenging to draw information from fixed brain samples. Additionally, late embryonic stages cannot be cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> due to extremely demanding metabolic and physiological needs. Thus, we custom-developed an imaging paradigm to perform intra-vital imaging of pial layer at late embryonic stages (e16-e17) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1A</xref>), a developmental stage where the brain is actively building pial collaterals. Briefly, embryos of the desired developmental time points were dissected out (with their intact yolk sac) from the anesthetized pregnant dams while still connected to the mother via their umbilical cord. Embryos were maintained at 37˚C and immobilized at appropriate orientation to aid imaging. The embryos were subjected to stereoscopic or confocal imaging for several hours. This imaging set up allowed visualization of the entire hemisphere─ MCA, ACA, and connected collateral arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Pial collaterals appear only after the primary branches of MCA and ACA have developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). We hypothesized that the branches of these cerebral arteries contribute towards formation of pial collaterals. To test this hypothesis, <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup>; Tie2::eGFP::Claudin5</italic> mice were used to label artery ECs with TdTomato and all endothelial cells with eGFP. To activate TdTomato, Tamoxifen was administered at e13.5, when both MCA and ACA are present and would be labelled in 2 days, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> by e15.5. Imaging of endothelial cells derived from arteries was performed at e16-e17. This experimental strategy allowed visualization of cellular dynamics specific to artery cells derived from pre-existing arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1C</xref>) and excluded the possibility of capturing other vascular processes.</p><p id="P12">We performed intra-vital time-lapse imaging of pial arteries and investigated if pial collaterals originate from pre-existing artery endothelial cells. We focused on the watershed region: an initial artery-free region which spans the distal ends of both arterial trees (MCA and ACA) and is later occupied by pial collaterals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1C and 1D-1F</xref>). Stereoscopic images of e16.5 brains revealed that branches from MCA and ACA extend (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and anastomose to build collaterals in the pial watershed (brackets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, TdTomato expression in artery tips (orange arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and collaterals (green arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) increased over time. These changes were executed within a short span of 80 minutes, and could not have been captured in fixed brain samples.</p><p id="P13">We next investigated artery cell dynamics associated with the growth fronts of the two cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F and 1G</xref>). At e16.5, the distal branches of the developing MCA extended and anastomosed to build an artery network <italic>de novo</italic> (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is the first evidence demonstrating that pre-existing cerebral artery tips build pial collaterals. We then performed intra-vital time-lapse confocal imaging of brains at e16, a stage prior to when we observed collateral artery networks being built <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E and 1G</xref>). Confocal imaging at e16 provided the necessary cellular resolution to quantitatively assess artery-tip extensions from MCA and ACA branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H-1J</xref>). As expected, we clearly observed artery tip extension of MCA branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H and 1I</xref>) and the ACA branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H and 1J</xref>) within an hour. Additionally, we noted several artery-specific movements within the pial layer. This included the appearance of single recombined artery endothelial cells (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K and 1L</xref>), movement of these single recombined artery cells towards an artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K, 1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>), and emergence of arterial sprouts (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K, 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B-S4D</xref>). Together, we provide direct evidence for the vascular origin of pial collaterals─ pre-existing MCA/ACA artery tips extend and connect with each other to build pial collaterals <italic>de novo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Artery tip extension occurs on pre-determined microvascular tracks</title><p id="P14">We next investigated if other endothelial cell sub-types participate in, and/or facilitate, pial artery tip extensions during collateral development. To investigate the same, <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup>; Tie2::eGFP::Claudin5</italic> mouse line was used. <italic>Tie2::eGFP::Claudin5</italic> is a transgenic mouse strain which expresses a fusion protein of eGFP with Claudin5 (a tight junction protein present in all ECs in the central nervous system). This eGFP-Claudin5 protein expression is under the control of <italic>Tie2</italic> promoter/enhancer, making it visible in all endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Thus, in <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup>; Tie2::eGFP::Claudin5</italic> mice, TdTomato marked artery ECs while eGFP marked all ECs. Live imaging of pial watershed showed that all artery cell movements, almost always, occurred along microvascular (MV) tracks which appeared structurally more organized/tubular than the surrounding capillaries (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). These MV tracks were distinct from the surrounding capillary plexus in that they formed direct connections between two arteries, but were not necessarily entirely populated by TdTomato<sup>+</sup> artery derived endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, our data show that these MV tracks originated from Apj<sup>+</sup> capillary/venous endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6A-S6H</xref>), expressed microvascular marker Endomucin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6I-S6L</xref>) and lacked arterial marker Cx40 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6M-S6O</xref>). Together, our data provide support for the non-arterial nature of the MV tracks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6P</xref>), and hence, the intermixing of TdTomato<sup>+</sup> and TdTomato<sup>-</sup> cells, are not due to uneven Tamoxifen recombination of <italic>Cx40CreER</italic>. We hypothesized that development of MV tracks precedes artery tip extensions and tested two potential mechanisms by which MV tracks could assist artery tip extensions during pial collateral development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Firstly, complete formation of MV tracks between two arteries at e16 could be a pre-requisite for initiation of artery tip extension, as often observed at e16. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2Ci-iv</xref>). Alternatively, MV tracks could appear first, but continuously grow/remodel to allow artery tip extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2Ci, v, vi</xref>) and subsequent pial collateral formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Civ</xref>). If the former was true, the number/length of MV tracks in a given watershed would remain unchanged between e16 and e16.5, however the TdTomato coverage of these MV tracks would be higher at e16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2Cii-iii</xref>). If the latter mechanism was true, at e16.5, the length of MV tracks would be higher, and the TdTomato coverage of these MV tracks would increase or remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2Cv, vi</xref>). To test these two potential mechanisms, <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup>; Tie2::eGFP::Claudin5</italic> mouse line was used, where MV tracks can be clearly visualized with eGFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Confocal imaging of e16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) and e16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>) whole brains, at single cell resolution allowed examination of watershed regions at both developmental time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E-2H and 2K-2N</xref> respectively). Next, robust quantification of MV tracks for each watershed region was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H, 2N and 2J</xref>). Amongst eGFP<sup>+</sup> vessels, an MV track has a distinct morphology from the surrounding capillary plexus and can be identified as eGFP<sup>+</sup> tubular structures connecting the distal artery branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F and 2L</xref>). We identified an eGFP<sup>+</sup> vessel as a MV track if 1) it is a continuous tubular structure and 2) is connected to a TdTomato<sup>+</sup> artery at least at one end. These MV tracks were traced on multiple z-slices, using Simple Neurite Tracer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H and 2N</xref>), and next, the extent of TdTomato coverage was calculated for total length of MV tracks per watershed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H, 2N and 2O</xref>). Quantifications show that while the total length of MV tracks was increased by 1.5 fold in e16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H, 2N and 2J</xref>), the TdTomato coverage of these MV tracks did not change between e16 and e16.5 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H, 2N and 2O</xref>). These results support the second mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C-i→v→vi→iv</xref>); thus, suggesting that pial collateral development is accomplished by simultaneous growth of MV tracks and artery-tips on them.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Artery ECs are the major cellular contributors of pial collaterals during embryogenesis</title><p id="P15">We next assessed the vascular-lineage composition of pial collaterals at a later stage when the collateral artery network has fully formed. This would allow us to: 1) determine if the artery cell contribution to nascent pial collaterals observed at e16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) persisted in later stages and 2) check contribution from microvascular lineage which is evident in newly formed collaterals in heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Genetic lineage tracing with <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup></italic> and <italic>ApjCreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup></italic> mice were performed independently, where TdTomato expression could be conditionally induced, with Tamoxifen, specifically in artery Ecs or capillaries respectively. Tamoxifen was administered to timed pregnant dams at e14.5 when both MCA and ACA arteries are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2G and S3G</xref>). Embryos were analysed at e18.5 or P0 when the pial collateral artery network has completely formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2H and S3H</xref>). Whole embryonic brains were immunostained for Cx40 and segments of collateral arteries between MCA and ACA were analysed for lineage contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B-3J</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We assessed the extent of lineage contribution from artery or capillary ECs towards pial collaterals in two separate experiments. As expected, all pre-existing artery ECs were labelled and traced in <italic>Cx40CreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C, 3D, 3G and 3I</xref>). Whole brain imaging of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) allowed identification of pial collateral arteries present between MCA and ACA in the watershed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Individual collateral segments as identified by Cx40 immunostaining were analysed for presence of TdTomato<sup>+</sup> artery ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D, 3G and 3I</xref>). This analysis revealed that 77% of the Cx40<sup>+</sup> collateral area to be TdTomato<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast to this data, a similar analysis in an independent experiment with <italic>ApjCreER; Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E, 3F, 3H and 3J</xref>) showed only 31.6% of the collateral area to be TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, i.e. traced from capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, artery ECs are the major contributors of pial collateral arteries during development.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Arterial VegfR2 mediates artery tip extension and is essential for pial collateral artery development</title><p id="P17">We analysed similarities, if any, in the molecular programs used by artery endothelial cells during collateral development in the heart and brain. Post-injury, neonatal coronary artery ECs undergo extensive migration and proliferation to build new coronary collateral arteries in the watershed. The processes of artery cell migration and proliferation are heavily dependent on Cxcr4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and VegfR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> respectively. To assess the functions of Cxcr4 and VegfR2 in pial collateral development, we deleted the respective genes at e14.5 and assessed the extent of pial collateral network at e18.5/P0 by whole brain imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Surprisingly, deletion of arterial <italic>Cxcr4</italic> did not affect the pial collateral network at e18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7A and S7B</xref>) or in adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S7C-S7E</xref>). This data suggests that a Cxcr4-independent vascular mechanism facilitates pial collateral development and its maintenance.</p><p id="P18">We next assessed if pial collateral artery development is dependent on arterial VegfR2. Whole brain imaging of control and <italic>VegfR2</italic> artery specific knockout embryos showed differences in collateral connectivity in the watershed, and required systematic quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C-4F</xref>). The extensive connectivity of pial arteries across the hemisphere (including watershed) provides several possible collateral paths for the blood to flow. These artery-artery connections are innumerable. We developed a method that allowed us to compare the pial artery coverage between the control and <italic>VegfR2</italic> artery EC specific knockout brains quantitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Intensity line-profiles were generated across the width of the hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C i, ii</xref>). The identified peaks per line-profile was plotted across the width of the hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C iii</xref>). The data was fit to a Gaussian function and the fitted curves were used as representative of the arterial coverage per hemisphere in each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C iv</xref>). The average of the fitted curves represented one genotype (grey curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C iv</xref>). Quantification of pial artery coverage showed significantly different distributions between control and <italic>VegfR2</italic> knockout brains (KS test, D value=0.569, p value=2.2066 X 10<sup>-141</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Peak arterial coverage was observed at the centre of the hemisphere and watershed was defined as a region ± 500µm from the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Thirdly, by combining mouse genetics with whole brain confocal imaging at cellular resolution, we show that an angiogenic vascular receptor, VegfR2, facilitates artery-tip extension on microvascular tracks and aids origin of pial collaterals. Finally, we show that Cxcr4, a receptor essential for artery reassembly and formation of coronary collateral arteries <italic>de novo</italic>, is dispensable for development of pial collaterals.

Furthermore, in heart, coronary collateral formation is regulated by arterial Cxcr4 which drives artery cell migration during artery reassembly. In contrast, arterial Cxcr4 had no impact on pial collateral formation or its maintenance. Unlike heart, pial artery endothelial cells contribute minimally via proliferation. Evidence for negligible artery cell proliferation within the pre-existing pial arteries prompts us to hypothesize that formation of pial collaterals during embryogenesis is minimally dependent on proliferation of pre-existing artery ECs. That being said, the underlying mechanism leading to extension of distal artery tips remain unclear. It is possible that distal artery endothelial cells experience a forward push from the proximal segments of the artery. This forward pressure could be generated due to incorporation of new cells. Accommodating these additional cells within an artery would require further cellular organization throughout the length of the artery, and could lead to distal extension of the artery tips.

The dynamics of single artery cell movements could also establish the branching pattern of the pial artery network; the precise mechanisms for which are unknown.</p><p id="P31">We show that pre-existing artery tip extensions occur along a distinct supporting structure. In the heart, single artery endothelial cells migrate by hitch-hiking on to the capillary networks during the formation of new collaterals. On the contrary, our study in the embryonic brains reveals the presence of a unique (Tie2<sup>+</sup>) vascular segment on which the arteries extend. These microvascular tracks are distinct from the surrounding capillary mesh in that they anastomose ACA and MCA arterial branches but do not show any artery specification. We speculate that the microvascular tracks form during the specific time window (e16-e17) which coincides with the period when majority of collaterals appear. Thus, these tracks may play a crucial role in pial collateral formation. Based on our Apj lineage data, we hypothesize that the cellular origin of these microvascular tracks is of capillary in nature. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some tracks (guiding vessels for artery tip extensions) could also originate from mixed lineages. Thus, though capillaries do not massively contribute to the ECs of the pial collateral, they could create/remodel into MV tracks, to indirectly facilitate development of pial collaterals. Elucidating the underlying mechanism governing MV track formation is an exciting avenue for future investigation. Additionally, determining their precise molecular identity will allow creating genetic tools to assess if MV tracks are indispensable for development of pial collaterals.</p><p id="P32">Our data about pre-defined microvascular tracks guiding the growth of pial arteries suggest that the microvasculature could shape the artery network of the brain.

Mice were anesthetized under 2% Isoflurane (Abbott, North Chicago, IL, USA) and were placed on a stereotaxic mount (Item number 51547; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) with the skull held tightly using ear bars. The mice were kept anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane using a nose-cone. 5mg/kg Dexamethasone in 1X PBS was administered subcutaneously and the mice kept warm using a heating pad (TC1000, CWE). The eyes were covered with an eye ointment and the hair above the skull removed using a hair trimmer. The surgical area was thoroughly wiped clean with 70% ethanol. Sterile surgical tools were used for the surgery. A small incision was made using a scalpel blade and the exposed skin was removed. The connective tissue covering the skull in the exposed area was scraped off using scalpel blade and Q-tips. Using a high-speed electrical drill (burr of diameter ∼0.25mm), a window of ∼4mm diameter was carefully etched on the skull. The skull within the window was eventually detached from the rest of the skull after repeated drilling and was carefully lifted using a pair of fine forceps (Catalog number: 11255-20, Dumont #55) without damaging the dura. During the process of drilling, the skull was constantly irrigated with cortex buffer (Concentration; in mM: NaCl–125, KCl–5, glucose–10, HEPES–10, CaCl<sub>2</sub> –2 and MgCl<sup>2</sup> –2. pH set to 7.35).<sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sub> The exposed dura was aspirated with cortex buffer until there is no bleeding and the window looked clear. An optical plug made up of two 4 mm coverslip and one 5 mm coverslip (CS-5R &amp; CS-4R; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) glued together (with NOA 81, Norland Optical Adhesive) was placed on the exposed dura. The optical plug was gently pressed using a toothpick such that the 5mm cover slip was touching the skull bone and then cyano-acrylic glue was applied across the perimeter of the 5mm coverslip attaching it to the skull. At this stage we had an optical window of 4mm. An aluminium head bar with circular hole of 8mm was placed onto the skull aligned to the previously made optical window. Next, dental cement (Catalog number: 56877, 3M Relyx U200) was applied over the exposed skull using a sterile toothpick while being careful to not get it on the optical window. Once the dental cement was completely dry, the animal was placed on a warm pad in a clean recovery cage. Animals undergoing craniotomy were maintained on meloxicam (2 mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (5 mg/Kg body weight) for 3-4 days until full recovery. Mice were further allowed to recover for at least 2 weeks post-surgery before the start of any experiment.
