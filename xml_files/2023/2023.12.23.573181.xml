Stabilisation of PINK1 at the Translocase of Outer Membrane (TOM) complex of damaged mitochondria is a critical step for its activation. To date the mechanism of how PINK1 is activated in the TOM complex is unclear. Herein we report co-expression of human PINK1 and all seven TOM subunits in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is sufficient for PINK1 activation. We use this reconstitution system to systematically assess the role of each TOM subunit towards PINK1 activation. We unambiguously demonstrate that the TOM20 and TOM70 receptor subunits are required for optimal PINK1 activation and map their sites of interaction with PINK1 using AlphaFold structural modelling and mutagenesis. We also demonstrate an essential role of the pore-containing subunit TOM40 and its structurally associated subunits TOM7 and TOM22 for PINK1 activation. These molecular findings will aid in the development of small molecule activators of PINK1 as a therapeutic strategy for PD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Autosomal recessive mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the RING-IBR-RING (RBR) ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin are causal for early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Cell-based studies have demonstrated that these proteins function together in a common mitochondrial quality control pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Active PINK1 phosphorylates both Parkin and ubiquitin at an equivalent Serine65 (Ser65) residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], resulting in activation of Parkin via a feed-forward mechanism triggering ubiquitin-dependent elimination of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Active PINK1 also indirectly induces the phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases including Rab 8A at a highly conserved Serine residue (Ser111) that lies within the RabSF3 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. PINK1 encodes a 581 amino acid Ser/Thr protein kinase containing an N-terminal canonical mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (residues 1-34); catalytic kinase domain containing three unique loop insertions (residues 156-513); and N-terminal and C-terminal extensions (NTE, residues 111-132; CTE residues 514-581) that flank the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The majority of PD-associated mutations are located within the kinase domain highlighting the protective role of PINK1 kinase activity against the development of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Under basal conditions newly translated PINK1 protein is rapidly imported into mitochondria through the Translocase of Outer Membrane (TOM) complex whereupon it undergoes consecutive N-terminal cleavage by matrix MPP proteases and the inner mitochondrial membrane PARL protease followed by retro-translocation into the cytosol and degradation by the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Upon mitochondrial membrane depolarisation that can be induced by mitochondrial uncouplers, for example Antimycin A / Oligomycin, PINK1 import is blocked leading to the accumulation/stabilisation of full-length PINK1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] and catalytic activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Mitochondrial depolarisation promotes PINK1 stabilisation at the TOM complex that can be visualised by blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) as a ~700 kDa complex distinct from the native TOM complex that migrates as a ~500 kDa band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The TOM complex is composed of seven subunits, TOM 5, 6, 7, 20, 22, 40 and 70 and is highly conserved through evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. It has been best characterised in yeast for its role in the recognition of mitochondrial precursors synthesised in the cytosol, and their directed import through the pore-containing subunit TOM40 that spans the OMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Cryo-EM studies of yeast and the human TOM complex have revealed that they form dimeric structures requiring TOM22 binding to TOM40 to form the core complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. TOM70 and TOM20 are both loosely associated with the complex and have not been visualised in high resolution cryo-EM structures to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] although a low resolution 6.8 Å cryo-EM structure of the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> TOM complex has been reported with TOM20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Both TOM70 and TOM20 contain large hydrophilic domains that extend into the cytosol and act as receptors with overlapping preference for precursor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. The role of the smaller TOM subunits 5, 6, and 7 have been shown in yeast to be important for assembly of the core complex but their role in mammalian cells has been less well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Despite considerable research in the field, the mechanism of mammalian PINK1 activation at the TOM complex remains incompletely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In a genetic screen, it was discovered that the TOM7 subunit played an essential role for PINK1 stabilisation and activation at the OMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We and others recently found an intramolecular interaction between the PINK1 NTE and CTE regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and that this is required for stabilisation of human PINK1 to the TOM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and its subsequent activation by autophosphorylation at Ser228 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Numerous pathogenic PD mutations are located within the NTE:CTE interface that prevent human PINK1 recruitment to the TOM complex highlighting the importance of this activation mechanism to disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Due to the essential role of the TOM complex in mammalian cells, a systematic analysis of the contribution of TOM subunits for PINK1 activation has not been possible to date and furthermore, it has not been established whether the stabilisation of PINK1 to the TOM complex is necessary or sufficient for its activation. To dissect the molecular mechanisms of PINK1 stabilisation at the TOM complex, we have employed a reconstitution system in which genes encoding human PINK1 and the seven subunits of the human TOM complex have been introduced into the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> which do not express PINK1. Strikingly we observe that co-expression of wild-type human PINK1 and the seven TOM subunits is sufficient to reconstitute PINK1 activation and we have exploited this to assess the role of individual TOM subunits towards PINK1 activation. Combining the yeast reconstitution system with AlphaFold modelling and mutagenesis studies in mammalian cells, we propose the mechanism of how PINK1 is stabilised and activated at the TOM complex via interaction with the TOM20 and TOM70 subunits. This systematic analysis provides new fundamental insights into the regulation of human PINK1 that will aid in the development of small molecule activators of PINK1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Co-expression of PINK1 with TOM complex subunits is sufficient for its activation</title><p id="P7">We initially generated stable transformant strains of the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, expressing human wild-type or kinase-inactive (D384A) full length PINK1-3FLAG with or without all seven subunits of the human TOM complex (TOM70, residues 1-608; TOM40, residues 1-361; TOM22, residues 1-142; TOM20, residues 1-144; TOM7, residues 1-55; TOM6, residues 1-64; TOM5, residues 1-51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A-B</xref>). Following induction of protein expression with 2% galactose, PINK1 pathway activity was determined by immunoblotting of whole-cell yeast extracts for endogenous ubiquitin phosphorylation or human PINK1 Ser228 (trans)autophosphorylation. In the yeast strain expressing human PINK1 alone we did not observe significant activation of PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>) consistent with previous studies showing that recombinant human PINK1 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> or insect cells displays little catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] and that transiently transfected PINK1 alone in human cell lines exhibits low levels of activity under basal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Strikingly we observed that induced co-expression of wild-type human PINK1 together with all TOM complex subunits, led to robust increase in ubiquitin phosphorylation (pS65 Ub) and PINK1 Ser228 autophosphorylation (pS228 PINK1) associated with a significant increase in the levels of PINK1 protein compared to expression of PINK1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). This was not observed when kinase-inactive PINK1 was co-expressed with all TOM subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). We further confirmed this in 4 independent yeast strains expressing wild-type PINK1 with or without TOM complex components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A-B</xref>). This data suggests that PINK1 stabilisation at the TOM complex is sufficient for PINK1 activation. To validate the relevance of PINK1 activation in this reconstitution system, we next generated stable transformant yeast strains of PD-associated pathogenic mutations of PINK1 that have been previously characterised in mammalian cell-based assays following conditions of mitochondrial damage-induced membrane depolarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] including an NTE region mutant Q126P; ATP binding mutant E240K; Insertion 3 (Ins3) substrate binding mutant G309D; and a CTE region mutant 534_535InsQ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], we observed complete loss of phosphorylated ubiquitin in all mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A</xref>). Further we observed loss of Ser228 autophosphorylation except for the G309D mutant consistent with the impact of this mutant on substrate binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A</xref>). For all strains expressing wild-type or mutant PINK1-3FLAG, we observed two bands of PINK1 corresponding to full-length and N-terminal cleaved protein suggesting that recombinant PINK1 in this system is being targeted to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2 &amp; 3A</xref>). To confirm this, we performed live cell imaging studies of PINK1-GFP and this demonstrated co-localisation of PINK1 with the mitochondrial marker red CMXRos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis of mitochondrial fractions of yeast strains expressing PINK1-3FLAG and the TOM complex also revealed that PINK1 and all human TOM subunits tested were localised in the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Genetic determination of TOM subunits regulating PINK1 activation</title><p id="P8">We next undertook systematic genetic analysis of the role of the TOM complex on PINK1 activation by generating stable transformant strains missing each of the seven subunits of the TOM complex co-expressed with wild-type human full length PINK1-3FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis of PINK1 activation for all strains revealed that the removal of TOM5 or TOM6 subunits did not significantly impair PINK1 activation as assessed by ubiquitin phosphorylation and PINK1 Ser228 autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig, S4-S5</xref>). Consistent with the previous reports of Youle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], we observed that removal of TOM7 largely abolished PINK1 activation, and furthermore, had a similar impact to removal of TOM40 or TOM22, and these findings were confirmed in four independent yeast strains for each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig, S4-S5</xref>). The similarity of the defect of TOM7 to TOM22 is consistent with their critical roles in the assembly and maintenance of the core TOM40 pore-containing complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Interestingly we also observed a reduction in PINK1 activation following removal of the accessory receptor subunits TOM20 or TOM70 and the activation was further reduced in strains lacking both TOM20 and TOM70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig, S4-S5</xref>). Overall, our findings indicate TOM subunits can be stratified into three groups based on their effect on PINK1 activation in the reconstitution system: Group 1 (no effect): TOM 5, 6; Group 2 (essential for core complex assembly): TOM 7, 22, 40; and Group 3 (regulatory receptor binding role): TOM 20, 70.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural modelling predicts NTE:CTE interface of PINK1 binds TOM20</title><p id="P9">TOM20 and TOM70 are not visible on high resolution cryo-EM structures of the yeast and human TOM complex indicating that these subunits are likely to be highly dynamic within the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. To investigate how PINK1 stabilisation at the TOM complex is mediated by TOM20 and TOM70, we employed a locally installed ColabFold notebook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] to run AlphaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] structure predictions of the PINK1-TOM complex, imputing full-length human PINK1 and varying combinations of TOM subunit sequences in an iterative manner. AMBER structure relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] was used to ensure appropriate orientation of the side chains and to avoid steric clashes. We were unable to generate a high confidence model of PINK1 and all subunits of the TOM complex together, however, five high confidence models of a single molecule of PINK1, in complex with a TOM dimer containing TOM7, 20, 22, and 40 subunits, were generated based on inter-chain predicted alignment error (inter-PAE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary video</xref>). All models correctly predicted the structural interfaces of the core of the TOM complex formed by TOM40, TOM22 and TOM7 in line with existing cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

S6A-B</xref>). TOM20 is comprised of an N-terminal transmembrane domain anchoring it to the OMM and the C-terminal region (residues 50-145) that spans five α-helices (α1 - α5) exposed to the cytosol where it binds mitochondrial precursor proteins via their MTS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A</xref>). Several key conserved residues within the C-terminus of TOM20, namely Gln67, Glu78, Glu79, Phe70, Leu71, Ile74 and Val109, have been found to play a critical role in the recognition and binding of mitochondrial precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A-B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Inspection of the AlphaFold PINK1-TOM complex model revealed a major hydrophobic interface between the αK helix of the CTE region of PINK1 and the hydrophobic patch formed by TOM20 α1 and α3 helices comprising multiple highly conserved residues including Leu532, Leu539, and Leu540 of PINK1 CTE and Phe70, Leu71, Ile74, Leu81, Leu110, and Leu114 of TOM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A-E</xref>). Furthermore, the NTE of PINK1 formed polar interactions with TOM20 including between the conserved Lys135 residue of PINK1 NTE and Gln78 located at the periphery of the α1 helix of TOM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A-E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To investigate the functional impact of mutations of these residues, we generated yeast strains in which we expressed PINK1 CTE mutants, L532A, L539A, L540A and a combinatorial L532A/L539A/L540A triple mutant (CTE 3A) together with all TOM complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis of total PINK1 did not reveal any differences in PINK1 processing suggesting that these mutations do not impact on mitochondrial import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Single CTE mutants led to mild-to-moderate effects on PINK1 activation but strikingly PINK1 activation was completely abolished in the CTE 3A mutant and this was also associated with a reduction in PINK1 stabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, the AlphaFold model predicted electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions between the NTE region of PINK1 and TOM20 including a predicted salt bridge between the conserved Lys135 of PINK1 and Glu78 of TOM20 and also predicted hydrogen bonding between Gln67 of TOM20 and PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A-B</xref>). We initially generated a yeast strain in which we expressed the PINK1 NTE mutants, K135E and K135M mutants in complex with all intact TOM complex subunits and immunoblot analysis revealed reduction in ubiquitin phosphorylation consistent with reduced activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We next generated strains of wild-type PINK1 co-expressed with all TOM complex subunits but in which we expressed TOM20 mutants Q67E, E78Q or E78R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Immunoblot analysis revealed that these mutations in TOM20 led to reduced levels of ubiquitin phosphorylation to a similar degree as the minus TOM20 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Overall, these studies suggest that the PINK1 NTE:CTE interface promotes binding to TOM20.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Molecular basis of PINK1 interaction with TOM70</title><p id="P12">We further investigated how PINK1 activation is regulated by TOM70.

Three of the five models predicted a highly consistent binding interface between an N-terminal region of PINK1 (residues 71-106) and a region located within the CTD of TOM70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10A-B</xref>) with high PAE scores for interacting regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10A-B</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that PINK1 contains an internal MTS sequence in this region that acts redundantly with the canonical N-terminal MTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. The Hermann lab previously elaborated an algorithm to predict internal MTS-like signals for TOM70 in the mature region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. We imputed PINK1 into this algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://csb-imlp.bio.rptu.de">https://csb-imlp.bio.rptu.de</ext-link>) and this predicted several MTS-like regions of which the strongest peak mapped to the TOM70-binding region predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10C</xref>). This predicted interface represents an extensive binding surface with multiple contacts involving hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic surface mapping visualisation of TOM70 demonstrated that the CTD pocket was largely negatively charged and the corresponding N-terminal interacting surface region of PINK1 was positively charged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10D</xref>). Furthermore, a series of conserved positively charged residues in PINK1 (Arg 83, Arg88, and Arg 98) are predicted to form salt bridges with a series of conserved negatively charged residues within TOM70 (Asp488, Asp545, Glu549 and Asp229 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). To test the predicted mode of binding model, we generated yeast strains expressing PINK1 mutations in the TOM70 interface (R83A/R88A/R98A triple mutant; R83E/R88E/R98E triple mutant). We observed that the combined triple mutation largely abolished ubiquitin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We next generated strains expressing TOM70 mutations within the PINK1-TOM70 binding interface namely D488A, D545A, and E549A and all of these substantively lowered ubiquitin phosphorylation to a similar degree as the minus TOM70 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Overall, our data indicate that TOM70 is also required for optimal stabilisation and activation of PINK1 at the TOM complex via an internal MTS-like region that we define as the TOM70 interacting region (TIR).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Validation of predicted PINK1-TOM interactions in mammalian cells</title><p id="P13">To validate the PINK1-TOM20 predicted interaction in a mammalian cell system, we generated stable cell lines in which we re-introduced full-length wild-type PINK1-3FLAG (WT); kinase-inactive mutant PINK1 (KI); CTE PINK1 mutants namely L532A, L539A, L540A and a combined CTE 3A mutant into Flp-In T-REx HeLa PINK1-knockout cells (generated by exon 2-targeted CRISPR-Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].

Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts revealed that CTE single point mutants led to a slight reduction of phosphorylated ubiquitin upon mitochondrial depolarization of which L540A had a more noticeable effect, however, consistent with the analysis in yeast, phosphorylated ubiquitin, was completely abolished in the CTE 3A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). We next investigated the PINK1-TOM70 interaction and generated stable cell lines in which we re-introduced PINK1 TIR mutants namely R83A, R88A, R98A and combined R83A/R88A/R98A or R83E/R88E/R98E triple mutants into Flp-In T-REx HeLa PINK1-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-E</xref>).

These data indicate that the PINK1:TOM interfaces identified in our yeast system are also functionally relevant in mammalian cells.</p><p id="P14">We further investigated the role of TOM20 and TOM70 in stabilising PINK1 at the TOM complex of mammalian cells.

Immunoblotting analysis of these complexes indicated that TOM20, and TOM40 were present in the native ~500 kDa TOM complex and the ~700kDa PINK1- TOM complex whereas TOM70 was not detectable in either of the complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

PINK1 resided in two HMW complexes namely the ~700kDa PINK1-TOM complex and a complex of intermediate size between the ~500 kDa and ~700kDa complexes as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We next performed BN-PAGE analysis on stable cell lines in which we re-introduced full-length wild-type PINK1-3FLAG (WT); kinase-inactive mutant PINK1 (KI); a combined CTE L532A/L539A/L540A mutant (TOM20-binding deficient); and a combined TIR R83E/R88E/R98E mutant (TOM70-binding deficient) into Flp-In T-REx HeLa PINK1-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Strikingly immunoblotting analysis with anti-TOM40 antibodies demonstrated that both the CTE L532A/L539A/L540A and TIR R83E/R88E/R98E triple mutants prevented the formation of the ~700kDa PINK1-TOM complex and this was also confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-PINK1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Overall, these studies demonstrate that PINK1 recruitment, stabilisation, and activation at the TOM complex requires interaction with TOM20 and TOM70 in mammalian cells and supports our findings from the yeast reconstitution system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Our yeast reconstitution system enables genetic dissection of the contribution of human TOM complex subunits towards human PINK1 activation.

Previous analysis of the PINK1 MTS sequence (aa 1-34) showed that it is sufficient for mitochondrial targeting to the matrix in polarised mitochondria of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Following mitochondrial depolarisation, the stabilisation of PINK1 at the TOM complex is distinct compared to other MTS-containing mitochondrial proteins which are generally released into the cytosol and not stabilised at the TOM complex. A role for TOM20 in PINK1 stabilisation upon mitochondrial depolarisation was first reported using cross-linking/immunoprecipitation studies of PINK1 under denaturing conditions and showing that only TOM20 could be co-isolated with PINK1 under these conditions suggesting a direct interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. However, the mechanism remained elusive since full-length PINK1 lacking the MTS could still be imported to mitochondria and stabilised and activated on depolarised mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. We and others recently defined the NTE:CTE interface as being critical for PINK1 recruitment to the TOM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and our new findings support a model whereby the NTE:CTE interface of active PINK1 binds to the C-terminal cytosolic domain of TOM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7</xref>). The cytosolic domain of TOM20 has previously been shown to have a diverse selectivity for client mitochondrial proteins mediated by a hydrophobic MTS sequence motif that is extremely broad (φχχφφ; φ is hydrophobic acid and χ is any other amino acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Structural studies have mapped the TOM20 peptide binding site to a hydrophobic pocket within its cytosolic domain (e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]). Similar to MTS presequences, the binding of PINK1 CTE to TOM20 is majorly directed by hydrophobic leucine residues although the sequence of the PINK1 hydrophobic patch (aa 532 – LQQSAATLL – aa 540) displays notable differences from the general MTS sequence motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7E</xref>). A further notable difference is that polar interactions between TOM20 and PINK1 are directed by residues located within the distinct NTE α-helix whereas these typically occur at the periphery of MTS presequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Overall the interaction between PINK1 and TOM20 that we have identified further expands the diversity of TOM20 client interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In future work it will be interesting to understand how TOM20 switches from binding the PINK1 MTS under polarised mitochondria conditions to the NTE:CTE interface in depolarised mitochondria. This is likely to be due to the flexibility of the cytosolic domain of TOM20 which renders it highly dynamic and accounts for it not being visible on previous high resolution cryo-EM structures of the TOM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Recently, low-resolution cryo-EM structures of the TOM complex in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> have revealed multiple sub-complexes containing TOM20, TOM22 and TOM40 in differing stoichiometries including one TOM20 in a dimeric TOM40 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. This suggests that TOM20 is able to adopt myriad conformations and interactions within the overall complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. AlphaFold modelling predicted an asymmetric PINK1-TOM complex with 1 molecule of PINK1 bound to 1 molecule of TOM20 within a dimeric TOM40 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), however, in view of the flexibility of TOM20 we cannot rule out additional subcomplexes of PINK1 and TOM20 with the rest of the TOM components with varying stoichiometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> structure revealed a strong interaction of the acidic patch of the N terminus of TOM22 with a positively charged patch in cytosolic TOM20 helix suggesting that TOM20 requires to dock with TOM22 for optimal receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], which was also not observed in the AlphaFold model.</p><p id="P18">A previous study of PINK1 had mapped an outer mitochondrial localisation signal (OMS) (residues 70 – 94) at its N-terminus located between the MTS and transmembrane domain (TMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. This region is dispensable for mitochondrial import but is required for PINK1 stabilisation and activation at the TOM complex on depolarised mitochondria in a TOM40 dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. TOM70 has been reported to recognise internal signals in hydrophobic regions and consistent with this was shown to be required for PINK1 import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] however, a role for TOM70 in PINK1 activation in depolarised mitochondria was lacking since BN-PAGE studies reported that TOM70 was not detectable in the ~700 kDa PINK1-TOM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. It was recently reported that TOM70 acts as the major receptor for PINK1 import and stabilisation in depolarised mitochondria based on siRNA knockdown studies of TOM subunits in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Our genetic dissection of TOM subunits in the reconstitution assay provides a clearcut role of TOM70 for PINK1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and we have mapped a TOM70 interaction region (TIR) that contains overlapping residues with the previously elaborated OMS region. AlphaFold modelling predicted binding of the N-terminal region of PINK1 to the C-terminal cytosolic domain of TOM70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results contrast with a previous study that employed peptide mapping studies to define the TOM70 binding site on PINK1 and suggested that TOM70 can interact with the N-terminal MTS, OMS or TMD regions with equivalent affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. To date there is no experimental structure of mammalian TOM70 but crystal structures of yeast TOM70 revealed it contains 26 a-helices that are involved in the formation of 11 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. The N-terminal domain functions to bind chaperones including Hsp90 in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Binding sites for selected mitochondrial preproteins have been mapped to the C-terminus (α-helices 8-26) although to date a general receptor site/motif has yet to be defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. The crystal structure of yeast TOM70 has revealed a highly conserved groove located in the centre of the C-terminal domain which has been attributed to be the major binding site for mitochondrial preproteins (TPR 4-11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. The distal side of the binding groove is made of hydrophobic and polar residues whereas the proximal side contains three highly conserved negatively charged residues Glu473, Glu542 and Glu577 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. AlphaFold modelling suggests PINK1 forms specific interactions with the proximal residues and also has interactions with the distal side that may aid in interaction by acting as docking site as it has been suggested for other preproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Previous studies have mapped numerous Parkin-mediated ubiquitylation sites in the TOM70 C-terminus (K473, K504, K539, K573 and K607) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>], however, these are located on the outside of the C-terminus and not likely to affect the binding surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Similarly regulatory phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus of TOM70 have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] it will be interesting to assess the role of these modifications as well as chaperone binding to the N-terminus on the interaction between PINK1 and TOM70 under depolarised mitochondrial conditions.</p><p id="P19">In contrast to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], our studies unambiguously show that both TOM70 and TOM20 are important for PINK1 stabilisation and activation at the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). AlphaFold was unable to predict a high confidence model with both TOM70 and TOM20 in the PINK1-TOM complex suggesting that PINK1 interactions with these subunits is likely to be dynamic and this is compounded by dynamic interactions of the cytosolic domains of TOM20 and TOM70 with other subunits of the TOM complex if bound to PINK1 simultaneously. We propose a model that PINK1 is engaged by both TOM20 and TOM70 for recruitment and stabilisation at the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig, 7A</xref>), however, we cannot exclude that the association of PINK1 with TOM70 and TOM20 subunits occurs in a sequential manner and since TOM70 is not detectable in the PINK1-TOM complex on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11D</xref>), suggesting that it may bind to PINK1 earlier to direct it to the TOM20 subunit and core complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Our reconstitution analysis confirms the essential role of the TOM7 subunit for PINK1 activation as first revealed by the Youle lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. AlphaFold modelling did not predict a direct interaction between TOM7 and PINK1 and instead was in line with previous Cryo-EM analysis showing that the three small TOM subunits, 5, 6 and 7 are peripherally bound to TOM40 via distinct interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. We did not observe much effect of loss of TOM5 or TOM6 on activation whereas loss of TOM7 largely abolished PINK1 activation akin to loss of TOM22 that is critical for stabilising the TOM40 dimeric pore structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Whilst the role of the small TOMs in the mammalian TOM complex are still to be fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], our findings are in keeping with previous analysis that have shown a critical role for TOM7 (but not TOM5 and 6) in maintaining stability of the mammalian TOM40 core complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P21">An unexpected and striking finding from our studies was that co-expression of human PINK1 with TOM subunits was sufficient for its activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). Over the past decade, PINK1 activation has mainly been studied in the context of mitophagic signalling following mitochondrial depolarisation, induced by mitochondrial uncouplers (e.g. AO or CCCP), or mitochondrial matrix misfolding stress, triggered by matrix Hsp90 inhibitors or over-expression of the deletion mutant of OTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Since all lead to PINK1 activation, our reconstitution results suggest that in the context of mitochondrial damage, the key event for PINK1 activation is its stabilisation at the TOM complex. Previous studies have shown weak activation of PINK1 when it is transiently over-expressed in mammalian cells without any mitochondrial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and we speculate the low activity is due to the substoichiometric levels of the TOMs compared to over-expressed PINK1. Thus, it would be interesting to assess whether this activity is increased if PINK1 is co-transfected with exogenous human TOM subunits. Similarly we detected weak activation of full-length human PINK1 when expressed alone in yeast or in yeast strains in which human TOM20 or TOM70 were mutated to prevent PINK1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) and this may be due to interaction with the yeast TOM20 and/or TOM70 since the PINK1 interaction sites are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">fig. 7B</xref> &amp; fig. 9B). Previous studies have reported that recombinant expression of catalytic domain-containing fragments of human PINK1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> or insect cells display no significant catalytic activity associated with low expression yields and unstable protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In contrast, recombinantly expressed catalytic domain-containing fragments of insect orthologues of PINK1 (e.g. Pediculus humanus corporis) are active with high expression yields of monodisperse protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In our hands we have been unable to identify any N-terminal or C-terminal truncated His-tagged human PINK1 constructs, out of &gt;30 tested, that when expressed in insect cells lead to high yields of soluble human PINK1 as detected by colloidal Coomassie gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

S12A-B</xref>), did not lead to enhanced expression of soluble protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S12D</xref>). Collectively our findings would suggest that recombinant co-expression of TOM subunits with human PINK1 in insect cells is needed to generate high yields of stable PINK1 and reconstitute PINK1 activation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P22">In future work, experimental structural data is required to better understand PINK1 regulation within the TOM complex which, although challenging due to transient association of TOM20 and TOM70 as well as PINK1, may provide additional molecular insights into PINK1 activation including dimerization which was recently shown for insect PINK1 and how this mediates Ser228 transphosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In addition to Ser228, we recently identified Ser167 autophosphorylation as being important for activation of human PINK1 which is not conserved in insect PINK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>].

After the beads settle, 100 μl of the supernatant was collected into a fresh microfuge tube. An additional 200 μl of 5% TCA was added to the beads and vortexed for a further 35 sec, and 150 μl of the supernatant was also collected after allowing the beads settle and added to the previous supernatant collection. The supernatant was centrifugated at maximum speed at 4°C in a microfuge to collect the precipitated protein, which was then resuspended in 200 μl of 25 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP pH 7.5 containing protease inhibitor cocktail.

(2009). In brief, a 2L culture of yeast cells carrying wildtype PINK1 alone or wildtype PINK1/KI with all TOMs was cultured, and expression was induced as described. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000xg for 10 minutes at room temperature. The resulting pellet was washed twice with 1.2 M Sorbitol and resuspended in DTT buffer (100 mM Tris-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> pH 9.4, 10 mM DTT) at a ratio of 2 ml of buffer per gram of cells. The suspension was gently rotated at 70rpm at 30°C for 30 minutes. After a subsequent centrifugation and resuspension in Zymolase buffer (20 mM K3PO4 pH 7.4, 1.2M sorbitol), the cells were treated with Zymolase powder (1 mg/gm of wet cells) and rotated gently at 70rpm for 60 minutes at 30°C. The resulting spheroplasts were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000g at 4°C. Maintaining a cool temperature, the spheroplast was then resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.6M sorbitol, 1mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA) and transferred into a pre-cooled ice glass homogenizer. Using a tight pestle, homogenization was performed with 15 strokes. Following homogenization, differential centrifugation steps at 2000×g and 3000×g were performed to discard cell debris. The isolated mitochondria were then centrifuged at 15,000×g, and to enhance purity, the mitochondria were resuspended in SEM buffer (10 mM MOPs/KOH pH7.2 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA buffer) and subjected to another centrifugation step. The final mitochondria were resuspended in SEM buffer, and their protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml using a Bradford protein assay.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>AlphaFold modelling</title><p id="P30">To gain insight into how PINK1 might interact with the TOM complex, or how PINK1 might interact with TOM70, AlphaFold prediction tool was deployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>].

HeLa Flp-In TREx cells were cultured using DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) supplemented with 10% FBS (foetal bovine serum), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1x Pen/Strep, and 15 μg/ml blasticidin. Culture media was further supplemented with 100 μg/ml zeocin pre-recombination with PINK1-3FLAG constructs. Transfections were performed using the polyethylenimine method. To ensure uniform expression of recombinant proteins, stable cell lines were generated in a doxycycline-inducible manner. HeLa Flp-In TREx CRISPR-mediated PINK1 knockout cells were generated. The PINK1 null host cells containing integrated FRT recombination site sequences and Tet repressor were co-transfected with 4.5/9 μg of pOG44 plasmid (which constitutively expresses the Flp recombinase) and 0.5/1 μg of pcDNA5-FRT/TO vector containing a hygromycin resistance gene for selection of the gene of interest with FLAG tag under the control of a doxycycline-regulated promoter. Cells were selected for hygromycin and blasticidin resistance 3 days after transfection by adding fresh medium supplemented with 15 μg ml−1 of blasticidin and 100 μg ml−1 of hygromycin. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 hours. Mitochondrial depolarisation was induced by treatment with 10 μM AntimycinA and 1 μM Oligomycin (Sigma; prepared in DMSO) for 3 hrs. Cells were harvested and resuspended in mitochondrial fractionation buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 200 mM chloracetamide). Cell suspensions were physically disrupted by 25 passes through a 25-gauge needle, and debris removed by centrifugation at 800 x g.
