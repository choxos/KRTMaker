Here, we report the discovery of a new molecule with antiviral properties that we named virapinib, which limits viral entry by macropinocytosis. The identification of virapinib derives from a chemical screen using High-Throughput Microscopy, where we identified new chemical entities capable of preventing infection with a pseudotype virus expressing the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent experiments confirmed the capacity of virapinib to inhibit infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as by additional viruses, such as Monkeypox virus and TBEV. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the compound inhibited macropinocytosis, limiting this entry route for the viruses. Importantly, virapinib has no significant toxicity to host cells. In summary, we present a new molecule that inhibits viral entry via the endocytic route, offering a new alternative to prevent viral infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antivirals</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd><kwd>chemical screen</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>mpox virus</kwd><kwd>Tick borne encephalitis virus</kwd><kwd>pseudotype virus</kwd><kwd>macropinocytosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since its onset in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused close to 7 million deaths across all continents and has led to major disturbances in the world economy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). The disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> genus of the <italic>coronavirus</italic> family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Several human coronaviruses are endemic and normally cause mild respiratory infections. However a few such as MERS-CoV (Middle east respiratory syndrome virus), SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause an acute respiratory syndrome with severe lung injuries and inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 surface is covered with the eponymous ‘crown’ formed by the Spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to the host-cell receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Due to its profound impact, there has been a global effort to develop therapies to protect against Covid-19, which to a large extent was made possible by RNA-based vaccines. In addition, counteracting the cytokine storm with the steroid dexamethasone has proven a successful strategy to reduce Covid-19-related deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, and despite intensive work, the development of antivirals that limit the infection step or that target SARS-CoV-2 has had more limited success. To date, only two drugs targeting the virus have received medical approval: paxlovid (targeting the viral protease) and remdesivir (targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although numerous drug-repurposing approaches have been reported, none have reached clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">An alternative to target the virus is to target its host cells, which is argued to be less susceptible to resistance mechanisms and potentially serve as a strategy to prevent infection by multiple viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Successful examples of this approach include CCR5 antagonists for HIV and interferon for hepatitis B or C (HCV and HBV) viruses. To date, no host-targeting antiviral agents have been approved against SARS-CoV-2. By conducting a phenotypic chemical screen using pseudotype viruses expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, we here report the identification of a new chemical entity that limits viral entry by endocytic pathways for several viruses including SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A pseudovirus-based screening assay for SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P5">To identify small molecules that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry, we used lentiviral pseudotyped viruses that expressed a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) as well as a Flag-tagged S protein from SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The S protein lacked the last 19 aminoacids, which was shown to facilitate membrane incorporation by deleting an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. S-enveloped pseudoviral particles (PV<sup>S</sup>) were produced in HEK 293T cells, as confirmed by western blot (WB) analysis of supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To facilitate infection by PV<sup>s</sup>, we generated a clone of HEK 293T cells expressing the ACE2 receptor (293T<sup>ACE2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Quantification of infection rates by high-throughput microscopy indicated that 1.91% of 293T<sup>ACE2</sup> cells were successfully infected with the PV<sup>S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). Furthermore, the number of infected cells was reduced approximately 8-fold by treatment with E-64d, a Cathepsin inhibitor that inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 and S-enveloped pseudoviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Subsequent repeats of the experiment confirmed its reproducibility, and the assay window was sufficient to conduct chemical screening.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of small molecules that inhibit infection by PV<sup>S</sup></title><p id="P6">Having established the assay, we next performed a chemical screen to identify novel chemical entities that limit infection by PV<sup>S</sup>. As a screening library, we used a set of 1,008 molecules predicted to have properties that could impair protein-protein interactions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). The choice was made on the basis that SARS-CoV-2 entry is facilitated by protein-protein interactions and to discover new chemistry beyond molecules that are already being investigated as antivirals. In the screening pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), 293T<sup>ACE2</sup> cells seeded in 384-well plates were first treated with the compounds from the chemical library (25 μM) for 6 h, followed by the addition of PV<sup>S</sup> and a subsequent 72 h incubation to allow for EGFP expression. After fixation, DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 and cells imaged using Hight-Throughput Microscopy (HTM). Infection rates were calculated as the ratio of EGFP-positive cells to the total number of nuclei per well, and all data were normalized to the infection rates observed in wells treated with DMSO (negative control). The raw infection rate across all plates was 3.11% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Treatment with E-64d led to an approximately 10-fold decrease in the infection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), providing a Z’ factor of 0.39 for the screen. For hit calling, we selected two criteria: hit compounds had to decrease the infection rate below 20% and show minimal toxicity to host cells. Three compounds met these criteria, and their effects were confirmed by individual inspection of the images of each well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To validate our screening data, we re-tested the three compounds in 293T<sup>ACE2</sup> cells using the same assay in a dose-response experiment. Although all compounds decreased infection rates, only two (C-1 and C-2; structures provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) showed a dose-dependent effect at the tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, none of the compounds prevented infection with a pseudotype virus expressing the envelope glycoprotein (G) from Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSVg), thereby discarding a general effect on host cells or on infection with lentiviral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that the compounds did not lower the expression of ACE2 in 293T<sup>ACE2</sup> cells, nor did they affect EGFP expression in an independent cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). Although both C-1 and C-2 showed interesting properties in these PV models, the chemical properties of C-2 hampered further development of this chemical series. Therefore, we selected C-1, which we named virapinib, for the rest of the study.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Virapinib prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="P8">Next, we tested if virapinib could limit infection with the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. To focus on the infection step, cells were treated with the compound for 6 h before addition of the virus. After washing off the virus, cells were incubated for 24 h, followed by HTM-dependent quantification of the expression of the N protein from SARS-CoV-2. Using this setup, we first tested the efficacy of virapinib against the ancestral strain of the virus in monkey Vero E6 cells, which are kidney cells from African green monkey origin that have been widely used as host cells for testing viral infections. Consistent with previous studies, Vero E6 cells were efficiently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), and infection was nearly completely abrogated by E-64d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In agreement with our results with PV<sup>s</sup>, virapinib presented a dose-dependent effect in limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells and had no detectable toxic or cytostatic effects in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Interestingly, while infection rates were reduced by the compound, infection was limited to a few cell clusters where the levels of N-protein were higher than those in control infections, an observation that is also seen with E-64d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We then aimed to validate these findings in a human cell line. To this end, we generated a lung carcinoma cell line (A549) with constitutive ACE2 overexpression (A549<sup>ACE2</sup>). Once again, virapinib presented a dose-dependent effect in inhibiting the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and no detectable toxicity in A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>). Furthermore, the compound reduced the incidence of multinucleated syncytia in A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>), which has been previously documented as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the interaction of membrane-present S protein with ACE2 of neighboring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">After confirming the efficacy of virapinib against the ancestral strain, we tested the effects of the compound against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Since its emergence, SARS-Cov-2 has been constantly mutating, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified several of these mutants as Variants of Concern (VOC), the most notable being Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron sub-lineages (e.g. BA.1). Importantly, virapinib showed anti-infective activity against all variants in both Vero E6 and A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells, and the concentration of the compound needed to limit infection was correlated with the infectivity of each VOC (higher concentrations for the most infective strains) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Finally, we tested the efficacy of virapinib in a well-established liver spheroid model of extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The model is extensively characterized and previously contributed to the identification of the antiviral activity of the JAK/STAT inhibitor baricitinib <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, which facilitated its rapid clinical translation and remains only one of four compounds endorsed by the WHO for severe Covid-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Notably, virapinib efficiently reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), to a similar extent as remdesivir, a nucleoside analog that inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Virapinib limits viral entry by inhibiting macropinocytosis</title><p id="P12">Having confirmed that virapinib can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in several <italic>in vitro</italic> models, we next investigated its mechanism of action. Given that our screening assay was based on PV<sup>s</sup> expressing the S protein and host cells expressing ACE2, we tested whether the compound affected these factors or their interaction. The compound did not affect the cellular distribution of ACE2 or the proteolytic processing of S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A, B</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to nanobodies targeting the S protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, the binding between recombinant S and ACE2 was not affected by virapinib, as measured by biolayer interferometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells, which was efficiently inhibited by remdesivir, was not affected by virapinib, suggesting that the mechanism of action of the compounds is related to viral entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 10 μM virapinib for 6 h and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of note, the choice of the cell line, dose and times of treatment was done to be able to compare these data against the drug-associated transcriptional signatures existing at the Connectivity Map (CMap) database, which can provide hypothesis on the mechanism of action of a given drug on the basis of similarities between its transcriptional signature to that of other drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Strikingly, most genes whose expression was significantly upregulated by virapinib were related to sterol biosynthesis, such as HMG-CoA synthetase and reductase (HMGCS and HMGCR), and the mevalonate kinase (MVK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Accordingly, pathway enrichment analyses revealed “steroid biosynthesis” as the most significantly induced by virapinib, suggesting that the compound had an impact on membrane biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). RNA-seq data were validated by subsequent experiments, where we confirmed that virapinib treatment increased the levels of <italic>HMGCR, HMGCS</italic>, and <italic>MVK</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>). As a control, we used methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which stimulates sterol biosynthesis by depleting cholesterol. Interestingly, however, virapinib did not affect cholesterol levels or its distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D,E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In parallel to our RNA-seq experiments, we conducted immunofluorescence analyses of SARS-CoV-2 N protein at different timepoints post infection to evaluate how virapinib prevented viral infection. In control (DMSO) A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells, the staining pattern showed a clear development from small puncta at the periphery of the cell (1-2 h post infection (h.p.i.)), through a clear dissemination within the cell and the signal intensity increase at 4 h.p.i., to a pan-cytoplasmic staining at 6 h.p.i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, cells treated with virapinib showed a clear lag in the development of this pattern, indicating that either entry or trafficking of the virus was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Quantification of this phenomenon by machine learning-based object classification confirmed our qualitative microscopic observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Given that our transcriptomic analyses indicated that the effect of virapinib could be related to viral entry and lipid metabolism, we next analyzed the effect of the compound by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particularly focusing on membrane dynamics, in A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this experimental setup, viral particles infected host cells through two distinct entry routes: endocytosis of individual viruses or bulk entry by macropinocytosis, a known mechanism of viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, whereby numerous virus particles are engulfed together with extracellular material into irregularly shaped large vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Importantly, macropinocytosis was by large the predominant mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of TEM images indicated that virapinib selectively inhibited the macropinocytic route, while not having a detectable impact on single-particle entry, the cell membrane or the integrity of intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). To directly test the effect of virapinib on macropinocytosis, we took advantage of an established assay based on the uptake of a fluorescent high-molecular-weight dextran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which revealed that virapinib limited dextran uptake in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Together, these experiments show that virapinib inhibits macropinocytosis, which is a major mechanism of SARS-Cov-2 entry into host cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Virapinib inhibits infection by Monkeypox, TBEV and Ebola viruses</title><p id="P16">Given that macropinocytosis has been reported to be the preferred mode of entry for many viruses, we finally explored whether virapinib could have broader antiviral activity. To do this, we tested its effect on the infection with the following viruses: Andes virus (ANDV; <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> family; enveloped; ssRNA), Dengue virus (DENV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family; enveloped; ssRNA), Monkeypox (MPXV; <italic>Poxviridae</italic> family; enveloped; dsDNA), Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family; enveloped; ssRNA), a EGFP-expressing adenovirus (<italic>Adenoviridae</italic> family, non-enveloped, dsDNA) and a VSV pseudotyped lentivirus expressing the envelope glycoprotein from Ebola virus. Virapinib showed dose-dependent antiviral activity against TBEV, Monkeypox virus, and Ebola-pseudotyped VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). We did not observe any decrease in the infection rate of ANDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>) and only a small effect on adenoviral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent increase in the infection rate with DENV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>), potentially reflecting that the inhibition of macropinocytosis could enhance other endocytic routes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a world-wide initiative to find strategies that could limit the spread and severity of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To a large extent, this was achieved by a combination of collective vaccination and the use of anti-inflammatory treatments to treat the fatal cytokine storm triggered by the disease. In contrast, and despite intense research, the development of antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 has had more limited success. Noteworthy, much of the work was placed on drug-repurposing campaigns, with the hope to have treatments that could reach patients as early as possible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, and despite all the effort, only three drugs have received approval for their medical use (paxlovid, remdesivir and molnupiravir). Furthermore, all of these approaches target viral proteins, and no host-targeting antiviral has been approved for the treatment of Covid-19.</p><p id="P18">The difficulty of antiviral development is not limited to SARS-CoV-2 and, currently, only a fraction of pathogenic human viruses can be treated with antiviral drugs. This is partly due to the high demands for safety to work with human pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which to some extent is overcomed by the use of non-replicating pseudotype viruses. This approach models the initial infection step of live viruses, and was used as a platform on a drug-repurposing screen for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Given the strong focus on repurposing by many other laboratories, we decided to explore another chemical space hoping to find new chemical entities showing anti-infection properties. The discovery of virapinib further validates the usefulness of this approach as a discovery platform for antivirals that limit the entry step. Our subsequent experiments revealed that the drug specifically limited SARS-CoV-2 entry by macropinocytosis. Of note, published studies had reported conflicting views about SARS-CoV-2 mode of entry, with some reporting clathrin-dependent endocytosis as the preferred route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> while others implicating macropinocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our TEM analysis was clarifying in this regard, illustrating how SARS-CoV-2 can simultaneously use both entry pathways, yet only macropinocytosis is inhibited by virapinib.</p><p id="P19">As to how virapinib regulates macropinocytosis, this remains to be fully understood. It is remarkable that our transcriptomic analyses revealed that the compound triggered very subtle changes on gene expression, consistent with the fact that the compound did not have any obvious phenotypic impact on host cells. Furthermore, the observation that the few genes which expression was altered by virapinib were mostly related to steroid biosynthesis suggests that the compound might affect interactions happening at the lipid bilayer membrane. Along these lines, many studies have implicated cholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Accordingly, decreasing cholesterol with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin inhibits infection with SARS-CoV-2, while supplementation with exogenous cholesterol potentiates the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Since virapinib does not affect cholesterol levels or distribution, we suggest that it might integrate at membranes and disrupt their physical properties limiting the formation of processes like membrane ruffling, which are necessary for macropinocytosis. Our TEM images provide indications that this is the case. Further supporting this hypothesis, the chemical structure of virapinib contains a fatty-acid-like moiety, which should facilitate membrane-targeting of the compound. Further studies of membrane biology and biophysics should be clarifying to better understand how virapinib impairs macropinocytosis.</p><p id="P20">Even if our original aim was to find antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, the fact that the compound inhibits macropinocytosis extends its potential usefulness for other pathologies. Given that macropinocytosis is used by multiple viruses as a mechanism for cell entry, it would be worthwhile to systematically test its antiviral capacity against a wide range of viruses. Our initial analysis with a limited set of viruses supports that the compound might be efficacious against multiple pathogens. In addition, macropinocytosis has been shown to have tumor promoting roles (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), as well as to contribute to the cell-to-cell propagation of toxic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, and besides its potential usefulness as an antiviral, our work here provides a new tool for the scientific community that should help to address the contribution of macropinocytosis to disease, and potentially help to mitigate the severity of these pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P21">HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) and A549 (ATCC CCL-185) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco™, 31966021) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F7524) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco™, 15140122).
