However, the development of DNA origami-based therapeutic agents is hindered by the challenge of translating <italic>in vitro</italic> performance into effective applications <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we exploit the optical transparency of the embryonic zebrafish to track intravenously injected, fluorescently labelled wireframe DNA origami nanostructures. Our approach integrated long-term, high-resolution imaging of transgenic live embryos with single-cell RNA sequencing, to elucidate the biodistribution of DNA nanostructures over time, up to 3 days post-injection (dpi). Notably, we observed rapid accumulation of nanostructures in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), akin to the fetal liver in mammals. We tested the effects of coating the nanostructures with an oligolysine PEG copolymer (K-PEG), a widely used strategy to enhance their stability. The K-PEG coating mitigated the accumulation rate in CHT, enabling higher percentages of the nanostructures to engage with other tissues. Additionally, our findings highlighted the pivotal role of scavenger endothelial cells in DNA origami clearance, with K-PEG offering sustained protection for the nanostructures at the CHT. Furthermore, by monitoring DNA origami in a transgenic zebrafish line designed for targeted macrophage ablation, we found that macrophages contribute to nanostructure clearance at later time points. This study introduces a framework for the analyses of the biodistribution and clearance of DNA origami nanostructures in vivo with single cell resolution and establishes a foundation for the investigation of DNA origami-based nanomedicines in animal models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of DNA nanotechnology towards enabling in vivo applications. Inherently biocompatible and biodegradable, DNA nanostructures are suitable for studies in animal models. Wireframe DNA architectures are particularly advantageous for in vivo studies as they are stable under physiological conditions due to their lower packing density compared to conventional DNA origami<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, several coating approaches have been explored to enhance the stability and circulation times of DNA nanostructures in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To enable tissue specific targeting, DNA origami nanostructures have been modified with antibodies, aptamers, or other bioactive ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using DNA origami nanostructures for targeting specific tissues, such as the immune system or tumors. In contrast, DNA nanostructures without targeting moieties have been shown to accumulate in the kidney and have been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate kidney damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Despite their promise, challenges persist in harnessing the full potential of DNA origami nanostructures as multifunctional therapeutic agents. In particular, there is a need to accurately assess the interaction profiles of DNA origami nanostructures with cells at the whole-body level as well as their dynamics of clearance. Whole-body biodistribution data acquired by imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and bioluminescence has limitations in both resolution and sensitivity. The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) embryo has emerged as a promising <italic>in vivo</italic> model in nanomedicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Its optical transparency allows for real-time observation of intravenously administered fluorescently labelled objects. Therefore, intravital imaging of zebrafish embryos can provide whole-body information on nanoparticle targeting, cellular uptake, and clearance in live animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, zebrafish have a robust immune system resembling that of mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Innate immunity starts at embryogenesis in zebrafish, marked by the emergence of macrophages from the mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, while adaptive immunity is activated at three weeks post fertilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This temporal separation of the onset of the innate and adaptive immunity in zebrafish embryos is advantageous for the study of the interactions of nanostructures with the immune system.</p><p id="P3">Here, we investigated the biodistribution of fluorescently labelled wireframe DNA nanostructures in live zebrafish embryos using advanced imaging methods, including light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), Airyscan confocal microscopy, and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. Leveraging a coating strategy with K-PEG, we evaluated how surface charge modifications impact the biodistribution and clearance of DNA nanostructures. Further, we explored the role of the innate immune system using targeted ablation of macrophages in a zebrafish model. Together, our results provide insights into the performance and fate of DNA origami nanostructures in vivo.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Wireframe NanoSheet DNA origami nanostructures for in vivo assessment</title><p id="P4">We used wireframe scaffolded DNA origami to produce single layer two-dimensional sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>), herein referred to as NanoSheets (NS), which remain stable in physiological buffers, unlike DNA nanostructures constructed with tightly packed helices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To detect the NS, we designed six protruding ssDNA strands, centrally located on their surface, which hybridize to complementary ssDNA strands conjugated with the fluorophore Texas Red (TR), referred to as NS<sup>TR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Further, we employed a coating strategy widely used to enhance nanostructure stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, whereby positively charged oligolysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol (K-PEG) electrostatically interacts with the negatively charged DNA nanostructures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Imaging of NS structures folded in PBS using atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed their self-assembly and integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed that NanoSheets folded properly and were fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Further, agarose gel electrophoresis showed that NS<sup>TR</sup> coated with K-PEG, named NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>, had a neutral surface charge and were thereby retained in the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Removal of the K-PEG coating by incubation with chondroitin sulfate restored band migration, confirming that NS nanostructures were not structurally compromised by the coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a single molecule detection method, showed similar diffusion times for NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>, indicating that the coating strategy did not induce aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). FCS analyses of ssDNA strands conjugated with Texas Red (ssDNA<sup>TR</sup>) yielded significantly shorter diffusion times compared to NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> (Fig1d), consistent with the lower molecular weight of ssDNA compared to NS. Importantly, the average intensity of NS<sup>TR</sup> was equivalent to that of NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> at 7.1 kHz/molecule, indicating that the K-PEG coating did not affect the brightness of the NanoSheets. Additionally, the average intensity of ssDNA<sup>TR</sup> was 3.6 kHz/molecule, suggesting that on average two molecules of Texas Red were detected per NanoSheet.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Temporal profiles of NanoSheet distribution in zebrafish embryos</title><p id="P6">To investigate the biodistribution profiles of NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> in vivo, DNA nanostructures were intravenously injected into the bloodstream of zebrafish embryos at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We used the zebrafish model <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP),</italic> where the expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is under the control of the endothelial specific <italic>fli1</italic> promoter, enabling visualization of the vasculature of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Live embryos were imaged with LSFM for a period of 4 h, starting at 0.25 hours post injection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). We observed that NS<sup>TR</sup> rapidly accumulated in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>), which is functionally equivalent to the fetal liver of mammals, responsible for embryonic hematopoiesis and the resident site of scavenger endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). At early time points, the NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> signal at the CHT was similar to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). At the whole animal level, the NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> signal showed a different biodistribution profile compared to NS<sup>TR</sup>, with signal detected outside the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). At 4 hpi, NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> mainly localized to the CHT but were also detected in other regions of the embryo, such as brain and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Fig.3</xref>). We confirmed that the detected fluorescence signal did not result from structurally compromised NanoSheets by injecting embryos with NS mixed with ssDNA<sup>TR</sup> at a 1:1 ratio (control), which showed low fluorescence signal due to lack of retention of ssDNA in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). The average fluorescence intensity of circulating NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> in the lumen of the dorsal aorta (DA) showed no significant differences after 1 hpi. To investigate the clearance dynamics of NanoSheets in the CHT, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity of control, NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The signal intensity of NS<sup>TR</sup> decreased substantially up to 1 hpi and continued to decrease gradually until 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,e</xref>). In contrast, NS<sup>TR/KPEG</sup> showed moderate accumulation in the CHT, with the highest fluorescence intensity detected at 2 hpi. We further investigated the fluorescence intensity profiles of NanoSheets at the CHT by confocal imaging for up to 3 dpi. We observed that the fluorescence intensity of NanoSheets decreased over time. However, only the fluorescence intensity of NS<sup>TR</sup> reached control levels at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In addition, NS<sup>TR/KPEG</sup> signal was detected at 72 hpi, which was not the case for the coating-free nanostructures. Therefore, our results suggest that the K-PEG coating resulted in pronounced stabilization of the NanoSheet fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="P7">To analyze NanoSheet localization to the pronephric tubes of zebrafish embryos, we used the <italic>Tg(foxj1a:EGFP)</italic> transgenic line, as previous studies have shown the importance of kidney clearance for rectangular DNA origami in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We observed that there was no accumulation of NanoSheets in the pronephric tubes at 4 and 24 hpi, using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the K-PEG coating does not prevent NanoSheets from accumulating in the CHT, the embryonic liver of zebrafish. However, there was a time window of one hour before we detected accumulation of the NS<sup>TR/KPEG</sup> nanostructures in the CHT whereas NS<sup>TR</sup> were detected shortly after injection took place. Additionally, we observed that the K-PEG coating offered long-term protection to the NanoSheets localized to the CHT.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamics of NanoSheet clearance at the CHT</title><p id="P8">After identifying CHT as the primary tissue for NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> accumulation, we used Airyscan imaging to dissect its role in NanoSheet clearance in <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic> embryos with subcellular resolution. We focused on the time window from 0.5 hpi to 1.5 hpi, when the fluorescence intensity curves of NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/KPEG</sup> were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We imaged the CHT and dorsal aorta (DA) of live injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Quantification of the Texas Red signal revealed that NS<sup>TR</sup> accumulated and degraded faster than NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> in EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, NS<sup>TR/KPEG</sup> were also detected in EGFP<sup>-</sup> regions, indicating their interaction with non-endothelial CHT resident cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> were detected in the circulation for the duration of the imaging, while NS<sup>TR</sup> was not detected by 1.5 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). To further investigate the aggregation state of NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> in circulation, we performed FCS in the blood stream of live zebrafish embryos. We measured the fluorescence intensity fluctuations of NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> diffusing through a detection volume in the lumen of the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Brightness analyses of the objects showed that coated NanoSheets started to form aggregates in circulation at 2 hpi, which increased in size with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the endothelial cells within the CHT are the primary cell-type that interacts with the NanoSheets. However, we observed that the coating affected the clearance dynamics and that NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> were able to interact with cells within the CHT other than the endothelial cells, unlike NS<sup>TR</sup>. Further, NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>, but not NS<sup>TR</sup>, were detected in circulation long after the microinjections.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Whole embryo transcriptome analysis of NanoSheet- interacting cells</title><p id="P9">To identify the cell types interacting with the NanoSheets at the whole organism level with single-cell resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on embryos injected with NS<sup>TR</sup> or NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>. Embryos were injected at 2 dpf and dissociated into single cell suspensions at 4 hpi (Fig4a). Texas Red<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted by flow cytometry, for both NS<sup>TR</sup> and NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). We obtained 1032 Texas Red<sup>+</sup> cells from NS<sup>TR</sup> injected embryos with a median of 1908 genes per cell, and 1751 Texas Red<sup>+</sup> cells from NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup> injected embryos with a median of 2076 genes per cell. We used UMAP dimensionality reduction for visualization of the clusters. Based on previously annotated data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we identified ten different cell types for both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Further, we confirmed the identity of the cell types by comparing the analyzed genes to known cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, 45.39% of the total number of NS<sup>TR</sup>-interacting cells was identified as scavenger/vascular endothelial cells, whereas this percentage was only 14.03% in the NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>- interacting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The largest group of NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>- interacting cells were identified as mesenchymal neural crest cells, constituting 30% of the total population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In addition, the percentages of cells identified as embryonic brain, red blood cells (RBC), the musculature system and muscle cells were higher in NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>- than NS<sup>TR</sup>-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The percentage of immune cells was low in both conditions at this time point (4hpi) but was more than two-fold higher for NS<sup>TR</sup>- that NS<sup>TR/K-PEG</sup>- interacting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Together these data indicate that the K-PEG coating allows for a wider distribution of NanoSheets at the whole organism level, which facilitates their interaction with tissues other than the CHT.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Macrophage contribution to NanoSheet clearance</title><p id="P10">It has been previously reported that liver macrophages play a significant role in the clearance dynamics of nanoparticles in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our findings from the whole-body single-cell transcriptome analysis of zebrafish embryos at 4 hpi, indicated that few macrophages (cells expressing the macrophage specific gene marker <italic>mpeg1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) interacted with the NanoSheets. To investigate the functional roles of macrophages within CHT in the clearance dynamics of NanoSheets at later time points, we used a transgenic zebrafish line engineered for conditionally targeted ablation of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Additionally, this transgenic zebrafish line expresses mCherry in macrophages which was used for their visualization, and therefore uncoated and coated NanoSheets were labeled instead with Alexa Fluor 488 and named NS<sup>AF488</sup> and NS<sup>AF488/K-PEG</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We induced macrophage ablation by treatment with metronidazole (MTZ), from 1 dpf and until the end of the experiment at 72 hpi. We observed a reduction in the numbers of macrophages detected on MTZ-treated larvae compared to controls, for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). We injected non-macrophage-ablated or macrophage-ablated embryos with NS<sup>AF488</sup> or NS<sup>AF488/K-PEG</sup> nanostructures at 2 dpf and measured their fluorescence intensity by confocal microscopy at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hpi. We confirmed that in this zebrafish model, the fluorescence intensity of the NanoSheets in the CHT gradually decreased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), consistent with the results we obtained for the <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the fluorescence signal from NS<sup>AF488</sup> was significantly higher in macrophage-ablated embryos compared to controls, at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) and 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>) but not at earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, macrophage ablation did not significantly affect the fluorescence signal from NS<sup>AF488/K-PEG</sup> at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the effects of CHT macrophages on the clearance of uncoated NanoSheets start days after the injection of the nanostructures in the blood circulation of the zebrafish. In addition, our data suggests that K-PEG coating offers protection against macrophage-mediated clearance within the CHT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P11">The DNA origami method allows for precise fabrication of nanostructures, offering control over their physical and chemical properties as well as site-specific functionalization with ligands of interest. These features position DNA origami nanostructures as promising therapeutic agents, capable of being selectively directed towards specific tissues. However, despite this potential, the evaluation of their performance within living organisms has been limited by the use of methods that lack single cell resolution. To tackle this, we propose a strategy integrating DNA nanotechnology with embryonic zebrafish models, advanced microscopy, and single-cell RNA sequencing. This approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biodistribution and clearance dynamics of DNA origami nanostructures in real-time under physiological conditions. We imaged NanoSheets within live animals and tracked their interactions with cells. Modifying NanoSheet surface chemistry with K-PEG did not affect which tissues they labeled but had a large impact on relative distribution of NanoSheets in the different tissues. Thereby, this coating approach provided a therapeutic window that prolonged NanoSheet interaction with tissues like the brain and musculature before their clearance. Furthermore, our observations highlighted the scavenger endothelial cells as the primary contributors to NanoSheet clearance, with macrophages playing a role at later stages.
