However, characterising the effects of increased serotonin signalling in human models of behaviour is challenging given the limitations of available experimental probes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, SSRIs). Here we use a now accessible approach to directly increase synaptic serotonin in humans – a selective serotonin releasing agent – and examine its influence on domains of behaviour historically considered core functions of serotonin. Computational techniques including reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling were fit to observed behaviour. Reinforcement learning models revealed that increased synaptic serotonin reduced sensitivity specifically for outcomes in aversive but not appetitive contexts. Furthermore, increasing synaptic serotonin enhanced behavioural inhibition, and shifted bias towards impulse control during exposure to aversive emotional probes. These effects were seen in the context of overall improvements in memory for neutral verbal information. Our findings highlight the direct effects of increased synaptic serotonin on human behaviour, underlining its critical role in guiding decision-making within aversive and neutral contexts, and offering broad implications for longstanding theories of central serotonin function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Understanding the function of central serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been a focal goal of neuroscience research for nearly a century <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, not least because of its central role in the effects of many psychiatric drugs, predominantly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], and street drugs (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA] and lysergic acid diethylamide) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Serotonin is phylogenetically ancient, and its function translates across species to many lower-and higher-level behaviours; from feeding and sexual functioning to goal-directed, flexible cognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Amongst these, behavioural inhibition, memory, and aversive processing are historically considered the core, specialised functions of serotonin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This is underpinned by converging preclinical and human work involving <italic>in vivo</italic> manipulation of synaptic 5-HT, predominantly with SSRIs or depletion of its amino acid precursor tryptophan [TRP] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and observing behavioural change. In humans, however, stark differences in the direction of behavioural effects are observed across similar experimental approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. For example, several studies report seemingly contradictory effects of SSRIs on tasks of aversive and reward processing (reinforcement learning); specifically, different reports show that SSRIs increase reward sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, increase loss sensitivity and decreased reward sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and decrease sensitivity to both reinforcement valences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Inconsistent behavioural effects of SSRIs are also observed across other domains, including behavioural inhibition and memory processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>;</sup> in some cases, these behavioural changes align with those seen after TRP depletion (<italic>e.g.</italic> reduced cognitive flexibility) despite the expectation that they would have opposing effects on net synaptic 5-HT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Determining a causal link between increased synaptic 5-HT and behaviour in humans via SSRIs is difficult due to the complex effects of SSRIs on 5-HT and co-localised neurotransmitter systems. For example, negative signalling feedback along the serotoninergic pathway following autoreceptor activation early in treatment can limit cell firing, and therefore 5-HT release, in a regionally-specific manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, deactivation of 5-HT transporters results in 5-HT uptake via dopamine transporters, leading to subsequent co-release of dopamine and 5-HT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The effect of increased dopaminergic content and signalling is seen in acute and short-term SSRI administration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, observable in striatal, prefrontal, and hippocampal structures implicated in reward processing, behavioural inhibition and memory functioning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Given the complex molecular and behavioural profile of SSRIs, alternative probes which increase synaptic 5-HT may help further clarify the role of 5-HT in human behaviour and cognition. One such alternative involves the use of a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>): unlike SSRIs which increase 5-HT levels indirectly through prolonging synaptic 5-HT, SSRAs stimulate direct exocytic release of 5-HT, without broad monoaminergic efflux (as seen in non-selective 5-HT releasers, such as MDMA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. While SSRIs require ongoing neural firing for vesicular release of 5-HT into the synapse, the SSRA mechanism is not firing-dependent and thus not negated by dorsal raphe autoreceptor negative feedback which delays the therapeutic onset of action of SSRIs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Until recently, it has been challenging to characterise the effects of SSRAs in humans because of the lack of available licensed pharmacological probes. However, in 2020, low dose fenfluramine (up to 26mg daily; racemic mixture) was licensed for the treatment of Dravet epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Unlike SSRIs, low dose fenfluramine directly and rapidly increases synaptic 5-HT without modifying extracellular dopamine concentration in regions involved in mood regulation such as the striatum and hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Fenfluramine results in substantially greater extracellular 5-HT levels than the SSRI, fluoxetine, when administered at similar doses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Acute administration of fenfluramine increases synaptic 5-HT by 182-200% vs basal state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, while short-term administration (4-5 days) retains the increases in net 5-HT without influencing 5-HT terminal structural integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> . With its recent relicensing for epilepsy syndromes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, fenfluramine provides a novel opportunity to probe the neurobehavioural effects of SSRAs in humans to answer outstanding questions about the role of synaptic 5-HT in human behaviour.</p><p id="P7">Here we use this now accessible approach to directly increase synaptic 5-HT in humans and examine its influence on domains of behaviour historically considered historically core functions of serotonin: aversive processing, behavioural inhibition, and memory.

During this task, participants learned the probability of outcomes associated with symbols within pairs. Each pair represented a task condition: win trials (win money or no change) and loss trials (lose money or no change). Optimal choices were made when selecting symbols which had a greater probability (70%) of leading to a favourable outcome (<italic>i.e.,</italic> win in win trials and no change in loss trials). Computational reinforcement learning models were fitted to participant choice during the task (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) to formalise a predicted change in optimal choice making between allocation groups. Model parameters for each trial type were derived, providing a distinct explanation of learning and decision-making behaviour throughout the task: learning rate (𝛼), explaining the rate at which outcomes modify expectations; outcome sensitivity (ρ), explaining the effective magnitude of experienced outcomes; and inverse decision temperature (𝛽), explaining the extent to which expectations inform choices (choice stochasticity). Model parameters ρ and 𝛽 were estimated across separate models.

As SSRAs and TRP result in opposite effects on net synaptic 5-HT, the opposite behavioural pattern observed here is consistent with a key role for serotonin in modulating loss sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">An absence of change in reward sensitivity from the SSRA contrasts with the effects of SSRIs in humans. Despite the shared purpose of increasing synaptic 5-HT, SSRI administration has been associated with decreased sensitivity for rewarding outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Reduced reward sensitivity has been attributed to unwanted SSRI treatment effects, notably emotional blunting and reduced efficacy in targeting anhedonia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Importantly, SSRI administration results in indirect modulation of dopaminergic signalling pathways involved in reward processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, the SSRA used here (low dose fenfluramine, racemic mixture) retains selectivity for 5-HT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>, and is inactive at dopaminergic synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, in addition to a binding affinity for 5-HT transporters which is &lt;0.5% of that typically seen in SSRIs such as citalopram <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref> for further details on the pharmacodynamic properties of the experimental probe and its past uses). Thus, these results highlight potentially specific effects of serotonin on loss processing, whereas contradictory effects of SSRIs previously reported may relate to effects beyond the serotonin system.</p><p id="P26">The effect of increased synaptic 5-HT on aversive but not reward processing is further supported by a body of preclinical literature. Pharmacological (fenfluramine) and optogenetic stimulation of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus [DRN] results in no changes in reward processing in animal models; however, stimulation of non-serotonergic DRN neurons via amphetamine and optogenetics results in marked increases in reward processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Moreover, increased firing of amygdala 5-HT neurons is observed during aversive but not reward prediction errors, an effect which appears to be modulated by a functionally discrete DRN to basal amygdala 5-HT pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Accordingly, direct 5-HT depletion in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex modulates learning about aversive but not rewarding feedback <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>A step toward uncovering the shared role of serotonin in inhibition and aversive processing</title><p id="P27">Increasing synaptic 5-HT (via the SSRA) enhanced behavioural inhibition, an effect driven by more cautious decision-making. Impairment of 5-HT function decreasing behavioural inhibition is well-observed in animals, and to lesser extent in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. However, the opposite approach of increasing synaptic 5-HT with SSRIs yields a comparably less clear picture cross-species. In humans, SSRI challenge results in improvement or no change in action cancellation ability (stop signal) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, while action restraint ability (go/no-go) remains unchanged or impaired <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. Frontal functional activity increases during action restraint following SSRI challenge, however this is not linked to a corresponding change in ability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. Likewise, SSRIs yield no clear effect on behavioural inhibition in animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. The seemingly irreconcilable effects of SSRIs on behavioural inhibition may be attributed to the vulnerability of the agent to experimental noise; notably, its acute-to-chronic mechanistic shift and off-target dopaminergic effects. Nevertheless, the present study is the first to demonstrate objective improvements in action restraint by increasing synaptic 5-HT. Given disorders of behavioural control and impulsivity (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ADHD) are associated with 5-HT dysregulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, exploring potential clinical applications of SSRAs within these populations may prove beneficial.</p><p id="P28">During behavioural inhibition, increased synaptic 5-HT resulted in a bias for impulse control during aversive interference, alongside a corresponding drop in choice impulsivity. These findings align with the longstanding conceptualisation of 5-HT as an inhibitor which becomes active in aversive contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. Indeed, in individuals with depression and tryptophan-depleted healthy adults, choice impulsivity increases for explicit negative emotional targets in a go/no-go paradigm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. However, the effects of increased 5-HT on behavioural inhibition reported here were not experimentally confined to aversive contexts; notably, we observed a decrease in choice impulsivity during a control condition without affective interference. Potentially then, 5-HT performs an active role of limiting impulsive action more generally, but this is amplified in aversive contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Direct increases in synaptic serotonin enhance verbal memory processing</title><p id="P29">The SSRA enhanced retrieval and speed of processing during memory tasks involving verbal, but not visuospatial, information. Observable changes in memory consolidation are reliably observed following TRP depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. SSRI challenge, however, leads to highly variable effects on long-term and episodic memory function; while improvements have been observed, typically null findings are reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>. Unlike the SSRA, the threshold of synaptic 5-HT required for observable change may not be achieved during the brief SSRI regimen of most studies (≤ 7 days), where the problem of autoreceptor supersensitivity persists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>. Importantly, 5-HT receptor subtypes strongly associated with memory functioning (<italic>i.e.,</italic> 5-HT<sub>3,4,6</sub> receptors) have significantly lower binding affinities for endogenous 5-HT relative to other 5-HT receptors (<italic>e.g</italic>., 5-HT<sub>1A,B,D,E,F</sub>; 5-HT2<sub>A-C</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. Thus, crossing a putative 5-HT concentration threshold may be required to observe change in memory function, potentially explaining our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P30">Here we demonstrate direct effects of increased synaptic serotonin on human behaviour, underlining its critical role in guiding decision-making within aversive and more neutral contexts. In aversive contexts, increased synaptic serotonin appears to reduce sensitivity for loss outcomes, and promotes a bias toward impulse control during behavioural inhibition. In neutral contexts, increased synaptic serotonin appears to enhance behavioural inhibition by promoting cautious decisions, as well as enhancing memory recall for verbal information.</p><p id="P31">Not only do the present findings offer broad implications for longstanding theories of central serotonin, but they also demonstrate the promise of the SSRA as an experimental probe, furthering the scope of fundamental work which aims to characterise the involvement of serotonin in human behaviour, and its contribution to psychiatric aetiology in clinical samples.</p><p id="P32">Given the prominence of impaired cognition and aversive/negative emotional biases as transdiagnostic targets within psychiatry (<italic>e.g.,</italic> unipolar and bipolar depression; schizophrenia) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, investigating the therapeutic potential of the SSRA in clinical populations may be worthwhile. Such investigations may allow greater targeting of specific neurocognitive mechanisms across disorders in the absence of widespread, and often unwanted, effects including emotional blunting.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Participants and design</title><p id="P33">Fifty-six participants (28:28, SSRA:placebo; mean age = 20.2) were randomised to take part in the study. Recruitment occurred between June 2021 and June 2022. Potential participants were screened to exclude those who had recently used recreational drugs (3-month wash-out, except MDMA which had a wash out period of ≥ 1 year) or who were pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or who were currently breastfeeding. All participants had a BMI between 18–30 and were fluent speakers of English.

For full details of the recruitment process, see the study CONSORT flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Eligible participants were randomised to administration of SSRA fenfluramine hydrochloride (15mg b.i.d.; racemic mixture) or placebo for short-term administration (7-9 days), in a double-blind design. Both the SSRA and the placebo were administered orally in a flavoured aqueous solution, with the placebo lacking an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Randomisation was performed by the Clinical Pharmacy Support Unit, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust (Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) using a stratified block randomisation algorithm, with stratification for gender and task stimulus version (for further details on task stimulus version, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P35">The study was approved by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee (MSD-IDREC reference R69642/RE004) and pre-registered on the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database (NCT05026398). Prior to study participation, participants provided informed consent. All study visits were conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p id="P36">Participants undertook two screening visits to assess study eligibility. In the first session, medical history and current medication use was assessed and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V was conducted to screen for current or past psychiatric illness. In the second session, cardiovascular health (blood pressure; electrocardiography), renal and liver health (liver function, urea, and electrolyte blood tests) were assessed, and drug and pregnancy urine tests were performed. Eligible participants attended two study visits, baseline and post-intervention occurring 7, 8 or 9 days after baseline. This study period was scheduled to avoid the premenstrual week for female participants. At baseline, participants completed a battery of cognitive and emotional computer tasks and questionnaires (described in the Materials section below). Participants were then given their first dose of the SSRA or placebo and monitored for three hours during which regular blood pressure and observational checks were made. To determine cortisol levels, saliva samples were collected immediately before initial dose, one hour post-dose, and three hours post-dose. Saliva samples were immunoassayed for cortisol levels over linear calibration curves (for further details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>). After the initial dose visit, participants were asked to independently take the SSRA or placebo daily, in addition to completing daily questionnaires (see Questionnaires Measures section). At the post-intervention visit, participants completed the same task and questionnaire battery as at baseline and were then requested to estimate their allocation prior to debriefing.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Questionnaire measures</title><p id="P37">At each study visit, participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring affect, mood, anxiety, subjective cognitive functioning, and side-effects; the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-T], Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI], Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS], Visual Analogue Scale [VAS], Perceived Deficit Questionnaire – Depression [PDQ-D], and side effects profile questionnaire. Participants completed the VAS and side effects questionnaires once per day between the baseline and post-intervention visits.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Cognitive and Emotional Task Battery</title><p id="P38">Participants undertook an extensive cognitive and emotional task battery at both the initial dose visit (baseline) and follow-up visit. Participants undertook the following tasks in order: 1) Auditory Verbal Learning Task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>) – a measure of episodic memory encoding and retrieval where accuracy of recall was the measured outcome; 2) Affective Interference Go/No-Go Task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>) – a measure of behavioural inhibition under affective interference (positive [happy faces], aversive/negative [fearful faces], and neutral distractors) where accuracy of inhibited response to ‘no-go’ trials (response inhibition), accuracy and response time to ‘go’ trials (an index of impulsivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>) were the non-model outcome measures. The block design of the task allows for analysis of set-shifting effects (executive shifting for task condition rule changes) on accuracy and response time. Participant task data was fit to a computational drift diffusion model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for further details) which provided the following model parameters: boundary separation, initial choice bias, non-decision time, drift rate and drift criterion; 3) Verbal <italic>N</italic>-Back task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>) – a measure of complex verbal working memory where accuracy and response time to ‘target’ letters (<italic>i.e.,</italic> matching a letter which appeared <italic>n</italic>-back [0, 1, 2, or 3] trials ago) were the outcome measures; 4) Probabilistic instrumental learning task ([<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>] adapted from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>) – a measure of reward and loss sensitivity during instrumental learning, which produced non-model outcome measures which were fit to computational reinforcement learning model.

Homogeneity in demographic variables across allocation groups was assessed using chi-squared independence tests (categorical, binary variables) and two-tailed independent t-tests (continuous, discrete variables). The effect of the SSRA on outcomes across the task battery and questionnaire ratings was analysed using between-groups (SSRA vs. placebo) type III mixed model ANCOVA models on post-intervention data, with baseline performance serving as a regressor and participant as a random effect where appropriate. The approach of using baseline score as a regressor in this manner was selected as this yields greater statistical efficiency and avoids conditional bias from baseline imbalance compared with repeated-measures ANOVA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup> and other baseline-adjustment techniques (<italic>e.g.,</italic> change score between post and pre-intervention) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>. Post-hoc comparisons were carried out on outcome measures collected at follow-up using two-tailed estimated marginal means tests, where estimates are reported alongside standard means error; family-wise error was adjusted for via Bonferroni-Holm procedure. Effect sizes matrices are reported for the ANCOVA (partial eta squared, ηp<sup>2</sup>) and EMM (Cohen’s <italic>d, d</italic>) alongside corresponding 95% confidence intervals (for effect size calculations, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). In addition to ANCOVA analysis of questionnaire data at follow-up, daily questionnaire data (VAS and side effects profile) was joined longitudinally with initial dose and follow-up visit data and analysed using linear mixed effects models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation with participant as a random effect. Salivary cortisol was analysed across three timepoints (before dose, 1- and 3-hr post-dose) using mixed linear effects modelling using time-by-allocation as an interaction term.

The majority of central 5-HT innervation originates from the dorsal raphe nucleus (lilac), and is found within areas of the brain strongly implicated in mood regulation and cognitive function: amygdala (yellow), hippocampus (purple), striatal structures (green), anterior cingulate cortex (light blue) and the prefrontal cortex (red). <bold>B.</bold> SSRIs and SSRAs both influence extracellular presynaptic serotonin concentrations, allowing for greater serotoninergic activity, while the effects of SSRIs on synaptic 5-HT are delayed by autoreceptor hypersensitivity and may
