However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>maternal nutrition</kwd><kwd>protein restriction</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The nutritional environment experienced in early life can influence the risk of developing age-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].

While postmitotic muscle fibres are formed during embryonic development via primary and secondary myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], the early neonatal period in humans and rodents is also a critical time for skeletal muscle development as muscle hypertrophy mainly occurs during early postnatal life through a rapid increase in the number of myonuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Skeletal muscle is a highly dynamic tissue, and its development is particularly prone to nutritional deficiency compared with other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].

Lower body weight in early life is a predictor of skeletal muscle disorders in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether the reduction in body weight and muscle weight persists or could be corrected by weaning onto a normal protein diet.

At 3 months of age, p62 protein abundance was significantly lower in NLN mice compared to the control group (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, 5e), but there was no significant difference between the two groups at 18 months of age (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f, 5g</xref>).

Therefore, it is important to acquire a comprehensive understanding of how sarcopenia develops. It has been reported that the principal cause of sarcopenia is loss of muscle fibre number and fibre atrophy - notably among type II fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Protein deficiency is recognized as a widespread and persistent global issue due to its multifactorial causes, including limited access to expensive food sources containing essential amino acids, hindering the optimal growth and development of the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In this study, we assessed the effects of lifelong protein restriction on GAS and SOL skeletal muscles and our results demonstrated that feeding a lifelong low-protein diet following lactational protein restriction accelerated the loss of type IIa fibres and reduced muscle fibre size in later life. Consistently, our group previously reported that a postnatal low-protein diet (5%, compared to normal protein diet 17-20%) reduced maximum force generation in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle at 3 months of age in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Another animal study has reported that rats born to mothers fed a low protein diet (8%) and maintained on an 8% protein diet in postnatal life had a decreased cross-sectional area and distorted myofibers in their GAS muscle at 16 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, our previous research demonstrated that long-term protein restriction led to a consistent decrease in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle weight throughout the lifespan of male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Together, this data suggested that lifelong protein restriction may subsequently contribute to the development of sarcopenia, but further studies are required to follow this up after 18 months of age when the sarcopenic phenotype is fully developed.</p><p id="P26">Our data indicated that lactational protein restriction lead to a significant upregulation of ribosomal gene expression in the GAS skeletal muscle in the offspring. Since protein deficiency during lactation resulted in limited growth in the offspring, these findings suggest that the observed increase in ribosomal mRNA expression serves as a compensatory response to the growth restriction. Similar to these findings, our group previously demonstrated that lactational protein restriction also upregulated the expression of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), such as U3, in skeletal muscle. snoRNAs facilitate multiple roles in ribosomes biogenesis including 2′-O-methylation of ribosomal (r)RNA and pseudouridylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Hence, given the vital role of U3 in the maturation of ribosomal rRNAs, it has been proposed that the upregulation of U3 expression may also act as an adaptive mechanism in response to protein restriction during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Moreover, feeding a lifelong low-protein diet after lactational protein restriction reduced ribosomal gene expression and autophagy in GAS muscle in later life. This decrease in autophagy was associated with the accelerated loss of skeletal muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size later in life. Although autophagy flux is increased during the process of muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], there is accumulating evidence to suggest that impaired autophagy may contribute to age-related muscle loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. For example, a rat study has reported an age-related decline in autophagic degradation in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Together, it can be inferred that lifelong protein restriction leads to an acceleration in skeletal muscle loss by impairing autophagy and ribosomal gene expression, thus compromising proteostasis.</p><p id="P27">We also demonstrated that feeding a low-protein diet following lactational protein restriction disturbed AMPK signalling and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis and mitochondrial antioxidant defence in later life. This suggested that mitochondria play a key role in the accelerated skeletal muscle loss phenotype observed in mice fed a low-protein diet following lactational protein restriction. Consistent with our findings, a loss in muscle mass has been related to a decline in mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], while PGC1α-TFAM activation alleviates skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. In addition, Mfn2 deletion resulted in muscle atrophy and deletion of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 decreased muscle performance in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], whereas stimulating mitophagy can counteract age-related skeletal muscle loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. It has been reported that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants may prevent immobilisation-induced muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Our study offers mechanistic insight into lifelong protein restriction-induced skeletal muscle loss, which could be a targeting strategy for studies investigating muscle wasting.</p><p id="P28">It is well-established that maternal undernutrition has a great effect on the metabolic health outcome of the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. In the present study, we found that lactational protein restriction impaired ribosomal protein gene expression, regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, the transition between fast and slow fibre and skeletal muscle fibre development. While previous studies have reported long-lasting adverse effects of maternal protein restriction on offspring in later life via epigenetic modifications, these studies mostly focused on the influence of gestational protein restriction on the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Longitudinal studies following women who were pregnant during the Dutch Famine of World War II have reported the impact of maternal nutrition on offspring development and their susceptibility to diseases in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. In contrast, we provide evidence that the detrimental effects of lactational protein restriction in skeletal muscle can be corrected by weaning onto a normal protein diet in later life in mice. Similarly, our group previously reported that male and female mice fed a normal protein diet following lactational protein restriction exhibited a compensatory growth response and had similar survival rate to the control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. In addition, Ozanne and Hales, 2004 described that iso-caloric protein restriction during gestation shortened the lifespan in mice, whereas the offspring nursed by mothers on a low-protein diet during lactation lived longer than the control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that lactational protein restriction may not have long-lasting detrimental effects on skeletal muscle, but could even have beneficial effects when followed by a normal protein diet starting at weaning. Translation of our findings into human health has the potential to revolutionize the guidelines for appropriate maternal nutritional diet during pregnancy and lactation. Further studies are needed to examine the importance of the timing of maternal nutritional programming in mediating the long-term adverse effects on the offspring.</p><p id="P29">We showed that lifelong low protein diet after lactational protein restriction had adverse effects on skeletal muscle at 18 months of age. However, reduced dietary consumption of protein is linked with increased metabolic health and longer life span in flies, rats, mice, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Richardson and colleagues (2021) reported that lifelong consumption of low amino-acids (AA) diet significantly increased the lifespan of C57BL/6J male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Moreover, lifelong dietary branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) restriction decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in skeletal muscle and the frailty in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Key differences from our study include protein restriction during lactation, dietary design, and the restriction of only BCAAs. In their study, Richardson and colleagues examined the effects of a 7% protein diet starting at weaning or the specific restriction of BCAAs by 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Our study involved the restriction of dietary protein intake in lactating mothers and the subsequent feeding of their offspring with a low-protein diet beginning at weaning. This highlights the importance of maternal dietary protein intake during lactation. To comprehensively evaluate the differences, further research is required, focusing on a direct comparison between a low protein diet administered during lactation and a low protein diet initiated after weaning.</p><p id="P30">In summary, lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth by impairing mitochondrial and ribosomal homeostasis. While there is a substantial amount of work indicating the adverse effects of maternal malnutrition during gestation on the offspring later in life, for the first time we have shown that at least some of the detrimental effects of lactational protein restriction seen in skeletal muscle can be attenuated by weaning onto a normal content protein diet. However, lifelong protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss and reduced muscle fibre size in later life, and this was associated with an impairment in the AMPK signalling pathway and the dysregulation of mitochondrial homoeostasis and proteostasis. Hence, one should consider the AMPK-PGC1α-mitochondria axis and proteostasis as potent factors in protein restriction-driven skeletal muscle loss.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Methods Animals</title><p id="P31">B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-YFP)16Jrs/J mice (Jackson Laboratory; stock number 003709), were used for this study.
