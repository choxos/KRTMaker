Low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) have been associated primarily with cell cycle arrest in cultured dividing cells. Macrophages are typically quiescent in G0, though yolk sac and bone marrow derived macrophages frequently proliferate and monocyte-derived tissue macrophages are able to proliferate in response to tissue signals. Here we show that hypoxia (1% oxygen tension) results in reversible entry into the cell cycle in monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) and mouse peritoneal macrophages. Cell cycle progression is largely limited to G1/S phase with very little progression to G2/M. Mechanistically, this cell cycle transitioning is triggered by a HIF2α-directed transcriptional program. The response is accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle-associated proteins, including CDK1, and reversible activation of the canonical mitogen-activated MEK-ERK proliferation pathway. CDK1 associated SAMHD1 phosphorylation at T592 in hypoxic macrophages renders them hyper-susceptible to lentiviral transduction. Furthermore, PHD inhibitors, which activate HIFs, are able to recapitulate HIF2α-dependent cell cycle entry in macrophages, as well as susceptibility to lentiviral transduction. Finally, we demonstrate that tumour associated macrophages (TAM) in lung cancers exhibit transcriptomic profiles representing responses to low oxygen and cell cycle progression at single cell level. This work uncovers HIF2α driven macrophage cell cycle progression in low oxygen conditions that culminates in SAMHD1 phosphorylation and high susceptibility to lentiviral transduction. These findings have implications for inflammation, neoplasia and pathogen defence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Macrophages are typically quiescent and reside in G0, though in particular, yolk sac derived macrophages can proliferate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In addition tissue macrophages are also able to self-replenish, independent of circulating monoctyes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. We previously observed cell cycle progression from G0 to G1 in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) stimulated by fetal calf serum (FCS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This was mediated via the canonical mitogen-activated Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, culminating in CDK4/6 activation and de-repression of Rb protein and transcription of cell cycle-associated proteins such as CDKs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The MEK/ERK pathway is evolutionarily conserved and involves feedback loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleotide-triphosphate hydrolase that lowers intracellular dNTP levels and works in opposition to ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This hydrolase activity is regulated by CDK1 phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at position T592, and during cell division CDK1 activity rises, thereby allowing accumulation of dNTP for S phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We previously showed that macrophage cycle entry into G1 also correlates with an increase in CDK1 expression which phosphorylates SAMHD1 at position 592 and increases dNTP concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. SAMHD1 is also known as a restriction factor for virus replication of HIV-1 and DNA viruses, and thought to be mediated by decreasing the dNTP pool for viral DNA synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation at T592 renders SAMHD1 inactive against HIV-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In support of an important role for SAMHD1 in virus restriction, the lentiviral accessory protein Vpx in SIV and HIV-2 have been shown to counteract and degrade SAMHD1 through proteasomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. HIV-1 does not encode a Vpx like protein and bypasses SAMHD1 by infecting cells whilst they are in proliferative phases. Therefore the ability to infect non-dividing myeloid cells and T cells has been attributed to SAMHD1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, infection of sentinel macrophages may contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">We have subsequently sought to identify physiological factors that may impact macrophage cell cycle status; oxygen tension was of particular interest given the wide variability in oxygen tensions that macrophages encounter when passing through the circulation and across tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Indeed in areas where viruses such as HIV replicate, such as lymphoid tissue or the GI tract, tissue oxygen tension is 1-5% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, in contrast to 11-14% in the circulation, and typical <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions at 21% oxygen. At low tissue oxygen levels, Hypoxia Inducible transcription Factors (HIFs) are stabilised, initiating a transcriptional programming response to adapt to changing oxygen levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. HIFs are ubiquitously expressed in all cells, but the main HIF isoforms, HIF1α and HIF2α, can be differentially expressed and can result in distinct transcriptional outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, both isoforms are regulated by PHDs (prolyl-hydroxylases 1-3) and FIH (factor inhibiting HIF), which are the oxygen sensors and act enzymatically in an oxygen-dependent manner to hydroxylate HIFα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Prolyl hydroxylated HIFα acts as the recruitment signal for the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase, leading to HIFα proteasome-mediated degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. However in low oxygen, PHD enzymatic activity is inhibited, leading to the stabilisation of HIFα followed by its translocation with HIF1β to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the nucleus, cascading the activation of HIF-dependent gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Asparagine hydroxylation of HIFα by FIH acts as negative feedback mechanism to control HIF-mediated transcription, and this results from the differential oxygen affinity between the PHDs and FIH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here we show that lowering oxygen tension to 1% (typical for tissues such as lymph nodes) results in a PHD-initiated cascade and a HIF2α-directed hypoxic transcriptional program in macrophages leading to reversible cell cycle progression. This response is accompanied by the activation of the canonical MEK-ERK pathway and expression of cell cycle-associated proteins including CDK1, which in turn deactivates the antiviral response of SAMHD1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Hypoxia drives reversible macrophage cell cycle progression</title><p id="P6">We isolated monocytes from blood of healthy individuals and differentiated them into monocyte-derived (MDM) macrophages using MCSF for 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The MDM were then placed in a hypoxia chamber at 1% oxygen. In parallel, identical wells of cells were placed in a standard tissue culture incubator supplied with 21% oxygen. We stained macrophages under 1% and 21% oxygen using a panel of myeloid antibodies that have been used to define M1 versus M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). The expression of these markers did not indicate classical M1/M2 macrophage polarisation under hypoxic conditions. Phagocytosis is a core function of macrophages and we therefore assessed phagocytosis using the phrodo system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We observed an apparent heterogeneity in phagocytic activity and did not observe significant differences based on oxygen conditions across three donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Bulk RNA seq analysis revealed that in these macrophages known HIF-driven genes were indeed transcriptionally regulated under low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Pathway analysis also showed enrichment of glycolytic genes and other canonical HIF target genes as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B&amp;C</xref>). Interestingly, genes involved in MEK/ERK pathway such as those encoding RAF, MEK, ERK, CDK4 and Cyclin D were expressed to higher levels in 1% oxygen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In addition, the negative regulator to MAP kinase (ERK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which itself activates a plethora of downstream targets including the cell cycle regulating CDK1, was among the most downregulated genes. These observations, in conjunction with our previous study on FCS-stimulated MEK/ERK-induced cell cycle progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, prompted us to further examine the MEK/ERK pathway in the context of hypoxia. To further investigate whether hypoxia induces cell cycle progression, we lysed cells which had been incubated in either 1% or 21% oxygen for two days and performed western blot analyses to probe cell cycle-associated proteins. The cells treated at 1% oxygen displayed a robust expression of HIF1α and HIF2α, which were undetectable under the experimental setting in 21% oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We probed for MCM2 and CDK1 that we had shown previously to be reliable markers of cell cycle re-entry from G0 in FCS-stimulated MDM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed an elevated expression of MCM2 as well as an up-regulation of CDK1 - the kinase responsible for SAMHD1 phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, similar to the observation for the MDM stimulated under FCS. We observed an elevated level of pSAMHD1 due to an elevated level of CDK1 expression while the overall expression of SAMHD1 was largely unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Consistent with the western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining on fixed cells post two day treatment revealed a marked increase in cell cycle-associated markers MCM2 as well as Ki67 and EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F&amp;G</xref>). Ki67 was detected at various stages of the cell cycle in cells exposed to 1% oxygen. EdU incorporation was marginally increased in 1% oxygen treatment, suggesting that synthesis is increased and replication stress was not induced. This is in contrast to more profound levels of hypoxia (&lt;0.1%) where EdU incorporation is reduced, and replication stress is observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The expression level of S/G2/M marker Geminin was not significantly altered, suggestive of cells not progressing into G2/M phase. Taken together we conclude that hypoxia drives MDM to re-enter cell cycle from G0 state, highly similar to our early studies using FCS as a stimulator for cell cycle progression in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">We next aimed to assess whether the cell cycle entry was reversible. We incubated differentiated MDM in 1% oxygen for two days before transferring them to an incubator supplying 21% oxygen and lysed the cells for different time intervals for western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We observed an acute and transient decrease in MCM2, CDK1 and pSAMHD1 after re-oxygenation along with a rapid loss of HIF1α and HIF2α. Interestingly at 30 mins post re-oxygenation we observed rebound expression of MCM2, CDK1 and pSAMHD1 but not HIFs. This rebound lasted at least 30 mins and had resolved by the final time point of 48 hours. We conclude that cell cycle changes in macrophages under hypoxic conditions are reversible and likely involve feedback circuits within the MEK/ERK axis that generates a temporary rebound in pERK leading to oscillatory pSAMHD1 expression after re-oxygenation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Macrophage cell cycle entry under low oxygen toggles SAMHD1 antiviral activity</title><p id="P10">We and others had previously observed that an increase in pSAMHD1 correlates with the alleviation of post-entry restriction of HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Notably this correlation does not hold for lentiviruses that encode Vpx protein, such as SIV or HIV-2, where SAMHD1 undergoes Vpx-mediated degradation via proteasomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. As pSAMHD1 levels were increased in 1% oxygen-treated MDMs, we hypothesised that the restriction of HIV-1 infection in these macrophages should be alleviated and hence an increase in viral replication, which should contrast with the level of infection in SIV or HIV-2. To test this hypothesis, we produced HIV-1, SIV or HIV-2 pseudotyped with VSV-G glycoproteins together with packaged genomes that once integrated into the target cells express GFP for ease of quantitation of infected cells. Western blot analysis showed that the 1% oxygen resulted in upregulation of CDK1 which drives an enhanced pSAMHD1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and this increase correlates with up to a 5-fold increase in HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As predicted, this increase in infectivity is not observed for SIVmac or HIV-2, where SAMHD1 is degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We further knocked down SAMHD1 and found the infectivity was increased in 1% oxygen condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus the toggling of SAMHD1 antiviral activity serves as a surrogate marker for macrophage cell cycle reentry, thereby also validating our observations for cell cycle markers (MCM2, Geminin, EdU) and associated proteins/transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MEK/ERK inhibitors abrogate cell cycle changes induced by low oxygen conditions</title><p id="P11">The MEK/ERK pathway is enriched in our transcriptomics study and has been shown to be involved in the FCS-induced cell cycle progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Hence we hypothesised that MEK/ERK pathway might be implicated in hypoxia-driven cell cycle progression. We took advantage of clinically proven antagonists against different targets in this pathway to examine the specificity of this pathway in driving the cell cycle progression in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found the inhibitors indeed efficiently and specifically blocked the activation cascade in MDM as the inhibitors to the upstream RAF (Tak632 and AZ628) completely abolished the phosphorylation on ERK therefore the abrogation of expression in CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). MEK inhibitor U0126 also manifested inhibition in phosphorylation of ERK but not the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib which acts downstream of ERK but upstream of CDK1 expression. Nevertheless, all the MEK/ERK inhibitors led to a drastic decrease in CDK1 expression. Since signal transduction is converged at ERK, we chose to focus on using U0126 and palbociclib, one upstream and one downstream of ERK for further studies of the regulation of MEK/ERK pathway in hypoxia. MDMs were incubated in 1% oxygen for 12 hrs prior to the addition of U0126 or palbociclib for 2 hrs; this was followed by transduction using pseudotyped viruses bearing VSV-G for single-round infections. The treatment with U0126 completely abrogated the phosphorylation of ERK which then culminated in decreased CDK1 expression in 1% oxygen, resulting in a diminished level of pSAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the treatment of palbociclib maintained the expression level of pERK but led to a decrease in CDK1 and thus phenocopied the effect seen in the U0126 treated cells. In accordance with the observed expression profile for pSAMHD1 by western blotting, the infectivity of HIV-1 was completely abolished by either U0126 or palbociclib, confirming the role of hypoxia in regulating the MEK/ERK pathway, cell cycle re-entry and HIV-1 restriction in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mouse peritoneal macrophages enter the cell cycle in low oxygen conditions</title><p id="P12">We previously observed mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated by FCS could re-enter cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. To examine whether the low oxygen tension-driven cell cycle re-entry is specifically for human cells, we sought to examine this by using mouse peritoneal macrophages exposed to 1% oxygen. As a control to the enhanced HIV-1 infectivity in 1% oxygen, we additionally collected peritoneal macrophages from SAMHD1 KO mice which should de-suppress the restriction to infection. The cells from the same WT or SAMHD1 KO animal were split into two aliquots for culture in 21% or 1% oxygen. Western blot analysis of the lysates showed that, although there was variability between cells from the WT animals, KO cells displayed a significant increase in MCM2 expression in 1% oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the observation that pERK is increased in this hypoxic condition in human cells, we found that peritoneal macrophages from both WT and KO animals had elevated levels of pERK in 1% oxygen, demonstrating that hypoxic regulation of the MEK/ERK pathway is evolutionarily conserved. As expected, SAMHD1 was absent from the KO cells and infection using VSV-G pseudotyped HIV virus showed a 20-fold increase in infection in SAMHD1 KO cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The infection in WT was negligible (0.1%) due to the presence of active SAMHD1. However, when the cells were exposed to 1% oxygen a small but statistically significant 3-fold increase in infection was noted. This is in agreement with our data from human MDMs and shows that hypoxia drove macrophages into a non-G0 stage which correlated with an increase in susceptibility to pseudotyped HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PHD inhibitors mimic the effect of low oxygen on macrophage cell cycle progression</title><p id="P13">Having demonstrated that both MDM and peritoneal macrophages from mice can be driven to enter the cell cycle in hypoxia, we next sought to determine whether manipulating the HIF pathway using pharmacological inhibitors in 21% oxygen was sufficient to replicate our findings in 1% oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). As there are several classes of clinically proven or under clinical investigation inhibitors targeting different stages of HIF-mediated pathway, we selected well-documented PHD inhibitors. This class of drugs is used in treatment of anemia associated with renal anemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We observed that drugs targeting PHD activity (daprodastat) increased the stabilisation of HIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly daprodustat-treated cells manifested a significant increase in MCM2 expression, suggesting the presence of those drugs drives PHD-dependent cell cycle entry through stabilization of HIF1α or HIF2α. Strikingly, the treatment of daprodustat in normal oxygen levels led to an elevated level of pSAMHD1 which correlated with ~5 fold increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. This increased infectivity was abrogated in the additional presence of either U0126 or palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B&amp;C</xref>), recapitulating the phenotype observed in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Macrophage cell cycle progression is dependent on HIF2α activity</title><p id="P14">We next sought to investigate whether the cell cycle re-entry is dependent on HIF transcription factors. We decided to examine the involvement of HIF2α using the clinically approved selective HIF-2α inhibitor, PT-2385. This inhibitor disrupts the interaction between HIF2α and HIF1β leading to reduced expression of HIF2α-dependent HIF target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Indeed, the presence of PT-2385 did not affect the expression of unrelated genes (BAP1) or genes mainly regulated by HIF1α (PDK-1 and PGK-1) while PAI-1, a gene mainly targeted by HIF2α, was specifically reduced in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also observed a dose-dependent decrease in MCM2 expression in the presence of PT-2385 under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that PT-2385 effectively blocks the cells from re-entering the cell cycle in hypoxia. Accordingly, CDK1 expression was decreased with PT-2385 treatment accompanied by a reduced level of pSAMHD1. Since pERK functions upstream of CDK1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), we reasoned that the level of pERK may be affected in the presence of PT-2385. Indeed while total ERK was unaltered in the presence of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), a statistically significant two-fold reduction in pERK expression was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Additionally, PT-2385 significantly decreased the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), whilst cell numbers were largely maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To further investigate whether HIF2α was also involved in the cell cycle progression induced by PHD inhibitors, we sequentially treated the cells with daprodustat followed by PT-2385. As predicted, daprodustat treatment induced cell cycle re-entry that was abrogated with PT-2385 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Given both CDK1 and pSAMHD1 were reduced we hypothesised that the level of pERK expression was lowered. Western blot analyses on multiple donors indeed showed that the total ERK was unaltered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>) but that the ratio of pERK/ERK was reduced in the presence of the higher dose of HIF2α antagonist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>), which correlated with decreased HIV-1 infectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6D&amp;E</xref>). Taken together our data suggest that HIF2α is necessary and sufficient to account for the observed hypoxia-driven cell cycle progression as well as the PHD inhibitor-induced cell cycle response in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Tumour-associated macrophages exhibit hypoxia and cell cycle progression signatures</title><p id="P16">Hypoxia is one of the hallmarks of tumour growth environment where tumour-infiltrating macrophages are also found.

We further probed for MCM2 and CDK1 expression, which are reliable markers of cell cycle reentry of MDM from G0. Indeed, we observed an upregulation of MCM2 and CDK1 in TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6E</xref>, black boxes).

In addition, we observed upregulation of genes involved in MEK/ERK pathway such as MAPK12 and MYC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.6E</xref>, black boxes).

High dNTP levels are detrimental for cells, both due to increased likelihood of parasitisation by DNA viruses and other micro-organisms, and possibly higher rates of spontaneous mutation following DNA damage and repair. Although macrophages were traditionally viewed as non-proliferating cell types, more recent insights have shown that yolk sac derived macrophages in tissues such as brain and gut have significant proliferative potential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and monocyte derived tissue macrophages are able to proliferate in response to specific signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. These insights have significant implications for health and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. While our previous studies have demonstrated that MDM can be stimulated by FCS and reenter the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, we were interested in how monocyte-derived macrophages respond to low oxygen tension, which reflects physiological conditions where those cells reside <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we report that hypoxia can drive cell cycle entry in monocyte-derived macrophages. This was somewhat surprising as hypoxia was previously shown to arrest the cell cycle in numerous other cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In contrast, HIF2α is the key driver in clear cell renal cell carcinoma where VHL is dysregulated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and there is an emerging recognition that HIF1 and 2 can impact cell cycle differentially in the context of neoplasia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore it is intriguing and important that the same physiological stimulus can drive opposing responses based on cell type, and these may be driven through direct and indirect interactions with oncoproteins and tumour suppressors such as Myc and p53 respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Cell cycle progression resulted in modestly increased incorporation of EdU. Surface expression of classical macrophage markers such as CD86 did not change significantly in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), and phagocytic activity was not substantially altered in hypoxic macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). We have demonstrated from three lines of evidence that a subpopulation of macrophages re-enter into the non-G0 stage by a hypoxia-triggered canonical mitogen-activated proliferation cascade in macrophages, involving MEK-ERK and downstream CDK4/6-Cyclin D, with phosphorylation of SAMHD1. Firstly, our transcriptomic analysis highlighted, and transcript analysis by qRT-PCR confirmed, genes involved in the MAPK pathway are highly differentially expressed in hypoxia. Negative regulators of ERK were also downregulated additionally implicating this pathway in the response to low oxygen tension. Secondly, pharmacological inhibition on the intermediate targets involved in the MEK/ERK pathway completely abolished the low oxygen tension-induced cell cycle re-entry phenotype. Thirdly, the addition of an antagonist to HIF2α either in hypoxia or PHD inhibitor-driven HIF stablisation in normoxia prevents cells from re-entering from G0, with a decrease in ERK phosphorylation and CDK1 expression.</p><p id="P21">We found that the cell cycle changes were reversible within minutes following restoration of oxygen tension. Interestingly at 30 mins post re-oxygenation we observed rebound expression of MCM2, CDK1 and pSAMHD1, but not HIFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This rebound lasted at least 30 minutes and had resolved by the final time point of 48 hours. We conclude that cell cycle changes in macrophages under hypoxic conditions are reversible and likely involve feedback circuits within the MEK/ERK axis that generate an oscillatory rebound ‘hypoxia-like’ response after re-oxygenation that is HIF independent. This may be similar to work showing paradoxical ERK activation in the presence of RAF inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly we observed that ERK1/2 is upregulated in hypoxia which can be abrogated in the presence of a HIF antagonist - suggesting ERK may be transcriptionally regulated by HIF2a, consistent with the identification of an HRE upstream of the ERK promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Mechanistically, we identified HIF2α as the key mediator. This was supported by the use of a specific inhibitor of HIF2α (PT-2385) that was able to completely abrogate the effect of hypoxia-driven cell cycle re-entry. PT-2385 blocked the upregulation of HIF2α specific transcripts and partially blocked ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that the pathway connecting hypoxia to cell cycle is proximal to MEK, with possible involvement of factors upstream of MEK such as RAF, RAS and EGFR. PHD3 is known to be highly upregulated in hypoxia and is known to negatively regulate the level of EGFR at the cell surface in certain conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, we were unable to assess the potential role of EGFR in macrophages due to the low abundance of the protein as estimated by western blot (data not shown).</p><p id="P23">The dNTP hydrolase and antiviral restriction factor SAMHD1 is known to be regulated by cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The block to HIV-1 infection is governed by CDK1-dependent phosphorylation at T592 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. SAMHD1 is phosphorylated when macrophages re-enter the cell cycle from G0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Although there are instances where cell cycle-associated proteins such as cyclin D3 can restrict viruses independent of cell cycle status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, SAMHD1 restriction of HIV-1 is closely related to cell cycle status. As expected, the primate lentivirus SIVmac, encoding an accessory protein Vpx that degrades SAMHD1, infected macrophages to a similar extent under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, suggesting SIVmac is likely to be insensitive to macrophage cell cycle status. These data reinforced that cell cycle status has significant impacts on susceptibility to viruses that do not have a means of antagonising the activity of SAMHD1, for example HIV-1. Here we observed that the cell cycle entry associated with hypoxia, or PHD inhibition, results in phosphorylation and deactivation of SAMHD1 antiviral activity in macrophages. This phenotype could be blocked by pharmacological MEK inhibition as well as CDK4/6 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B&amp;C</xref>), indicating that the proliferation pathway activated by hypoxia was similar to that previously elaborated in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. As predicted, HIV-2 - a lentivirus that encodes the SAMHD1 antagonist Vpx - is not impacted by hypoxia-induced cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), confirming the primacy of SAMHD1 in the restriction of HIV-1 infection in macrophages. These data have implications for the maintenance and expansion of HIV-1 reservoirs in lymphoid tissue where oxygen tensions are estimated to be between 1-5%. Drugs that selectively block the link between HIF2 and cell cycle progression could be used therapeutically.</p><p id="P24">Using single cell transcriptomic analysis of two independent cancer datasets, we observed an association between hypoxia and cell cycle progression transcriptional signatures in tumour associated macrophages (TAM), consistent with our model of hypoxia driving cell cycle progression. Moreover, HIF2α has been reported to be particularly highly expressed in tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. TAM-associated HIF2α has also been correlated with angiogenesis in breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. This may be related to the fact that anaemia during cancers is common <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues during anaemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> could result in HIF2α activation, and macrophage cell cycle entry.</p><p id="P25">Inhibition of cell cycle is a central mechanism of cancer therapies, and future work should include an assessment of the relationship between TAM cell cycle inhibition and their modulation of the micro-environment, including anti-tumour activity and risk of metastasis. As deactivation of SAMHD1 in hypoxic macrophages renders them hyper-susceptible to lentiviral transduction, there is potential for efficient lentiviral gene delivery to target TAM and reverse the immune suppressive / metastatic environment.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P26">Our study was limited by use of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cells and lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> functional data. We did however demonstrate the relationship between hypoxia, HIF2α and cell cycle re-entry in both tissue macrophages from mice as well as human monocyte-derived macrophages.</p><p id="P27">In summary, we show that low oxygen tension results in a PHD-initiated cascade and a HIF2α-directed hypoxic transcriptional program in macrophages and reversible cell cycle reentry. This response is the result of the activation of the canonical MEK-ERK pathway. Our work paves the way for further exploration of the impacts of oxygen tension on macrophage functions in inflammation, immunity, neoplasia and viral reservoirs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cells, plasmids and viruses</title><p id="P28">293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.
