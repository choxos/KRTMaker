Multiple domains bind to different receptors, including TGF-β receptors TβRI (ALK5) and TβRII through domains 1-3, and prototypic family member TGM1 binds the cell surface co-receptor CD44 through domains 4-5. This allows TGM1 to induce T lymphocyte Foxp3 expression, characteristic of regulatory (Treg) cells, and to activate a range of TGF-β-responsive cell types. In contrast, a related protein, TGM4, targets a much more restricted cell repertoire, primarily acting on myeloid cells, with less potent effects on T cells and lacking activity on other TGF-β-responsive cell types. TGM4 binds avidly to myeloid cells by flow cytometry, and can outcompete TGM1 for cell binding. Analysis of receptor binding in comparison to TGM1 reveals a 10-fold higher affinity than TGM1 for TGFβR-I (TβRI), but a 100-fold lower affinity for TβRII through Domain 3. Consequently, TGM4 is more dependent on co-receptor binding; in addition to CD44, TGM4 also engages CD49d (Itga4) through Domains 1-3, as well as CD206 and Neuropilin-1 through Domains 4 and 5. TGM4 was found to effectively modulate macrophage populations, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-driven inflammatory cytokine production and boosting interleukin (IL)-4-stimulated responses such as Arginase-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results reveal that the modular nature of TGMs has allowed the fine tuning of the binding affinities of the TβR- and co-receptor binding domains to establish cell specificity for TGF-β signalling in a manner that cannot be attained by the mammalian cytokine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Many infectious agents exploit the pivotal host immunoregulatory pathway driven by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In the case of helminth worm parasites, their fecundity and longevity depends upon a dampened immune system, in some cases muted by regulatory cells induced by cytokines such as TGF-β. Hence, it was remarkable to discover a helminth, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, that has convergently evolved a functionally active, but structurally unrelated, mimic of TGF-β (named TGM1) that binds strongly to mammalian plasma membrane TGF-β receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. TGM1 acts as a fully functional activator of the TGFβ signalling pathway, down-regulating inflammation in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and inducing the differentiation of both mouse and human immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) through the canonical transcription factor Foxp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The ability of this parasite to drive Treg differentiation may therefore be explained by its production of TGM1 as central part of a strategy to evade host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P3">TGF-β activates cells through a heterodimeric receptor composed of two transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, TβRI (ALK5) and TβRII; its mode of binding is to first ligate TβRII, forming a complex that recruits and phosphorylates TβRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. In contrast, TGM1 was found to independently bind both receptor subunits, with a particularly high affinity for TβRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. TGM1 is comprised of 5 modular domains distantly related to the complement control protein (CCP) or Sushi protein family, with Domains 1 and 2 binding TβRI, while Domain 3 binds TβRII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Thus, loss of any of Domains 1-3 completely ablated activity of TGM1, confirming that binding to both subunits of the receptor is required for signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Recently, we ascertained that Domains 4 and 5 of TGM1 confer an additional binding specificity, for CD44, which potentiates activation of cells through the TGF-β pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. CD44 is widely expressed on hematopoietic cells, as well as some stem cell populations, interacting with extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. It is prominent in immune cell types, upregulated in memory/effector T cells, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and includes a cytoplasmic domain capable of signal transduction. Hence, it was suggested that TGM1 has evolved to preferentially target CD44<sup>+</sup> immune cells for modulation during <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P5"><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> expresses a suite of proteins related to TGM1, forming a multi-gene family of at least 10 members with up to 7 CCP-like domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Among these homologues, TGM2 and TGM3 with 93-100% identity in Domains 1-3 showed similar functional activity to TGM1 activating the signal pathway in a fibroblastic reporter cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, in the same assay, TGM4 was found to be inactive, despite the high sensitivity of the reporter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. and 80.2% amino acid identity to TGM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1 A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We therefore performed a more detailed investigation of TGM4, which we now report differs from TGM1 in affinity for each TβR, and interacts with a wider range of co-receptors, resulting in a higher level of cell specificity that targets myeloid cells rather than fibroblasts. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of co-receptors, in addition to the TβRs, in delivering signals through the TGF-β pathway. This remarkable modular gene family has thereby gained the ability, unlike TGF-β itself, to selectively target different host cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Selective activation of T cells and macrophages by TGM4</title><p id="P7">The novel TGF-β mimic (TGM) family from <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> was first identified by activation of the TGF-β-responsive fibroblast-derived reporter cell line MFB-F11, and subsequently shown to induce the transcription factor Foxp3 in naïve murine T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], TGM4 showed no activity in the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a</xref>,). However, a small but significant signal was found with a fibroblastic (NIH3T3) CAGA12 luciferase reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). We therefore examined whether TGM4 could drive Foxp3 in mouse splenic T cells and found positive induction albeit at lower efficacy than TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 c</xref>), while another family member that was inactive on MFB-F11 cells (TGM7) was also negative for Foxp3 induction. Hence, TGM4 presented a uniquely discordant activity that we investigated further.</p><p id="P8">To confirm that TGM4 was, like TGM1, acting through the TGF-β signalling pathway in T cells, cultures were supplemented with the small molecule inhibitor SB431542 which blocks the kinase activity of ALK-4, 5 (TβRI) and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d</xref>, while TGM4 was less potent than TGM1 in inducing Foxp3, both ligands were fully suppressed by addition of SB431542, as previously established for TGM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P9">We then probed different cell types for TGM1- and TGM4-stimulated phosphorylation of SMAD2 that is immediately downstream of the TβRI ALK5 kinase in the signalling pathway. Cell lines were incubated with these ligands, and mammalian TGF-β, for 60 minutes, then lysed and analysed by Western blot with anti-SMAD2 and anti-phospho-SMAD2 (p-SMAD2) antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 e, f</xref>, TGM-4-stimulated MFB-F11 fibroblasts showed only low levels of SMAD2 phosphorylation in contrast to TGM1 and TGF-β. However, in the EL4 T cell line, and in macrophage lines (J774A.1 and RAW264.7) all three ligands were equally active. We also tested a hepatoma cell line, HepG2, which responded only to TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 e</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We then investigated responses of primary murine hematopoietic cells, measuring SMAD2 phosphorylation 1 hr following stimulation with the different ligands. When CD4<sup>+</sup> murine splenic T cells were stimulated with TGM4, responses were much weaker than with TGF-β or TGM-1, and indeed did not attain statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 g</xref>). As similar cells were capable of Foxp3 induction after 72 hrs co-incubation with TGM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 c</xref>), the possibility was raised that activation follows a slower time course, as indeed observed for TGM1 compared to TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. To test this, we employed imaging flow cytometry to measure nuclear localisation of SMAD2/3 in splenic T cells at 1 and 16 hrs post-stimulation; although at the earlier time point TGM4-stimulated T cells were at baseline values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2 a</xref>), by 16 hrs they were elevated and comparable to cells activated with the other ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2 b</xref>). Thus, while TGM4 has a relatively subdued ability to activate TGF-β signalling in primary T cells, it is sufficient to induce measurable responses over a 16-72 hr time frame.</p><p id="P11">We similarly analyzed SMAD activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages; in this subset, responses to each ligand were comparable, with TGM4 also inducing a significant level of pSMAD2/3 measured by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 h</xref>) and SMAD2/3 nuclear localisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2 c</xref>) within 1 hour of stimulation. In additional analyses, TGM4 was found to lack activity on other epithelial (NM18) and fibroblast (NIH 3T3) cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2d, e</xref>), but did induce SMAD2 phosphorylation in dendritic cells, represented both as cell lines (MuTu, D1) and bone marrow-derived DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2 g, h</xref>). Hence, TGM4 displays a strong predilection for cells of the myeloid lineage.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TGF-β Receptor Binding by TGM4</title><p id="P12">We next tested whether activation of the SMAD signalling pathway by TGM4 could be induced by the same domains (D1/2/3) that are required for activation by TGM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Cells incubated with full-length (D1/2/3/4/5) or truncated (D1-3 or D4-5) portions of TGM1 and TGM4 were probed for SMAD2 phosphorylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, only full-length or D1-3 of TGM1 elicited a p-SMAD response in MFB-F11 fibroblasts, but neither full-length nor D1-3 of TGM4 did so. In contrast, when a macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was tested, both proteins drove p-SMAD, and for both ligands activity resided, albeit attenuated, in D1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To investigate whether TGM4 differs from TGM1 in its interactions with the two TGF-β receptor chains (TβRI and TβRII), we used a system of endogenous expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-TGM fusion proteins in cell lines, followed by anti-eGFP antibody pull-down of the ligand and any associated receptors. In this manner, we identified that TGM1 and TGM4, but not TGM7, forms complexes with both TβRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 c</xref>) and TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). While TGM4 co-precipitated TβRI more strongly than did TGM1, the interaction with TβRII was substantially weaker than observed with TGM1.</p><p id="P14">To ascertain whether TGM4 binds directly to each receptor chain, and to understand the respective receptor affinities of TGM1 and TGM4, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were made for binding to TβRI and TβRII. SPR analysis showed substantially higher affinity of TGM4 than TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 e, f</xref>) for TβRI, estimated at 3-5 nM vs 70 nM respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). Notably, TGM4 binding to TβRI shows a faster on-rate and slower off-rate than does TGM1. Unlike the direct binding of TGMs to TβRI, it is well established that TGF-β has little direct affinity for TβRI unless complexed to TβRII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P15">In contrast to the higher affinity of TGM4 for TβRI, binding to TβRII was found to be weak by SPR, at 116 μM, representing &gt;100-fold lower affinity than TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 g</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). NMR analysis showed small but significant shifts of several signals when<sup>15</sup>N-labeled Domain 3 of TGM4 was titrated with increasing concentrations of TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 h</xref>), also indicative of no more than moderate binding affinity. As this raised the possibility that the physiological target of TGM4 is another type II receptor, we performed SPR assays with ActRII and BMPRII, two major receptors of this type. However, we found no evidence of direct binding to either of these receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3, a, b</xref>). In addition, no interactions were observed between Domain 2 and the type I Activin receptor, ALK4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3 c</xref>). We therefore concluded that the cognate receptors for TGM4 are TβRI (ALK5) and TβRII, similar to TGM1, although the two parasite proteins differ markedly, and reciprocally, in affinity for these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CD44 Binding by TGM4</title><p id="P16">TGM1 and -4 share the same 5-domain structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1 a</xref>); in the case of TGM1 we showed by truncation analysis that only Domains 1-3 were essential for biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]; however, Domains 4 and 5 (D4/5) enhance the potency of TGM1, binding to a cell surface co-receptor identified as CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. To determine if TGM4 also binds CD44, we expressed eGFP-tagged TGM1 and TGM4 in MFB-F11, RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells, followed by GFP-TRAP pulldown and Western blotting analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a</xref>, a strong CD44 band was observed with both TGM1 and TGM4 in the fibroblast and macrophage cell lines, but not in hepatocytes. Quantification from replicate Western blot experiments showed that CD44 was considerably more prominent in RAW264.7 cells than MFB-F11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 b</xref>). In addition, higher TβRI levels were co-precipitated with TGM4 than TGM1 in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a, c</xref>). In contrast, TβRII co-precipitation was significantly greater with TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a, d</xref>), consistent with the weak TGM4 binding to this receptor noted above. Taken together, these data suggest that the strength of interaction with CD44 and both TβRs could be related to the differential activity of TGM4 on these two cell types.</p><p id="P17">To dissect interactions of TGM4 with each receptor at the domain level, eGFP fusions of truncated proteins were designed, expressing D1-3 or D4-5 of TGM1 and TGM4 in RAW264.7 cells. Lysates of cells expressing each construct were immunoprecipitated using GFP-TRAP beads and analysed by Western blotting. D1-3 constructs precipitated the TβRs, but not CD44, while when D4-5 was expressed, the converse was true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 e</xref>), as recently reported for TGM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P18">To more precisely evaluate TGM4-CD44 interactions, the binding of TGM1 and TGM4 with recombinant human and mouse CD44 was measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). For these measurements, the D4-5 fragments of each TGM were employed, as this segment of TGM1 carries the CD44 binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 f, g</xref>, both helminth proteins bound each CD44 molecule with similar affinities, which were determined to be in the 50-200 nM range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To establish whether CD44 was essential for TGM4 activation of myeloid cells, we tested control RAW264.7 macrophages, and a line derived from these cells from which CD44 had been genetically deleted by CRISPR-Cas9. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 h, i</xref>, SMAD phosphorylation was reduced to background levels in macrophages lacking CD44, when tested with a range of concentrations of TGM4 that elicited strong responses in CD44-sufficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Preferential Binding of TGM4 to Myeloid Cells</title><p id="P20">We recently reported that Alexa Fluor-488 (AF488)-labelled TGM1 binds strongly to the surface of MFB-F11 and EL4 cells, as measured by flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. We noted that TGM4 bound these, and other, cell lines with greater intensity than seen with TGM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig. 4a</xref>). Preferential binding of TGM4 was most evident on two macrophage cell lines (J774A-1 and RAW264.7), while no binding was observed to the hepatocyte line, HepG2. Notably, the intensity of binding to J774 macrophages was significantly higher than each of the other immune-derived lines.</p><p id="P21">We then tested TGM1 and TGM4 binding to primary peritoneal exudate cells, by flow cytometry using AF594-labelled proteins. Both ligands showed extensive binding to CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>low/-</sup> tissue resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a</xref>), and in each case staining was more intense by TGM4 compared to TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Staining of T lymphocytes was quite heterogenous, while 100% of macrophages were bound by TGM4.</p><p id="P22">Although TGM4 showed more intense staining, it is possible that differences in efficiency of labelling or protein stability affected by coupling Alexa-Fluor to exposed lysine residues could be responsible. However, when we co-stained with both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c</xref>), TGM4 was able to outcompete TGM1, reducing the TGM1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d</xref>) while the TGM4 signal was unaffected by the presence of TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 e</xref>). Although weaker, TGM1 binding correlated closely with TGM4 (giving a diagonal profile in doubly-stained cells) indicating that the two ligands bind similar populations of host cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TGM4 is more avid than TGM1 in surface binding to immune system cells, with a strong affinity for myeloid cells.</p><p id="P23">To examine the role of CD44 in surface interactions, we deleted the <italic>Cd44</italic> gene in RAW264.7 cells by CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 4 b</xref>). We then tested CD44-sufficient and-deficient cells by flow cytometry with AF488-labelled full-length and truncated TGM4 proteins comprising D1-3 or D4-5. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 f</xref>, we found that in the absence of either CD44, or D4-5, cell surface binding is effectively abolished. Thus, on CD44-sufficient RAW264.7 cells (upper row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 f</xref>), binding of full-length TGM4, or of D4-5, correlates closely with expression of CD44, while D1-3 shows only a low level of fluorescence; in the absence of CD44 expression (lower row) a similar residual level of binding is observed in full-length TGM4 and D1-3, suggesting this represents interactions with the TβRI/II proteins. It was also noted that the intensity of binding (MFI) of D4-5 was attenuated compared to full-length TGM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 f</xref>, top right panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 g</xref>). Similar data were obtained with MFB-F11 cells with intact or deleted CD44 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 4 c, d</xref>). As with RAW264.7 cells, D4/5 binding to MFB-F11 was lower than full-length TGM4, suggesting that D1-3 may contribute to the overall binding affinity for CD44. A similar involvement of D1-3 in optimal CD44 binding was also indicated by the ability of the unlabelled D4-5 to diminish but not fully inhibit the binding of full-length AF488-labelled TGM4 to RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 h, i</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In the case of TGM1, Domain 1 was found to contribute to the ability of domain 2 to bind TβRI, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], explaining earlier data that Domains 1-3 were all essential for biological activity in the MFB-F11 assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. A similar truncation analysis for TGM-4 was performed, evaluating pSMAD2/3 activation, indicating a parallel dependency, as in the absence of any of the first 3 domains, signalling was ablated, while in the absence of D4 and/or D5, an attenuated level of signalling could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Pull-down of TGM4-binding proteins from splenocytes revealed, in addition to CD44 and TGM4 itself, 4 more candidates: integrin α4 (CD49d), CD72, Mrc1 (CD206) and Lirb3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a</xref>). While CD44 was evident in pull-downs from MFB-F11 cells, none of these other candidates were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 b</xref>). We also performed similar procedures on the macrophage cell line J774, confirming that TGM4 interacted with CD49d and CD72, in addition to CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 c</xref>). In addition, in all cells probed with TGM4, neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) was identified. Notably, parallel analyses of the same three cell populations with TGM1 failed to show interactions with these CD49d, CD72 or Nrp-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 d-f</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Taken together, these data demonstrated that TGM4 associates not only with the CD44 co-receptor, but also CD49d and CD72 which were not detected on fibroblasts, and with Nrp-1 which was expressed in all cell types studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CD44-Dependent and Independent Co-Receptors</title><p id="P27">In co-precipitation experiments, partner proteins may interact with different members of a complex. To ascertain whether TGMs directly bind co-receptor proteins, or do so in conjunction with CD44, we performed pulldown experiments in RAW264.7 cells with unaltered or deleted <italic>Cd44</italic>. In CD44-sufficient cells, CD49d, CD206 and Nrp-1 were all detectable in precipitates from cells incubated with biotinylated TGM4, but not TGM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 a</xref>); the loss of CD44 from RAW264.7 cells ablated CD206 and Nrp-1 detection, but CD49d remained present in the TGM4 pull down. Hence although CD206 and Nrp-1 are found only in TGM4 complexes, their presence is dependent on CD44. A parallel result was observed in MFB-F11 cells, in which CD49d is not expressed, but NRP1 is present; as with RAW264.7 cells, NRP1 is precipitated only in CD44-sufficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 b</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We next asked whether the CD44-binding domains D4-5 are required for association with these three co-receptors; the same streptavidin pull down system was used with cells incubated with biotin labelled full-length (D1-5), D1-3 or D4-5 TGM4. CD206 and NRP1 were found only in full-length and D4-5 constructs, consistent with them being dependent on CD44. In contrast, CD49d was associated with D1-3 proteins, which also bind the two TGF-β receptors, albeit the binding is weaker than with full-length TGM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 c</xref>).</p><p id="P29">CD49d and Nrp-1 knockout cells were then tested to determine if either gene was required for signalling in response to TGM4.

However, in neither case did gene deletion reduce responses measured by pSMAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 d,e</xref>).

In mimicking TGF-β, <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> may have adopted a successful strategy for immune evasion that is shared, in different fashion, by many diverse infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The emergence of multiple homologues which form their own multigene family may represent redundancy (for example, if the host generates antibodies to one form, the others are still effective) or specialization (such that different family members fulfill different functions and/or target different host tissues). The latter may hold true in some cases at least, as 4 of the family members (TGM7 to 10) are only expressed by larval stages in the intestinal submucosa, and not by luminal-dwelling adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P34">The TGM family are modular constructs with between 3 and 7 homology domains all distantly related to the CCP or Sushi family (Pfam00084), modified by short insertions that evidently allow evolutionary flexibility and the ability to bind novel interaction partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Both TGM1 and TGM4 are 5-domain proteins and we find here that they share multi-specificity mediated through separate domains, Domain 2 binding TβRI and Domain 3 binding TβRII. Although the corresponding domains of the two proteins are highly conserved (86-90% amino acid identity), we find sharply contrasting binding affinities, with TGM4 being tenfold stronger for TβRI, yet 100-fold weaker in binding TβRII.</p><p id="P35">These differences may account for the inability of TGM4 to activate a fibroblast reporter line, while retaining some ability to induce T cell expression of Foxp3, the canonical transcription factor that specifies suppressive Tregs which are expanded during <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, TGM4 is markedly more active on myeloid cells than other cell types; this is perhaps not surprising given the pivotal role of macrophages and neutrophils in priming and mediating protective immunity to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. In future studies, it would be interesting to target TGM4 by active or passive immunisation and monitor the effects on myeloid cell subsets during parasite infection.</p><p id="P36">An intriguing question is why TGM4 has evolved a lower affinity for TβRII than other members of the gene family. One answer may be that this, together with the recruitment of co-receptors, allows the ligand to be more discriminatory. It is likely that the selectivity of TGM4 is based on a continuum threshold; although MFB-F11 fibroblasts do express the CD44 co-receptor (and can bind TGM4 in flow cytometry assays), either the expression level is too low, and/or the additional coreceptors required for high affinity interactions are absent, resulting in the failure of TGM4 to assemble an activation complex. The ability of TGM1 to stimulate fibroblasts can thus be attributed to its &gt;10-fold higher affinity for TβRII. Thus the nuances of differential affinities for TβRI and II, and the disparate levels of expression of essential co-receptors in diverse cell types, determine whether receptor ligation is sufficient to drive signalling. It is also possible that co-receptors directly deliver secondary signals that contribute to target cell activation, a question that we are now investigating.</p><p id="P37">The affinities of TGM family members for TβRs may thus be calibrated by evolution to depend on interaction with co-receptors such as CD44 that is bound by both TGM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and TGM4 interactions. Notably, TGM4 interacts with a broader range of co-receptor partners, including CD49d, CD206 and Nrp-1, and while CD44 interactions are governed by D4-5, CD49d interacts with D1-3. This may explain while cell binding by TGM4 is primarily mediated by D4-5, it is diminished compared to full-length TGM4 in which D1-3 may contribute.</p><p id="P38">CD49d is an integrin α chain subunit (α4, Itga4), that combines with β integrins; dimerised to β1 integrin (CD29) it comprises the VLA (very late antigen) 4 surface marker that mediates binding to VCAM1 (CD106), expressed on eosinophils, myeloid cells and mesenchymal stem cells, in an interaction controlling leukocyte endothelial adhesion, rolling and extravasation. When combined with β7 integrin, CD49d forms a homing receptor which binds mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM) in mucosal tissues. CD49d expression is raised in many stimulated cell types, such as activated eosinophil subsets compared to basal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Thus by targeting CD49d, TGM4 can encompass multiple immune cell subsets that are instrumental to protective immunity against infection.</p><p id="P39">Other integrins facilitate the activation of latent TGF-β, principally αv combined with different β subunits, releasing mature TGF-β from the latency associated peptide within extracellular matrix; however α4 integrin is not implicated in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. As we ascertained that anti-TGF-β antibody did not reduce signal from TGM4, it is unlikely that release of host TGF-β contributes significantly to the effect observed.</p><p id="P40">Future work will aim not only to provide finer detail on how TGM proteins interface with multiple receptors, at the structural level and in terms of target cell populations, but also to evaluate the in vivo role of these products.
