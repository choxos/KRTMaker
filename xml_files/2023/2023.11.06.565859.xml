The FRET biosensor GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR1, which permits single-cell GA measurements <italic>in vivo</italic>, was previously used to observe a GA gradient correlated with cell length in dark-grown but not light-grown hypocotyls. We sought to understand how light signalling integrates into cellular GA regulation. Here we show how the E3 ligase COP1 and transcription factor HY5 play central roles in directing cellular GA distribution in skoto- and photomorphogenic hypocotyls, respectively. We demonstrate that the expression pattern of biosynthetic enzyme <italic>GA20ox1</italic> is the key determinant of the GA gradient in dark-grown hypocotyls and is a target of COP1 signalling. We engineered a second generation GPS2 biosensor with improved orthogonality and reversibility to show the cellular pattern of GA depletion during the transition to growth in the light. This GA depletion partly explains the resetting of hypocotyl growth dynamics during photomorphogenesis. Achieving cell-level resolution has revealed how GA distributions link environmental conditions with morphology and morphological plasticity and the GPS2 biosensor is an ideal tool for GA studies in further conditions, organs and plant species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gibberellin</kwd><kwd>GA</kwd><kwd>cell growth</kwd><kwd>Gibberellin Perception Sensor 2</kwd><kwd>nlsGPS2</kwd><kwd>FRET biosensor</kwd><kwd>fluorescence live-imaging</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>hypocotyl</kwd><kwd>skotomorphogenesis</kwd><kwd>photomorphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The cellular dynamics of growth regulatory phytohormones act as signal integration nodes that allow plant development to continually adjust to environmental conditions. Gibberellin (GA) hormones are required for cell and organ elongation in many developmental contexts, including several with implications for agricultural yields such as germination, budbreak, stem elongation, branching and flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gao and Chu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Early in the life-cycle of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, GA mediated organ elongation is highly plastic in response to the light environment. Pre-germination, light triggers GA accumulation that allows elongating radicles to emerge through seed coats, while post-germination, darkness triggers GA accumulation in elongating hypocotyls as part of the skotomorphogenesis program, i.e. etiolation, allowing for seedling emergence from soil. In contrast, post-germination illumination represses GA accumulation and hypocotyl elongation as part of photomorphogenesis or deetiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Weller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reid et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alabadí et al., 2008</xref>). We developed a genetically-encoded FRET biosensor for GA, nuclear localised Gibberellin Perception Sensor 1 (nlsGPS1), that revealed cellular GA dynamics in skoto- and photomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, skotomorphogenic hypocotyls showed low GA levels in the apical hook grading to high GA levels in the sub-apical hypocotyl, a cellular dynamic that correlated with cell length patterns. However, it remained unclear how this cellular GA gradient arises, is reprogrammed for photomorphogenesis, and is quantitatively related to cell elongation.</p><p id="P4">A cellular gradient of a mobile hormone such as GA can emerge from a number of differentially regulated enzymatic steps including early biosynthetic steps leading to the mobile intermediate GA12, the penultimate step catalyzed by GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASEs (GA20ox), the final biosynthetic step catalyzed by GIBBERELLIN 3-OXIDASEs (GA3ox), and catabolic steps catalyzed by GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASES (GA2ox) or CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 714, SUBFAMILY A, POLYPEPTIDE 1s (CYP714A1s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hedden, 2020</xref>; Yamaguchi et al., 2014). In addition to the etiolated hypocotyl gradient, nlsGPS1 also revealed a GA gradient correlated with cell length in the elongation zone of Arabidopsis root tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). This finding controverted a computationally simulated root GA gradient based in part on the expression pattern of a GA20ox enzyme as this step was regarded as rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Band et al., 2012</xref>). Using biosensing, chemical and genetic perturbations, and further mathematical modelling, a key role for the GA3ox step in controlling the elongation zone GA gradient was recently revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rizza et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remained unclear which steps are patterned to articulate cellular GA dynamics in the hypocotyl or how they are themselves regulated.</p><p id="P5">Etiolated hypocotyls express GA20ox1, GA20ox2, GA3ox1, GA2ox1, GA2ox2, GA2ox6, Ga2ox8 and GA2ox9 enzymes, and the expression of several enzymes changes dynamically in response to light during Arabidopsis de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). In de-etiolating pea seedlings, red, far-red and blue light inhibit expression of GA3ox genes and lower GA levels within 2-4 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reid et al., 2002</xref>). We observed low GA levels without a clear GA gradient in light grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that elevated cellular GA levels in the sub-apical hypocotyl would be depleted during de-etiolation. Phytochrome inhibition of hypocotyl elongation is well known to involve lowered GA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kamiya and García-Martínez, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hedden and Phillips, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">García-Martinez and Gil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Halliday and Fankhauser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vandenbussche et al., 2005</xref>). However, a double mutant in Arabidopsis red and far-red-sensing PHYTOCHROME A and PHYTOCHROME B (<italic>phyAphyB</italic>) expressing nlsGPS1 showed only modestly elevated GA levels in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). Blue light-sensing CRYPTOCHROMES (CRY1 and CRY2) are positive regulators of the catabolic <italic>GA2ox</italic> genes and negative regulators of the biosynthesis genes <italic>GA20ox1</italic> and <italic>GA3ox1</italic> in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). PHY and CRY signaling both antagonize the central skotomorphogenesis regulator CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin-ligase with myriad degradation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">McNellis et al., 1994</xref>). Among these, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a transcription factor playing a key role in promoting photomorphogenesis in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Koornneef et al., 1980</xref>). On the other hand, transcription factors promoting skotomorphogenesis include a series of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Leivar and Quail, 2011</xref>) and brassinosteroid responsive BRI1-EMS SUPRESSOR1 (BES1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yin et al., 2002</xref>) and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Although PIFs, BES1 and BZR1 are dependent on GA signaling for removal of antagonist DELLA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">de Lucas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gallego-Bartolomé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Oh et al., 2014</xref>), there is also evidence that they can promote GA accumulation in positive feedback loops acting in rapid elongation growth of the sub-apical hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here we investigated the quantitative effects of the above enzymatic steps and light signaling components on the cellular GA dynamics of etiolated hypocotyls. In darkness, PIF and BR signalling influenced GA homeostasis but were not required for establishing the GA gradient while COP1 played a critical role in GA accumulation in the sub-apical hypocotyl. Although GA2ox catabolism contributed to limiting GA from the apical hook, we pinpointed spatial control over GA20ox1 as a key generator of the GA gradient as its expression correlated with cellular GA accumulation in wildtype and mutants and induction of GA20ox1 expression strongly raised GA levels across the etiolated hypocotyl. In the light, PHY and CRY signaling repressed GA accumulation, in part through HY5, and a <italic>phyAphyBcry1cry2</italic> mutant restored the skotomorphogenic GA gradient. In order to observe the effects of deetiolation on patterning of GA, we created a next generation GPS2 biosensor that has improved reversibility over GPS1. GPS2 was also engineered to have increased orthogonality and showed a loss of GA hypersensitivity phenotypes previously observed in Arabidopsis expressing GPS1. During deetiolation, GA remained low in the apical hook and depleted from the sub-apical hypocotyl, in keeping with lowered biosynthetic and increased catabolic gene expression. Interestingly, a novel <italic>ga2ox</italic> heptuple mutant overelongated during deetiolation. Taken together, our results indicate that GA accumulation is necessary for growth of sub-apical cells but is not sufficient for setting cell length. Additionally, depletion of GA from the apical hook is not developmentally meaningful, but timely GA depletion during deetiolation is important for growth arrest.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Skotomorphogenesis agonist PIFs are required to maintain, but not generate GA gradient in dark-grown hypocotyls</title><p id="P7">We previously demonstrated a reduction of GA levels in a quadruple mutant (<italic>pifq</italic>) lacking four PIFs in the 3 day old dark grown hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>) and thus PIFs represented candidate light signalling components that could drive GA accumulation patterns in the etiolated hypocotyl. However, the <italic>pifq</italic> mutant is photomorphogenic with a relatively short hypocotyl and open cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Leivar et al., 2008</xref>) and thus GA regulation could be an indirect consequence of a broader fate switching. To further explore the effect of PIFs on hypocotyl development and GA distribution we monitored the growth of <italic>pifq</italic> and Col-0 in the dark for 72 hours after germination using an infra-red camera. Apical hook development consists of three phases: formation, maintenance and opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vandenbussche et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gallego-Bartolomé et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed the <italic>pifq</italic> mutant completing the formation phase and then opening without entering the maintenance phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). We imaged the upper hypocotyl (0- ~1000 μm from the shoot apical meristem) and analysed GA levels in Col-0 nlsGPS1 and <italic>pifq</italic> nlsGPS1 at 32 hours after germination when Col-0 was still in the maintenance phase and <italic>pifq</italic> was fully open. We observed that <italic>pifq</italic> seedlings have reduced GA levels in the sub-apical hypocotyl and have no apical-basal GA gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c and e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). However, at 24 hours after germination when seedlings were at the end of formation phase, both Col-0 and <italic>pifq</italic> have an apical-basal GA gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 c and d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The presence of and subsequent loss of the gradient in <italic>pifq</italic> indicates PIFs are not required for the formation of the GA gradient but they are required for its maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Brassinosteroid distribution does not explain GA gradient in dark-grown hypocotyls</title><p id="P8">Brassinosteroids are known regulators of hypocotyl elongation and GA metabolism making them a candidate for controlling GA patterning. Brassinosteroids have a dual regulatory role on GA levels promoting both GA biosynthesis and GA catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Unterholzner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albertos et al., 2022</xref>). We have established that the GA gradient is set up early in development. To investigate whether BR could be establishing this gradient, we first reduced BR levels by growing Col-0 nlsGPS1 in the presence of the BR biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole (BRZ). To avoid germination effects, we germinated Col-0 nlsGPS1 on media and transferred seedlings to BRZ at 48 hours after a germination light pulse. We observed an overall decrease in GA levels, however a clear apical-basal gradient of GA was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f and g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Second, we increased BR levels by growing Col-0 nlsGPS1 in the presence of epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) and again saw an overall decrease of GA levels in the hypocotyl with persistence of the apical-basal gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f and g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). These results support a complex role for brassinosteroids in the regulation of GA levels and indicate that BR levels are optimised in the plant to give high levels of GA that are required for rapid elongation in the dark. However, the persistence of the gradient under altered brassinosteroid levels indicates that brassinosteroids are not responsible for apical-basal patterning of GA.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Skotomorphogenesis agonist COP1 is required for generating GA gradient and GA20ox1 and GA3ox1 expression in dark-grown hypocotyls</title><p id="P9">Photoreceptors play key roles in both GA responsiveness and modulating GA levels. CRY1 and PHYA have been shown to redundantly regulate expression of GA metabolic enzymes and to lower GA levels in pea hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reid et al., 2002</xref>) and indeed we have previously shown that in Arabidopsis the <italic>phyAphyB</italic> mutant has elevated levels of GA in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). CRYs are positive regulators of catabolic <italic>GA2ox</italic> genes and negative regulators of the biosynthesis genes <italic>GA20ox1</italic> and <italic>GA3ox1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).

To further investigate the role of the photoreceptors in establishing the GA gradient we created <italic>phyAphyBcry1cry2</italic> nlsGPS1. Under white light photomorphogenesis is severely delayed in this line and we observed elevated levels of GA forming an apical-basal gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). As PHYs and CRYs act to reduce GA levels in the light, we explored downstream targets of both CRY and PHY that act to establish the gradient in the dark.</p><p id="P10">The COP1 E3-ligase is inactivated by both photoreceptors and interacts with GA levels and signalling in promoting skotomorphogenesis. As COP1 is required to maintain high levels of GA in dark grown hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Weller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blanco-Touriñán et al., 2020</xref>) we explored the possibility that COP1 establishes the spatial distribution of GA. Using <italic>cop1-4</italic> nlsGPS1, we confirmed that GA levels are lower than WT and found that the apical-basal gradient is abrogated in dark-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c and d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). A primary target of COP1 is the transcription factor HY5, a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis, which accumulates in dark grown <italic>cop1-4</italic> seedlings (Osterlund et al., 2000). As in pea, the <italic>hy5</italic> mutation in the <italic>cop1-4</italic> background partially rescues both the phenotype and the GA levels of <italic>cop1-4</italic> in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Weller et al., 2009</xref>). However, using nlsGPS1 we observed that this rescue does not extend to the patterning of GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Together these results indicate that COP1 functions to prevent HY5 from repressing GA accumulation, though this function alone does not explain the central role for COP1 in regulating the GA gradient.</p><p id="P11">GA biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in a tissue specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Plackett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mitchum et al., 2006</xref>) and the complexity of GA metabolism provides many candidate regulators of the hypocotyl GA gradient. We previously showed the key regulatory steps controlling a GA gradient in light grown roots vary along the apical-basal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rizza et al., 2021</xref>). In order to identify the specific GA metabolism targets of the COP1/HY5 pathway, we carried out qPCR on 3 day old dark grown hypocotyls of WT, <italic>cop1-4</italic> and <italic>cop1-4/hy5-215</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).

To explore the effect of spatial distribution of GA on cell size we measured epidermal cell lengths in Col-0 nlsGPS1, <italic>ga20ox1/2/3</italic> nlsGPS1 and induced pUBQ-XVE-AtGA20ox1 lines. Cells in the apical hook are smaller than cells in the sub-apical hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gendreau et al., 1997</xref>) and this correlates with GA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, we observed Col-0 cell lengths increasing with distance from meristem in hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Sub-apical hypocotyl cells are shorter in <italic>ga20ox1/2/3</italic> indicating the level of GA in these cells is important for elongation. However, higher levels of GA in the apical hook region do not correlate to longer cells suggesting the relative depletion of GA is not important to keep these cells small. In light grown hypocotyls, where higher GA levels do stimulate cell elongation, GA response was also shown to be positionally dependent along the apical-basal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>).

Both properties are potentially related to the mechanism of GPS1 biosensing involving GA binding the AtGID1C moiety which then interacts with the truncated DELLA moiety from AtGAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Also, the stable transgenic lines expressing nlsGPS1 were hyposensitive to GA biosynthesis inhibitor Paclobutrazol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>), indicating interaction between GPS1 and endogenous GA signaling, likely the AtGID1C moiety with endogenous DELLA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). As FRET biosensor re-engineering can deliver improved variants (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rowe et al., 2023</xref>)), we aimed to increase GPS1 reversibility and orthogonality, i.e. reduce potential interference with and by endogenous signalling, via re-engineering the GID1-DELLA interaction interface. The high-resolution structure of the <italic>At</italic>GID1A-<italic>At</italic>GAI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>) revealed two potential interfacial electrostatic interactions that were conserved in GPS1 as Glutamate 13 (E13) on <italic>At</italic>GID1C and Lysine 51 (K51) on <italic>At</italic>GAI and Glutamate 28 (E28) on <italic>At</italic>GID1C and Arginine 54 on <italic>At</italic>GAI (R54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>).

We introduced four charge exchange mutations E13K and E28K (<italic>At</italic>GID1C) and K51E and R54E (<italic>At</italic>GAI) into GPS1 to restore the original two electrostatic interactions while abrogating interactions between GPS1 and endogenous GID1s and DELLAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c and d</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of GPS1 purified from yeast revealed successful restoration of GA emission ratio response and maintenance of a high affinity for bioactive GA<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> reversibility testing using buffer-exchange chromatography revealed that this quadruple charge exchange mutant detected a second GA treatment following a first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). Thus, this biosensor had improved reversibility, likely due to increased off-rate of the GID1-DELLA interaction resulting from inversion of the interfacial hydrostatic interactions. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing a nuclear localized variant of this biosensor were found to have lost the PAC hyposensitivity phenotypes of nlsGPS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>).

However, there is also a transient increase of some GA biosynthesis genes which could indicate localised GA increase e.g. in the apical hook. How these expression dynamics affect GA dynamics and whether this is relevant to the deetiolation response was not known. To determine whether the next generation biosensor could be used to image this decrease of GA, we examined how nlsGPS1 and nlsGPS2 respond during de-etiolation. We imaged the non-reversible Col-0 nlsGPS1 and the reversible Col-0 nlsGPS2 6 hours after transfer to the light in comparison with hypocotyls that had been kept in the dark. Col-0 nlsGPS1 did not show a reduction in GA levels, which is contrary to published studies but expected due to the low reversibility the biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). One the other hand, in Col-0 nlsGPS2 we observed a reduction in emission ratios along the length of the hypocotyl with the greatest reduction occurring in cells that had high GA levels in the dark (&gt;600μm from the meristem) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>).

We observed a greater decrease in the sub-apical hypocotyl than in the apical hook indicating a potential difference in the response to light in these sections of the hypocotyl. To determine potential mechanisms of these differential regulations, we examined the transcripts of selected metabolic genes in the dark at 1h, 3h and 6h transfer to light in the sub-apical hypocotyl and the apical hook. The selected transcripts examined were those that demonstrated the greatest fold change in the whole hypocotyl at 4 hour transfer to light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11a</xref>). Upon exposure to light, we observed a rapid decline of expression of <italic>GA20ox1</italic> and <italic>GA3ox1</italic> after 1 hour in both the apical hook and the sub-apical hypocotyl followed by an increase limited to the sub-apical hypocotyl at 3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>). The latter result could be an indication of a transient or internally localised GA increase in expanding cells during apical hook opening that was missed in our 6 hr analysis of epidermal and cortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). During the dark to light time course, <italic>GA2ox1</italic> expression increased simultaneously in the hypocotyl and the hook until 3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>).

For both embryo protrusion from seed coats in germination and seedling protrusion through soil in skotomorphogenesis, GA accumulation coordinates endogenous signals with environmental cues, particularly light and darkness, to appropriately direct organ growth. In Arabidopsis seed germination, PIF1 antagonizes GA biosynthesis and promotes catabolism (Gabriele et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2004), thus linking light with GA accumulation. Using the direct GA biosensor nlsGPS1, we previously uncovered a GA accumulation gradient in skotomorphogenic hypocotyl cells that was absent in photomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). It was known that light antagonises GA in this developmental context, but the complexity of light signalling and GA metabolism in Arabidopsis provided multiple potential points of regulation for cellular GA dynamics.</p><p id="P23">Here we investigated the biochemical basis of this hypocotyl GA gradient and discovered that COP1 signalling acting, presumably indirectly, on the patterned expression of the GA20ox1 biosynthetic enzyme is a central regulatory module. We also show, using a <italic>ga2oxhept</italic> mutant, that GA catabolism contributes to articulating the gradient. Although we previously showed the <italic>pifq</italic> mutant did have lower GA levels in the dark, we now demonstrate that PIFs were dispensable for the GA gradient formation and were instead key for maintenance of skotomorphogenesis. Brassinosteroid signalling has been shown to both promote and repress GA accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Unterholzner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albertos et al., 2022</xref>), but providing epi-brassinolide or BRZ inhibitor did not abolish the GA gradient. As PIF and BR patterning are unlikely to explain GA20ox1 expression in the sub-apical hypocotyl and HY5 activity is limited in the dark, determining the responsible regulators downstream of COP1 will be an interesting topic for a future study.</p><p id="P24">The discovery of a GA gradient correlated with cell length in etiolated hypocotyls was not evidence of GA levels acting in a simple dose-response relationship with elongation. Rather, overaccumulation of GA in the <italic>ga2oxhept</italic> mutant and after induction of <italic>GA20ox1</italic> expression did not alter cell elongation patterning and thus we can conclude that GA accumulation is not alone sufficient to set cell length in the dark. A similar dynamic was determined in Arabidopsis root elongation in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rizza et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, GA is required for subapical hypocotyl cell elongation and a spatially resolved lowering of GA levels will be required to fully reveal the quantitative relationship between GA and the cell elongation gradient. A model in which local GA concentrations cooperate with levels of other growth factors (e.g. PIFs, brassinosteroid) to set cell length would have distinct implications for morphogenesis control than, for example, one in which a low threshold of GA potentiates growth (i.e. via DELLA degradation) with other factors setting cell length. For example, in a cooperative model, a range of GA concentrations would be meaningful and provide robustness for cell length patterning while in a thresholded model GA would provide a gating function for growth.</p><p id="P25">While relative depletion of GA from the apical hook was not important in skotomorphogenesis, we showed that catabolism of GA was quantitatively important in the early stages of photomorphogenesis.
