Estimating the stability of IAV is challenging and depends on factors such as the respiratory matrix and drying kinetics. Here, we combine kinetic experiments on millimeter-sized saline droplets with a biophysical aerosol model to quantify the impact of NaCl on IAV stability. We show that IAV inactivation is determined by NaCl concentration, which increases during water evaporation and then decreases again when efflorescence occurs. When drying in air with relative humidity RH = 30%, inactivation follows an inverted sigmoidal curve, with inactivation occurring most rapidly when the NaCl concentration exceeds 20 molal immediately prior to efflorescence. Efflorescence reduces the NaCl molality to saturated conditions, resulting in a significantly reduced inactivation rate. We demonstrate that the inactivation rate <italic>k</italic> depends exponentially on NaCl molality, and after the solution reaches equilibrium, the inactivation proceeds at a first-order rate. Introducing sucrose, an organic co-solute, attenuates IAV inactivation via two mechanisms, firstly by decreasing the NaCl molality during the drying phase, and secondly by a protective effect against the NaCl-induced inactivation. For both pure saline and sucrose-containing droplets, our biophysical model ResAM accurately simulates the inactivation when NaCl molality is used as the only inactivating factor. This study highlights the role of NaCl molality in IAV inactivation and provides a mechanistic basis for the observed inactivation rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>Expiratory droplet</kwd><kwd>Salinity</kwd><kwd>Airborne transmission</kwd><kwd>Respiratory organics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) can be transmitted by expiratory aerosol particles and droplets emitted by an infected individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Small particles (up a few μm) can stay airborne for minutes to hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and travel dozens of meters before encountering a new host,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> while larger droplets (&gt; 100 μm) can travel only a short distance (1-2 m) and settle within seconds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> For both aerosol particles and droplets, IAV can only be transmitted if the viruses remain infectious outside the host. Understanding the environmental parameters that modulate IAV infectivity in expiratory particles and droplets is therefore crucial to tackle seasonal flu epidemics as well as worldwide pandemics.</p><p id="P3">When aerosol particles and droplets are exhaled from the respiratory tract, they leave an environment with a relative humidity (RH) close to 100% and body temperature and instantaneously enter a cooler, dryer environment. In typical indoor environments in temperate climates, RH can be as low as 30% during winter, whereas it is around 50% in summer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> The RH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> the temperature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and the initial size and composition of the expiratory particle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> dictate the droplet drying rate and hence the concentration of solutes in the droplets. If the RH is below the efflorescence relative humidity (ERH) of the salts, the salts will effloresce. Moreover, gas exchange with the environment takes place,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and liquid-liquid phase separation may occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> These processes modulate the salinity as well as the pH within the particle. We previously found that the pH in small aerosol particles rapidly decreases to around 4 as a result of gas exchange with the surrounding air.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> This low pH was suggested to be a primary driver of IAV inactivation in aerosol particles in indoor environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> In contrast, larger droplets first undergo alkalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> up to pH 10 followed by a much slower acidification on the scale of hours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> suggesting that IAV inactivation observed in droplets is likely driven by another factor.</p><p id="P4">Previous studies have suggested an important contribution of salt to virus inactivation in deposited droplets. Specifically, the stability of IAV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> bacteriophage MS2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> was found to be low at intermediate RH (50-65%), just above ERH of NaCl (41-51%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> where the salinity in the droplets is expected to be maximal. In search for a mechanistic explanation for this observation, Lin and Marr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> suggested that the cumulative dose (NaCl concentration multiplied by exposure time) of NaCl over a 1-h drying period is the main determinant of virus inactivation in droplets and aerosol particles for bacteriophages MS2 and Φ6. Similarly, Niazi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> showed that rapid evaporation followed by immediate efflorescence does not inactivate IAV and human rhinovirus-16 in airborne aerosol particles, suggesting that a short exposure to high salinity is insufficient to lead to efficient inactivation. An important role of evaporation dynamics on IAV inactivation in droplets was also proposed by French et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> who observed faster inactivation during the initial evaporation step, while the particle is still liquid, and a slower decay after efflorescence. Likewise, a near-instantaneous 50% loss in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was observed when efflorescence occurred, followed by a slower inactivation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Besides salt efflorescence, IAV stability is also dependent on the presence of organic co-solutes in the matrix, which are typically reported to exert protective effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> though the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Nevertheless, some organic compounds, such as the saliva constituents lysozyme and lactoferrin, are viricidal and can enhance viral inactivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Finally, Rockey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> observed a lower IAV stability in saliva droplets than in respiratory mucus droplets, whereby the difference could not be explained by the salt content nor the drying kinetics, but was instead attributed to the morphology of the dried droplets. Overall, the role of salinity, efflorescence and organic co-solutes in IAV inactivation is thus not fully understood, and it remains difficult to predict inactivation in saline droplets, in particular in the presence of organics.</p><p id="P6">The goal of this study was therefore to provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of salt in IAV inactivation in deposited, drying droplets, to explain observed differences in inactivation rates at different RH and solution conditions. To this end, we aimed to establish a predictive relationship between the NaCl concentration in drying droplets and IAV stability, in the presence and absence of organics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Virus propagation, purification and enumeration</title><p id="P7">Influenza A virus (IAV) strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1 subtype) was propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and purified by ultracentrifugation as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and detailed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information (SI)</xref>.

We monitored the inactivation of influenza virus strain A/WSN/33 in 1- and 2-μl drying droplets containing NaCl and sucrose at different ratios. A spherical 1-μl droplet has a radius of 620 μm and thus represents the upper end of the particle size distribution produced while coughing or speaking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> This volume also allows to contain a sufficient number of viruses to monitor several orders of magnitude (log<sub>10</sub>) of inactivation.</p><p id="P9">Experiments were conducted in solution with an initial composition of either 8 g/l (i.e., molality <italic>b</italic> = 0.14 mol/(kg H<sub>2</sub>O) = 0.14 molal) NaCl solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, 207790010) or 5.8 g/l (0.14 molal) LiCl solution (Acros Organics, 193370010). This salt concentration corresponds to the NaCl concentration in simulated lung fluid, that was used previously to assess IAV inactivation in a realistic matrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> falls within the range of salt concentrations measured in sputum (5.9–8.9 g/l),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and is also really close to the NaCl concentration in PBS (8.12 g/l). Additionally, experiments were conducted in solutions containing 8 g/l NaCl solution supplemented with either 8 g/l (0.023 molal) or 64 g/l (0.187 molal) of sucrose as a model organic (Fisher BioReagents, BP220-1). These sucrose concentrations were chosen based on droplet efflorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), which showed that the lower sucrose concentration allowed for NaCl efflorescence, whereas no efflorescence was observed (by videography or eye) at the higher one. The solutions were all prepared using milli-Q water. Purified virus stock in PBS was spiked into 100 μl of the matrix in a 1.5-ml plastic tube (Sarstedt, 3080521), to achieve a starting concentration in the experimental solution of either 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml (“normal titer”) or 10<sup>9</sup> PFU/ml (“high titer”). The added volume of PBS (1%) does not influence the final concentration of NaCl, as the NaCl content of PBS corresponds closely to the initial NaCl concentration. The tube was vortexed and kept in a cold tube rack until use.</p><p id="P10">Inactivation experiments were performed in an environmental chamber (Electro-Tech Systems, 5532) with controlled relative humidity and temperature. Prior to the experiment, the chamber was set at the targeted RH and room temperature (25°C ± 2) and left to equilibrate. Trace gases potentially present in the chamber air (e.g. acids such as HNO<sub>3</sub>), which are absorbed by the droplets, have no influence on the inactivation process, as the large volume of the droplets leads to a high dilution. Once equilibrated, 1- or 2-μl droplets were deposited in the wells of a 96-well plate with a non-binding surface (Greiner Bio-One, 655901), one droplet per well. Droplets were then left to dry at 30% or 65% RH (unless mentioned otherwise), and were periodically collected (see below) over the course of up to 180 min. For each time point in an experiment, three droplets were collected. The three droplets that were deposited last were sampled immediately to act as the time = 0 sample. The deposition time (~10 s per droplet) was recorded and accounted for when sampling the time points. In each experiment, a control was performed in the experimental solution in bulk.</p><p id="P11">To sample a droplet, 300 μl of PBSi (PBS for infection; PBS supplemented with 1% P/S, 0.02 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.01 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich A1595), with a final pH of ~7.3) were added to the corresponding well. Each droplet was then resuspended by scratching the bottom of the well with a 200-μl pipette for 5 s, followed by up and down pipetting for 5 times, followed by a second round of scratching and pipetting. Then, each sample was aliquoted in 2x 150 μl and frozen at -20°C until further quantification by culturing and RT-qPCR. The recovering and freezing processes do not inactivate the virus further. In each experiment, a control was included by sampling 1 μl of the experimental solution directly from the plastic tube at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The sample was immediately diluted in 300 μl of PBSi. The tube was kept in the environmental chamber during the whole experiment to ensure similar conditions as for the droplets.</p><p id="P12">To account for physical loss of the virus due to attachment to the wells, recovery of the total (infectious plus inactivated) virus from the plate was measured by RT-qPCR.

The camera was positioned 15 cm above the well plate and took a picture every 16 s. The covered area of each droplet was calculated from the pictures using the software ImageJ (version 1.53t). Briefly, the stack of images was cropped around the droplet of interest and was converted to 8-bit type. Then, an auto-threshold using the “triangle” method was applied across the image stack. A particle analysis was performed on the droplet using default settings, yielding the droplet area of each droplet in pixels. This enables the calculation of relative radii of the (circular) area across all images in the stack.

ResAM was developed as a spherical shell diffusion model to determine viral inactivation in spherical aerosol particles and droplets, which we generalized here to take account for the nonspherical droplet-in-well symmetry. ResAM is initialized with the starting composition and size of the droplets, as well as the relative humidity, temperature and ventilation in the experimental chamber, and assuming the viruses to be initially homogeneously distributed in the droplet volume. From this initial state, the model simulates the loss of water molecules by gas phase diffusion, the buildup of internal NaCl concentration gradients in the liquid phase, and derives the inactivation rates as function of NaCl molality, taking into account the internal concentration gradients. ResAM is fully described by Luo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and the adaptation to non-spherical droplet geometry is described in detail in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI</xref>, where the uncertainties and model limitations are also discussed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S10"><title>IAV inactivation kinetics in efflorescing NaCl droplets</title><p id="P19">Inactivation kinetics of IAV in 1- and 2-μl aqueous NaCl droplets exposed to an RH of 30% were measured over the course of 60 min, to compare the kinetics in two different droplet sizes.

Initially, the droplets were composed of 8 g/l of NaCl, and 1% (by volume of infectious virus in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), reaching a virus titer of 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml. After deposition, the droplets shrank slowly due to water loss until the salt visibly effloresced after approximately 20 min in the 1-μl droplets and after 36 min in the 2-μl droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A+C</xref>). After efflorescence, the appearance of the droplets, as seen by eye and videography, did not change until the end of the experiment.</p><p id="P20">The inactivation curve of IAV in both droplet sizes initially followed the evaporation kinetics of the droplets and exhibited an inverted sigmoidal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B+D</xref>): during the initial phase of exposure to the controlled RH in the gas phase, the volume loss of the droplets is greatest, as there is a large humidity gradient between the air directly above the liquid surfaces and the prescribed RH in the environmental chamber. However, during the initial 5-15 min, the camera barely detected any change in droplet size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A+C</xref>). This is because the droplet flattens out, its contact angle with the surface decreases and its volume rapidly decreases, while the covered base area remains constant. This cannot be detected from the elevated angle of the camera. Only after the contact angle reached a critical small size, also the covered base area contracts until equilibrium between the liquid and gas phase in the chamber is reached (i.e., until the water activity in the solution <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> = RH).</p><p id="P21">Despite the continuous decrease in volume and the increasing salt concentration, IAV remained infectious during the first 15-25 min. This was followed by a short phase of about 5 min during which IAV infectivity plummeted by more than 2-log<sub>10</sub>. After efflorescence, the inactivation kinetics slowed significantly and showed a constant inactivation rate for the remainder of the experiment, resulting in less than 2-log<sub>10</sub> inactivation in the 40 min after efflorescence. In 2-μl droplets, inactivation kinetics were similar to 1-μl, although the initial slow inactivation phase was prolonged to approximately 30 min, due to the smaller relative volume change rate and, hence, the later efflorescence of the larger droplets. Control experiments conducted in bulk solutions showed only minor inactivation during the course of the experiment, suggesting that the observed inactivation can be attributed to the droplet environment.</p><p id="P22">Two mechanisms may explain the rapid decease in virus titer.

The dissolved NaCl concentration increases as the droplet evaporates and massive supersaturations (&gt; 20 molal, see below) are reached prior to efflorescence, exposing the virus to extreme salinity, before it decreases again to the saturation level (6.1 molal) due to efflorescence.

This observation is also consistent with salinity being the main driver of inactivation: the fastest inactivation occurs under the most saline conditions just before efflorescence, and because efflorescence is a stochastic nucleation process, different droplets effloresce at slightly different times.

In brief, the model is based on a spherical shell diffusion system.

To inform the model, IAV inactivation was first parameterized in terms of the NaCl molality and sucrose content. Generally, while the conditions in the droplets change as a function of time, one cannot expect first order inactivation kinetics.

Furthermore, while the 1:8 NaCl:sucrose matrix does not show efflorescence visible by eye, the observed reduction in the inactivation rate after 45 min is indicative of efflorescence. We therefore assume that microscopic dendritic crystal growth occurred in this matrix. This assumption is needed to ensure that the model is consistent with the experimental data. Finally, the model assumes a homogeneous distribution of the virus in the droplet. This is in contrast with studies suggesting that the virus may preferentially localize on the border of the dried droplet when proteins are present in the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> The exact location of IAV viruses in a drying NaCl/sucrose droplet remains to be assessed.</p><p id="P33">Under these assumptions, ResAM revealed the following: (i) at 65% RH, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) the NaCl molality increases up to 8 mol/kg, until equilibrium with air. No efflorescence occurs at this RH, such that the droplet remains supersaturated in NaCl; (ii) at 30% RH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), NaCl molality first increases due to water evaporation, and reaches supersaturation (up to 20 mol/kg at the particle surface) before the salt effloresces. After efflorescence, the concentration drops down to saturation molality (i.e., 6.1 mol/kg) and inactivation continues with the same rate as in a saturated bulk solution, likely in pockets of solution encapsulated by crystalline salt; and (iii) in sucrose-containing droplets at 30% RH, the NaCl molality prior to efflorescence is dependent on the sucrose content: the more sucrose, the lower the diffusivity of water and hence the greater the retention of water inside the droplet. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). After efflorescence, any remaining liquid is in equilibrium with crystalline salt, and hence the aqueous NaCl molality in all matrices corresponds to saturation, i.e. 6.1 mol/kg.

For this purpose, we used sample aliquots from the inactivation experiment in 1-μl NaCl droplets exposed to 30% or 65% RH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). At both RH levels, the IAV titer was reduced by ~3-log<sub>10</sub> after 120 min. Samples taken at times 0 and 120 min were used to infect A549 cells for 6 h, prior to fluorescent staining of the IAV nucleoprotein (NP). A549 cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Fluorescence microscopy showed that in cells infected with viruses in freshly deposited droplets (exposure time 0 min), NP production was present in approximately half of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that viral replication occurred.

In this study, we combined experimental data on IAV inactivation at different salinities with a biophysical model to parameterize the effect of NaCl on virus stability. Our data suggest that the main inactivation driver of IAV in efflorescing saline droplets is exposure to high (supersaturated) NaCl molality rather than the formation of salt crystals during efflorescence. This suggestion was confirmed by model simulations showing that the NaCl molality, which increases dramatically prior to efflorescence and then is reduced to saturation post-efflorescence, is sufficient to explain the observed inactivation.</p><p id="P38">The ResAM model was able to capture the entire inactivation curve observed in both effloresced and deliquesced droplets, and in both aqueous NaCl and NaCl/sucrose matrices. A recent study proposed the inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 to be correlated with the cumulative dose, defined as the solute concentration multiplied by the exposure time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> A dose-dependent inactivation could not be confirmed by ResAM for IAV. Instead, we here demonstrate an exponential dependence of IAV inactivation on salt molality, suggesting that an increase in molality leads to a disproportionate increase in inactivation. In particular at salt molalities &gt; 20 mol/kg, inactivation times become very fast, with 99% inactivation achieved within seconds. However, even at a RH as low as 30%, it takes several minutes to reach such molalities in 1-μl NaCl droplets, and in droplets containing large amounts of organics, such molalities may not be reached at all. Depending on the RH and the organic content, the virus may thus remain stable for minutes to hours. Therefore, droplet transmission may play an important role in the spread of IAV, and a combination of prevention strategies addressing both aerosol (e.g. ventilation) and droplet transmission (e.g. surface disinfection), may be needed to prevent the spread of influenza.</p><p id="P39">While our results were obtained in millimeter-sized deposited droplets, our findings are also relevant to smaller, airborne particles with diameters up to few micrometers. Below the deliquescence RH (74%), such particles can rapidly reach supersaturated salt concentrations, similar to those obtained in our experimental system (but experimentally inaccessible in bulk solutions). As shown in our experiments with sucrose, supersaturation is also achieved in matrices with high amounts of organics. We therefore expect that the observed dependence of IAV stability on NaCl molality also applies to smaller particles, including organic-rich expiratory aerosol particles. Depending on the composition of the respiratory matrix and the surrounding air, however, the inactivating effect of NaCl in such small particles may be outcompeted by other inactivating factors, including aerosol pH. Specifically, virus inactivation in small particles was previously suggested to be driven by acidic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or basic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> pH, though the contribution of pH-mediated inactivation mechanism remains to be confirmed in real world systems. In contrast, acidification in millimeter-sized droplets is too slow to compete with salt-mediated inactivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and we found IAV to be stable over the course of 1 h at an alkaline pH of 11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). We can therefore exclude pH as a determinant of virus inactivation in droplets, highlighting the importance of salinity in modulating virus stability.</p><p id="P40">The inactivation of IAV in drying droplets may be explained by a combined effect of two processes: the removal of water molecules due to evaporation, and the subsequent increase of salt molality. Our data suggest that the virion integrity is damaged in drying NaCl droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Virion integrity loss was also observed to be a minor mechanism in the inactivation of IAV by acidic pH, as encountered in small aerosol particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> For salinity-mediated inactivation in drying droplets, however, damage to the virus structure seems to be the main inactivation mechanism. Therefore, we here summarize how these two processes may affect the lipid envelope and the viral proteins.</p><p id="P41">Upon drying, the osmotic pressure induced by the solutes increases and causes shrinkage of IAV by forcing water molecules to exit the virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> The shrinkage rate constant of influenza virus was previously observed to increase with ionic strength, until reaching a threshold where the lipids and the matrix proteins (M1) are no longer able to adapt to the compressive stress, resulting in morphological change and loss of membrane integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> This concurs with our finding that damage to the viral integrity is the main inactivation mechanism. The authors furthermore hypothesize that the morphological change in the membrane leads to irreversible conformational changes, resulting in the loss of hemagglutinin (HA) activity. We did not investigate the structural integrity and functionality of HA in this work, though it is possible that this mechanism occurs concomitantly to the loss of virion integrity in drying saline droplets.</p><p id="P42">In addition to osmotic stress, water evaporation may induce leakage of the viral lipid envelope. It was shown that when the water molecules surrounding the phosphate heads of membrane phospholipids are removed, the packing of the head groups densifies. The subsequent increase of Van der Waals’ interactions among hydrocarbon chains trigger a phase transition in the lipid bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> Specifically, under physiological conditions, the phase transition temperature, (T<sub>m</sub>) is usually below room temperature, and the hydrated lipids are in a disordered, flexible liquid crystalline phase. However, the increase of Van der Waals’ interactions due to water removal increases T<sub>m</sub> to values above room temperature and forces the dried lipids to transition into an ordered, solid-like gel phase. Upon rehydration, the lipids then undergo a reverse phase transition when the head group packing decreases due to the formation of H-bonds with water. These phase transitions induce leakage of the lipid bilayer, damaging the membrane. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism occurs in the viral envelope of influenza virus in a drying droplet or aerosol particle, with rehydration occurring when the particle is inhaled by a host. Moreover, both Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions were found to bind with the lipid head groups, increasing the ordering of the lipids and subsequently increasing T<sub>m</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> We propose that the combination of water removal and NaCl attachment to the lipid bilayer promote phase transition and cause damage to the viral envelope, which may interfere with fusion during viral infection. Such a mechanism agrees with our data that demonstrate that in drying droplets, IAV inactivation is driven by high NaCl molality and is caused by damaging the virion integrity. It is also consistent with findings by Lin et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> who observed a higher salt susceptibility of the enveloped bacteriophage Φ6 than the non-enveloped bacteriophage MS2, supporting the hypothesis of viral envelope disruption by high salinity. Similarly, Kukkaro and Bamford<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> saw a larger sensitivity to NaCl concentration changes of enveloped viruses compared to non-enveloped ones. Nevertheless, to conclusively confirm this mechanism, future work should study phase transition mechanism in the lipid bilayers of enveloped viruses in drying droplets.</p><p id="P43">We observed that the addition of sucrose is protective for IAV in drying droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The protective mechanism by sucrose is two-fold. First, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the presence of sucrose in the matrix decreases the molality of NaCl during the drying phase, thereby lowering viral inactivation. This effect is particularly evident at an NaCl:sucrose ratio of 1:8, and constitutes an indirect protective effect from sucrose. Second, our results show that sucrose also has a direct protective mechanism: in droplets at equilibrium, the NaCl molality is independent of the sucrose concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), and yet lower inactivation rate coefficients are observed when sucrose is present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The inactivation rate coefficients follow the trend 1:0 &gt; 1:1 &gt; 1:8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H-J</xref>), showing that an increasing sucrose concentration increases the protection. Here, the protection cannot be attributed to a change in NaCl molality, as the latter is at saturation in all conditions. Therefore, a different, direct mechanism must protect the virus.</p><p id="P44">Potential direct protection mechanisms by sucrose acting on both lipids and proteins are described in the literature. The addition of disaccharides, such as sucrose and trehalose, was previously shown to help stabilize the membrane phospholipids during lyophilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> The sugar molecules interact with the phosphates, inserting in between the head groups and replacing water. The packing density needs to decrease to give room to the sugars, and the Van der Waals’ interactions are reduced. Consequently, T<sub>m</sub> is decreased, and remains below room temperature. Therefore, despite water removal, the lipids do not undergo phase transition, and no membrane leakage occurs. The direct protection of IAV exerted by sucrose in the droplet may thus be partly due to the protection of the lipid bilayer from water loss, preventing the damage to the lipid envelope during drying. In addition, the sucrose may also protect the lipid bilayer from the effects of salt, if sucrose replaces the Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions between the lipid head groups and thereby counteracts the increase in T<sub>m</sub> caused by the salt. This mechanism remains to be assessed, but it correlates with the decrease in inactivation rate as a function of sucrose content in matrices with similar NaCl molalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H-J</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Additionally, protection may arise from the stabilization of surface proteins by sucrose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> Upon drying, the water molecules stabilizing the structure of proteins are removed, unfolding the proteins and inducing potentially irreversible conformational changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> However, when osmolytes (here, sucrose) are present, they are sterically excluded from the first hydration shell of the proteins. This preferential exclusion of the sucrose leads to a preferential hydration of the proteins, increasing the free energy of the system. The unfolded state of the proteins becomes thermodynamically unfavorable, forcing the proteins to remain in their native state. Our data do not indicate whether protein unfolding occurred in drying droplets, and therefore we cannot assess whether the sucrose protection is in fact caused by protein stabilization. Indeed, the surface proteins of a virus have lower mobility than proteins in solution, and it is possible that this stabilization mechanism is less pronounced in viruses. Further studies on IAV are required to confirm this protection mechanism by sucrose and other organics present in respiratory fluids.</p><p id="P46">This study has some limitations. First, the ResAM model used herein relies on some assumptions that remain to be validated. Specifically, the encapsulation of residual water and viruses by NaCl crystals in efflorescing droplets, as well as the formation of micro-crystals in the 1:8 NaCl:sucrose solution, are hypothetical physical processes that need to be assessed. However, previous studies have shown that the viscosity of an organic phase can kinetically limit the coalescence of the inorganic salt crystal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> and non-coalesced salt crystals were observed in porcine respiratory fluid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> which supports the hypothesis of micro-crystal formation when the sucrose content is large. Moreover, we accounted for the flattened shape of the droplet despite using a spherical model by limiting the diffusion depth to the thickness of the spread droplet. This also represents a minor uncertainty of ResAM, as detailed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI</xref>. The likely largest uncertainty in ResAM, however, results from the extrapolations of the inactivation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the diffusivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) to highly supersaturated regimes without direct measurements. For both these parameters, we conducted sensitivity analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI and Figures S9 and S10</xref>), which reveal that in particular, improved experimental data for diffusivities in highly concentrated salt solutions would be beneficial for further constraining our model assumptions.</p><p id="P47">Finally, the simple NaCl/sucrose/water matrices that were used in this study are useful to parameterize ResAM, but are far less complex than real respiratory fluids and saliva. In real matrices, other processes may occur during droplet drying, such as the formation of a glassy shell by proteins, limiting evaporation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> In addition, the morphology of the dried droplet, the importance of which has been recently presented by Rockey et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> is dependent on the matrix composition, such as the Na:K ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> and the initial NaCl content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> that can affect crystal formation. It is therefore essential to combine studies of both simple and more complex matrices, to disentangle the effects of all parameters and assess their importance for IAV transmission.</p><p id="P48">In summary, we demonstrate that IAV inactivation in deposited droplets is driven by the high NaCl molality due to water evaporation. Furthermore, we propose a model to simulate IAV inactivation in droplets as a function of RH, NaCl and organic concentration. Finally, we determined that organics (sucrose) protect IAV by two mechanisms: first by decreasing the salt molality in the drying droplet and second, by a direct mechanism that may prevent the leakage of the lipid bilayer and the unfolding of surface proteins. This work contributes to the understanding and quantification of virus inactivation in drying droplets. It expands the fundamental knowledge of airborne virus transmission, which is the basis for the development of appropriate mitigation strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS193129-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 189939).

(B) Time required for 99% titer reduction of IAV versus NaCl molality in aqueous NaCl/sucrose droplets derived by fitting ResAM to the experimental data in panels (G-J) and in bulk NaCl solutions. The inactivation times in droplets are based on the first order inactivation rates after droplet compositions stopped changing by equilibration with air, that is ≥ 40 min after deposition.
