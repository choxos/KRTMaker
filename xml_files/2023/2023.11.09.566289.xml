The biomechanics of Caenorhabditis elegans (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), a model organism widely used in pharmacological and ageing research, has been established as biomarker for healthy ageing, though the mechanics of individual tissues have remained elusive. In this study we investigated the biomechanics of healthy <italic>C. elegans</italic> cuticle, muscle tissue, and pseudocoelom using a combination of indentation experiments and <italic>in silico</italic> modelling. Nematode stiffness measurements were performed using an atomic force microscope. The worm’s cylindrical body was approximated using a novel three-compartmental nonlinear finite element model, enabling analysis of how changes in the elasticity of individual compartments affect the bulk stiffness of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The parameters of the model were then fine-tuned to match the simulation force-indentation output to the experimental data. To test the finite element model, distinct compartments were modified experimentally. Our <italic>in silico</italic> results, in agreement with previous studies, suggest that hyperosmotic shock reduced stiffness by decreasing the <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ internal pressure. Unexpectedly, treatment with the neuromuscular agent aldicarb, traditionally associated with muscle contraction, reduced stiffness by decreasing the internal pressure. It challenges previous assumptions about the effects of aldicarb. Furthermore, our finite element model can offer insights into how drugs, mutations or processes like ageing target individual tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Caenorhabditis elegans</kwd><kwd>finite element method</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd><kwd>Aldicarb</kwd><kwd>osmotic shock</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) is a powerful model organism for the study of different physiological processes including neuronal signalling, stress response and ageing, all of which ultimately converge into behavioural changes. Moreover, nematode behaviour has been extensively studied to test or investigate drugs, and to analyse the effects of genetic mutations. Here, automated, multidimensional <italic>C. elegans</italic> motion trackers paired with machine learning have generated databases for behavioural phenotypes and tracked life and health span effects of genetic and pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Stroustrup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yemini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Javer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In the context of behavioural responses, locomotion plays an essential role. The worm’s locomotion involves a complex interplay between its neuronal network, contracting muscles, and the surface traction between the cuticle and the culture medium. Notably, locomotion also depends on the biomechanics of the worm’s tissues. As the worm ages, its body gradually becomes softer and loses the ability to move. We have previously analysed the biomechanics of ageing worms by atomic force microscopy and revealed a correlation between loss of stiffness and diminished mobility, establishing stiffness as a reliable biomarker for healthy ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Essmann et al., 2020</xref>). Since our stiffness calculations were based on the well-established Hertzian model for contact mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sneddon, 1965</xref>) by assuming the worm’s body being a single uniform tissue, it resulted in one bulk stiffness value for the entire worm indifferent to individual tissue mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Essmann et al., 2020</xref>). Ultimately, and to differentiate between the decay of individual tissues, tissue properties are required to be mapped for each tissue layer of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> individually.</p><p id="P4">Like other organisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is composed of distinct tissue layers, including the cuticle, hypodermis, muscles and the pseudocoelom. The latter being a fluid filled cavity enclosing internal organs, which contributes to the overall biomechanics and structural support of the worm through hydrostatic pressure, as documented in WORMATLAS. Each <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissue layer is unique in its molecular and cellular composition thus likely different in stiffness, but very little is known about the local material properties and stiffness of these individual layers, and how they contribute to the overall body stiffness. Determining the stiffness values for each layer becomes crucial when examining the impact of specific mutations (e.g., mutations affecting muscle function or the extracellular matrix) external influences (food, temperature, salt content of the media) or processes such as ageing on specific tissues. This lack of knowledge partly arises from the challenge of directly measuring the deeper layers using current <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation procedures. Recently, researchers analysed the stiffness of the dissected worm cuticle and how it is affected by collagen mutations or ageing using tensile test techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rahimi et al., 2022</xref>). However, the cuticle alone does not determine the mechanics of the worm. Deeper layers, such as the muscle layer and hydrostatic pressure, have been experimentally modified to analyse their contribution to the overall stiffness of the worm, albeit their individual stiffness values have not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Petzold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Backholm et al., 2013</xref>). Petzold and his colleagues used piezoresistive cantilevers to find that chemic- or optogenetic-induced muscle contractions significantly increased the bulk stiffness of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while muscle relaxation reduced it. Moreover, Park et al. described that puncturing the worm with a fine needle to release the hydrostatic pressure had modest effect on the overall biomechanics of the worm. One approach to overcome these limitations is to use computational modelling and to develop a new biomechanical model capable of assigning mechanical properties to distinct individual layers.</p><p id="P5">The biomechanics of <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been modelled in various ways based on experimental interrogations as early as 2005 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Park et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2007</xref>) and later in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Nakajima et al., 2009</xref>). These studies incorporated a custom-designed MEM device and an environmental-scanning electron microscope (E-SEM) to measure <italic>C. elegans</italic> stiffness at the microscopic level. Utilising experimentally measured force-displacement (F-D - indentation depth) data, Park et al. employed a linearized Hertzian contact model, whereas Nakajima et al. employed a Euler-buckling theory model to estimate nematode bulk tissue stiffness. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gilpin et al. (2015)</xref> employed a linear-spring mechanical analogue to explicitly model hydrostatic pressure, by taking the difference between the external and the desired internal pressure, to explore <italic>C. elegans</italic> whole-body biomechanics. A previous study in our lab by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elmi et al. (2017)</xref> introduced a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of the <italic>C. elegans</italic>, assigning distinct stiffness values to an outer (cuticle, hypodermis, muscle) and an inner layer (pseudocoelom). This model was based on linear-elastic isotropic, homogeneous soft matter. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sanzeni et al. (2019)</xref> modelled <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ body as a tapering cylinder that consists of an outer shell structure (i.e., the cuticle, hypodermis, and body wall muscles) and an inner (tube) structure of the pseudocoelom with the intestine and gonad gland. To simplify their structural model, they employed a Hookean stress/strain constitutive law for the worm (thin shell) solid body. A more advanced model that uses a second-order elasticity theory to capture larger amplitude deformations and material nonlinearity was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Du et al. (2023)</xref>.</p><p id="P6">This study combines a new experimental procedure based on atomic force microscopy with the development of a new multi-compartmental FE model. We demonstrate the importance of internal pressure as the primary determinant of overall body stiffness and that hyperosmotic shock significantly reduces body stiffness. Moreover, our data show that the neuromuscular agents aldicarb and tetramisole reduce the internal pressure within the worm. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of neuromuscular agents and their effect on the biomechanics of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Moreover, the model can be used in the future to predict how mutations or pharmacological interventions impact the age-related decline of individual tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> laboratory maintenance</title><p id="P7"><italic>C. elegans</italic> wild-type (N2) and ZX299 animals were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre.

The proposed 3D FE model overcomes two major simplifications of published biomechanical models: (<italic>a</italic>) it distinguishes the major tissue regions of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that primarily contribute to the worm’s body biomechanics, which are modelled individually (with separate model parameters). In addition, (<italic>b</italic>) our FE model accommodates nonlinear (material model) biomechanical behaviour of the tissue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the nonlinearities that appear from the mechanical interactions with components of the testing device (i.e., the AFM tip). Part of the nematode body was approximated in ABAQUS as an idealized cylinder (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl Text 1</xref>) subdivided into three distinct tissue compartments corresponding to the cuticle and dermis, the muscle tissue, and the pseudocoelom (gonad, intestine, etc.). Each tissue compartment was modelled using separate material properties (i.e., stiffness) based on a Green-elastic, neo-Hookean constitutive model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl Text 1</xref>). Next, for the FE discretization of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model, a hexa-dominant 3D mesh was generated in ABAQUS, with a finer mesh used close to the region where the tip contacts the cuticle, growing further away from the indentation region. A mesh sensitivity and convergence analysis found the optimal FE mesh had a 0.4 <italic>μ</italic>m minimum edge size. Finally, proper contact and boundary conditions were defined to reduce the size of the computational domain and replicate the constraints applied to the nematode movement <italic>in vivo</italic> during testing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl Text 1</xref>).

In this study, we wanted to elucidate on the role of the distinct components of this previously named ‘outer’ layer and each of their contribution to the overall stiffness. We therefore required a force sensing system in the range of nanonewtons that is capable of indentations in the range of nanometres to a few micrometres. For this purpose, we used an atomic force microscope (AFM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>), to produce data to inform and validate the FE model used to simulate the <italic>C. elegans</italic> biomechanics (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl Text 1</xref> and in paragraph ‘<italic>C. elegans</italic> FE model’ above).</p><p id="P16">As in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elmi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Essmann et al., 2017</xref>), we used 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM, a chemical that has been described to relax muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Petzold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Backholm et al., 2013</xref>) by inhibiting myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Higuchi and Takemori, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soeno et al., 1999</xref>)) to immobilise worms during AFM analysis. Using a 10 <italic>μ</italic>m bead attached to a tipless cantilever to avoid damaging or penetrating the cuticle during the indentation process, we applied a set force of 450 nN and recorded individual force-indentation curves. The mean indentation at this force was 338 nm ± 8.4 SEM (n=44; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). Subsequently we employed our FE model to simulate the AFM indentation test and to reproduce the F-D plots obtained from the experiments. Following an Edisonian approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wills, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dandekar et al., 2003</xref>), we attempted through the simulations to interrogate and estimate the model parameter values (Young’s modulus) for each of the three tissue compartments of the FE model: the cuticle (cuticle and hypodermis), the muscle, and the pseudocoelom. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref> shows the mean force (nN) versus the displacement (nm) curve of the experiments (black solid line) compared against the FE-simulated curve (red-dashed line). After optimising for the Young’s modulus of each of the three compartments of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> FE model, we converged to the following set of values that gave the best agreement to the experiments: 150 kPa, 1200 kPa and 840 kPa for the cuticle, muscle and pseudocoelom respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 1a</xref>).

Taking the natural variation into consideration, the mechanical properties we propose for BDM-treated wild type animals range from 200 kPa to 100 kPa for the cuticle, from 2350 kPa to 280 kPa for the muscle layer and from 1100 kPa to 800 kPa for the pseudocoelom (mean values: 150 kPa for the cuticle, 1200 kPa for the muscle, 840 kPa for the pseudocoelom).</p><p id="P17"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref> shows a simulated F-D generated from the FE model with Young’s modulus values for the muscle tissue set to 900 kPa and for the pseudocoelom set to 1400 kPa.

After trial-and-error optimisation, the model parameters were: 90 kPa for the cuticle compartment, 650 kPa for the muscle compartment, and 76 kPa for the pseudocoelom. Comparing these values to the best fit parameters in to the control case (105 kPa, 390 kPa and 880 kPa; see green dash-dot line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 1b</xref>) we observe an 14% and a 91% approximately drop in the Young’s modulus of the cuticle tissue and the pseudocoelom respectively, whereas the muscle sees an ≈67% increase of the Young’s modulus. In addition to the mean F-D curve on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, we used the FE model to reproduce the two extreme F-D curves of the experiment (min, max), and again optimised the model to estimate Young’s Modulus for each tissue compartment.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>, the agreement of the numerically predicted F-D curve to the experimental data recorded under high salt experimental data was poor. This suggests that the hyperosmotic shock caused by salt had the largest impact on the pseudocoelom by reducing its pressure, attributed to loss of water due to osmosis, resulting in reduced volumetric resistance in that compartment. In addition, high salt treatment also increased muscle stiffness in line with previously reported results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Park et al., 2007</xref>). In conclusion, the overall worm body stiffness is significantly reduced in response to salt exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>3.3</label><title>Aldicarb treatment reduces <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ bulk stiffness</title><p id="P21">To understand the contribution of the body wall muscle layer to worm body stiffness we next modulated the muscle tone of the worm using the well-known chemical called aldicarb. Aldicarb has been described previously to hyper-contract muscles by blocking the degradation of acetylcholine at the neuro-muscular junction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nurrish et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lackner et al., 1999</xref>). We treated the worms with either aldicarb or BDM as control condition until immobilized and measured their stiffness using the AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The mean F-D curve of aldicarb-treated worms showed a maximum indentation of 864 ± 47 nm (n=76) for a total compressive force of 450 nN, compared to 356 nm ± 11 nm (n=68) for the BDM-treated worms. Contrary to our expectations, this result suggests that aldicarb-treated worms, although hyper-contracted, are softer than BDM-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). We hypothesized that when a worm shrinks due to muscle hypercontraction, the cuticle of the animal folds, thereby, allowing for a margin of the corresponding tissue to start becoming indented without significant compressive force being applied and therefore making the worm appear softer than in its uncontracted state. Based on this explanation, the stiffness should increase for larger indentations. To test this, we employed a Micro-F-D System (μFDS) as a second force-indentation tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>) able to indent worms up to 20 <italic>μ</italic>m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elmi et al., 2017</xref>). BDM-treated worms were mounted on top of an agarose pad against the edge of a glass coverslip to provide a rigid surface when indenting the worm from the side with a uniaxial force sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>). Using μFDS, we measured F-D curves for indentations of up to 16 <italic>μ</italic>m. For that indentation depth, we measured a mean compressive force of 29.3 <italic>μ</italic>N ± 3.5 SEM (n=5) for <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with BDM, whereas for when treated with aldicarb the same indentation resulted in a compressive force of only 8.5 <italic>μ</italic>N ± 0.9 SEM (n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). Hence even at larger indentations, aldicarb treated worms are softer than BDM-treated worms. To quantify the difference in bulk stiffness between these two treatment conditions, and compare data from AFM and μFDS setups, we employed linear regression at moderate to high indentation depths to estimate the bulk stiffness using F-D data for indentations &gt;10 <italic>μ</italic>m for the μFDS data set, and &gt;200 nm for the BDM and &gt;300 nm for the aldicarb AFM data set. The normalized values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>; for absolute values see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl Table 1</xref>) indicate that the bulk stiffness of aldicarb-treated worms is decreased by 66% when compared to BDM-treated animals.</p><p id="P23">To further investigate the effect of the neuromuscular agent, untreated worms were placed in the μFDS, and F-D data was captured over time after adding aldicarb.

Similarly, to the results for aldicarb-treated worms, data captured using AFM and μFDS systems for tetramisole-treated animals show they are significantly softer than BDM treated worms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl Fig 2</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We modified the Young’s modulus values for all three compartments of the FE model to reproduce the F-D curve for aldicarb-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>). The numerically estimated Young’s modulus for the cuticle (140 kPa) and the muscle (950 kPa) compartments varied by less than 10% from the corresponding values for BDM-treated worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 1c</xref>). However, the estimated Young’s modulus for the pseudocoelom was 94 kPa, and dramatically lower than the 760 kPa for the pseudocoelom compartment of the BDM-treated worms. To also explore the range of natural variation between the aldicarb-treated worms’ biomechanics, we re-optimised the model to fit the two extreme experimental (min, max) F-D curves. This yielded estimates of between 42 kPa to 275 kPa for the Young’s modulus of the pseudocoelom, between 910 to 2100 kPa for the muscle tissue, whilst the Young’s modulus of the cuticle remained close to 140 kPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3f</xref>). We also attempted to fit the experimental data by softening the muscle tissue and stiffening the pseudocoelom, or inversely by stiffening the muscle and softening the pseudocoelom as such. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref> the simulated F-D curves (blue dotted lines) in both cases compare poorly to the mean experimental F-D curve for the aldicarb-treated worms (black solid line).</p><p id="P26">To conclude, rather than increasing stiffness treating <italic>C. elegans</italic> with aldicarb or tetramisole softens the worm. Fitting the experimental data using our multi-compartment FE model indicates that both agents significantly reduce the stiffness of the pseudocoelom without significantly changing the muscle layer compared to the control condition (i.e., BDM). This suggests that both these drugs have additional effects beyond their function as muscle contracting agents.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><label>3.4</label><title>Osmotic shock and aldicarb treatment reduce worm size</title><p id="P27">Our FEM simulations indicated that worms treated with aldicarb loose most of their pseudocoelom stiffness.

To understand more about the additional effects of aldicarb, we measured changes to the length, width and volume of the worms exposed to aldicarb or osmotic shock compared to BDM-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Both osmotic shock and aldicarb treatment significantly decreased worm size with measured volumes of 2457.34 mm<sup>3</sup> ± 35.9 SEM and 2439.35 mm<sup>3</sup> ± 64.6 SEM respectively, compared to 2870.41 mm<sup>3</sup> ± 45.1 SEM for animals treated with BDM alone (n = 24, 49 and 67 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). However, in contrast to worms subject to osmotic shock, aldicarb-treated worms reduced more in width (53.87 ± 0.39 <italic>μ</italic>m, compared to 55.59 ± 0.57 <italic>μ</italic>m) than length (1014.76 ± 13.57 <italic>μ</italic>m compared to 907.22 ± 9.22 <italic>μ</italic>m; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). It has been reported previously that worms exposed to aldicarb on plates shrink over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Opperman and Chang, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nurrish et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lackner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Glenn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). When we compared worms paralysed on aldicarb-containing plates versus aldicarb solution we found that animals exposed to aldicarb on plates shrank more with a reduced length and volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl Fig 3a</xref>). Based on analysis of AFM F-D curves these worms also tended to be 13% softer than worms paralysed in aldicarb solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl Fig 3b–3c</xref>). However, we observed no difference in stiffness or volume between worms treated with BDM in solution versus plate, although we found an ≈10% difference in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl Fig 3d–3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3.5</label><title>Optogenetically controlled muscle contraction increases <italic>C. elegans</italic> bulk stiffness</title><p id="P28">Our data show that, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mulcahy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Izquierdo et al., 2021</xref>), when aldicarb is administered in solution or on a plate the animals shrink. However, contrary to previous findings we measured a decrease in worm stiffness following aldicarb exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Petzold et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, our FEM simulations suggest this arises due to a change in the pseudocoelom rather than in the muscle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>). It is possible that muscle contraction is not measurable with our force-indentation set-ups, or that chemically induced muscle contraction is accompanied by other effects and in combination this does not result in tissue stiffening. To investigate this possibility, we employed optogenetics as an alternative, non-chemical, tool to induce muscle contraction in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, using a worm strain expressing a channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variant in its muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schultheis et al., 2011</xref>). ChR2 is an ion channel that responds to UV light by opening and allowing ions to enter the cell. When expressed in muscle cells ChR2 enables control of muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">AzimiHashemi et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether we could detect force associated with muscle contraction, we analysed untreated worms expressing channel rhodopsin using the μFDS setup. The AFM system was unsuitable for such measurements due to the uncontrolled, large movements of non-treated worms. The force sensor was used to indent the worm and clamp it against the coverslip edge. After a few seconds of baseline recordings, the worm was irradiated for 7–8 seconds with UV light to activate muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). UV irradiation (On) resulted in a sharp rise in the compressive force sensed by the force sensing tip. When UV-light was turned off (Off) the force reading declined sharply. The same trend was observed when the force reading was set to zero with UV-light switched on: switching it off led to a decrease in measured force, switching it back on to an increase in force (On-Off-On). These results indicate that the μFDS set-up is sufficiently sensitive to measure changes in muscle tone and stiffening following ChR2 mediated muscle contraction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Next, we investigated whether worms treated with aldicarb, or BDM retained the ability to contract their muscles when under ChR2-induced muscle activation. Assuming BDM immobilises worms by relaxing the muscles, channel rhodopsin activation should still lead to muscle contraction and hence stiffening of the worm. On the contrary, aldicarb-treated worms (with hypercontracted muscles) would likely not increase their stiffness following ChR2 activation. Using both the μFDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>) or AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>) set-up, BDM-treated worms showed a robust increase in stiffness upon ChR2 activation in both activation–deactivation sequences (On–Off–On or Off–On–Off). Untreated transgenic worms had responded similarly to light activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). Hence it is possible to induce and to measure muscle contraction in worms treated with BDM, suggesting BDM leaves muscles in a relaxed or responsive state. Using the μFDS set-up no significant stiffness increase was detected for aldicarb-treated worms following UV-light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl Fig 4a</xref>). Using the AFM set-up, however, we observed an increase in measured compressive force for approximately half of the worms following UV-light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl Fig 4b</xref>). This suggests that responsive aldicarb-treated worms had contractile muscles which were not hypercontracted. For those worms that did not respond, muscles were either hyper-contracted already and unable to contract further or were unresponsive due to additional effects of aldicarb. We suggest the latter as the most likely explanation, as ChR2 activation-induced muscle contraction results in a stiffening of the worm whereas aldicarb-treated worms have reduced stiffness compared to BDM-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S18"><label>4.1</label><title>FE model</title><p id="P30">In this study we generated new empirical data of small-scale indentations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> of up to 2 <italic>μ</italic>m, which we used subsequently to build a new <italic>in silico</italic> model to simulate the biomechanics of the worm.

AFM data indicated that the F-D relation is highly non-linear (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>), hence, pertinent methodological considerations in the <italic>in silico</italic> model are required.

Reduction of internal pressure by high salt exposure reduced the Young’s modulus of the pseudocoelom by 91% according to our model. This observation contrasts with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Park et al. (2007)</xref> in two ways. Firstly, their study proposed that the mechanics of the ‘outer shell’ was the major contributor to worm stiffness, and secondly, that hyperosmotic stress increased worm stiffness. How can a deeper compartment like the pseudocoelom affect stiffness? The contribution of an underlying tissue compartment even if not directly indented, in our case the indentation depth reached by the AFM was maximum 1 <italic>μ</italic>m, is relevant to due to the model’s assumed incompressibility of all three compartments. As a result, the deformation of the outer compartment (cuticle) is transferred rigidly to the compartments below. To demonstrate the influence of the pseudocoelom on the F-D curve we decreased the Young’s modulus of the muscle compartment instead of the pseudocoelom. The simulated F-D curve no longer matched the experimental results, being shallower for smaller displacements due to the soft muscle compartment, and steeper for larger displacements due to the stiff pseudocoelom compartment. Secondly, Park and colleagues reported that hyperosmotic shock increased body stiffness due to salt-induced muscle contraction, meaning the reduced internal pressure had lesser impact on the overall body stiffness. In our experiments, exposure to a high salt concentration led to reduced stiffness. A key difference between the two studies is that in addition to salt, worms were treated with BDM for complete immobilization during our AFM measurements. BDM, acting as a muscle relaxant may have interfered potentially with any muscle contraction promoted by hyperosmotic conditions. It is worth noting however that the body wall muscles in BDM-treated worms remained responsive to induced contraction, as shown by ChR2 activation in the presence of BDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). However, it is possible that the pathway leading to hyperosmotic-induced muscle contraction may act upstream of BDM, and consequently, our measurement results primarily reflected the effect of a reduction in hydrostatic pressure. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with the observation that a decrease in internal pressure due to cuticle puncture similarly reduces body stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Park et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>4.3</label><title>Aldicarb on stiffness and morphology</title><p id="P33">The neuromuscular agent aldicarb has been an invaluable tool in <italic>C. elegans</italic> research to investigate neuromuscular function and behaviour. By assessing mobility and paralysis in response to this agent, researchers have gained insights into neuromuscular and synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sieburth et al., 2005</xref>). A large body of work has linked sensitivity to these agents, resulting in paralysis and shrinkage, to hypercontraction of body wall muscles. To understand the contribution of the body wall muscles to overall stiffness of a worm, we modulated the muscle tone using aldicarb, expecting a stiffening due to muscle hyper-contraction. However, using two different force-indentation systems, we observed that administration of aldicarb reduces worm stiffness. The question is therefore whether the effect of aldicarb in addition to muscle contraction could also affect other properties of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and, if so, what would these be?</p><p id="P34">In our optogenetics experiment, aldicarb-treated worms either increased in stiffness or showed no response upon UV-light induced muscle contraction. Aldicarb-treated worms shrink, and they are softer than control worms (BDM-treated). In addition, our biomechanical model suggests the most substantial change in stiffness arises from the pseudocoelom compartment. We therefore propose that aldicarb-treatment ultimately decreases the <italic>C. elegans</italic> internal pressure. This reduction might be a secondary effect following an initial muscle contraction, possibly to counteract the pressure generated during muscle contraction. Worms exposed to high salt and aldicarb decreased in stiffness and volume, although there was an observable difference in relation to width and length which might suggest different underlying causes.</p><p id="P35">We did not observe any evidence for a muscle hyper-contraction. Firstly, in our optogenetic experiment aldicarb-treated worms were at least partially stiffening under UV-light exposure suggesting the muscles were in a responsive, as opposed to hypercontracted, state. Secondly, when administering aldicarb to untreated worms in our μFDS system we observed a gradual softening of the worm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl Fig 5</xref>). Thirdly, the aldicarb is expected to inhibit ACE, acetyl-choline-esterase, leading to the accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which acts on different ACh receptors including ion-gated excitatory nicotinic AChR, muscarinic AChR and possibly inhibitory anion-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>).

Sensory neurons, including mechanosensory neurons, have been reported to be involved in osmoregulation, none of which is directly cholinergic (details available from the WORMATLAS database). Though one of them, the URX neuron, has direct contact to the pseudocoelomic fluid. Moreover, some of the sensory neurons’ direct downstream target interneurons are cholinergic and hence speculatively effected by aldicarb.</p><p id="P36">When comparing the effects of aldicarb administered on the plate and in solution, worms on plates underwent additional shrinkage, resulting in reduced length and volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl Fig 3a</xref>). This might be attributable to the behaviour of worms, which swim in solution and crawl on plates. Swimming worms showing diminished pharyngeal pumping in comparison to their counterparts that crawl on agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Vidal-Gadea and Pierce-Shimomura, 2012</xref>). When administered on an agar plate aldicarb is likely to undergo both digestion and absorption, enabling it to reach more tissue, whereas worms in solution will experience reduced intestinal uptake. Although not significant, worms on plates tended to be softer than worms treated in aldicarb solution. Correlation between size and stiffness is not necessarily linear, a reduction in volume does not have to equate to a proportional decrease in stiffness, and that there must exist a limit to how soft a worm can become due to the reduced pressure in the pseudocoelom.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P37">We have investigated the biomechanics of <italic>C. elegans</italic> using empirical data together with an <italic>in silico</italic> model, using the FE method, to characterize the mechanical properties of three different worm tissue compartments.
