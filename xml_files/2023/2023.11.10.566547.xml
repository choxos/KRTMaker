required for tumourigenesis. Phenotypic plasticity is an important gateway to malignancy and inflammation can fuel tumourigenesis, however, little is known about when and how these hallmarks first arise. Using single-cell transcriptomics and <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging we have characterised the immediate cell intrinsic and innate immune responses during the first 24 hours following oncogenic Ras activation, in an inducible zebrafish model of HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-mediated skin tumour initiation. We found that only a subset of basal keratinocytes, but not superficial keratinocytes, are susceptible to RAS-driven phenotypic plasticity. These preneoplastic cells undergo dedifferentiation and partial EMT, resembling malignant cells observed in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Strikingly, the same subset instigates the development of tumour-promoting neutrophils, which in turn enhance preneoplastic cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of oncogenic Ras are primarily determined by the cell of origin and reveal an association between the unlocking of phenotypic plasticity and the onset of tumour-promoting inflammation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5">The Ras gene family comprises the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Paradoxically, Ras driver mutations have also been found in normal healthy human tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, indicating that mutations alone are insufficient for tumourigenesis. Non-genetic factors such as intrinsic cellular state and local tissue microenvironment may be instrumental for tumour promotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. For example, Ras-driven tumourigenesis can be accelerated by wounding or inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, cancer associated inflammation has long been known to promote tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Within established tumours, myeloid cells are reprogrammed to support tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, however, little is known about the immediate myeloid response following the first oncogenic mutation. Modelling tumour initiation in zebrafish larvae has enabled <italic>in vivo</italic> visualisation of myeloid responses, showing that oncogenic Ras can trigger cancer-promoting inflammation within hours of oncogene activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.</p><p id="P6">Phenotypic plasticity is crucial for tumourigenesis as cancer cells must diverge from tissue homeostasis that imposes limits upon cell fate and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Cells carrying oncogenic mutations initially show increased proliferation but can later undergo differentiation, highlighting differentiation as an early barrier to tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Although phenotypic plasticity, such as dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation, is recognised as a requirement for malignant conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, most existing studies focus on established tumours or preneoplastic lesions occurring weeks post oncogene activation at which point plastic cell states are already observed. The mechanisms that first unlock phenotypic plasticity and the timing of its acquisition remain to be fully described.</p><p id="P7">Here we used single cell transcriptomics and <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging to examine the cellular state of nascent preneoplastic cells (PNCs) and the inflammatory response throughout the first 24 hours following oncogenic HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> expression in the zebrafish epidermis. Our approach enabled us to determine that basal keratinocytes possess a permissive cellular state for oncogenic Ras driven phenotypic plasticity. Oncogenic Ras induced partial EMT and the acquisition of cancer stem cell features, but only in a subset of basal keratinocytes, demonstrating the importance of non-genetic factors intrinsic to the cell of origin. Cross species data integration revealed a close resemblance between these PNCs and highly invasive cells found at the leading edge of human tumours, showing that malignant potential can emerge within 24 hours of RAS-induced tumour initiation. This subset of PNCs also expressed a unique profile of cytokines implicated in the activation of a systemic neutrophil response. Neutrophils enhanced the proliferation of PNCs, with both immature and mature neutrophils undergoing activation and recruitment to the local PNC microenvironment, similar to the neutrophil response recently described in human tumours.</p><p id="P8">Our findings identify the intrinsic state of the cell of origin as the primary determinant in driving both phenotypic plasticity and intrinsic tumour-promoting inflammation within the basal epidermis.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Cell of origin determines response to oncogenic Ras</title><p id="P9">HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> is a common mutation in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and leads to tumour formation in the mouse epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To study Ras-driven tumour initiation we used a tamoxifen-inducible transgenic zebrafish model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, wherein the human HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> oncogene is conditionally expressed within the epidermis under the control of the <italic>krtt1c19e</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The zebrafish larval epidermis consists of a superficial periderm and basal keratinocyte layer, the latter of which gives rise to all epidermal lineages within adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The <italic>krtt1c19e</italic> promoter is active within all basal keratinocytes and a small proportion of superficial keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, therefore, preneoplastic cells within Tg(<italic>krtt1c19e</italic>:KALTA4-ER<sup>T2</sup>; UAS:EGFP-HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>) larvae (hereafter referred to as HRAS larvae) originate from both epidermal layers. Control keratinocytes from Tg(<italic>krtt1c19e</italic>:KALTA4-ER<sup>T2</sup>; UAS:EGFP-CAAX) larvae (hereafter referred to as CAAX larvae) express membrane bound EGFP. The UAS promoter provides mosaic expression of the HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> or CAAX transgenes throughout the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Previously, we found that HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> expression within the larval epidermis triggers hyperproliferation, morphological changes and an inflammatory response within 24 hours post induction (hpi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, we isolated epidermal cells and myeloid cells from the same animal by FACS at 8 and 24 hpi to perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), aim to capture the immediate cellular response to oncogenic Ras and host inflammatory cell response to RAS driven preneoplastic initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>). Cell types were identified by unsupervised clustering and expression of known markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1B-D</xref>). We found three clusters of basal keratinocytes, one of which was composed almost exclusively of cells derived from HRAS larvae, indicating the emergence of a novel Rasdriven cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1E-F</xref>). In contrast, we found a single cluster of superficial keratinocytes composed equally of cells from both CAAX and HRAS larvae. This suggests that basal keratinocytes are more susceptible to Ras-driven changes whilst superficial keratinocytes possess a more fixed cellular identity. Furthermore, differential expression analysis showed &gt;2,000 genes were differentially expressed in basal keratinocytes following HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> expression compared to only 462 differentially expressed (DE) genes in superficial keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Syngeneic preneoplastic cells diverge towards distinct cellular states within 24 hours of oncogene activation</title><p id="P11">To examine keratinocytes and PNCs in detail we sub-clustered these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This resulted in a clear separation of basal-derived PNCs from control cells, whereas both CAAX and HRAS superficial keratinocytes remained clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Control basal keratinocytes (clusters CAAX-1 to -5) maintained stable cellular states over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, PNCs showed substantial transcriptomic changes compared to CAAX keratinocytes by 8hpi (PNC-1) and continued to change further over time (PNC-2 to -4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Pairwise differential expression showed that PNC-1 and PNC-2 had very few specific DE genes, indicating a continuous transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, PNC-3 and PNC-4 were highly distinct with 811 and 1,017 specific DE genes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Permissive DE analysis (see methods) revealed that all basal-derived PNC clusters upregulated cell cycle-related genes, such as <italic>pcna, tubb2b</italic> and <italic>mki67,</italic> consistent with the hyperproliferation of PNCs previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Additionally, all basal-derived PNC clusters downregulated control CAAX cluster-specific genes, suggesting a departure from normal development. Immediate Ras/Erk target genes, such as <italic>egr2a</italic> and <italic>fosl1a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), were enriched in PNC-1 capturing the early response to Ras induction at 8hpi. PNC-3 enriched genes included <italic>mmp9</italic> and <italic>mmp13a,</italic> and actin binding proteins associated with cancer cell migration, such as tpm4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, <italic>tagln2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and <italic>anxa2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, PNC-4 enriched genes included <italic>myb,</italic> a key regulator of terminal differentiation in the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and <italic>cldna,</italic> a marker of intermediate keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, suggesting that these cells undergo differentiation to suprabasal fate. In support of this, there was also a noteworthy overlap between genes enriched within PNC-3 and the superficial keratinocyte cluster, including superficial markers, such as <italic>cyt1, cytl1, cldne, cldnb</italic> and <italic>krt17</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Finally, whilst PNC-2 lacked specifically enriched genes, this cluster expressed low levels of both PNC-3 and PNC-4 enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), suggestive of an intermediate state. Indeed, pseudotime analysis identified a branch point within PNC-2 at which PNCs diverge towards the two distinct cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To determine whether distinct subpopulations of PNCs were present <italic>in vivo,</italic> we used HCR™ fluorescence in situ hybrisation (HCR FISH) to visualise gene expression. We confirmed that the expression of PNC-3 marker <italic>lamc2</italic> and PNC-4 marker <italic>cldna</italic> were mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). Moreover, within the same PNC clone, some <italic>cldna</italic> positive PNCs were positioned apically to <italic>lamc2</italic> positive PNCs (Supplementary Video 1). This is consistent with the enrichment of intermediate and superficial keratinocyte markers within PNC-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>) and confirms their differentiation to suprabasal fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">These findings show that syngeneic PNCs, even when derived from the same cell type, can undergo divergent cell state transitions. Whilst some remained aligned with normal tissue differentiation occurring during homeostasis (PNC-4), others unlocked unique cellular states distinct from normal epidermis (PNC-2 / PNC-3).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Subsets of Ras-driven PNCs undergo dedifferentiation to an embryonic-like state</title><p id="P15">To explore transcriptomic differences between PNCs and normal epidermis, we performed pairwise pseudo-bulk comparisons between each of the 24hpi PNC clusters versus control basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The 100 most downregulated genes in all three clusters (PNC-2, 3 and 4) included numerous basal keratinocyte markers, collagens and keratins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This downregulation is expected in PNC-4 cells due to their differentiation process. However, the absence of differentiation markers in PNC-2 and PNC-3, despite similar downregulation, suggests a potential dedifferentiation occurring within these clusters.</p><p id="P16">In many aggressive cancers, cells travel backwards along the Waddington landscape and begin to re-express gene programmes reminiscent of embryonic precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To determine whether this occurs within Ras-driven PNCs, we derived gene sets from zebrafish embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Immature epidermal genes were upregulated in all PNC clusters, whilst mature epidermal genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 C&amp;D</xref>). To investigate this further we inspected the expression of <italic>tp63</italic> target genes, a master regulator of the epidermal lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Genes known to be positively regulated by <italic>tp63</italic> were downregulated within PNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) despite sustained <italic>tp63</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). <italic>Tp63</italic> also acts to repress neuroectoderm genes during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, therefore, we questioned whether dedifferentiation might open a gateway for transdifferentiation. However, genes known to be negatively regulated by <italic>tp63,</italic> including neuroectoderm genes, were not differentially expressed within PNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This indicates dedifferentiation towards an embryonic-like epidermal state without transdifferentiation to neuroectoderm fate.</p><p id="P17">Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed downregulation of genes related to differentiation, development and cell fate commitment, whilst gene sets related to epigenetic programming were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Upregulated epigenetic regulators included <italic>dnmt1, uhrf, hdac1, ezh2, actl6a, prmt1, prmt5</italic> and <italic>bptf</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), which are known to suppress differentiation and maintain basal stem cell self-renewal. Many of these chromatin modifiers were also part of the immature epidermis signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Thus, oncogenic Ras expression led to dedifferentiation within a subset of basal keratinocytes, likely regulated at the epigenetic level.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A subpopulation of PNCs undergoes partial EMT and resembles cancer stem cells</title><p id="P18">Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition occurs in tumours and is linked to invasion and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The genes specifically upregulated within the PNC-3 cluster are strongly indicative of EMT. These include genes related to cell migration, such as the arp2/3 complex required for lamellipodia formation, myosins involved in rear contractility, components of migratory signalling pathways and key integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2A</xref>). Cell surface receptors related to EMT and invasion in cancer such as <italic>cd276</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, <italic>cd81a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, <italic>nrp1a/b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> were also upregulated. Upregulation of EMT genes was validated by qPCR of FACS sorted PNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the PNC-3 cluster retained epithelial markers, <italic>cdh1</italic> (E-cadherin), <italic>epcam,</italic> and <italic>tjp1a</italic> (zonal occludins 1) and lacked some mesenchymal markers such as <italic>vim</italic> (vimentin) and <italic>cdh2</italic> (N-cadherin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating only partial EMT (pEMT). Consistent with this finding, the only EMT transcription factor upregulated in PNC-3, <italic>snai2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2C</xref>), was previously found to drive pEMT in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Partial EMT has been associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs), with hybrid E/M cells possessing greater plasticity and tumour initiating capacity than cells at the extremes of the E/M spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Therefore, we questioned whether the PNC-3 cluster may contain additional cancer stem cell (CSC) features. Indeed, CSC markers <italic>cd44a</italic> and <italic>thy1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> were specifically upregulated within PNC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2D</xref>), alongside markers of a CSC population recently identified in a mouse cSCC model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Akin to normal stem cells, CSCs undergo a low rate of proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Inference of cell cycle phase suggested that, although all PNC clusters had an elevated rate of proliferation in comparison to control cells, PNC-3 was the least proliferative cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Bi</xref>). In fact, the expression of pEMT gene program was inversely correlated with the expression of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Bii</xref>) and cell cycle inhibitors were upregulated specifically within PNC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To ascertain whether evidence of pEMT could be observed <italic>in vivo,</italic> we performed live confocal imaging. In comparison to the regular polygonal shape of control basal keratinocytes, PNCs began to undergo morphological changes by 8hpi, some PNCs losing the polygonal shape entirely by 24hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). PNCs became either rounded or stretched, the latter of which possessed protrusions resembling lamellipodia and were classified as “mesenchymal-like” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

The short time frame in which these state changes occurred strongly implies that the cellular response to oncogenic Ras signalling was determined by pre-existing non-genetic factors intrinsic to the cell of origin. This is especially apparent when comparing basal versus superficial keratinocytes, the latter of which retained their cellular identity and did not undergo cell state changes in response to oncogenic Ras. Superficial keratinocytes are terminally differentiated, whilst the basal population consists of stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that stem cells are more susceptible to oncogene-induced plasticity.
