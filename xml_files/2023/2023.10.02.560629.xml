Constitutive immunity allows for a faster response, but it comes with an associated cost that is always present. This trade-off between speed and fitness costs leads to the theoretical prediction that constitutive immunity will be favored where parasite exposure is frequent. We selected populations of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> under high parasite pressure from the parasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>. With RNA sequencing, we found the evolution of resistance in these populations was associated with them developing constitutively active humoral immunity, mediated by the larval fat body. Furthermore, these evolved populations were also able to induce gene expression in response to infection to a greater level, which indicates an overall more activated humoral immune response to parasitization. The anti-parasitoid immune response also relies on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway being activated in muscles following infection, and this induced response was only seen in populations that had evolved under high parasite pressure. We found that the cytokine Upd3, which induces this JAK/STAT response, is being expressed by immature lamellocytes. Furthermore, these immune cells became constitutively present when populations evolved resistance, potentially explaining why they gained the ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling. Thus, under intense parasitism, populations evolved resistance by increasing both constitutive and induced immune defenses, and there is likely an interplay between these two forms of immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The innate immune system utilizes both constitutive and induced mechanisms for defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Constitutive immunity is always active, regardless of the presence of infection, whereas induced immune mechanisms are activated only in response to infection. Constitutive defense includes the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and the presence of circulating immune cells in the absence of infection. On the other hand, induced immunity has the potential to be amplified many times, such as the massive upregulation of AMPs in response to microbial infections and the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Constitutive immunity can provide an immediate response and eliminate pathogens in the early stages of an infection. Nevertheless, immunity is costly to organisms, and constitutive immunity diverts energy from other components of fitness to defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. While costs from constitutive immunity are always present, inducible defense mechanisms impose minimal costs when pathogens are absent. However, mounting an inducible response can be time-consuming, leading to a trade-off between the speed of response and the fitness costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Theoretical models predict that a key factor for determining whether constitutive or induced mechanisms are favored is the probability of encountering a parasite, where frequent parasite exposure leads to the favoring of constitutive defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Consistent with these models, when we artificially evolved <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> populations under high rates of parasitism by the parasitoid wasp species <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>, we found that the populations evolved a constitutively active cellular immune defense. Immune cells in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are called hemocytes and have similar functions to leukocytes in vertebrates. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immature lamellocytes, a type of hemocyte that appears through differentiation in response to parasitization, became constitutively present in these evolved populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The total and circulating hemocyte numbers also increased with frequent parasite exposure, again mimicking the induced immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Moreover, the transcriptional signature of hemocytes from uninfected larvae of these populations also displays constitutive upregulation of immune-inducible genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. All these constitutive defense mechanisms likely contributed to the increased level of resistance in these populations.</p><p id="P4">When a parasitoid wasp lays its egg inside <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the fly larva launches an anti-parasitoid immune response following infection, which can be divided into cellular and humoral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Cellular responses include the proliferation of hemocytes and the differentiation of specialist lamellocytes that function to encapsulate the parasitoid egg in a multilayered cellular capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The capsule becomes melanized through prophenoloxidase activities mediated by crystal cells and lamellocytes, eventually killing the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Humoral immunity is mediated by the fat body of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larva, which is the metabolic hub of the organism, functionally similar to the mammalian liver. The larval fat body is responsible for the secretion of systemic humoral immune effectors. For example, antimicrobial humoral immunity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is mediated by the two hallmark NF-κB signaling pathways in the fat body – Toll and Imd pathways – which upregulate effectors such as antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. However, the role of humoral immune mechanisms in anti-parasitoid immunity is not well characterized. A few secreted immune effectors have been shown to be involved in this response, including thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), where their mammalian counterparts are complement factors involved in the complement cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], a C-type lectin called <italic>lectin-24A</italic> shown to be crucial in the encapsulation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and serine proteases which play key roles in the melanization reaction and Toll pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In addition to the involvement of the two immune tissues, fat body and hemocytes, in the anti-parasitoid response, there exists an interplay between hemocytes and somatic muscles in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae. Wasp infection induces the expression of the cytokines Upd2 and Upd3 by circulating hemocytes, which induce of JAK/STAT activity in somatic muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, JAK/STAT activation in muscles is shown to be required for the encapsulation response, including lamellocyte formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this study, we investigated how the constitutive and induced humoral immune defenses have evolved with high rates of parasitism. We conducted RNA sequencing on the larval fat bodies of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations evolved under high parasite pressure or no parasite pressure. This allowed us to examine the expression of immunity genes changed as resistance evolved, and whether these changes were constitutively present before infection or were inducible after infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The evolution of resistance leads to constitutive expression of immune-inducible genes in the larval fat body</title><p id="P7">Six experimental populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were established from 377 wild-caught <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Three of these (N1-3) were maintained with infection by the NSRef strain of the parasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> at every generation, where flies that survived by launching a successful encapsulation and melanization response were used to establish the next generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The other three populations (C1-3) were not parasitized but were otherwise maintained under the same conditions. The populations maintained with high parasitism evolved resistance. After 56 generations, about 50% of flies successfully encapsulated and melanized the wasps, while the no parasitism controls were only able to melanize less than 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, d.f. = 2.09, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0064).</p><p id="P8">We found previously that high parasitism rates had led to a more active cellular encapsulation response in the populations, including the constitutive presence of immature lamellocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. A constitutive increase in the number of circulating hemocytes was also observed in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. To investigate how humoral immunity has evolved in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations under high pressure of parasitism, we collected the fat bodies of male larvae by dissection from each of the six populations. We analyzed the transcriptional response to infection at 2-, 12-, and 24-hours post-infection (hpi), as well as the transcriptome of fat bodies from age-matched uninfected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We investigated whether the humoral immunity of the selected populations would exhibit a similar constitutively active state as the cellular immune response. Comparing the mean gene expression profiles across the three time points, we see that both infection and selection with parasitoids alter gene expression in the larval fat body. We found that when flies adapted to high rates of parasitism, the uninfected larval fat body exhibits similar transcriptional changes as the fat body of infected flies that have not undergone parasitism every generation. To avoid ascertainment bias, we used data from an independent study of the larval fat body to define a set of 329 parasitism-responsive genes that were significantly differentially expressed with a log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) of greater than one after parasitoid infection.</p><p id="P10">Among these genes, the constitutive changes in expression in the populations adapted to high rates of parasitism were correlated with the infection-induced expression in the populations that were not evolved with parasite pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the transcriptional response seen after infection was greater than the change in gene expression seen in uninfected larvae that had evolved resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This correlation in transcriptional profiles shows that the humoral immunity was partially activated in the evolved populations before the larvae were infected.</p><p id="P11">The genes that show large transcriptional changes with constitutive induction or after infection tend to be upregulated as opposed to downregulated, which is consistent with the role of the fat body in secreting immune effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Among the 33 genes that showed log<sub>2</sub>FC of greater than 4 with constitutive induction and/or infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), 73% are predicted to be secreted, compared to 9% in the full set of genes included in the RNAseq. This indicates that the genes showing large transcriptional inductions in the fat body are significantly enriched for secreted factors (Fisher’s Exact Test, <italic>p</italic>-value =1.99 ×10<sup>-19</sup>).</p><p id="P12">To further understand the effect of selection on the basal humoral immunity level of the selected populations, we compared the expression profiles between selected and control populations, under uninfected conditions across the three time points. After filtering out lowly expressed genes, we detected 9962 genes in the fat body. There is a total of 338 significantly differentially expressed genes with absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC of greater than 1. Taking the 30 most significant of these, the pattern of selection increasing expression more than decreasing expression is apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These highly significant genes include short secreted peptides of the Bomanin family, which are regulated by the Toll pathway with antifungal and antibacterial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], are more highly expressed in selected populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Upon a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes, we also observed an enrichment of serine-type peptidase activity (GO: Molecular Function) in the populations evolved with high rates of parasitism (Figure S1A). For instance, <italic>CG30090, CG33462</italic>, and <italic>SPH93</italic> are all serine proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Proteolytic cascades of extracellular serine proteases play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, including the melanization reaction and activation of the Toll pathway [17,18,22–24].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Populations evolved under the pressure of high parasitism rates can induce gene expression to a greater level</title><p id="P13">We see a higher level of humoral response in the evolved populations. Following infection, the parasitism-inducible genes showed an overall higher level of expression in the populations that had evolved under high rates of parasitism than those evolved without parasitism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This was in contrast to what we previously found for cellular immunity, where the gene expression profiles become similar between the selection regimes after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P14">Under infected conditions, 398 significantly differentially expressed genes, with false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 and absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC of greater than 1, were found between the populations evolved with high rates of parasitism and those maintained without, indicating that there are still substantial differences in transcriptional expression even with parasitoid infection. The genes that are differentially expressed largely show higher expression in the populations evolved with high parasite pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Strikingly, key components of three major immune signaling pathways (Toll, Imd, and JAK/STAT pathways) all show up within the top 30 significantly differentially expressed genes: <italic>Tl, Dif, dl, Rel</italic>, and <italic>hop</italic>. These genes are all significantly upregulated in the populations evolved with high parasitism, suggesting that these pathways are more active in the selected populations under the infected state. GO enrichment of significantly upregulated genes showed enrichment of terms related to “immune system process”, “defense response”, and “interspecies interaction” (Figure S1B). Therefore, the populations evolved with high parasite pressure displayed an overall more activated humoral immune response in the presence of parasitoid infection.</p><p id="P15">A number of parasitism-responsive genes showed similar levels of constitutive expression in the selected populations as the infection-induced expression in the control populations; these genes then became even more upregulated in the selected populations with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, <italic>Tep1</italic> is known to play a role in the melanization of parasitoid eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], and it was expressed more highly in selected populations after infection. Similarly, the serine protease <italic>CG33462</italic> and the fibrinogen-like protein <italic>CG6788</italic>, in addition to a group of antibacterial cecropins, all showed further induction with infection in the populations evolved with high parasitism rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). It is also notable that virtually all the highly induced parasitism-responsive genes have greater levels of expression in the selected populations with infection than in the control populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;3 in control populations).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The immune response is faster in populations evolved under strong parasite pressure</title><p id="P16">As the success of the anti-parasitoid immunity is dependent on how fast the fly can launch its defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], we hypothesized that the populations evolved under high rates of parasitism had an accelerated transcriptional response with infection. We analyzed the expression changes of 44 significantly differentially expressed genes with immune-related functions 2-, 12-, and 24-hours post-infection (hpi). There is generally higher upregulation of these immune-inducible genes at the 2 hpi time point in the populations maintained with parasitic pressure, relative to the baseline of uninfected populations maintained without parasitism (Figure 6). By 12 hpi, the level of induction of these genes became comparable between the populations. Interestingly, at 24 hpi, the populations evolved with parasitism again showed slightly higher level of transcriptional upregulation of these immune-inducible genes. This result suggests that the significantly differentially expressed immune-related genes are more rapidly and highly upregulated in the evolved populations at the early time point of 2 hpi.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Only populations evolved under high parasitism rates activate the JAK/STAT pathway after infection</title><p id="P17">Parasitoid wasp infection can cause hemocytes to secrete the cytokines Upd2 and Upd3, leading to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. As we had observed upregulation of <italic>hop</italic> (which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> JAK) in the populations adapted to high parasitism rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), we investigated how JAK/STAT activity had evolved in these populations. We crossed males from the selected or control populations to females expressing a JAK/STAT pathway activity reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The reporter expresses GFP under the control of ten Stat92E binding sites from the Stat92E-regulated gene <italic>Socs36E</italic>. At 24 hours post-infection (hpi), we see that JAK/STAT activity is strongly induced in the F<sub>1</sub> progeny from the evolved populations, while there is little or no induction in those from the control populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, d.f. = 2.95, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0238). Our results suggest that JAK/STAT is activated only after infection only in populations evolving under high parasitism pressure. The JAK/STAT pathway has been shown to be involved in the encapsulation response, where loss-of-function mutations in <italic>hopscotch</italic> results in reduced ability to generate lamellocytes and reduced encapsulation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Thus, the differential activation of JAK/STAT activity between the selected and control populations may play a part in the difference in resistance to parasitoid infection.</p><p id="P18">JAK/STAT activation in somatic muscles is the result of the cytokines Upd2 and Upd3 being secreted from hemocytes. In a previous study, we found that the immature lamellocyte cell states LAM1 and 2, which are typically only induced by parasitoid infection, become constitutively present in populations selected under high parasitism; the mature LAM3 lamellocyte cell state remains a largely inducible response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. To investigate whether this could underlie the difference in JAK/STAT activation, we examined the expression of Upd2 and Upd3 in the different hemocyte cell states present in a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Utilizing our previous single-cell RNAseq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], we found that LAM2 cells are the main <italic>upd3-</italic>expressing cell state, while plasmatocytes and crystal cells show almost no <italic>upd3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The expression of <italic>upd3</italic> does not change markedly within a cell state upon infection. <italic>upd2</italic> is not included in this dataset as it did not pass the detection thresholds.</p><p id="P19">LAM2 cells are constitutively present in the populations evolved with high parasitism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), and their role as the cytokine-secreting hemocytes suggests that they might act as an early sensing system for the detection of wasp infection in the larvae. When we compare the expression of <italic>upd3</italic> in the three LAM cell states between the evolved and non-evolved populations, we see that in uninfected conditions, there is a higher proportion of <italic>upd3-</italic> expressing cells in the evolved populations compared to the controls across all three cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Of the LAM2 cell state only, the evolved populations have 8-fold more cells expressing Upd3 than the control populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). LAM2 is the final immature cell state before differentiation into the mature lamellocyte cell state LAM3 on the hemocyte lineage from plasmatocytes to lamellocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Our results suggest that the immature LAM2 cells may play a role in the crosstalk between different parts of the immune system through cytokine secretion, by which they are likely responsible for the cell non-autonomous activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in other larval tissues including the somatic muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">We investigated how humoral immunity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> populations evolved under high parasite pressure. This work complements our previous results on how the cellular immune response changed in response to high rates of parasitism. In contrast to hemocytes, where differences in gene expression largely reflect the differentiation of specialist cell types for the encapsulation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], RNA sequencing in the larval fat bodies is studying the activation of immune pathways and secretion of immune effectors. Our results showed that constitutive humoral immune mechanisms are favored when the probability of parasitization is high, consistent with theoretical predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The selected <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations showed constitutive expression of immune-inducible genes in their larval fat bodies, indicating constitutive secretion of immune effectors for the anti-parasitoid response, even in the absence of infection.</p><p id="P21">As parasitoid virulence is high, theory predicts that the parasite will select for higher investment in both constitutive and induced defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis in that we see an increase in both forms of defenses in the populations evolved with high rates of parasitism. However, when we investigated the cellular immunity of these populations, we did not see the same greater overall response—the only differences were before infection, and after infection the populations of immune cells in the selected and control populations were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. While these findings may be affected by the timepoints we examined, it suggests that the two branches of the immune system may differ in their evolutionary dynamics.</p><p id="P22">Between the selection regimes, we observe a stark difference in the induced response when we investigated JAK/STAT pathway activity. With infection, we see strong activation of JAK/STAT activity in the selected populations whereas the controls showed no induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). JAK/STAT is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway with functions in immunity and defense. It may provide a link between the evolutionary changes we have observed in different tissues as JAK/STAT signaling involves cytokines secreted after infection, which then bind to receptors found on other cells, activating the pathway through an intracellular signaling cascade. The final effector of the pathway is the transcription factor STAT, which translocates when active to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes. Wasp infection causes two cytokines to be secreted by hemocytes, Upd2 and Upd3, which then activate JAK/STAT activity in other tissues through ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This non-cell autonomous activation of JAK/STAT signaling in the somatic muscles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is required for lamellocyte formation and encapsulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. It may also influence transcriptional changes we observed in the fat body, as septic injury results in hemocyte-specific Upd3 cytokine secretion that activates JAK/STAT signaling in the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Similarly, the expression of the Tot family of stress response genes and the thioester-containing protein Tep1 are controlled by JAK/STAT signaling in the fat body [30– 32]. We have previously found that these evolved populations showed constitutively active cellular immunity – particularly the constitutive presence of immature lamellocyte cell state LAM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Reanalysing this data, we found that these cells are the main Upd3-expressing hemocyte subtype. It is therefore possible that it is these cells that are responsible for activating JAK/STAT in the evolved populations.</p><p id="P23">It is known that parasitoid wasps employ various strategies to block and evade host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. One explanation of our results is therefore that the virulent NSRef strain of <italic>L. boulardi</italic> wasps may be suppressing JAK/STAT pathway activity in susceptible flies while the populations maintained under high parasite pressure have evolved to counter this suppression. If this is the case, the constitutive expression of Upd3 cytokines by hemocytes in these evolved populations in the absence of wasp infection might allow these flies to activate JAK/STAT signaling before the parasitoid venoms can sabotage this defense. Altogether, our results suggest a hypothesis by which constitutively producing previously inducible precursor cell states, the evolved populations can more effectively respond to parasitoid infections through a two-fold mechanism: 1) the constitutive presence of immature lamellocytes allows for the rapid production of mature lamellocytes upon infection, and 2) the cellular immune system is also “primed” to activate other parts of the immune response through the secretion of cytokines by LAM2 before they differentiate into mature lamellocytes. Interestingly, the transcription of Upd3 does not increase in LAM2 cells after infection, so the activation of JAK/STAT may rely on release of cytokines being controlled at the level of translation or secretion, as is common in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P24">Autoimmune damage may be a price hosts have to pay for resistance to infection. This cost may be present both in the absence of infection, as with many autoimmune disorders, or during infection, in what is known as hypersensitivity reactions often linked to inflammation and complement activation caused by an immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. While we did not investigate self-damage, our results are consistent with both effects: we see both constitutive activation of immunity in the absence of an infection and overall greater immune activation after infection. In particular, aberrant cytokine signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway underlies many autoimmune disorders found in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Our results show both greater Upd3 expression by hemocytes in the absence of infection and higher JAK/STAT activity after infection, indicating potentially high immunopathological costs to the hosts in the evolved populations.</p><p id="P25">To our knowledge, this is the first model in which the evolution of humoral immunity under high parasite pressure has been studied. Along with our previous findings on the cellular immunity of these selected populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], we show that constitutive immunity is favored in two different immune tissues in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae when selected for resistance with high rates of parasitism. Future studies on different species and models will provide more insights to how general is this observation of natural selection driving evolution of constitutive defenses when infection is common. Our studies on evolution over short time scales may provide an explanation more broadly of the evolutionary logic as to why some aspects of host immunity are inducible and others are not, and the reasons why immunopathological disease is so widespread.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Artificial selection of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></title><p id="P26">The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines used were continuations of selections from the populations established by Leitão et al.

Isofemale lines were established by placing single females in vials with cornmeal food (per 1200 ml water: 13g agar, 105g dextrose, 105g maize, 23g yeast, 35ml Nipagin 10% w/v). Five females and five males were collected from the progeny of each isofemale line to create a source population of 3770 flies. The source population was collected into cages and fitted with 90mm apple agar plates (per 1500 ml water: 45g agar, 50g dextrose, 500ml apple juice, 30ml Nipagin 10% w/v) covered with yeast paste (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> – Sigma-Aldrich #YSC2). The flies carried out overnight egg lays and eggs were collected from the agar plate with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a paintbrush. The eggs were collected in 15 ml centrifuge tubes and allowed to settle to the bottom. Subsequently, 500 μl of the egg solution was transferred into a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube, from which 6 μl of egg solution was added to plastic vials containing cornmeal food. The vials were kept at 25°C, in a 14-hr light/10-hr dark cycle and 70% humidity. 48 hours after egg transfer, a single female wasp was added into each vial for infection of 24 hours, and some vials were not infected. Vials were then incubated at 25°C for 12 days in total, then flies from infected treatments were collected and randomly sorted into triplicate selection lines (N1-3). Flies that were not infected were sorted into triplicated control populations (C1-3). Each subsequent generation of selected populations were maintained in the same way, while the control populations were maintained with the same protocol without infections. The population sizes were maintained at around 200 adult flies for each.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Encapsulation assays</title><p id="P27">Female wasps lay eggs inside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hemocoel through the ovipositor.

individuals. As constitutive immunity is a more rapid response, theory predicts that it will be favored when animals frequently encounter parasites. When we subjected populations of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to high rates of parasitization from its natural parasite, <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> parasitoid wasps, we indeed observed that the immune response became constitutively active. Uninfected insects had an activated humoral immune response and produced cytokine-secreting immune cells that were normally induced after infection. However, we also found that these populations evolved a greater induced response. This included a greatly increased cytokine response after infection, suggesting that the constitutive activation of some aspects of the immune system may allow a greater induced response in other tissues.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Selection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations for resistance to parasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>.</title><p>(A) Schematic of experimental design.
