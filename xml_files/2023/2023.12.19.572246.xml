The precise excision of tRNAs by the mitochondrial endoribonucleases (mt-RNase), mt-RNase P and Z, releases all RNA species from the two RNA transcripts. The tRNAs then undergo 3’-CCA addition. In metazoan mitochondria, RNase P is a multi-enzyme assembly that comprises the endoribonuclease PRORP and a tRNA methyltransferase subcomplex. The requirement for a tRNA methyltransferase complex in mt-RNase P cleavage activity is not fully understood. Moreover, the mechanisms of pre-tRNA 3’-cleavage and CCA addition have also yet to be uncovered. Here we report cryo-EM structures that visualise these events, revealing the molecular basis for the first steps of RNA-transcript processing in human mitochondria. Altogether, the structures visualise four steps of mitochondrial tRNA maturation: 5’ and 3’ tRNA-end processing, methylation and 3’-CCA addition, and explain the defined sequential order of tRNA processing. The methyltransferase subcomplex recognises the pre-tRNA in a distinct mode that can support tRNA processing and 3’-CCA addition, likely resulting from an evolutionary adaptation of mitochondrial tRNA maturation complexes to the structurally-variable mitochondrial tRNAs. This subcomplex can also ensure a tRNA-folding quality-control checkpoint before the sequential docking of the maturation enzymes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitochondria generate most of the cellular energy in eukaryotes through oxidative phosphorylation. In human mitochondria, this capacity is critically dependent on the biogenesis within the organelle of 13 essential proteins of the respiratory chain that are encoded in the mitochondrial DNA genome (mt-DNA). The mt-DNA also encodes the RNA components of the specialised translation machinery of the organelle: 2 ribosomal RNAs (mt-rRNAs) and 22 transfer RNAs (mt-tRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Each mt-DNA strand is transcribed as a large polycistronic RNA transcript containing all the RNA species required for mitochondrial translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Most of the individual RNA species are released by endonucleolytic excision of tRNAs from each polycistronic RNA transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, constituting a key step of mitochondrial gene expression. These processing events likely occur co-transcriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and are performed in RNA granules close to the mitochondrial nucleoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Processed mt-tRNAs further undergo the addition of the 3’-CCA trinucleotide and chemical modifications to become fully mature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Impaired processing of mt-tRNAs has a detrimental effect on gene expression and ribosome assembly in the organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and mutations that disturb any stage of mt-tRNA maturation or mt-tRNA structures are linked to severe human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The mt-tRNA 5’-leader and 3’-trailer processing reactions are performed by the mt-RNase P and mt-RNase Z, respectively. In metazoan mitochondria, the endoribonuclease PRORP (protein-only RNase P) acts in place of the catalytic RNA component employed by the prototypical RNase P ribozyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, while the endoribonuclease ELAC2, a long-form RNase Z found only in Eukaryotes, processes the 3’-trailer of both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The processing is ordered, with 5’-leader pre-RNA cleavage occurring prior to 3’-trailer processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. A few mt-pre-tRNAs are organised as clusters such that the 3’-trailer of one tRNA borders the 5’ end of its neighbour. In the case of the tRNA<sup>His</sup>-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) pair, where tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) lacks the D-arm and has an extended anticodon stem, the processing of the 3’-trailer of tRNA<sup>His</sup> by ELAC2 simultaneously generates a mature 5’-end tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY), without the need for PRORP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Metazoan mt-RNase P is a multi-enzyme assembly comprising the endonuclease PRORP and a tRNA methyltransferase (MTase) subcomplex composed of the MTase, TRMT10C, and the dehydrogenase, SDR5C1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These enzymes, but not their enzymatic activities, are strictly required for efficient tRNA cleavage by PRORP <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. TRMT10C belongs to the SPOUT-fold Trm10 family of tRNA MTases found in archaea and eukaryotes. It catalyses the purine-9 N1-methylation of mt-tRNAs using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This dual specificity, <italic>i.e</italic>. the ability to methylate either nucleotides A9 or G9 in mt-tRNAs, is not shared by all Trm10-family enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. So far, TRMT10C is also the only member of the Trm10 family that is active in complex with a protein partner. The N1-methylation of purine-9 is the most prevalent nucleotide modification in human mt-tRNAs. 19 of the 22 mt-tRNAs have an N1-methylated purine 9, with 14 occurring on an adenine (m<sup>1</sup>A) and 5 on a guanine (m<sup>1</sup>G)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The mt-tRNAs have low structural stability compared to cytosolic tRNAs because they have a low GC content and their D-, T- and variable loops, that support the folding of cytosolic tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, are either absent or differ in length. Nucleotide modifications are crucial to ensure functional folding and stability of these structurally-divergent tRNAs required for mitochondrial translation. After mt-tRNA processing, the addition of 3’-CCA, which is required for aminoacylation, is catalysed without the requirement for a nucleic-acid template by TRNT1, a class II nucleotidyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5"><italic>In vitro</italic> data suggest that the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex may act as a maturation platform to facilitate sequential processing steps of the low-stability mitochondrial pre-tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The pre-tRNA is bound to TRMT10C/SDR5C1 for purine-9 N1-methylation and 5’-leader processing by PRORP, and remains associated to TRMT10C/SDR5C1 during subsequent maturation steps, <italic>i.e</italic>. 3’ processing by ELAC2 and 3’ -CCA addition by TRNT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the presence of the pre-tRNA in the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex dramatically enhances the activity of PRORP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, but has no impact on TRNT1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Conflicting results have been obtained for ELAC2: either a significantly enhancement of the ELAC2 activity for most mt-tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or a decrease in ELAC2 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the tRNA is not released from the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex after 5’-cleavage or methylation and is thus only accessible in the subcomplex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the interaction of TRMT10C/SDR5C1 with ELAC2 and TRNT1 enzyme is supported by their localization in mitochondrial RNA granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and by the interaction of TRMT10C with ELAC2 and with TRNT1 in affinity-capture mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. ELAC2 and TRNT1 also mature nuclear tRNA where TRMT10C/SDR5C1 is absent, implying that they are active without the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex to process more structurally-stable cytosolic tRNAs.</p><p id="P6">The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of mt-RNase P bound to the pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr25</sup> has elucidated the organisation of this complex. A tetramer of SDR5C1 interacts with a monomer of TRMT10C that wraps around the mt pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, with PRORP poised to process the pre-tRNA 5’-leader (PDB 7ONU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The requirement of the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex for PRORP activity still remains unclear. From structural data, it was proposed that PRORP adopts an active structure upon binding to the TRMT10C/SDR5C1-bound pre-tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, PRORP has been recently shown to be active alone <italic>in vitro</italic>, the main function of TRMT10C/SDR5C1 probably being to direct PRORP’s nuclease domain to the cleavage site, thereby increasing the rate and accuracy of cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The organisation of the mt-RNase P exposes the 3′ cleavage site of pre-tRNA, where ELAC2 may bind. However, due to a lack of structural data on ELAC2, it is not clear whether ELAC2 could bind the pre-tRNA simultaneously with PRORP or would require the enzymes to exchange. Moreover, no experimental structure is available for ELAC2 or for a eukaryotic tRNA-bound RNase Z. Therefore, the mechanisms of 3′ cleavage and how the hierarchy of processing reactions is ensured remain to be determined. Similarly, no structural information is available for tRNA recognition by TRNT1 and the mechanism of 3′CCA-addition.</p><p id="P7">To investigate the mechanism of mitochondrial pre-tRNA 3’-processing and 3’CCA-addition, and the potential role of TRMT10C/SDR5C1 as a tRNA-maturation platform, we reconstituted functional complexes containing human ELAC2 or TRNT1 enzymes with the mitochondrial pre-tRNA bound to TRMT10C/SDR5C1 complex. To investigate the dual specificity of TRMT10C, the methylation complexes were formed with pre-tRNAs containing either an A9 (pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>) or a G9 (pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>) and with SAH, the cofactor-product for methylation, bound in the TRMT10C active site. To visualise the processing of the tRNA<sup>His</sup>-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) pair, we reconstituted the mt-RNase P and mt-RNase Z complexes with this pair of pre-tRNAs. We determined the structures of these four mt-tRNA maturation complexes using single-particle cryo-EM at a global resolution ranging from 2.7 to 3.2 Å, revealing snapshots of the four tRNA maturation steps, <italic>i.e</italic>. N1-methylation of purine 9, 5’-leader and 3’-trailer processing and 3’-CCA addition. These structures provide the molecular basis for the first steps of RNA-transcript processing in human mitochondria and for a chain of maturation events that takes pre-tRNA from its transcript state to a maturation state ready to be amino-acylated for mitochondrial translation. They rationalise the role of TRMT10C/SDR5C1 complex as a scaffold that supports pre-tRNA maturation for structurally-degenerate mitochondrial tRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure determination of the human mitochondrial tRNA maturation complexes</title><p id="P8">To reconstitute human mt-tRNA maturation complexes, we recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex, PRORP, ELAC2, TRNT1 and mutants of the endoribonucleases, PRORP<sub>D479A</sub> and ELAC2<sub>H548A</sub>. These mutations target catalytic residues that coordinate metal ions in the active site of these endoribonucleases. The pre-tRNA substrates, pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) pair (hereafter named pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup>), were produced by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1ab</xref>). pre-tRNA<sup>His(0,Ser)</sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>Ile(0,4)</sup>, both with no 5’-leader, and tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> with no extensions were also produced to provide substrates for ELAC2 and TRNT1, respectively. TRMT10C/SDR5C1 forms a stable complex with pre-tRNA, and addition of co-factors or co-factor analogues, <italic>i.e</italic>. S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) to TRMT10C, NADH to SDR5C1 and CTP, ATP or CDP to TRNT1 stabilised these enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, SAH, NADH and CDP were added for cryo-EM analysis. We performed methylation, processing and 3’-CCA addition assays to investigate whether reconstituted maturation complexes with pre-tRNA bound to TRMT10C/SDR5C1 complex are functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Methylation assays, using H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>-SAM as methyl donor, showed that the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 complex methylates both pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup>. In pre-tRNA cleavage assays, PRORP processed pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup>, whereas the PRORP<sub>D479A</sub> mutant did not. Pre-tRNA<sup>His(0,Ser)</sup> is substrate of ELAC2, while the ELAC2<sub>H548A</sub> mutant was catalytically inactive. Lastly, in a 3’-CCA addition assay, TRNT1 could extend tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and CDP was used to block TRNT1 at the incorporation of the first C, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">For cryo-EM analysis, we first mixed TRMT10C/SDR5C1 with NADH and SAH, then added pre-tRNA, and finally either PRORP<sub>D479A</sub>, ELAC2<sub>H548A</sub> or TRNT1 in excess. Single-particle cryo-EM data collection and processing yielded EM density maps at an overall resolution of 3.2 Å for the TRMT10C/SDR5C1/pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> complex, 2.7 Å for TRMT10C/SDR5C1/ pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup>/PRORP, 2.7 Å for TRMT10C/SDR5C1/ pre-tRNA<sup>His(0,Ser)</sup>/ELAC2 and 3.1 Å for TRMT10C/SDR5C1/tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> /TRNT1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs 2-5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Local resolution of 4.5 Å was obtained for PRORP, 4.1 Å for ELAC2 and 4.5 Å for TRNT1. In all structures, a second copy of TRMT10C/pre-tRNA was bound on the opposite side of the SDR5C1 tetramer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) as described for the RNase P/pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, confirming the 2:4 TRMT10C:SDR5C1 stoichiometry previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The second copies displayed less clear densities, likely due to lower occupancy of TRMT10C, and we therefore focused our analysis on the better-resolved structural units. The resulting density maps allowed us to fit the crystal structure of TRMT10C with SAM (PDB 5NFJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, the cryo-EM structure of mt-RNase P/pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (PDB 7ONU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, the AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> models of the mt-tRNA maturation enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and to model the pre-tRNAs including the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) of the tRNA pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The density maps for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of TRMT10C were defined only for complexes where a maturation enzyme is bound on the pre-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e,f,g</xref>). Compared to the structure of mt-RNase P/pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (PDB 7ONU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we were able to build new regions for this domain spanning from residues 61-91, 157-174 and 386-403, to visualise the SAH in the TRMT10C active site and to build the 5’-leader and 3’-trailer of the pre-tRNA pair, resulting in a complete structure of the mt-RNase P.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>5’-to-3’ order during mitochondrial tRNA-end processing</title><p id="P10">The architecture of the maturation complexes is globally the same in all structures, <italic>i.e</italic>. TRMT10C asymmetrically straddles a tetramer of SDR5C1, while wrapping around the pre-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e,f,g</xref>). Indeed, TRMT10C is anchored in the SDR5C1 tetramer via a central, mostly helical region, that connects the TRMT10C MTase domain to its N-terminal domain (NTD). Both domains of TRMT10C bind an L-shaped pre-tRNA. This leaves one side of the pre-tRNA exposed for interaction with maturation enzymes. For the tRNA pair, tRNA<sup>His</sup> is bound in the TRMT10C/SDR5C1 subcomplex. The pre-tRNA binding sites of PRORP and ELAC2 overlap, excluding a simultaneous binding of PRORP and ELAC2 on the pre-tRNA and forcing the sequential action of those two nucleases. In our structure of mt-RNase P, PRORP interacts with the leader and the trailer sequences of tRNA<sup>His</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast, superimposition of the pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup> structure (with a 5’-leader) with that of pre-tRNA<sup>His(0,Ser)</sup> (with no 5’-leader) in the complex with ELAC2 shows clashes between the 5’-leader of pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup> and ELAC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), likely preventing ELAC2 binding to a pre-tRNA with a 5’-leader. Indeed, ELAC2 cleavage is inhibited by the presence of the 5’-leader in pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This rationalises the 5’-to-3’ processing order previously observed for mt-pre-tRNA maturation <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structure of human mitochondrial RNase P processing pre-tRNA</title><p id="P11">The cryo-EM structure of mt-RNase P in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>His-Ser</sup> shows PRORP bound to the acceptor- and T-arms of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> through its catalytic and PPR domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The 5’-cleavage site of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> is positioned in the catalytic site of PRORP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). For this, a stretch of conserved residues in PRORP (residues 497-504, in red on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), that includes the conserved aspartates D499 and D503 involved in coordinating one of the two catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions used in this family of enzymes for RNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, interacts with the phosphodiester backbone of nucleotides G1 and U2 of tRNA<sup>His</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, nucleotides U-1, U-2 and C-3 of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> 5’-leader are in contact with the catalytic domain of PRORP through two loops (residues 415-422 and 473-478) and a 3<sub>10</sub> helix (residues 446-450) that contain residues conserved in mammals (in green on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). H447 is notably π-stacked on U-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are proposed to be coordinated by D479/D499/D503 and D409/D478/D479 (mutated to alanine here), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The density map is consistent with one Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordinated by the scissile phosphate, D499 and D478 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The second ion is not observed due to the D479A mutation, but could be modelled using the crystal structure of PRORP from <italic>A. thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. PRORP is anchored to the pre-tRNA by interactions with both the 5’- and 3’-cleavage sites. Indeed, the density map also reveals interactions between the phosphodiester backbone of the nucleotides of the 3’-cleavage site, C73 of tRNA<sup>His</sup> together with G1 and A2 of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY), and two long loops of PRORP that contains conserved residues (e.g. F417, P418, K419 and F532; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These interactions likely block the stacking of the acceptor stems of the two tRNAs, that would prevent 5’-processing by PRORP.</p><p id="P12">Two sites of interaction between TRMT10C and PRORP were revealed in our structure. First, the density map suggests an interaction between a loop of PRORP (residues R384-K385) and the catalytic loop of TRMT10C (residues 310-320), whenever SAM or SAH is present, since the cofactor defines this loop conformation that supports these contacts. The presence of SAM is not required for PRORP activity, but this interaction could explain why SAM binding increases the binding efficiency and 5’-end processing by PRORP for some mt pre-tRNAs, like pre-tRNA<sup>Val 38</sup>.

First, the two processing enzymes cannot bind simultaneously to the pre-tRNA, so they must act sequentially, which necessitates an exchange of the endonuclease bound to the pre-tRNA. Second, the mitochondrial RNase Z cannot bind to a pre-tRNA containing a 5’-leader, whereas RNase P can. This imposes a 5’-to-3’ order for the pre-tRNA processing steps. The structure of mt-RNase P in complex with a pair of pre-tRNA reveals new interactions between PRORP and the pre-tRNA extremities (5’-leader and 3’-trailer), and between PRORP and TRMT10C. We show that the first two helices of TRMT10C interact with the PPR domain of PRORP, clamping PRORP on the pre-tRNA. PRORP is not active on the pre-tRNA pair when these interactions are abolished.

The inability of TRMT10C/SDR5C1 to bind a pre-tRNA prevents PRORP from processing its 5’-leader, thereby blocking ELAC2 from cleaving the 3’-trailer, in turn blocking TRNT1 from adding the 3’CCA sequence. This blocking of pre-tRNA maturation, when tRNAs cannot bind to TRMT10C/SDR5C1, gives the subcomplex a role in tRNA quality-control and could prevent pre-tRNAs for which an error occurs during transcription from entering the maturation process. tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGY) is found in a tRNA triplet, where it is bordered by more canonical pre-tRNAs upstream and downstream.
