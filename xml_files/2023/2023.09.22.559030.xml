Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (<italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named <italic>Peromyscus coronavirus-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>. Both belong to the <italic>Betacoronavirus 1</italic> species and are ~90% identical to the closest known relative, <italic>Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus.</italic> Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk.

In the intervening years, COVID-19 research necessarily focused on human-to-human transmission. However, there is another important dynamic to consider: SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the animal-human interface. Specifically, the risk posed by viral spillback (human-to-animal), sustained transmission in naive animal populations (animal-to-animal), and secondary spillover (spillback followed by animal-to-human) is currently unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Outbreaks at the animal-human interface hold two important implications for long-term control. First, with the pandemic now in an endemic stage marked by less human-to-human transmission, animals could become an increasingly important source of new outbreaks. Second, transmission within new non-human host species could result in unexpected viral evolution, potentially yielding variants with properties such as increased virulence or enhanced immune escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.Coupled with the challenges of viral surveillance in animal populations, concerning variants might not be detected until their emergence among humans.</p><p id="P5">For viral spillback to occur, a given animal species must be both susceptible and exposed to SARS-CoV-2. All vertebrates are potentially susceptible due to the highly conserved angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells, although the degree of susceptibility varies based on how well the species’ ACE2 receptor binds to the virus spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, continually high levels of global human-to-human transmission have provided innumerable exposure opportunities over the past several years. As of August 2023, one database reported SARS-CoV-2 infections or exposures in 34 animal species across 39 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Affected species include companion, zoo, farmed, and wild animals. If viral spillback occurred, only a subset of species may be capable of sufficiently high viral replication and infectious virus shedding, combined with suitable behaviors, to enable within-species transmission. In addition, sustained transmission within some species may depend on repeated viral spillback from humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The final dynamic to consider is that of potential secondary spillover. Few examples of secondary spillover of any pathogen have been reported, likely in part due to the many behavioral and host barriers a pathogen must overcome combined with the challenges of observing such dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Despite this, potentially due to broad susceptibility and substantial exposure opportunities, several instances of SARS-CoV-2 secondary spillover have been reported including from farmed mink (<italic>Neovison vison</italic>) to workers in the Netherlands, imported golden hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) to pet shop workers in Hong Kong, and white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>) to human contacts in Canada and the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Not all animals are equally likely to experience viral spillback, sustained transmission, and/or secondary spillover. In this study, we focused on rodents due to their prominence as zoonotic disease reservoirs and proximity to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, posing the following question: is there evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spillback from humans or other animals into rodents in Connecticut (CT) and, if so, do we observe evidence of sustained transmission and secondary spillback?</p><p id="P6">To investigate, we selected the white-footed mouse (<italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>), a peridomestic species abundant throughout North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Experimental challenge studies show that two closely related species, the deer mouse (<italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>) and California mouse (<italic>Peromyscus californicus</italic>), are capable of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection and direct transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Among challenged <italic>Peromyscine</italic> species, only the California mouse displays clinical disease. Two studies have performed limited surveys of wild <italic>Peromyscine</italic> mice for SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. One study reported 17% (1/6) and 29% (4/14) neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among white-footed mice and deer mice, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The other found 4% rRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity for one of two gene targets among <italic>Peromyscine</italic> mice (2/50)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The majority of other SARS-CoV-2 wild rodent studies focused on sewer rats, especially the Norway rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. A New York City study found that 16.5% of Norway rats were IgG or IgM positive and 5% RT-qPCR positivity among lung tissue samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in rodents remains highly limited despite these occasional detections. While rodents are the focus of our study, we also evaluated white-tailed deer, a species with extensive evidence of infection and exposure across the United States and Canada to provide a comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Experimental challenge studies further confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission capacity of deer, and note that the disease presents subclinically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We collected sera and swab samples from each species. We observed a 1% (6/540), 0% (0/69), and 7% (4/55) seroprevalence of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies among residential white-footed mice, forested white-footed mice, and all deer, respectively. Seropositive deer most effectively neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2, with reduced or absent cross-neutralization of subsequent viral variants. While we did not detect active SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed 1% (5/468), 0% (0/146), and 0% (0/31) pan-coronavirus PCR positivity among 2022 residential white-footed mice, forested white-footed mice, and all deer, respectively. Subsequent sequencing revealed infection with divergent betacoronaviruses. The limited SARS-CoV-2 spillback into white-footed mice suggests a low risk of novel SARS-CoV-2 reservoir establishment among and viral variant emergence from this species. However, the detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 divergent betacoronaviruses among white-footed mice highlights the broader, likely underestimated contribution of rodents to betacoronavirus diversity and circulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">We investigated whether there was evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spillback into white-footed mice in Connecticut by testing 2020-2022 sera and 2022 swabs (oral and anal) for neutralizing antibodies and active infection, respectively. To provide a comparison, we additionally tested 2021-2022 sera and 2022 swabs (oral, anal, and nasal) collected from white-tailed deer, a known susceptible animal, in similar settings. Finally, we tested swabs from both species for additional coronaviruses via a nested PCR to understand whether non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses were able to circulate within our studied animal populations. We sampled white-footed mice from residential (Guilford, CT) and forested (North Branford, CT) settings and deer from two forested settings surrounded by residential neighborhoods (Norwalk and Bridgeport, CT) as part of ongoing host-targeted tick management studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies detected in 1% of residential white-footed mice and 7% of white-tailed deer</title><p id="P9">To evaluate past SARS-CoV-2 exposure in white-footed mice, we adopted a two-step screening process for sera samples. First, to select 2020 and 2021 white-footed mice with probable past SARS-CoV-2 exposure, we developed an in-house pre-screening ELISA assay to detect binding antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We did not pre-screen the 2022 white-footed mice samples and 2021/2022 deer samples due to a relatively higher expected prevalence and smaller number of samples. Together with the 2020/2021 samples that passed the pre-screening, we tested sera for neutralizing capacity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 using the Genscript cPass surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The assay measures neutralizing capacity as the ability to block or reduce the interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein RBD and the human ACE2 receptor pre-coated on the plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Among individual residential white-footed mice, we found wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies among zero individuals from 2020 (0/156), one from 2021 (1/52, 2%), and five from 2022 (5/332, 2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of the six neutralizing antibody positive samples, one was positive in duplicate on a subsequent confirmatory test (high confidence in positive result), four were positive on the first sVNT test and had elevated OD values that did not surpass the positivity cutoff on the confirmatory test (moderate confidence in a positive result), and one was positive on the first test but was unable to be retested due to insufficient serum volume. Two of the positive white-footed mice were recaptured with discordant results between subsequent samples. One individual initially tested positive for neutralizing antibodies, followed 21 days later by a negative sample.</p><p id="P11">Another individual initially tested negative for neutralizing antibodies, followed 17 days later by a positive sample. While the sVNT assay is qualitative, all positive white-footed mouse sera samples had values near the assay positivity cutoff, potentially indicating the presence of neutralizing antibodies below the necessary concentration to pass the assay positivity cut-off. Among individual residential white-footed mice, the sex breakdown was as follows: 47% female, 51% male, and 2% unknown. We did not detect any neutralizing antibody positives among the forested white-footed mice (0/69 individual animals). Individual forested mice were 43% female, 54% male, and 3% unknown. The results indicate a limited presence of neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 sufficient to pass the assay positivity threshold, suggesting either absent or infrequent past exposure.</p><p id="P12">Among the deer sera samples, we identified six positives for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies across 2021 (3/41, 7%) and 2022 (3/31, 10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Two of the positives represented recaptured individuals that later tested positive again 16 and 37 days later, respectively, corresponding to four unique individual positives. Only one recaptured deer had discordant serological results possibly indicating waning antibody titers - an initial positive followed 309 days later by a negative sample. Seroprevalence was 12% (3/25) among individual Norwalk deer and 3% (1/30) among individual Bridgeport deer, corresponding to an overall seroprevalence of 7% (4/55). The sex breakdown was as follows: 56% female, 44% male, and 0% unknown at the Norwalk site and 50% female, 47% male, and 3% unknown at the Bridgeport site. The deer were 80% adult, 16% yearling, 4% age transitioning (fawn or yearling to adult in the case of recaptured individuals) at the Norwalk site and 77% adult, 7% yearling, 7% age transitioning, and 10% fawn at the Bridgeport site. Our findings indicate that white-tailed deer in residential/forested settings in Connecticut exhibit higher SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody seroprevalence than white-footed mice sampled from similar habitats, suggesting that the mice potentially are not susceptible or exposed enough in real-world settings for frequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.</p><p id="P13">Separately for each species, we conducted a Fisher’s exact test of independence to assess whether there was a significant association between the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody result (positive or negative) for each individual and sampling location. We counted each individual animal once. If a recaptured individual ever tested positive, we designated it positive. We failed to reject the null hypothesis for both the white-footed mice and the deer, indicating that there is not a significant association between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody result and sampling location. In addition, most of the neutralizing antibody positive residential white-footed mice were spatially dispersed, reducing the likelihood of any transmission between mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Finally, we also conducted a Fisher’s exact test of independence for both the mice and deer, separately, to test for a significant association between sex (deer and mice) or age (deer only) and neutralizing antibody result. We failed to reject the null hypothesis for all tests, indicating that there is not a significant association between sex or age and neutralizing antibody result.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Waning or absent cross-neutralization of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants observed among white-footed mice and white-tailed deer positive for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies</title><p id="P14">To understand the possible timing of past exposure and susceptibility to various SARS-CoV-2 lineages, we tested white-footed mice and white-tailed deer samples positive for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against several variants. Given limited sera volume, we only tested white-footed mice samples in singlicate against the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in humans at the time of sample collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To do so, we used the sVNT as previously described, exchanging the wild-type viral spike glycoprotein RBD for variant-specific RBDs. We tested the July 2021 seropositive white-footed mouse sample against Delta (B.1.617.2) and four samples collected in July/August 2022 against Omicron (BA.2).

Following the variant-specific sVNT testing, we further used deer sera to conduct an infectious virus neutralization test (VNT) to confirm our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) using wild-type, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.5) viruses.

To provide a comparison, we assesed seroprevalence among white-tailed deer, a species with high levels of reported exposure and infection, from similar Connecticut settings. We observed 7% neutralizing antibody seroprevalence across the two residential/forested settings. We subsequently tested wild-type neutralizing antibody positive mice sera from 2021 and 2022 against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.2), respectively, observing no cross-neutralization. We tested neutralizing antibody positive deer sera against infectious Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.5), noting waning or absent cross-neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We did not identify active SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR in swabs from either species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, to understand broader coronavirus circulation, we performed pan-coronavirus PCR testing of all 2022 mice and deer swabs and noted 1% (5/468), 0% (0/146), and 0% (0/31) pan-coronavirus PCR positivity among the residential white-footed mice, forested mice, and deer, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Sequencing yielded complete genomes from four of the five positive mice samples, revealing two divergent viruses (preliminarily named PCoV-1 and -2) that cluster with members of the <italic>Betacoronavirus 1</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Our findings indicate low spillback of SARS-CoV-2 from humans or an unknown animal into white-footed mice, with sustained transmission and secondary spillover unlikely. However, our detection of divergent betacoronaviruses in white-footed mice demonstrates that non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses are capable of circulation. Further research is required to understand the extent of infection with the newly identified betacoronaviruses.</p><p id="P21">Among the 1% of residential white-footed mice samples that initially tested positive for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), several displayed elevated values that did not cross the 30% positivity threshold upon retesting. First, neutralizing antibodies could be present but at insufficient levels to consistently surpass the assay cutoff. Second, there may have been false positives on the initial test. Third, individuals may not have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but rather have cross-reactive antibodies to an unknown coronavirus (possibly PCoV). Finally, because we confirmed the initial positive test with a subsequent confirmatory test, the difference could reflect slight variation in how the assay was conducted. One mouse positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was recaptured 21 days later and tested negative. In addition to the previously mentioned hypotheses for differential sVNT results, this finding could reflect seroconversion in the interim period between sample collections or diminished antibodies following the initial blood draw. We did not detect any variant cross-neutralization among tested sera from wild-type seropositive mice. Our finding may be due to exposure to an earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineage combined with low cross-neutralization between variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The white-footed mice population typically turns over annually due to high mortality as demonstrated by the few interannual recaptures in our study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, our SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody findings would maximally include past infections dating back approximately one year, if neutralizing antibodies persist for that duration. White-footed mice also experience the highest levels of both reproduction and mortality during summer and the opposite dynamics during winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, our summer sampling may have captured relatively younger mice with potentially lower overall seroprevalence. Of the neutralizing antibody positive mice, only two were captured within potentially overlapping territories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The low SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody seroprevalence combined with the spatial dispersion of positives does not suggest sustained transmission between mice following occasional spillbacks.</p><p id="P22">While the 7% wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody seroprevalence observed among white-tailed deer in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) was lower than the 14-40% neutralizing antibody positivity found in other locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, it was surprisingly high given the semi-restricted nature of the sampling sites. All six seropositive deer samples tested positive in duplicate. One seropositive deer tested negative upon recapture 309 days later, likely due to waning immunity. We tested wild-type seropositive deer against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), observing absent or decreasing neutralization across variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Four samples successfully neutralized Alpha and, among those, one neutralized Delta. We observed the highest percent inhibition of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, suggesting past infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Seropositive deer may have been exposed in 2020 prior to the spread of variants in deer populations or may have been more recently exposed to an earlier lineage potentially still in circulation in the animal population. Regardless, we cannot rule out subsequent variant infections if the deer mounted the strongest neutralizing antibody response to their initial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Deer #1 displayed especially high neutralizing activity against wild-type, Alpha, and Delta, possibly due to a more recent infection or a stronger immune response to infection due to individual immunological variation. Deer #5 may have been a false positive on the initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sVNT. We subsequently tested sVNT positive deer using an infectious VNT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Most deer neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and none neutralized Delta or Omicron (BA.5). Assay result variation could be due to differential ACE2 receptor presentation, the use of only the viral spike protein RBD in the sVNT versus infectious virus in the VNT, or that the sVNT measures inhibition of ACE2/viral spike protein RBD binding whereas the VNT measures cell viability. White-tailed deer live up to 10 years in the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and one study indicated that neutralizing antibodies persist for at least 13 months in the majority of naturally-infected deer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, as all of the seropositive deer in our study were adults excluding one yearling (#1), their infections could potentially date back to at least 13 months prior to sampling. Deer home ranges vary from 0.8-3.2 and 1.6-6.4 square kilometers for adult females/fawns and adult males, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Adult males substantially increase their movements during the late fall breeding season and yearling males can disperse up to 32 kilometers to establish new home ranges. The higher wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody seroprevalence observed within white-tailed deer compared to other species could in part result from such movement patterns, with infections in new herds seeded by adult or yearling males.</p><p id="P23">None of the mice or deer samples tested positive via RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially due to the relatively low-risk sampling periods timed to coincide with ongoing studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We primarily collected samples during summer 2022, which corresponded to a period of lower human transmission and lower-risk animal behavior. Both species are relatively solitary during summer but form larger groups during winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, mice experience greater human exposure during winter when they enter human homes seeking warmth. However, we also did not detect any infections among deer sampled during the relatively higher-risk colder months. In addition, the window of active infection detection may be relatively narrow. Experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies of <italic>Peromyscine</italic> mice found detectable viral RNA and infectious virus up to 8-21 and 3-14 days post infection, respectively, (ranges across studies) in oral swabs and at least eight days in rectal swabs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Challenged deer had detectable viral RNA up to 7-14, 10-22, and 7 to at least 14 days post infection in oral, nasal, and rectal swabs, respectively (ranges across studies) and infectious virus from all swab types up to five days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, challenge studies typically use higher viral doses than those naturally encountered, and thus real-world detection windows may be narrower. Finally, our sampling locations likely feature a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure from humans. We sampled residential mice from the backyards of single-family homes in a relatively affluent suburban area. In contrast, mice residing in or around high-density or poorer quality housing that enables easier access would likely experience greater exposure. Similarly, deer sampled from locations with greater access to human populations or other deer herds would likely have a higher exposure risk.</p><p id="P24">We detected 1% pan-coronavirus PCR positivity among residential white-footed mice (5/468) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and sequenced complete viral genomes from four samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We detected two divergent betacoronavirus clusters (PCoV1 and PCoV; 96.51-96.68% identical) that aligned spatiotemporally with sample collection. Given such divergence between geographic clusters combined with the limited range of <italic>Peromyscine</italic> mice, transmission of PCoV1 and PCoV2 is likely geographically isolated. Comparing PCoV1 and PCoV2, our phylogenetic trees for specific gene sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>) revealed nearly identical genomes for the ORF1ab gene (99.05-99.09% identical) with greater divergence in the spike gene (89.93-90.08% identical). PCoV1 and PCoV2 were comparatively more similar in the nucleocapsid gene (95.03-95.10% identical), but PCoV1 appeared to be ancestral to PCoV2, potentially a result of recombination. The PCoV1 and PCoV2 sequences clustered most closely with <italic>Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus</italic> (PHEV; 88.68-89.37% identical), a common virus found worldwide in pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, PCoV1 and PCoV2 remain relatively divergent from PHEV, suggesting that the viral emergence event in white-footed mice (or in another animal species) occurred in the distant past.

The sVNT assay has moderate to high sensitivity (91-94%) and high specificity (100%), but is less suitable for detecting low titers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Our ELISA and sVNT assays detected wild-type SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and animals infected with subsequent variants may test negative. We selected the sVNT assay for its species-agnostic aspect and appropriateness for biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) settings. However, the sVNT assay uses only the viral spike protein RBD and other more conserved parts of the Spike protein may also serve as neutralizing antibody targets. The viral spike protein RBD, while under strong evolutionary pressure, does not reflect all viral genome-wide mutations that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 variants, and there may be greater differences between variants in VNTs using infectious virus that could explain discrepancy in results between assays. In addition, the assay uses human ACE2 receptors. Cross-reactivity to other non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses could explain some of the elevated results that oscillated near the sVNT positivity threshold. The sVNT assay manufacturer reports cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not with common human coronaviruses62.

The ubiquity of the ACE2 receptor among vertebrates combined with the unprecedented exposure opportunity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has provided innumerable SARS-CoV-2 spillback opportunities into naive animal species. As the virus is introduced into a greater range of animal species, there is further potential for spillback between animal species as well. In addition, our detection of divergent betacoronavirus infections among white-footed mice expands the diversity of coronaviruses discovered among rodents. Further investigation is necessary to determine the geographic and species range of PCoV1 and PCoV2. Given the relatively small territories of white-footed mice, it is possible that such viruses may remain constrained to narrow geographic areas unless they circulate among additional animal species with greater movement ranges. Deeper surveillance of animal populations with the susceptibility and behavior potential to serve as potential primary or secondary betacoronavirus reservoirs is key to understanding the possible implications for long-term control of both established and newly detected betacoronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Ethics Statements</title><p id="P27">We followed animal capture and handling protocols approved by the Wildlife Division of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (#2124002, 2124002a, and 2023006) and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station’s (CAES) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (P32-20 and P35-21) in accordance with the American Society of Mammologist’s guidelines for the use of wild animals in research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

We included a positive feline coronavirus control (gift from Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine) and negative extraction and template controls (nuclease-free water). To test for coronavirus RNA, we followed a semi-nested approach that targets conserved regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene and used the accompanying primers as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We also used the primers designed for this approach. We combined 2 μl of each primer (IDT), 25 μl of Platinum II Hot-Start Green PCR Master Mix 2X (Invitrogen 14001014), 15 μl of water, and 4 μl of cDNA per reaction. For the first round, we used the following primers: Pan_CoV_F1 (GGTTGGGAYTAYCCHAARTGYGA), Pan_CoV_R1 (CCRTCATCAGAHARWATCAT), and PanCoV_R2 (CCRTCATCACTHARWATCAT) (IDT). We performed the following thermal cycling steps: 3 minutes at 94°C, 25 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 48°C, 1 minute at 72°C, and 5 minutes at 72°C. For the second round, we used 2 μl of the first-round PCR product, 2 μl of each primer (IDT), 25 μl of Platinum II Hot-Start Green PCR Master Mix (2X) (Invitrogen 14001014), and 15 μl of water per reaction. We used the following primers: Pan_CoV_R1 (CCRTCATCAGAHARWATCAT), PanCoV_R2 (CCRTCATCACTHARWATCAT), PanCoV_F2 (GAYTAYCCHAARTGTGAYAGA), and PanCoV_F3 (GAYTAYCCHAARTGTGAYMGH) (IDT). We conducted the following thermal cycling steps: 3 minutes at 94°C, 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 58°C, 1 minute at 72°C, and 5 minutes at 72°C. We visualized PCR products on a 2% agarose gel.

For samples where we confirmed PCR product specificity, we subsequently performed untargeted metagenomic sequencing as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Briefly, we re-extracted RNA from each anatomical site separately. Nucleic acid extraction was treated with DNase followed by first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was directly submitted to the tagmentation and adapter ligation reaction using the Nextera XT DNA Library preparation kit. Then, index adapters were added via PCR for sample identification prior to pooling. Sequencing was performed on a Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (paired-end 150bp) at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis, targeting 50-100 million reads per individual library.

The null hypothesis of the test states that the neutralizing antibody result and sampling location are independent; the alternative hypothesis that they are not independent. We selected this test due to fewer than five observations in one category for each species. We compared 1) the residential (Guilford, CT) versus forested (North Branford, CT) setting for the white-footed mice and 2) the two deer settings (Norwalk and Bridgeport, CT). Specifically, we compare counts of negative versus positive individuals in each location. In the case of multiple recaptures, we counted each individual once. If an individual ever tested positive, we designated it as such. In addition, we conducted a Fisher’s exact test to test for a significant association between sex or age, separately, and neutralizing antibody result (positive or negative). We also tested for an association between sex or age and the pan-coronavirus PCR result. Sex data were available for both the mice and deer. We categorized any sex metadata mismatches for recaptured individuals as “Unknown”. Age data were only available for deer (adult, yearling, or fawn). We categorized any recaptured deer that transitioned from one age group to adulthood during the study (i.e. fawn or yearling to adult) as “age transitioned”. We used a significance level of 0.05 for all tests.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Estimated Weekly Human Infections per 100,000 Population in Connecticut</title><p id="P45">We obtained weekly estimated human infections for Connecticut from <italic>Covidestim,</italic> a Bayesian nowcasting model that adjusts for diagnostic and reporting biases by anchoring to more reliable death data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

B) Monthly number of sera samples and wild-type neutralizing antibody results for white-footed mice in residential and forested settings and deer in two settings at the residential/forest interface. For the 2020-2021 white-footed mice sera, we only pre-screened the last sample in the case of multiple recaptures, and thus these are not included in the total counts. In addition, we only tested 2020-2021 white-footed mouse samples for neutralizing antibodies if they passed the pre-screening ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). For 2022 white-footed mice and 2021/2022 deer, we forwent the pre-screening ELISA and tested all samples for neutralizing antibodies via the sVNT. We tested the samples either in duplicate initially or in singlicate with a subsequent confirmatory duplicate in the case of an initial positive, unless there was insufficient volume.
