Geological records have delivered fossil time series crucial in formulating and testing hypotheses on evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of speciation spanning micro- to macroevolutionary scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dzik 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Strömberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aze et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Voje 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, fossils remain underused in evolutionary biology. Their main application is still node and tip calibration of molecular clocks, which commonly relies on single occurrences or on assumptions about the probability of finding a fossil rather than stratigraphic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Donoghue and Yang 2016</xref>). It is also subject to biases resulting from this small sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Springer 1995</xref>). The unique type of information contained in a fossil succession sampled over a long time interval is rarely exploited, likely due to the following barriers: <list list-type="order" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P6">The fossil record, being a part of the stratigraphic record, is patchy and distorted. At the time when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Darwin (1859)</xref> discussed this as a major limitation for the testing and development of the theory of evolution, little geological knowledge was present to elucidate the rules governing this incompleteness. Darwin’s concern widely persists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Patterson (1981)</xref>), albeit mostly implicitly: most phylogenetic analyses published today do not use fossils which would have been relevant or use only a small fraction of them. Stratigraphy and sedimentology, which can provide relevant data on fossils and the constraints on their occurrence and sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Kidwell and Holland 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Hunt 2010</xref>), are jargon-laden, highly atomized disciplines whose utility for evolutionary biology is not obvious to biologists. Biostratigraphy, which uses fossils to establish the relative age of rocks and has amassed datasets that would be of high utility for evolutionary studies, employs taxonomic concepts that are often impractical for or incompatible with evolutionary questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dzik 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Pearson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Haug and Haug 2017</xref>).

Historically, phylogenetic methods rarely incorporated geological information such as the relative order of appearance of taxa or specimens in the fossil record, which is the main subject of biostratigraphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Wills 1999</xref>). This has led to radical discrepancies between the outcomes of phylogenetic and stratigraphic, or stratophenetic, approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gingerich and Schoeninger 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Donoghue 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dzik 2005</xref>). This barrier is gradually overcome by methodological advances, such as the Fossilized Birth-Death Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Stadler et al. 2018</xref>), which allows incorporation of parameters specific to the fossil record, such as fossilization rate, sampling probability and age uncertainties of fossil occurrences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barido-Sottani et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Warnock, Heath, and Stadler 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Wright et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barido-Sottani et al. 2023</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P8">Recently, there is renewed appreciation for the importance of fossils in phylogenetic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Quental and Marshall 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Mitchell, Etienne, and Rabosky 2019</xref>; Mongiardino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Koch, Garwood, and Parry 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Guenser et al. 2021</xref>). These studies focus on the role of the morphological information provided by extinct taxa, but less on what a modern understanding of the physical structure of the geological record contributes to reconstructing evolutionary processes from fossil-bearing stratigraphic successions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Stratigraphic incompleteness and age-depth models</title><p id="P9">The incompleteness of the fossil record serves as an umbrella term for different effects that diminish the information content of the rock record, ranging from taphonomic effects and sampling biases to the role of gaps and erosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Kidwell and Holland 2002</xref>). Here we focus on the role of gaps (hiatuses) in the rock record. Such gaps can arise due to sedimentation (including fossils) and subsequent erosion or lack of creation of rocks in the first place, e.g. when an environment remains barren of sediment formation or supply for a long time. Both processes result in gaps in the rock record and, as a result, in the fossil record. This type of incompleteness is termed stratigraphic (in)completeness, defined as the time (not) recorded in a section, divided by the total duration of the section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dingus and Sadler 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Tipper 1987</xref>). Stratigraphic completeness provides an upper limit on the proportion of evolutionary history that can be recovered from a specified section, even with unlimited resources and perfect preservation of fossils. Stratigraphic completeness is difficult to quantify in geological sections, and estimates range between 3 and 30 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Wilkinson, Opdyke, and Algeo 1991</xref>), suggesting that more than 70 % of evolutionary history is either not recorded in the first place or destroyed at a later time.</p><p id="P10">Fossils older than a 1.5 million years cannot be dated directly, and their age has to be inferred from circumstantial evidence on the age of the strata in which they were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Wehmiller et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Kidwell and Flessa 1996</xref>). This inference is formalized by age-depth models (ADMs), which serve as coordinate transformations between the stratigraphic domain, where the fossils were found (length dimension L, SI unit meter), and the time domain (time dimension T, SI unit seconds - we use the derived units years, kyrs, or Myrs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hohmann 2021b</xref>). Age-depth models are always explicitly or implicitly used when fossil data is used for evolutionary inferences. Because they convey how positions of fossils relate to their age, ADMs are the basis for calculating evolutionary rates. As a result, revising ADMs commonly leads to a revision of evolutionary rates. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Malmgren, Berggren, and Lohmann (1983)</xref> observed increased rates of morphological evolution in lineages of fossil foraminifera over a geologically short time interval of 0.6 Myr and proposed that this “punctuated gradualism” may be a “common norm for evolution”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">MacLeod (1991)</xref> revised the age-depth model and showed that the interval with increased rates of evolution coincides with a stratigraphically condensed interval, i.e. more change is recorded in a thinner rock unit. Re-evaluating the evolutionary history based on the revised age-depth model removed the apparent punctuation and showed that morphological evolution in that case had been gradual rather than punctuated.</p><p id="P11">Age-depth models contain information on both variations in sediment accumulation rate and gaps in the stratigraphic and - as a result – the fossil record. For example, stratigraphic completeness corresponds to the fraction of the time domain to which an age-depth model assigns a stratigraphic position. In the absence of an age-depth model, we can only make statements on the ordering of evolutionary events, but not on the temporal rates involved.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Forward models of stratigraphic architectures</title><p id="P12">Forward computer simulations of sedimentary strata provide a useful tool to study the effects of incompleteness and heterogeneous stratigraphic architectures. They have demonstrated that locations and frequency of gaps in the stratigraphic record are not random, but a predictable result of external controls, such as fluctuations in eustatic sea level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Warrlich 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Hutton and Syvitski 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Masiero et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Combined with biological models, forward models provide a powerful tool to test hypotheses on the effects of stratigraphic architectures on our interpretations of evolutionary history. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hannisdal (2006)</xref> combined simulations of a siliciclastic basin with models of taphonomy and phenotypic evolution. The results showed that when sample sizes are small, morphological evolution will appear as stasis regardless of the underlying mode. This might explain why stasis is the most common evolutionary pattern recovered from the fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Hunt, Hopkins, and Lidgard 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Stratigraphic incompleteness and variations in sediment accumulation rates introduce multiple methodological challenges. Constructing complex ADMs requires sedimentological and stratigraphic expert knowledge, and they will potentially be associated with large uncertainties. Even in the “perfect knowledge” scenario where the age-depth model is fully known, evolutionary history in the time domain will inevitably be sampled irregularly: If two samples are separated by a hiatus, their age difference must be at least the duration of the hiatus, which might be millions of years. On the other hand, if sediment accumulation is rapid and no hiatuses are present, the age difference between samples might be only a few days.</p><p id="P15">Most studies “translate” fossil successions into time series using age-depth models based on simplified assumptions on the regularity of the stratigraphic record. These ADMs ignore stratigraphic incompleteness and often assume uninterrupted constant sediment accumulation (UCSA). This assumption implies that stratigraphic completeness is 100 %, rock thickness is proportional to time passed, and linear interpolation between tie points of known age can be used to infer fossil ages from their positions. Such ADMs are usually used implicitly, without discussing their limitations. While the assumption of UCSA is sedimentologically and stratigraphically unrealistic, it brings strong methodological simplifications. For example, if distance between samples collected in a rock section is kept constant, UCSA implies that the underlying evolutionary history in the time domain is sampled at a constant frequency, the generated fossil time series are equidistant in time and can therefore be analyzed by standard methods of time series analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Hunt 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Beran 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="P16">We examine how commonly made simplified assumptions on stratigraphic architectures influence how the mode of evolution is recovered from fossil time series.

The implication of this hypothesis is that different depositional environments have different chances of preserving the mode of evolution because of systematic differences in their completeness.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P20">We simulate trait evolution in the time domain, pass it through a stratigraphic filter produced by the CarboCAT Lite model of carbonate platform formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burgess 2023</xref>), and compare how well the mode of evolution can be recovered from the fossil time series sampled in the stratigraphic domain and the time series reflecting the “true” evolutionary history in the time domain.

CarboCAT Lite is implemented in MATLAB and simulates carbonate production by carbonate factories characterized by different production curves, which are functions of water depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bosscher and Schlager 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Masiero et al. 2020</xref>). It includes sediment transport that is a function of platform topography, i.e., sediment is transported downslope, but not a function of external parameters such as waves or currents. Simulations were run using time steps of 1 kyr (1000 years) and a grid of 1 km width (strike) and 15 km length (dip), subdivided into quadratic grid cells of 100 m length. We used three carbonate factories with production curves following the parametrization of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bosscher and Schlager (1992)</xref> (<italic>Supplementary Figure 1</italic>). Factory 1 is phototrophic with a maximum carbonate production rate of 500 m × Myr<sup>-1</sup>, which it maintains up to 30 m of water depth. Factories 2 and 3 have maximum production rates of 160 and 150 m × Myr<sup>-1</sup> respectively and maintain maximum productivity until 40 m water depth, but differ in how fast productivity decreases with depth (<italic>Supplementary Figure 1</italic>). We assumed constant subsidence of 70 m per Myr across the grid. This is approximately seven times higher than estimated subsidence rates in the last 125 kyr in the Bahamas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">McNeill 2005</xref>), allowing for higher completeness than would be generated on a typical passive continental margin. As initial topography, a slope with a gradient of 5.33 m × km<sup>-1</sup> was used, resulting in a total initial difference in water depth of 80 m between the shore and the offshore end of the simulated grid. We followed the default setting of CarboCAT Lite, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess (2013)</xref> with three lithofacies (sediment types) corresponding to the three carbonate factories, plus three secondary lithofacies representing sediment transported downslope after the deposition of the primary lithofacies (dark colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As initial facies distribution, the default setting of CarboCAT Lite was used, which assigns each grid cell one of the three carbonate factories or no factory according to a uniform distribution.</p><p id="P22">Two scenarios were simulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In scenario A, the simulation was run for 2 Myr with changes in eustatic sea level given by a combination of sinusoids expressed as third-order sea level changes with a period of 1 Myr and an amplitude of 20 m and fourth-order changes with a period of 0.112 Myr and an amplitude of 2 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>). Scenario B was simulated for the period from 2.58 Mya (beginning of the Pleistocene) until the present using the global eustatic sea level curve estimated from global <italic>δ</italic><sup>18</sup>O<sub>benthic</sub> records by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Miller et al. (2020)</xref>. This curve has a temporal resolution of approximately 2 kyr over the Pleistocene (mean: 2.13 kyr, median: 2.07 kyr), and was linearly interpolated to match the time increments of the simulation and normalized to have a mean sea level of 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 E</xref>).</p><p id="P23">For each scenario, CarboCAT Lite produces a grid containing the facies, including no deposition, at each time step and position on the grid. The outputs were extracted from MATLAB and all further analysis was carried out in the R Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">R Core Team 2023</xref>). For both scenarios, age-depth models at every grid node were extracted from the simulation outputs. Age-depth models taken from the same distance from shore display only little variation as position along the shore (strike) is varied, indicating that lateral position in the grid is negligible. Accordingly, we focused on age-depth models taken from the middle transect along the dip. In each scenario, synthetic sections and the corresponding age-depth models at five locations were selected (<italic>Supplementary Figure 2</italic>). The selected locations are 2 km, 6 km, 8 km, 10 km, and 12 km from the shoreline. These distances corresponded to lagoonal environments, backreef, forereef, proximal slope, and distal slope. The simulated carbonate platforms accreted vertically with only minor shift of environments along the onshore-offshore axis, therefore each location can be interpreted as representing its respective environment across the entire simulation (platform lifetime). Only simulation outputs between the shore and 13 km offshore are shown in the figures, as the remainder (13-15 km) consisted entirely of redeposited carbonates and was not used further.</p><p id="P24">The simulated carbonate platforms were characterized using the following parameters calculated at any given location in the platform: <list list-type="order" id="L4"><list-item><p id="P25">Stratigraphic completeness, calculated as the proportion of time steps with sediment accumulation relative to the total number of time steps in the simulation (function <monospace>get_completeness</monospace> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hohmann et al.

These simulations serve as “true” evolutionary history against which we compare fossil time series derived under simplified assumptions on age-depth models.</p><p id="P28">In unbiased random walk models, the change in traits over a fixed time step is independent of the previous trait values, and drawn from a distribution with mean zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bookstein 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Sheets and Mitchell 2001</xref>). In biased random walk models, the mean can deviate from zero. The trait evolution along a lineage is then generated by summing up the incremental changes in traits. Commonly used models of random walks are based on equidistant time steps, meaning the time passed between two observations of the random walk is identical for all observations. We could not use these models, because depending on where in the stratigraphic column samples are collected, the time elapsed between two successive sampling positions can vary by more than three orders of magnitude. It will be less than a thousand years when sediment accumulation rate is high, and more than half a million years when they are separated by a hiatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). If samples have identical distances in the stratigraphic column, the underlying evolutionary history will be sampled at irregular times. We use continuous-time extensions of random walk and stasis models so we can sample lineages at arbitrary time points without relying on interpolation between discrete time steps. Interpolation would potentially introduce dependencies between successive samples, contradicting the assumption of the random walk model that change in traits is independent and identically distributed. The continuous-time expansion provides exact trait values at the sampled times, and reduces to the standard discrete time step models when applied to equidistant time steps. In addition, discrete-time models incorporate time elapsed between observations into model parameters (e.g., the variance parameter of the random walk model), making their scaling behavior non-obvious when time scales are varied. Using continuous-time implementations makes it possible to compare observations across time scales and vary the granularity of observation while keeping the underlying model of evolution fixed. We use this property to examine how increased sampling of the same time interval influences model selection performance.</p><p id="P29">We extracted age-depth models from CarboCAT Lite outputs.

The distribution of traits among the specimens in a sample is normally distributed with variance of 0.1 and a mean according to the simulated trait values.

The variance of 0.1 was chosen to ensure that variability within a sample is small compared to the expected mean evolutionary change that accumulates over the course of the simulations, thus reducing the chance to mistake variability within populations for evolutionary trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hannisdal 2006</xref>).

The tests use corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) to determine which of the following models fits best to the stratophenetic series: the stasis model, an unbiased random walk (URW), and a biased random walk referred to as general random walk (GRW). The models identified by the <monospace>compareModels</monospace> function correspond to the simulated processes as follows: URW to the Brownian motion, GRW to the Brownian drift, and stasis to stasis. The tests take the between-samples variance in trait values and the number of specimens found at a sampling position into account. At each location in the carbonate platform, 100 stratophenetic series per evolutionary scenario (stasis, Brownian motion, Brownian drift) were simulated and tested for their fit to the stasis, URG, and GRW model. Because raw AICc values carry no meaning, we use the derived AICc weights instead. The (uncorrected) AIC weight of a model can be interpreted as the probability that it is the best approximating model, given the data and the set of candidate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Wagenmakers and Farrell 2004</xref>). Thus, higher AIC weights (and, as a result, AICc weights) reflect better support for the model.</p><p id="P39">As a baseline for the test performance of the paleoTS package, the tests were also performed in the time domain, i.e. without any losses or distortions introduced by the stratigraphic record.

Lineages evolving according to the specified modes of evolution were sampled at these time points, and the test for the modes of evolution was performed on the resulting time series. Our hypothesis for this baseline is that in the absence of stratigraphic effects, increased sampling effort (i.e., a higher number of subdivisions of the time interval of observation, resulting in longer time series) increases support for the correct mode of evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S15"><title>Stratigraphic architectures</title><sec id="S16"><title>Carbonate platform A</title><p id="P40">Platform A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 A-C</xref>) has a steep topography with high build-up up to 8 km into the basin and thin, condensed off-platform deposits between 8 and 13 km, consisting mostly of transported sediment. The majority of transported sediment is derived from the phototrophic factory, with a sharp drop in production rate at around 30 m water depth (<italic>Supplementary Figure 1</italic>). The thinnest interval at ca. 13 km into the basin contains also sediment transported from the two other factories.</p><p id="P41">The platform consists of two “depositional sequences” with different topographies. These “sequences” correspond to two sea-level highs, with the first one resulting in low topography and rapid progradation that led to basinward, rather than upward, growth of the platform. The second “sequence” is aggradational, with distinct “parasequences” expressed in facies, corresponding to the 125 kyr period in the sea-level curve used as simulation input. This “sequence” is responsible for the steep topography of the platform. The top of the platform is abruptly truncated as a result of the long-term cycle sea-level fall and covered with a thin deposit of the ensuing initial transgression.</p><p id="P42">The two long-term cycle sea-level falls result in two major gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 A</xref>). The gap between the first and the second “depositional sequence” does not extend uniformly across the entire platform. During the time of the gap formation, the euphotic factory and sediment derived from transport of this factory’s products accumulated at the platform edge, prograding between 5 and 12 km basinward. The last part of this interval offlaps the platform, forming an architecture resembling the Falling Stage Systems Tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Plint and Nummedal 2000</xref>). In contrast, the second major gap resulted in almost no deposition, reflecting almost no sediment transport in the second stage of platform formation. As a result, this platform is characterized by: two long gaps in deposition and several shorter gaps with limited spatial extent; large differences in thickness along the onshore-offshore gradient and a substantial contribution of sediment transport and offshore deposits formed entirely from sediment exported from the platform in the first half of the platform formation.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Carbonate platform B</title><p id="P43">For scenario B, we used the Pleistocene-Holocene global mean sea-level estimate of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Miller et al. (2020)</xref>. In the original dataset, the sea level varied between -121 m to 31.9 m and was here normalized to a mean of 0 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 E</xref>). The simulated time interval corresponds to gradually lowering global sea level dominated by 41-ka tilt forcing leading to amplitudes reaching 50 m. A gradual increase in sea-level amplitude throughout this interval is attributed to the onset of the glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere. In the middle Pleistocene, ca. 800 ka, a shift to “quasi-100-ka” periodicity is associated with higher sea level amplitudes reaching 140 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Miller et al. 2020</xref>). This Milankovitch-paced sea-level changes resulted in a simulated carbonate platform with short gap durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 B</xref>). Where present, the gaps are widespread across the platform, i.e. sea-level drops resulted in gaps uniformly distributed across all environments. The continuity of gaps is even more pronounced in the youngest part of the platform corresponding to the last 800 kyr, reflecting the higher sea-level amplitude. Most gaps are concentrated in the central part of the platform, whereas the most shore- and basinward parts of the platform may be filled with sediment at the time when no other strata is formed in the grid, leading to the highest completeness of these two opposite ends. The dominant facies is sediment transported from the phototrophic factory (dark red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which is present across the entire platform, rather than exported off the platform as in scenario A. Hence, this platform is dominated by short-distance sediment transport. In the older part of the platform, the offshore part (at a distance of 11-13 km from the shore) has a higher stratigraphic completeness (more time represented by sediment) than the onshore end, but in the younger part of the platform, the difference disappears. The lack of large sea-level falls results in a lack of major facies shifts, low topography and a gradual, nearly aggradational buildup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Completeness and distribution of hiatuses</title><p id="P44">Changes in completeness along the onshore-offshore gradient were very similar for both scenarios: completeness increased monotonously from the shore and had a double peak around 9 and 11 km offshore, where it reached values of 75 and 95 percent (onshore and offshore peak) in scenario A and around 80 percent (both peaks) in scenario B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The onshore peak in completeness coincided with the forereef environment, where organisms continuously grow, while the second peak coincided with the slope onset, where transported sediment is continuously provided by the forereef.

Maximum hiatus duration was constant over the entire platform, dropped dramatically on the slope, and then increased again off-platform.

The exception to this is the backreef in scenario A (approx. 4–6 km from shore), where the 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile of hiatus durations reaches values of 0.25 to 0.4 Myrs. Averaged over the platform, maximum hiatus duration is one to two orders of magnitude larger than median hiatus duration (135 times longer in scenario A and 13 times longer in scenario B). This shows that the distribution of hiatus durations on the platform is heavy-tailed: most hiatuses are short, but a few exceptionally long hiatuses that are associated with long-term drops in sea level are present. Quantitatively, hiatus durations in scenario A are longer (average median hiatus duration across the platform: 26 kyr in scenario A, 10 kyr in scenario B).

In contrast, hiatuses introduce jumps into the lineages evolving according to a Brownian drift, which are not present in the time domain. For the Brownian motion, the presence of jumps depends on whether the trait series accumulates sufficient trait differences during the hiatus, making the presence or absence of jumps over gaps effectively random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6, B &amp; F</xref>, red and green vs. blue lineage).

While stasis and Brownian drift can be recovered from stratophenetic series, support for Brownian motion (undirected random walk) decreases with sampling effort. Visually, not stratigraphic completeness, but rather maximum hiatus duration and directionality of evolution determine how much series of trait values derived from the stratigraphic record differ from the true evolutionary history.</p><sec id="S28"><title>Identifying the mode of evolution from stratophenetic series</title><p id="P59">We tested the hypothesis that the mode of evolution identified in a stratophenetic series obtained under the assumption of uninterrupted constant sediment accumulation (UCSA) is the same as the mode of the original time series in the time domain (the “true” evolutionary history). AICc weights of stratophenetic series derived under this assumption are almost identical to the AICc weights of the true evolutionary history. Stasis and directional evolution can correctly be identified from stratophenetic series under the assumption of UCSA, and AICc weights are very high (median &gt; 0.9 for stasis, &gt;0.67 for Brownian motion). Stasis has lower support in parts of the platform where time series are short. We attribute this to the very optimistic sampling regime we have chosen. Empirical stratophenetic series (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Clyde and Gingerich (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Dzik (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Hunt and Roy (2006)</xref>) are commonly much shorter than the series simulated here. For example, stratophenetic series compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Hunt, Hopkins, and Lidgard (2015)</xref> had a median of 14 sampling positions and the longest stratophenetic series consisted of 114 sampling positions. In addition, we assumed a very low intrapopulation variance, and did not include any taphonomic or ecological effects that could reduce the number of specimens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hannisdal (2006)</xref> argued that these effects combined can lead to “analytical stasis”, where the mode of evolution cannot be distinguished from stasis due to low statistical power, potentially explaining the abundance of morphological stasis observed in the fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Hunt, Hopkins, and Lidgard 2015</xref>). Due to our sampling strategy, we could not confirm this effect, but found an opposite effect in the absence of stratigraphic biases: under simulations of stasis, tests favor the recognition of unbiased random walks for very short time series (less than 10 sampling points) and provide mixed support for both stasis and unbiased random walks for short time series (15 sampling points) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10A</xref>).</p><p id="P60">For simulations of Brownian motion, tests find intermediate to good support for the correct mode of evolution (URW, unbiased random walk), which decreases with time series length even in absence of stratigraphic biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lower rows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). This effect is not due to our implementation of trait evolution, as it persists when the internal simulation procedures provided by the paleoTS package are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hohmann and Hopkins 2024</xref>). Based on the probabilistic interpretation of the AICc weights, this implies that the more samples are collected, the lower the probability that the data-generating model is the best model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Wagenmakers and Farrell 2004</xref>). There are multiple potential explanations for this apparent statistical paradox. One is that sampling a fixed time interval more frequently leads to diminishing returns on the information gain per sample. Intuitively, a few samples should be sufficient to separate directional evolution from stasis. However, this does not explain why the effect only appears under simulations of Brownian motion, and AICc weights for the correct mode of evolution decrease instead of increasing. Another potential explanation is that AIC is not consistent in the sense that if sample size grows, the probability that AIC identifies the true model does not approach one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bozdogan 1987</xref>). It is unclear if the considered time series are long enough to display such asymptotic effects, and how they translate from AIC to AICc weights. The decrease in AICc weight might be caused by the fact that the models tested for are nested in the sense that URW is a special case of GRW, making it impossible to strictly separate between them. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes are used to model trait evolution towards an optimum. They have multiple modes of evolution nested within them: with no selection, they reduce to an unbiased random walk; when they start in the phenotypic optimum, they represent (autocorrelated) stasis; and when the optimum is far away they represent directional evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cooper et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Grabowski et al. 2023</xref>). If OU is included in the set of tested modes of evolution, support for them increases with sampling effort, independent of the mode of evolution simulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hohmann and Hopkins 2024</xref>). This is an indicator that the decrease in AICc weights for URW under simulations of Brownian motion is driven by nestedness of models. This highlights that the separation into distinct modes of evolution is conceptually useful, but mathematically imprecise and needs to be approached with caution.</p><p id="P61">Lastly, individual sample paths of a Brownian walk can look directional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 E</xref>) as a result of random fluctuations. All models of unbiased random walks have an expected trait value of 0. However, the probability of deviating from 0 increases with time, potentially creating lineages with large deviations from the expected trait value. For the unbiased random walk model, the evidence ratio (ratio of AICc weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Portet 2020</xref>)) of individual simulations can be close to 1, making unbiased and biased random walks equally fitting models. In our simulation study, we have access to the distribution of AICc weights under repeated sampling of the underlying mode of evolution. <italic>Supplementary Figure 20</italic> illustrates the distribution of the evidence ratio (the ratio of AICc value for the correct mode, URW, to the AICc value for GRW) for one of the cases where the distributions of AICc weights overlap substantially, i.e. for the set of simulated Brownian motion in scenario A at a distance of 6 km from the shore. In 18% of runs, the incorrect (GRW) mode has higher support than the correct one, and the AICc for the wrong mode can be as high as 0.959. Overlaps between the AICc distributions of alternative models are also observed for very short time series, e.g. between stasis and URW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10 A</xref>), pointing to situations where incorrect decisions on single trait sequences are more likely.</p><p id="P62">The simulation approach opens the possibility to estimate how common a wrong decision would be made as a result of the variable properties of any single run. However, for empirical studies, only one lineage representing one sample path or realization of the underlying evolutionary process is known. Based on the resulting point estimate of the AICc weight, unbiased and biased random walk might not be distinguishable. In the entire study, Brownian motion was the mode most susceptible to be mis-identified as Brownian drift, which coincides with the (not always correct) intuition that strongly directional series must be adaptative. Our results provide a guideline on when it is the case and an empirical estimation of the frequency of false decisions when single trajectories are investigated.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Effects of stratigraphic incompleteness</title><p id="P63">The second hypothesis we examined was that the lower the stratigraphic completeness, the lower the chance to identify the correct mode of evolution from stratophenetic series that are constructed based on the assumption of uninterrupted constant sediment accumulation (UCSA). Spatial variability in AICc weights in both carbonate platforms can be explained by differences in time series length resulting from differences in total accumulated thickness (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>) rather than differences in stratigraphic architectures or completeness. One possible explanation for the high similarity of test results in the time and stratigraphic domain is that they are based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), which measures relative fit of models to data. In the time domain, we simulate lineages according to the same model we test for. For Brownian walk and drift, the modes of evolution tested for are not adequate to describe the trait evolution in the stratigraphic domain as they do not incorporate any jumps. For example, the stratigraphic expression of the Brownian drift models resembles a Lévy process with rare, but large, jumps, rather than a Brownian drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Landis, Schraiber, and Liang 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Landis and Schraiber 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The issues arising from using AICc when models are not adequate are well known, and the adequacy of models of phyletic evolution has been discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Voje, Starrfelt and Liow (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Voje (2018)</xref>. Despite the lack of model adequacy in the stratigraphic domain when UCSA is assumed, paleoTS test results are not affected by the non-linear transformation of time series by age-depth models.</p><p id="P64">In addition to the tests, we visually compared stratophenetic series derived under this assumption with time series of the true evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>Supplementary Figures 4—19</italic>). Trait evolution reconstructed using simplified age-depth models varies spatially throughout the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Even if gaps are identified and their duration is known, evolutionary history coinciding with sea level drops is not preserved on the platform top. These time intervals can be recovered from the distal slope where sediment is continuously accreted during lowstand shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Grammer and Ginsburg 1992</xref>). This highlights the importance of combining information from across the entire sedimentary basin in reconstructing past changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Holland and Patzkowsky 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Zimmt et al. 2021</xref>), although the information gained from this approach might vary between carbonate platforms and siliciclastic systems.</p><p id="P65">We found that stratigraphic incompleteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dingus and Sadler 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Tipper 1987</xref>) is an imperfect predictor of the biasing effects of stratigraphic architectures on phenotypic evolution. For similar values of stratigraphic completeness, the stratigraphic expression of the same lineage can strongly differ. For example, stratophenetic series of Brownian drift reflect the underlying true evolutionary history, or display apparent jumps in phenotype for very close values of completeness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, different modes of evolution are biased to a different degree when compared within the same section (and thus identical stratigraphic effects and values of incompleteness). For example, in the same section, Brownian drift displays jumps in phenotype over gaps that will be misinterpreted as elevated rates of evolution, whereas stasis remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Multiple definitions of incompleteness have been applied in stratigraphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anders, Krueger, and Sadler 1987</xref>), some of which incorporate spatial variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Straub and Foreman 2018</xref>). The definition of stratigraphic completeness from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Tipper (1987)</xref> we used here reflects the intuition that gaps in the geological record are the dominant factor that diminishes the quality of the fossil record. While other definitions of incompleteness might be more suitable to quantifying stratigraphic effects, our results show that the nature of the underlying evolutionary process cannot be neglected when assessing the fidelity of the fossil record.</p><p id="P66">The change of phenotype over a gap is determined by gap duration and the change in phenotype accumulated over this time interval. Stasis remains unaffected by gaps as it accumulates no change in phenotype. On the other hand, for Brownian drift, change in phenotype is proportional to gap duration. Under the simplified assumptions on ADMs we used, the change in traits over gaps will be taken at face value, giving trait evolution a distinct punctuated look (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Rita et al. 2019</xref>). In paleontological, and especially biostratigraphic, practice, a sudden change in a trait is typically the basis for recognizing a new species and, thus, a speciation event. It would not meet the original definition of punctuated equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gould and Eldredge 1972</xref>), which requires the speciation to take place allopatrically.</p><p id="P67">However, a precise modern formulation of the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis is debated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Pennell, Harmon, and Uyeda (2014)</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Lieberman and Eldredge (2014)</xref>), and identifying allopatry and the type of speciation relies on geological and morphological information. This creates the risk of circular reasoning in identifying whether a given sudden change should be considered a case of punctuated change (e.g. sympatric speciation) or punctuated equilibrium. Models of trait evolution that can incorporate punctuations are Lévy processes, a class of stochastic process that combines gradual change with discrete jumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Landis, Schraiber, and Liang 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Landis and Schraiber 2017</xref>). In Lévy processes, the jump components are random and have a Poisson structure. This provides a way to separate between artefactual jumps introduced by simplistic ADMs and true elevated rates of evolution: Artefactual jumps will coincide with gaps in the record or interval of reduced sediment accumulation rates, and thus connect to external drivers of stratigraphic architectures such as drops in sea level, rather than being random. Our study provides the stratigraphic null hypothesis that punctuated change in morphology should be more prevalent at times with low frequency sea-level changes. Combined, our results suggest that due to gaps in the stratigraphic record, stratophenetic series favor the recognition of both stasis and complex, punctuated models of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Hunt, Hopkins, and Lidgard 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P68"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hoffman (1989)</xref> pointed out that most paleontological evidence for punctuated equilibrium comes from shallow water habitats (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Kelley 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Williamson 1981</xref>)), which he argues are more incomplete and thus favor the recognition of punctuations. This reflects the common idea that different environments have different incompleteness and thus different abilities to preserve evolution, as we have phrased in our hypothesis two. In contrast to this preconception, we found that many environments in a carbonate platform have very similar incompleteness and hiatus distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Due to the flat geometry of the platform, the separation is between platform top and slope, not the distinct environments within the platform such as forereef and lagoonal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Liu and Liu 2021</xref>). In addition, incompleteness alone is not sufficient to produce artefactual jumps in phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P69">Gaps in the stratigraphic record need to be sufficiently long compared to the rate of the evolutionary process, so that morphologies can change enough to display sufficient offset over the gap. This indicates that, rather than incompleteness, maximum hiatus duration is driving the discrepancy between stratophenetic series and the true evolutionary history.</p><p id="P70">Naturally, maximum hiatus duration is limited by stratigraphic completeness and the time covered by the section. But even under high incompleteness, as long as hiatus frequency is high and durations are short, the fossil record can still give a good insight into evolutionary history, and be adequate to test a wide range of evolutionary hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Paul 1992</xref>).</p><p id="P71">In our stratigraphic models, hiatus frequency and duration are determined by the frequency of sea-level fluctuations. Preservation of evolutionary history under high-frequency sea level changes (scenario B) is good, while the large-scale fluctuations in scenario A result in prolonged gaps with a large impact on the recovery of the mode of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This demonstrates that understanding controls on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the stratigraphic record is decisive in correctly interpreting the evolutionary history of a lineage in the realistic case of spatially constrained sampling.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Limitations of the simulated carbonate platforms</title><p id="P72">Carbonate platforms used for this research only approximate stratigraphic architectures that would form in nature. First, CarboCAT Lite does not include erosion other than sediment transport, which removes sediment locally immediately after its formation, but preserves the total volume of generated sediment in the platform. In real carbonate platforms, part of the carbonate sediment is dissolved and returned to the water column (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Langdon, and Anthony (2013)</xref>, exported into the ocean, and a part is chemically and mechanically eroded when it becomes emerged. The addition of erosion to the model would have the effect of enlarging the present gaps in the record and merging the shorter ones, resulting in fewer, longer gaps and lower stratigraphic completeness. Second, carbonate production curves used to inform the models reflect activities of carbonate factories under stable conditions. In reality, a regression would often lead to removal of carbonate producing organisms from the emerged area. The recolonization of this area by carbonate producers would lead to a lag in the factory resuming its activity. Carbonate production and preservation is also sensitive to diurnal, seasonal and long-term astronomical cycles, e.g. through temperature control over the proportion of precipitated aragonite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Balthasar and Cusack 2015</xref>) and the length of the vegetative season of calcifiers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Marshall and Clode 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Mancuso et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P73">Our simulations did not include pelagic carbonate production, spatially heterogeneous subsidence or gravitational sediment transport, which may be crucial in the formation of some empirical carbonate platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Masiero et al. 2020</xref>). We relied here on high benthic <italic>in situ</italic> production rates as the dominant driver of sediment accumulation in tropical, attached carbonate platforms. Thus, the stratigraphic architectures presented here are conceptual endpoints with exaggerated completeness.</p><p id="P74">The construction of our study follows the assumption of uninterrupted constant sediment accumulation (UCSA), which implies that the ages of fossils found at a given stratigraphic position correspond to the age of the stratum. This assumption is made in many simulation studies of trait evolution in the fossil record (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hannisdal 2006</xref>)) and inherent to most methods that estimate age-depth models (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Parnell et al. 2008</xref>)). With this respect, our computer experiment is representative for such studies. However, time averaging and sedimentary condensation mean that typically more time is represented by fossils than by sedimentary strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Kowalewski and Bambach 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Tomašových et al. 2022</xref>). On the other hand, fossils of different ages will be found at the same stratigraphic height, limiting the temporal resolution of evolutionary steps in the population’s mean. Because of high <italic>in situ</italic> sediment production, timescales of time averaging identified in modern tropical carbonate environments are typically much shorter than rates of trait evolution, regardless of the way they are measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Hunt 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Voje 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Kowalewski et al. 2017</xref>; Philip D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gingerich 2019</xref>). This means that trait evolution reconstructed in tropical carbonate platforms may not be representative for other environments with lower rates of sediment accumulation or higher proportion of transported material.</p><p id="P75">For simplicity, we assumed that simulated taxa are equally represented and preserved across all sampled environments. Specifying their environmental niche or differential preservation would further reduce the number of data points in stratophenetic series. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Holland (2000)</xref> showed that the record of a stenotopic species would be even more incomplete than the simulations presented here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S31" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P76">We tested the hypothesis that the commonly employed approach to identifying the mode of evolution in fossil succession, i.e. linear projection of stratigraphic positions of occurrences into the time domain without considering changes in sedimentation rate and gaps in the record, recovers the correct mode of evolution. We found that, although prolonged gaps distorted trait evolution record visually, tests for the mode of evolution were only weakly affected by gaps and irregular age-depth models. Our findings differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hannisdal (2006)</xref>, who found (using a different approach but asking the same question) that incomplete sampling in the stratigraphic record may result in all other modes of evolution being identified as stasis.</p><p id="P77">Our findings did not vary substantially between two stratigraphic architectures with varying gap distributions and degrees of stratigraphic completeness. The lack of influence of stratigraphic effects is counterintuitive, as deeper environments are often assumed to be more complete and therefore more suitable for sampling fossil series for evolutionary studies. In the case of undirected random walks, increasing the number of observations (i.e. sampling intensity, length of the fossil series) did not improve the identification of the mode of evolution, but rather worsened it.</p><p id="P78">Our study was motivated by improving the recovery of evolutionary information from highly resolved fossil successions, particularly at microevolutionary scales. We are convinced that such successions can aliment models and understanding that is not accessible to exclusively neontological methodologies, as illustrated by e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Hopkins and Lidgard (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Voje (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Petryshen et al.

Forward modeling allows rigorous testing of concerns that the fossil record is too distorted, or too incomplete, to answer (micro)evolutionary questions. They also offer the possibility to evaluate the robustness of identifications of the mode of evolution and estimates of its parameters under different simulated age-depth models.
