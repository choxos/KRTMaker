People with diabetes have higher circulating levels of inflammatory markers including macrophage migration inhibitor (MIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. MIF is a cytokine expressed broadly in the outer lining of tissues such as endothelial, epithelial, endocrine and immune cells including macrophages and can be released in response to cellular stress from readily releasable pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].Plasma MIF levels are elevated in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and further increased in Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. MIF is also highly expressed in diabetes complications such as myocardial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], coronary artery disease and diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], suggesting a graded increase in circulating MIF with disease severity. The plasma levels of MIF also correlate with the severity of illness in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The cytokine increases production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and may also play a role in thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In contrast, MIF deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] or antagonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] has been shown to prevent chronic inflammation, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice, suggesting MIF likely plays a detrimental role in diabetes.</p><p id="P8">Recent studies have demonstrated that hypoglycemia in addition to hyperglycemia contributes to inflammation via increasing circulating markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Correlating to MIF-induced changes in cytokines, hypoglycemia also increases the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF<italic>α</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Importantly, moderate and severe hypoglycemia increase risk for a cardiovascular event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and is also associated with neurological damage and increased risk for mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. As a major source of cytokines including MIF, macrophages play an important role in chronic inflammation in diabetes. This response is an energy-intense process, with macrophage metabolism shifting from mainly oxidative metabolism to aerobic glycolysis during the pro-inflammatory phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. This switch is associated with reduced activation of the key energy sensor 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This metabolic switch in macrophages can be inhibited by pharmacological activation of AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The kinase senses ratios of ATP to AMP and ADP and restores energy balance by inhibiting anabolic processes that consume ATP, while promoting catabolic processes that generate ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. AMPK also plays an anti-inflammation role. The first-line Type 2 diabetes drug metformin, which also activates AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], reduces systemic inflammation by decreasing the level of CRP and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and lowers plasma macrophage migration in obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Together these data suggest that AMPK is an attractive drug target to improve metabolic homeostasis and reduce inflammation. Here we used pharmacological AMPK activators, PF-06409577 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] given its use in a recent phase I clinical study (NCT02286882) and BI-9774, in conjunction with AMPK gain-of-function mice, to examine whether AMPK activation could prevent or reduce pro-inflammatory MIF production from macrophages following energy stress.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell isolation and culture</title><p id="P9">Raw264.7 cells and primary BMDMs were cultured as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].

In our study, we observed no change in the cellular MIF expression in macrophages. However consistent with the finding in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] we found that low glucose elevated MIF secretion from macrophages. Currently, the mechanisms of MIF release are poorly defined though cell death and loss of autophagy likely contribute to MIF release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. We ruled out cell death in our studies, at least over the time course studied. Moreover, we observed activation of autophagy following low glucose suggesting loss of autophagy is unlikely to mediate increased MIF release shown here. MIF is constitutively expressed and contained within readily-releasable pools in contrast to other pro-inflammatory cytokines and suggests that MIF may act as first responder during hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. In contrast to expectations, we did not observe changes in other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1 β release from macrophages (data not shown). It will be interesting to determine in future studies whether low glucose generates a greater and broader increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production from polarized macrophages, from macrophages isolated from models of diabetes/people with diabetes or during glucose recovery following a hypoglycemia-like challenge. Polarized pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages switch to aerobic glycolysis, and this metabolic switch is associated with reduced AMPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], whereas anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages utilize mainly oxidative metabolism to generate ATP. In our naïve macrophages, we did not see a metabolic shift towards glycolysis and in contrast, low glucose activated AMPK transiently and decreased the ratio of glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. This effect persisted for up to 3 hours, suggesting a successful metabolic adaptation of preserve intracellular ATP levels. Interestingly, pharmacological AMPK activation inhibited or reduced the necessity for this metabolic adaptation to low glucose. This begs the question as to what, if any, is the mechanistic difference between physiological (low glucose) and pharmacological AMPK activation? We noted modest increases in AMPK pathway activation in response to low glucose that coincided with increased MIF release. We tried to examine whether AMPK inhibition altered MIF release, however, SBI-0206595 increased MIF release in an AMPK-independent manner, mostly likely by increasing ROS production. BMDMs isolated from AMPK D316A allowed us to examine non-pharmacological effects. In line with the pharmacology studies, modest genetic AMPK activation attenuated low glucose-induced MIF release. These data lend support to the idea increasing levels of AMPK activity produce greater suppression of MIF release and that the regulation of MIF by AMPK is most apparent when there is a stress to work against.</p><p id="P28">AMPK is generally regarded as a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cascades, although the underlying mechanism is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Hematopoietic AMPK β1-containing AMPK complexes reduce mouse adipose tissue macrophage inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that pharmacological AMPK activation, using two different AMPK activators, attenuates MIF release from macrophages. Previous studies have shown that hypoglycemia/low glucose induces oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], and separate studies have shown that AMPK can inhibit oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] by activation of autophagy to scavenge ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. There is also evidence that oxidative stress induces MIF release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Accordingly we demonstrate that low glucose mediated oxidative stress may drive MIF release. However, PF-06409577 did not alter low glucose-induced ROS production, suggesting that AMPK-mediated suppression of MIF occurs further downstream or that increased ROS is a bystander event.</p><p id="P29">Surprisingly, we found no evidence that PF-06409577 altered autophagy. It has been suggested that AMPK regulation of autophagy is a dual ‘fail-safe’ mechanism mediated by inactivating of TORC1, the master regulator of autophagy, and direct phosphorylation of ULK1, an initiator of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Despite a recent report demonstrating PF-06409577 mediated reductions in the ratio of LC3 I/II in osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], this was not observed in macrophages even at higher concentrations (10 µmol/l vs. 1 µmol/l). PF-06409577 did not regulate autophagy in our study, at least under the conditions tested. Collectively, our findings suggest that low glucose induced MIF release is likely mediated, at least in part by increasing oxidative stress and that AMPK acts downstream of oxidative stress to suppress MIF release. The regulation of MIF secretion is poorly understood. Unlike most other cytokines, MIF lacks the N-terminal signal peptide that guides secretion through the conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi route, therefore is secreted via an unconventional pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy using RNAi or autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced MIF release from macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Consistently, we observed that AMPK/ULK/autophagy inhibitor SBI-0206965 substantially enhanced MIF release from macrophages, despite no effect on LC3 conversion. In the present study, low glucose-induced autophagy coincided with increased MIF release, indicating that autophagy is not directly involved in the regulation of MIF secretion from macrophages. Here, it is likely that suppression of MIF occurs through an AMPK-NFĸB signalling pathway given the role of NFĸB in the anti-inflammatory actions of AMPK in other pathological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. AMPK inhibits the translocation of NFĸB where it can otherwise activate transcription of genes involved in pro-inflammatory signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and we confirmed this in the present study, although this effect was modest. Similarly, NFĸB inhibition attenuated low glucose-induced MIF secretion, further demonstrating that NFĸB is involved in MIF release. Interestingly, MIF stimulates AMPK activation through CD74, promotes glucose uptake and protects the heart during ischaemia-reperfusion injury in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and increases glucose utilisation in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. In our study, we did not observe significant AMPK activation when MIF release was enhanced after low glucose exposure (i.e. at 16 hrs). It is possible that the autocrine-paracrine effect of MIF on the AMPK activation is too modest or transient to be detected in our conditions. According to studies in other cells, induction of significant AMPK activation by MIF requires concentrations of greater than 100 ng/ml, which is greater than the highest MIF concentrations detected here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. However, given that we did not find production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in our studies, it is plausible that MIF is acting in a protective and or compensatory manner to help cells defend against low energy availability.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P30">In summary, these data suggest that macrophage AMPK acts to limit MIF release under pathological states where increased ROS-mediated activation of NFĸB occurs. Moreover, pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses MIF release without altering the generation of ROS, at least in response to low glucose in the current study. Taken together, this suggests that pharmacological AMPK activation could be a strategy for reducing macrophage MIF release in diseases such as diabetes, where glucose variation frequently occur although further study is required to determine the nature of MIF signalling in the context of low glucose reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS189888-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d29aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr Ana Cruz, Dr Paul Weightman Potter, Dr Katie Partridge, Katherine Pye, Wyn Firth and Asmaa Alkhalidi for technical assistance and insightful comments during the project.
