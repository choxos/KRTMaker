tract in the huntingtin protein. The CAG repeat is unstable, and expansions of hundreds of CAGs have been detected in Huntington’s disease <italic>post-mortem</italic> brains. The age of disease onset can be predicted partially from the length of the CAG repeat as measured in blood. Onset age is also determined by genetic modifiers, which in six cases involve variation in DNA mismatch repair pathways genes. Knocking-out specific mismatch repair genes in mouse models of Huntington’s disease prevents somatic CAG repeat expansion. Taken together, these results have led to the hypothesis that somatic CAG repeat expansion in Huntington’s disease brains is required for pathogenesis. Therefore, the pathogenic repeat threshold in brain is longer than (CAG)<sub>40</sub>, as measured in blood, and is currently unknown.</p><p id="P2">The mismatch repair gene <italic>MSH3</italic> has become a major focus for therapeutic development, as unlike other mismatch repair genes, nullizygosity for <italic>MSH3</italic> does not cause malignancies associated with mismatch repair deficiency. Potential treatments targeting <italic>MSH3</italic> currently under development include gene therapy, biologics and small molecules, which will be assessed for efficacy in mouse models of Huntington’s disease. The zQ175 knock-in model carries a mutation of approximately (CAG)<sub>185</sub> and develops early molecular and pathological phenotypes that have been extensively characterised. Therefore, we crossed the mutant huntingtin allele onto heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Msh3</italic> knock-out backgrounds to determine the maximum benefit of targeting <italic>Msh3</italic> in this model. Ablation of <italic>Msh3</italic> prevented somatic expansion throughout the brain and periphery, and reduction of <italic>Msh3</italic> by 50% decreased the rate of expansion. This had no effect on the deposition of huntingtin aggregation in the nuclei of striatal neurons, nor on the dysregulated striatal transcriptional profile. This contrasts with ablating <italic>Msh3</italic> in knock-in models with shorter CAG repeat expansions. Therefore, further expansion of a (CAG)<sub>185</sub> repeat in striatal neurons does not accelerate the onset of molecular and neuropathological phenotypes. It is striking that highly expanded CAG repeats of a similar size in humans cause disease onset before 2 years of age, indicating that somatic CAG repeat expansion in the brain is not required for pathogenesis. Given that the trajectory for somatic CAG expansion in the brains of Huntington’s disease mutation carriers is unknown, our study underlines the importance of administering treatments targeting somatic instability as early as possible.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Huntington’s disease</kwd><kwd>somatic CAG repeat instability</kwd><kwd>MSH3</kwd><kwd>genetic modifiers</kwd><kwd>pathogenic CAG repeat length</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>CRISPR</term><def><p id="P3">clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAB</term><def><p id="P4">3.3′-diaminobenzidine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FELASA</term><def><p id="P5">Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>gRNA</term><def><p id="P6">guide RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOBP</term><def><p id="P7">gene ontology biological process</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GWAS</term><def><p id="P8">genome-wide association study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTRF</term><def><p id="P9">homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTTexon1</term><def><p id="P10">exon 1 HTT protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="P11">interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="P12">phosphate buffer saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p id="P13">principal component analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>polyA</term><def><p id="P14">polyadenylation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>polyQ</term><def><p id="P15">polyglutamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Q</term><def><p id="P16">glutamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qPCR</term><def><p id="P17">real-time quantitative PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RNA-seq</term><def><p id="P18">RNA sequencing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p id="P19">standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMRT</term><def><p id="P20">single molecule real-time sequencing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p id="P21">wild-type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P22">Huntington’s disease is a heritable neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by motor dysfunctions, psychiatric changes, and cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> The disease is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (<italic>HTT</italic>), which encodes an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT).

Importantly, for therapeutic potential, unlike other DNA mis-match repair genes, loss of function of MSH3 does not cause Lynch syndrome, which is associated with a high risk of colon cancer and a spectrum of other malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup></p><p id="P25">The design of mouse trials for the target validation of MSH3 and for the preclinical testing of novel MSH3 targeting therapeutics is not straightforward. Ideally, the chosen model will develop robust phenotypes within a timescale amenable to the administration and durability of the potential therapeutic agents. However, such a model is likely to have been created with a highly expanded CAG repeat that would cause childhood onset of the disease in humans, and therefore, does not model the CAG repeat expansion process that occurs in the adult-onset disease. The zQ175 knock-in mouse of Huntington’s disease is an attractive candidate as it is well characterised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and has been used for HTT lowering approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> However, the mutant allele in zQ175 generally has approximately (CAG)<sub>190</sub>. To test whether the prevention of somatic CAG repeat expansion could result in measurable improvements in zQ175 mice, we crossed the mutant <italic>Htt</italic> allele onto heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Msh3</italic> knockout backgrounds. Although, in the absence of <italic>Msh3</italic>, the pronounced somatic CAG repeat instability in the striatum was prevented, there was no improvement in striatal transcription dysregulation, as measured by RNA-seq, nor was there a decrease in striatal HTT aggregation. These data point to a CAG repeat threshold above which the rate of disease pathogenesis does not increase, and at which the prevention of somatic CAG repeat expansion will have no beneficial consequences. The trajectory for CAG repeat-expansion in the human brain is not known and this work further underlines the importance of developing treatments that can be given to Huntington’s disease mutation carriers as early as possible.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P26">All procedures were performed in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, and approved by the University College London Ethical Review Process Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation of <italic>Msh3</italic> knock out mice</title><p id="P27"><italic>Msh3</italic> knockout mice were generated by CRISPR technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> In brief, guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting exon 3 of mouse <italic>Msh3</italic>: Msh3 gRNA 51/57 (targeting sequence: TCTGCAACGTGCAAAGAATGCGG) and exon 8, Msh3 gRNA 89/69, (Targeting sequence: GTTGGCACAGACAGGTCGGAGGG) were designed by Benchling online software and generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription.

In zQ175 mice, it is the soluble HTTexon1 protein that is depleted from brain regions during the aggregation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> The N-terminus of HTT contains a potent nuclear export signal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and HTT is retained in neuronal nuclei because it aggregates there, appearing first as a diffuse immunoreactive product that fills the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> The threshold concentration for the nucleation of aggregation will be cell-type and subcellular location specific.</p><p id="P61">Knocking out the mismatch repair genes <italic>Msh2</italic> or <italic>Mlh1</italic> delayed the accumulation of aggregated HTT in striatal nuclei of the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q111 knock-in model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> However, prevention of somatic CAG repeat expansion in zQ175 mice had no effect on the deposition of aggregated HTT in striatal nuclei. Given that HTT aggregation precedes transcriptional changes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> this was consistent with MSH3 ablation having no effect on transcriptional dysregulation in the zQ175 striatum. Therefore, in this subcellular location, (CAG)<sub>185</sub> in the <italic>Htt</italic> gene produced HTTexon1 at or above the threshold concentration needed to initiate aggregation, and further CAG expansion could not accelerate this process. It is striking that highly expanded CAG repeats (of greater than (CAG)<sub>200</sub>) in humans cause onset of Huntington’s disease before two years of age, whereas those of (CAG)<sub>100–130</sub> caused onset at around four years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> This suggests that for CAG repeats approaching (CAG)<sub>200</sub>, initiation of the pathogenic process does not require further expansion through somatic CAG repeat instability.</p><p id="P62">MSH3 has significant therapeutic potential for Huntington’s disease and other trinucleotide repeat disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and a wide range of MSH3-targeting modalities are under development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> Our data indicate that whilst ablation of MSH3 prevented somatic CAG repeat expansion in zQ175 mice, this model will not be useful for evaluating these MSH3-targeting treatments, and that knock-in mice with shorter CAG repeat mutations should be used. However, more importantly, we found that somatic expansions in zQ175 striatal neurons did not accelerate HTT aggregate pathology or transcriptional dysregulation, indicative of a pathogenic repeat threshold at, or close to, (CAG)<sub>185</sub>. Early childhood onset cases of Huntington’s disease with repeat expansions close to (CAG)<sub>200</sub>, are consistent with a pathogenic threshold occurring at around this repeat length. Available data indicate that successful MSH3-targeting treatments will slow down the rate of somatic CAG repeat expansion in the brains of Huntington’s disease mutation carriers. The prevention of somatic CAG repeat expansion is unlikely as that would require MSH3 ablation. The trajectory for repeat expansion in the Huntington’s disease brain is not understood and these results indicate that the greatest benefit for MSH3-targeting therapeutics will be realised by treating as early as possible before cell-specific pathogenic thresholds have been achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS192941-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Jian Chen at the CHDI Foundation for advice on RNA sequencing and facilitating the data analysis.
