IRP2 is viewed as the primary regulator in liver, yet our previous datasets showing diurnal rhythms for certain IRE-containing mRNAs suggest a nuanced temporal control mechanism.

The master clock in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nuclei entrains to the light-dark cycle and synchronizes peripheral oscillators through various cues that include hormonal signals, feeding-fasting cycles and body temperature rhythms. At the molecular level, the timekeeping mechanism is based on negative transcriptional feedback loops and drives daily cycles in gene expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]). Metabolism is a key rhythmically regulated process in organs such as the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In addition to transcriptional regulation, various roles for post-transcriptional control of gene expression oscillations have emerged as well, involving in particular time-of-day-dependent changes in RNA stability and translation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]). Using ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) in mouse liver around-the-clock, mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins have been identified as prominent examples of transcripts whose rhythmic regulation occurs specifically through translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Moreover, in our previous work we reported that three transcripts encoding key proteins in iron metabolism, <italic>Ferritin light chain 1 (Ftl1), Ferritin heavy chain 1 (Fth1)</italic> and <italic>Aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (Alas2)</italic>, also show rhythmic translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P6">More than 40 years ago, the discovery of the iron-responsive element, or IRE, occurred through studying how Ferritin mRNA (encoding a major iron storage protein) is translationally repressed and activated by low and high iron levels, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. <italic>Alas2</italic>, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis in erythrocytes, was identified as IRE-containing a few years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Since then, several other IRE-containing transcripts have been identified and validated, and many more predicted ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and see below). These IREs are bound and regulated by IRPs (iron-regulatory proteins) in response to iron levels and other signals (O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NO) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]). The liver, a major iron storage organ, has been a key model for studying IRE/IRP regulation. Studies on mice lacking IRP1 (encoded by the <italic>Aco1</italic> gene) and IRP2 (encoded by <italic>Ireb2</italic>) have shown that IRP2 plays a major role in hepatic IRE regulation, with IRP1 having a limited role (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]). Interestingly, none of these studies have explored a possible time-of-day component in this regulatory mechanism.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we systematically investigate the rhythmic regulation of IRE-containing transcripts beyond <italic>Ftl1, Fth1</italic>, and <italic>Alas2</italic>. We examine the dependence of this regulation on IRP1 and IRP2 using ribo-seq analysis on liver samples collected at defined timepoints during the light and dark phases from <italic>Aco1/Irp1</italic> and <italic>Ireb2/Irp2</italic> knockout mice. Additionally, we analyze existing datasets to determine whether rhythmic IRE regulation is primarily driven by the circadian clock or by feeding/fasting. Our findings prompt a reassessment of current models regarding IRP1 and IRP2 dependence of hepatic IRE regulation, a crucial mechanism for organismal iron balance.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>A subset of IRE-containing transcripts is rhythmically regulated in mouse liver</title><p id="P8">Our previous around-the-clock RNA-seq and ribo-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) had revealed hepatic rhythms in RNA abundance across &gt;20 iron metabolic genes, as well as three transcripts – <italic>Ftl1, Fth1</italic> and <italic>Alas2</italic> – whose RNA levels were constant, yet they displayed robust rhythms in ribosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. <italic>Ftl1, Fth1</italic> and <italic>Alas2</italic> all contain an IRE in their 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, bind to such 5’ IREs to inhibit translation under conditions of low intracellular iron concentrations and as a function of other physiological cues; briefly, under high Fe(II), IRP1 assembles an iron-sulfur cluster and converts to ACO1 that is inactive for IRE binding, whereas IRP2 undergoes degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. IRE sequences adapt characteristic hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>) that are crucial for IRP binding and have been used for IRE predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. More than a dozen IRE-containing mRNAs have been reported in mammals, and we hence investigated whether rhythmic translation was more commonly found across other established 5’ IRE-containing transcripts. As compared to the robust translational rhythms on <italic>Fth1, Ftl1</italic> and <italic>Alas2</italic> in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, upper), other mRNAs lacked similar high-amplitude oscillations in ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, upper). Thus, the translation of <italic>Ferroportin</italic> (<italic>Slc40a1)</italic> mRNA showed low-amplitude oscillations, and <italic>Aconitase 2 (Aco2)</italic> and <italic>Hif2a/Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (Epas1)</italic> were non-rhythmic, despite harbouring well-characterised 5’ IREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Note that although <italic>Alas2</italic> is considered to be a paralogue mainly expressed in erythrocytes, the observed rhythmic <italic>Alas2</italic> translation in liver is most likely of hepatocyte origin rather than a signal from red blood cells/reticulocytes within the liver sample, as liver single cell RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] shows clear <italic>Alas2</italic> expression in hepatocytes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). We next compared the liver profiles with those from kidney, which revealed that <italic>Ftl1, Fth1</italic> and <italic>Slc40a1</italic> showed blunted ribosome occupancy rhythms in this organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>, lower). <italic>Aco2</italic> and <italic>Epas1</italic> were clearly non-rhythmic in kidney. We considered it a plausible hypothesis that distinct sequence/structural features of the IREs could underlie the observed presence or lack of rhythmicity. However, despite differences across IREs with regard to the length of the paired stem, the positions of bulge nucleotides, or IRE location relative to mRNA 5’ end or start codon, no particular feature appeared to distinguish rhythmicity-associated from other IREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In some cases, IREs are located in 3’ UTRs. In <italic>Transferrin receptor (Tfrc</italic>) mRNA, multiple 3’ IREs regulate transcript stability in an IRP-dependent manner, involving endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. We hence analysed diurnal <italic>Tfrc</italic> expression profiles. <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA abundance was indeed robustly rhythmic in liver and kidney, and ribosome footprints closely matched the mRNA profiles, indicating that no additional rhythmicity was imparted at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). We then sought to evaluate if the observed <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA rhythms were of post-transcriptional origin, in line with the 3’ IRE mechanism and previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. To this end, we leveraged two around-the-clock mouse liver datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] in which we had carried out RNA-seq on total RNA, allowing the quantification of both unspliced pre-mRNA (intron-mapping reads) and of mature mRNA (exon-mapping reads). With pre-mRNA levels serving as a proxy for nascent RNA/transcription at the <italic>Tfrc</italic> locus, both datasets confirmed that <italic>Tfrc</italic> was transcribed in a non-rhythmic fashion, yet its mRNA accumulated rhythmically around-the-clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-H</xref>, data from control mice). We concluded that <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythms were generated post-transcriptionally by modulating transcript stability in a diurnal fashion; this finding is further supported by a recent preprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P10">As a side note, one of the analysed datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) was part of a study that contained a matching cohort of animals with a disrupted miRNA biogenesis pathway (hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]). It has previously been proposed that <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA stability is governed by the interplay between IRPs and miR-7/miR-141 binding at the 3’ IRE stem-loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Given that <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA profiles were unaltered in <italic>Dicer</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), we deem it unlikely that miRNA-mediated mechanisms make strong contributions to hepatic 3’ IRE regulation. The other analysed dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) included an experimental cohort that carried a hepatocyte-specific mutation within the endonuclease that catalyse RNA degradation in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, <italic>Smg6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Briefly, the increase in <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA in <italic>Smg6</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) is most likely the result of a stabilization of several <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA variants that contain retained introns (see ENSEMBL annotations, locus ENSMUSG00000022797) and that are usually degraded through the NMD pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Rhythmic translation/mRNA abundance predicts phases of maximal and minimal IRP activity</title><p id="P11">From the above analyses we concluded that a subset of IRE-containing transcripts underwent pronounced rhythmic regulation in mouse liver. Of these, the 5’ IRE transcripts showed similar rhythmic phase, with a peak in translation around ZT4-6 and a trough at ~ZT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Given that IRP-IRE interaction inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), we would hence expect IRP activity on these transcripts to be minimal at ZT4-6 and maximal at ZT12. For <italic>Tfrc</italic>, IRP binding is expected to increase mRNA stability and we would predict maximal IRP activity during the rising phase of <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA abundance, i.e. at ~ZT12 as well. Therefore, the ensemble of observed rhythms would be consistent with a mechanism involving time-of-day-dependent IRP activity on IREs that is minimal and maximal at ZT4-6 and ZT12, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Diurnal regulation could be mediated simply by daily changes in IRP protein abundance. We had dismissed this mechanism, however, in our previous work as we had observed no rhythmicity (or, at most, very modest daily changes) for liver IRP1/ACO1 or IRP2/IREB2 at the level of mRNA, ribosome footprints or protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Since publication of our study it has been reported that the antibody we had used to quantify IRP2/IREB2 (abcam ab1811539) not only detects IRP2/IREB2 (as marketed by the vendor at the time), but also IRP1/ACO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Therefore, our original analysis of around-the-clock IRP2 protein levels was undoubtedly flawed, representing an overlay of both IRPs rather than IRP2 specifically. Moreover, it has been reported that in colon cancer cells, the <italic>Ireb2</italic> gene is circadianly transcribed through BMAL1:CLOCK, engendering <italic>Ireb2</italic> mRNA and IRP2/IREB2 protein oscillations that subsequently regulate <italic>Tfrc</italic> stability in a rhythmic fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The ensemble of these findings prompted us to revisit the temporal dynamics of IRP expression across our datasets. Thus, our RNA-seq and ribo-seq data showed modest rhythmicity (&lt;1.5-fold peak-to-trough amplitudes) for <italic>Aco1</italic> and <italic>Ireb2</italic> in liver but not in kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). For <italic>Ireb2</italic>, the mRNA phase – maximal abundance around ZT10 – was in principle compatible with the BMAL1:CLOCK regulation reported from colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, the shallow peak-trough amplitudes that <italic>Ireb2</italic> displays for both RNA and pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lower) indicated that rhythmic transcriptional activation through BMAL1:CLOCK would not appear to be an important driver of <italic>Ireb2</italic> mRNA synthesis in liver. For comparison, in the same dataset <italic>Arntl/Bmal1</italic> itself, and well-established BMAL1:CLOCK targets such as <italic>Dbp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], present very high amplitude mRNA and pre-mRNA oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The main regulation of IRP1 activity and of IRP2 abundance occurs through post-translational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Given the issues with antibody specificity described above, we re-evaluated IRP1 and IRP2 protein levels around-the-clock using highly specific monoclonal antibodies that are free of cross-reactivity (see later, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G, J</xref>). Using a time series of total liver protein extracts from the same animals that showed <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA rhythms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], Western blot analysis confirmed that ACO1/IRP1 showed constant abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). By contrast, the Western blot for IREB2/IRP2 revealed high-amplitude rhythmic protein accumulation in the control liver time series, with minimal and maximal protein abundances around ZT4 and ZT12, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). The difference in IRP2 protein levels quantified from single liver samples at trough (ZT4) and peak (ZT12) showed an ~10-fold amplitude with some inter-individual variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I, J</xref>). Of note, we also included our previous study’s “experimental condition” samples (<italic>Smg6</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]) in our Western blots. Interestingly, IRP2 protein rhythm was blunted in <italic>Smg6</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>), despite <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA oscillating with high amplitude according to RNA-seq analysis from exactly the same tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) – a discrepancy that led us to conclude that there was no simple, one-to-one correspondence between oscillations in IRP2 protein abundance and IRE-containing transcript regulation. We also analysed the levels of FBXL5, which is the F-box protein that targets IREB2/IRP2 for proteasomal degradation and is key for the regulation of IRP2 stability and abundance. According to the established mechanism, FBXL5 acts as an iron sensor that is stabilised by Fe binding under high iron conditions, yet unfolded and degraded during iron scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. In addition, an FBXL5-independent mechanism of IREB2/IRP2-dependent target regulation has recently been identified as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Our Western blot analysis in the control liver time series and in single liver samples indicated that FBXL5 protein levels showed modest rhythms only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K-M</xref>). We therefore deemed it unlikely that the observed strong diurnal changes in IREB2/IRP2 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>) would be the simple outcome of FBXL5 abundance changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K-M</xref>). Taken together, our analyses revealed hepatic rhythms in IRP2 abundance that have previously gone unnoticed. Still, the lack of clear correspondence between rhythmic patterns seen for the abundances of IRP2 and FBXL5 proteins as well as <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA, highlight the regulatory complexity within the IRP/IRE system.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>In vivo <italic>recording of diurnal gene expression oscillations shows unperturbed circadian mPER2::LUC reporter rhythms in</italic> Aco1 <italic>and</italic> Ireb2 <italic>knockout mice</italic></title><p id="P14">Two reasons pointed to a possible involvement of IREB2/IRP2 in diurnal IRE regulation. First, the observation that – in the time series data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref> – IRP2 did show rhythmicity with lower and higher abundances in the light and dark phases, respectively. Second, IRP2 can be considered the main IRP activity in liver, given that changes to IRE regulation have generally been reported upon IRP2 deficiency rather than IRP1 loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. However, if IRP1 does not constitute a major IRP activity in liver, it is intriguing that the protein is particularly abundant in this organ, as also confirmed by our own ribosome profiling data. Thus, in terms of translational output ACO1/IRP1 shows &gt;5-fold higher expression than IREB2/IRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; compare maximal liver footprint Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads of ~150 for <italic>Aco1</italic> and of ~25 for <italic>Ireb2</italic>). Of note, however, previous studies that failed to show major phenotypes in IRE regulation upon IRP1 loss did not address the possibility that IRP1-mediated effects in liver might be subject to temporal control over the diurnal cycle.</p><p id="P15">We thus wished to determine experimentally how rhythmic target regulation would be affected in the absence of IRP1 or IRP2. To this end, we made use of <italic>Aco1</italic> and <italic>Ireb2</italic> knockout mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. These mice present with systemic alterations to iron homeostasis, including in liver (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]); moreover, there are documented links between iron and the circadian timekeeping mechanism itself. For example, several core clock proteins contain heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and the transcription of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> has been reported as sensitive to iron accumulation through a mechanism that involves histone methylation state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. A more systematic analysis of how iron metabolic genes affect the circadian clock is still lacking in mammals, but has been carried out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and revealed numerous interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Therefore, for our study we first explored whether whole-body <italic>Aco1</italic> or <italic>Ireb2</italic> knockout would engender phenotypes in entrained liver clock rhythms that could potentially confound the specific analysis of rhythmic IRP/IRE regulation. We used a method for the real-time recording of liver gene expression in freely moving mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] that relies on luciferase reporters, luciferin delivery via an osmotic minipump, and highly sensitive bioluminescence photon counting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). All animals carried the <italic>mPer2::luc</italic> knock-in allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] that expresses a protein fusion between core clock component PER2 and firefly luciferase, serving as a precise readout of diurnal oscillations. We carried out real-time recordings of liver rhythms under conditions that ensured light-entrainment of the master (SCN) clock to an external 24-hour light-dark cycle by means of a skeleton photoperiod, i.e. two 30 min light pulses applied at times corresponding to the beginning and to the end of the light phase in a 12h-light-12h-dark (LD12:12) cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Our experiments revealed rhythmic bioluminescence rhythms in wild-type animals, as expected, and also in littermate animals that were knockouts for either of the IRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). For <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, the phase of entrained mPER2::LUC reporter oscillations was virtually indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In the <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, the entrained mPER2::LUC phase was minimally delayed (~0.5 h) as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), yet no other overt differences were apparent. We nevertheless verified that the liver clock in <italic>Ireb2</italic> knockouts was fully functional by recording free-running rhythms from liver organ explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Free-running bioluminescence rhythms from <italic>Ireb2</italic> knockouts and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>) and their quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>) indicated overall comparable oscillations <italic>ex vivo</italic>, yet with higher variability in period length between individual explants in the knockouts. Altogether, our data suggested that diurnal oscillations in liver were comparable between IRP knockouts and their respective controls. Entrained clock phases between genotypes showed good correspondence.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Timepoint-specific gene expression datasets from IRP-deficient livers allow analysis of diurnal regulation</title><p id="P16">For our further analyses we selected the two timepoints at which rhythmic IRP/IRE activity would be low (ZT5) and high (ZT12), respectively, leading to high and low translation efficiency <italic>(Ftl1, Fth1, Alas2)</italic> and mRNA turnover <italic>(Tfrc)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We reasoned that in the simplest scenario, one of the IRPs (e.g. IRP2, the most potent IRE-regulator in liver according to the literature) was singly responsible for rhythmic target regulation. This rhythm would then be detectable in the control livers when comparing the two timepoints, yet absent in the livers from animals deficient for the rhythm-relevant IRP (e.g. IRP2 in the above example). More complex regulatory scenarios are conceivable, too, such as redundant regulation by the two IRPs, which would lead to no, or partial deregulation of rhythmicity in the knockouts. We collected 3 livers per timepoint and genotype (<italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>; plus their respective, matched <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> controls carrying the same genetic background) and prepared RNA-seq and ribo-seq libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). After sequencing and analysis, quantification of <italic>Aco1</italic>-mapping ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) in <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> livers confirmed the knockout at the level of ACO1/IRP1 translation/protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, top panel). Because in the knockout allele the open reading frame is disrupted yet still produces an mRNA from the locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], the reduction in <italic>Aco1</italic> in the RNA-seq data was less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle panel). <italic>Aco1</italic> translation efficiency (TE; defined as RPF/RNA ratio) was decreased in the knockouts as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, lower panel). In livers from <italic>Ireb2</italic>-deficient animals, <italic>Aco1</italic> RNA and RPFs were decreased by 10-20% as compared to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), indicating that IREB2/IRP2 loss did not lead to compensatory higher IRP1 biosynthesis. Overall analogous observations were made for <italic>Ireb2</italic> expression, which showed the expected decrease in the <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals at RPF and TE level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, upper and lower panels), but not for the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, middle panel). In <italic>Aco1</italic> knockouts, <italic>Ireb2</italic> expression was largely unchanged at the RPF level, indicating that there was no substantial compensatory upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).

In these animals, IREB2/IRP2 abundance showed a tendency towards increased levels that did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G, I</xref>). Higher abundance of IREB2/IRP2 at ZT12 vs. ZT5 was evident as well, although quantitively less pronounced than in the around-the-clock time series analysed before (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G, I</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-J</xref>). In the <italic>Ireb2</italic> cohort, knockouts were devoid of IREB2/IRP2 protein as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J, L</xref>). In the control animals from this cohort, IREB2/IRP2 increased in abundance from ZT5 to ZT12 in a quantitatively minor (yet statistically significant) fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). In summary, we concluded that the datasets obtained from the two timepoints and genotypes would allow the analysis of interactions between IRP function and time-of-day and, more specifically, to investigate whether the identified rhythmic regulation could be attributed specifically to one of the IRPs. Moreover, our experiments validated the specificity of the IRP1 and IRP2 antibodies. Finally, although we observed a significant difference in IRP2 abundance between light-phase and dark-phase timepoints across different independent datasets, the fold-changes seen in the three cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I, J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I, L</xref>) were highly variable, pointing towards poor robustness of IRP2 rhythmicity.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>IRP loss affects the regulation of 5’ and 3’ IRE-containing transcripts in a timepoint-specific fashion</title><p id="P17">Next, we assessed across genotypes and timepoints how 5’ IRE-containing transcripts (<italic>Ftl1, Fth1, Alas2</italic>) were affected in their translation efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>) and 3’ IRE-containing <italic>Tfrc</italic> in its RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).

The most striking observation was the timepoint-specificity of translational derepression in <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>, right panels). Thus, <italic>Ftl1</italic> and <italic>Fth1</italic> (and to a lesser extent <italic>Alas2</italic>) showed strongly increased TEs (i.e., derepression) in the absence of IREB2/IRP2 during the light phase of the day (ZT5), in line with the model that IREB2/IRP2 is the main IRE-regulating IRP in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].

These findings indicated that a repressive mechanism distinct from IREB2/IRP2 was acting on the translation of IRE-containing transcripts specifically at ZT12.

On the one hand, the tendency to reduced <italic>Tfrc</italic> levels in <italic>Ireb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> livers (in line with the model that IRP2 protects <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA from degradation) was visible at ZT5. However, at ZT12 there was no decrease in <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA in the absence of IREB2/IRP2, and rather a trend towards increased abundance. Therefore, similarly to the TE repressive effects seen for 5’ IREs, also the mRNA stabilizing effect for 3’ IRE-containing <italic>Tfrc</italic> did not require IRP2 at the dark-phase timepoint.</p><p id="P18">We next analysed the effects associated with the absence of IRP1 (<italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> vs. <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> animals).

As a result, the differences between TEs at peak (ZT5) and trough (ZT12) were reduced in <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> vs. <italic>Aco1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> animals, indicating slightly blunted amplitudes of rhythmic <italic>Fth1</italic> and <italic>Alas2</italic> translation when ACO1/IRP1 was absent.

We concluded that despite the generally held model that IRP1 has little effect on IRE regulation in liver, specific differences between knockouts and controls were apparent.

Our data indicate that IRP2 is not solely responsible for IRE regulation in liver. Especially at ZT12, IRP2 actually appears to be dispensable for translational repression. Our analyses further revealed that absence of IRP1 affects the regulation of IRE-containing mRNAs, in particular at ZT12. Taken together, it is conceivable that for rhythmically regulated IRE transcripts, IRP activities are partitioned and partially redundant according to time-of-day, with IRP2 dominating regulation at ZT5 (light phase) and IRP1 able to act at ZT12 (dark phase).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Distinct timepoint-dependent regulation and basal repressed states distinguish core iron metabolic and other 5’ IRE-containing transcripts</title><p id="P20">Beyond the four transcripts analysed in the previous section, several other mRNAs contain validated IREs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), and many more have been predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. A recent study has proposed that across different IRE-containing transcripts in rat liver, translational control through IRPs follows a hierarchy based on different iron concentration set-points at which translational repression occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Thus, IRE-containing mRNAs encoding core iron storage factors (e.g. Ferritins) are translationally repressed under normal physiological conditions and chow diet (i.e., “regular” cellular iron levels; our animals were fed normal chow diet throughout), whereas those mRNAs that encode proteins with broader physiological roles are actively translated under these conditions (e.g. <italic>Aco2</italic>, encoding the TCA cycle enzyme, mitochondrial aconitase). Under iron overload, the former transcripts would undergo derepression, yet the latter only experience little additional stimulation of translation. Upon iron deficiency, by contrast, <italic>Aco2</italic> is highly responsive and becomes strongly repressed. Interestingly, it was proposed that IRP1 contributes to this setpoint mechanism through the kinetics of IRP1:IRE dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Conceivably, similar mechanisms may also underlie the differences that we observe in rhythmic regulation. Indeed, in the control mice, <italic>Ftl1</italic> and <italic>Fth1</italic> (encoding core iron management proteins) were generally more strongly repressed than <italic>Alas2</italic> (encoding a broader function protein involved in heme biosynthesis) – see TE values in the wild-type animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref> that were in the range of -4 to -1 for <italic>Ftl1</italic> and <italic>Fth1</italic>, but around -1.5 to -0.5 for <italic>Alas2</italic>.

Consistent with the validity of the “setpoint model”, these transcripts all showed high basal TEs (-1 to +0.5) and IRP deficiency led, at most, to modest stimulation of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-G</xref>).

In <italic>Aco1/Irp1</italic> knockouts, significant derepression was observable at both ZT5 and ZT12 for <italic>Slc40a1/Ferroportin</italic> (encoding a protein in the core iron metabolic machinery that functions as an iron exporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, left panel). For <italic>Epas1/Hif2a</italic> a small effect was apparent at ZT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, left panel; statistically not significant; please note that a previous report had suggested specific <italic>Epas1/Hif2a</italic> regulation through IRP1 in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]). The effect size of de-repression for <italic>Aco2</italic> was quantitatively minimal as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>, left panel).

First, we asked the question if the phenomenon was <italic>bona fide</italic> circadian clock-driven that depended on functional clocks locally in hepatocytes and/or systemically in the whole organism, or if other rhythmicity cues were involved. Briefly, it is well established that various direct and indirect mechanisms, alone or in combination, are involved in driving gene expression oscillations in liver (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]). A considerable proportion of rhythmic mRNA expression is thus driven transcriptionally and directly through the cellular core clock. However, numerous cases of hepatic gene expression oscillations still persist in the absence of local liver clocks, as they are driven by systemic cues. The underlying mechanisms include, for example, oscillations in body temperature that are generated by the master clock in the SCN and lead to changes in the activity of the transcription factor <italic>Hsf1</italic>, which in turn drives transcriptional oscillations without the obligatory involvement of local hepatocyte clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Moreover, feeding/fasting cycles (that are a consequence of behavioural rhythmicity) are an important timing cue for metabolically active peripheral organs. Rhythmic feeding is a well-established <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for the entrainment of hepatic clocks and, in addition, feeding-dependent signals also regulate gene expression directly, without the need of local hepatocyte clocks. For example, the nutrient-responsive mTOR pathway undergoes daily activation cycles in response to feeding, regulating the translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs containing regulatory 5’ TOP motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], showing maximal translation at the light-dark transition, i.e. in antiphase to IRP/IRE translation rhythms.</p><p id="P25">In order to explore at which level in the organism a circadian clock was required for IRP/IRE rhythms, we used the oscillations of <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA as a proxy for rhythmic IRP/IRE regulation. This allowed us to take advantage of numerous published around-the-clock RNA-seq datasets from wild-type and clock-deficient mice under a variety of feeding regimes. First, we analysed the RNA-seq data from a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] that used three different genetic animal models: wild-type, <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout (i.e., behaviourally arrhythmic with no functional clocks in the entire body) and liver-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> re-expression (i.e. behaviourally arrhythmic, with functional clocks only in hepatocytes), either fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> or night-restricted. Night-restricted feeding exacerbated <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythmicity in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, upper). In <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO mice, <italic>Tfrc</italic> was arrhythmic under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding, yet rhythmicity was re-installed under night-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, middle) and in <italic>Bmal1</italic> re-expression mice, <italic>Tfrc</italic> regained rhythmicity under night-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, lower). This data was fully compatible with a model according to which local clocks (liver) or a circadian master clock (SCN) were <italic>per se</italic> not essential for <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythmicity, as long as feeding-fasting cycles persisted. We confirmed this conclusion in two other datasets. Atger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] collected livers from night-fed full-body <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO vs. wild-type mice and applied an RNA-seq methodology to quantify both mRNA and pre-mRNA levels. In this experiment, <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA rhythms are indistinguishable between the circadian clock-deficient <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO and the control animals under imposed night-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, upper panel), and pre-mRNA (transcription) is identical and arrhythmic in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, lower panel). We concluded that rhythmic feeding was sufficient to induce post-transcriptionally generated <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA oscillations in the absence of an endogenous circadian system. Next, we used the study by Greenwell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] to investigate the complementary scenario, i.e. how <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythmicity in liver fares in the presence of a wild-type circadian system, but in the absence of feeding/fasting cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The analysis of four different feeding regimens from night-restricted (100% food intake during the dark phase) to <italic>ad libitum</italic> (~76% during dark), “damped”/almost entirely arrhythmic feeding (~56% during dark) and arrhythmic feeding (~51% of food intake during dark vs. ~49% during light phase), revealed a gradual disappearance of <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythmicity that scaled with the loss of feeding/fasting cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Finally, we analysed data comprised in the study by Manella et al.

From the above analyses that probe the relative importance of the circadian system vs. feeding/fasting cycles for the rhythmic accumulation of <italic>Tfrc</italic>, we can conclude that it is via the latter mechanism – feeding – that <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA oscillations are engendered. By extension, we propose that feeding-related timing cues constitute a physiological basis for rhythmicity of the IRP/IRE system in liver tissue.</p><p id="P27">Iron itself controls IRE-binding activity for IRP1 and protein stability for IRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Rhythmicity in intracellular, bioactive iron (the so-called “labile iron pool”, or LIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]) could therefore represent a plausible driver for the observed diurnal gene expression changes. However, the measurement of the relevant levels of Fe(II) – i.e., ferrous iron that is available to engage in regulation on IRPs in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes, rather than more stably bound in other Fe-S-cluster containing proteins – next to other Fe iron pools and sources within the tissue, is a major challenge in the field (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Discussion</xref>). To gain insights into possible daily variations in liver iron, we adapted a method allowing the quantification of total, ferrous and ferric iron and that is insensitive to abundant heme-iron (see Materials and Methods). Our analyses revealed no significant changes in Fe(II) levels across the genotypes analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Given the methodological uncertainty surrounding our attempts to quantify the LIP in these experiments, we refrain from drawing strong conclusions on whether diurnal IRP/IRE regulation involves fluctuations in iron levels or alternative cues (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Through decades of research, the IRP/IRE system has become a paradigm (and literally a “textbook example” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]) of post-transcriptional gene regulatory control that is, moreover, relevant for human diseases such as iron storage disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The regulatory parameter that we have explored in our study – the time-of-day – has so far gone largely unnoticed (with the exception of a recent preprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]). We find high-amplitude rhythmic regulation in the liver precisely for the subset of transcripts that are archetypes of IRE regulation, namely the Ferritins (<italic>Fth1, Fth2</italic>), <italic>Alas2</italic> and <italic>Tfrc</italic>, which were also historically the first to be discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Previous analyses in IRP knockout livers have led to the model that IREB2/IRP2 is the main actor in hepatic IRE regulation and that ACO1/IRP1 cannot compensate for its loss (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]). None of these studies, however, used ribo-seq to specifically quantify translation rates, nor did they consider the temporal component in regulation. The timing of animal sacrifice was not reported in previous publications on hepatic IRE regulation, yet it is likely that it occurred during “core working hours” of laboratory researchers, i.e. between early morning and late afternoon. In particular the timepoint for which we detect the strongest IRP activity on its rhythmic targets and a possible redundancy between IRP1 and IRP2 activities – ZT12, at the beginning of the dark phase – is unlikely to have been covered in previously published work. Dark phase timepoints are, however, particularly relevant when working with nocturnal species, as this is when mice are most active and ingest most of their food.</p><p id="P29">By leveraging publicly available datasets and using <italic>Tfrc</italic> oscillations as a readout for diurnal IRP/IRE regulation, we uncovered that rhythmic control does not require a local circadian clock in hepatocytes, nor a central pacemaker in the SCN, as long as feeding/fasting cycles are maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Daytime-fed mice have inverted hepatic <italic>Tfrc</italic> rhythms further underscores the dominant role of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Hence, the direct influence and interference from the circadian clock onto the observed rhythm seems to be rather limited. In this aspect, IRP/IRE rhythmicity distinguishes itself from the mechanism acting on ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs whose translation is also rhythmic and dependent on feeding. RP mRNA translation is increased at the light-dark transition in <italic>ad libitum</italic>- or night-fed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. However, in day-fed animals, the rhythm in newly synthesised RPs does not invert but becomes flat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. RP mRNAs contain 5’ TOP motifs that are regulated via the mTOR pathway, which shows multiple interactions with clock regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. While the translational upregulation of RP mRNAs by feeding is hence gated in a circadian fashion (i.e. the feeding signal can exert its stimulatory effect only at a specific time of day), no such circadian gating appears to be in place for the IRP/IRE system, as judged by <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA profiles.</p><p id="P30">Over the years, IREs have been reported, validated, or predicted in many transcripts – yet for none of them have we observed comparably high peak-to-trough amplitudes across the various datasets that we have analysed. In line with the “set-point model” that has been put forward to explain how IRP activity thresholds lead to a hierarchy of translational repression across 5’ IRE-containing transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], the most rhythmically regulated mRNAs are also the most sensitive to repression and generally exhibit lower translation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>) compared with the non- (or less-) rhythmically regulated transcripts, which are overall more highly translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-G</xref>). Therefore, we deem it likely that the appearance of rhythmicity on specific IRE-containing transcripts is related to whether the transcript/IRE-specific thresholds match the physiological dynamic range of regulatory cues that modulate the IRPs. This model would also explain why rhythmic regulation for the same mRNAs is less prominent in the kidney; conceivably, the dynamic range of the cues could be different in this organ.</p><p id="P31">A question that we have begun to address but that will require future investigations, concerns the identity of the molecular cue that is responsible for imparting rhythmicity. The prime candidate is certainly iron itself, more particularly iron in the so-called “labile iron pool” or LIP, which consists of redox-active iron ions that are weakly liganded and therefore engage in regulatory and metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Quantifying the relevant iron pool in tissues is technically not a facile enterprise, given the large amounts of iron that is stored in ferritin or otherwise bound in various Fe-S cluster-containing proteins, plus the large quantities of iron in the mitochondria and lysosomes. Our measurements show minimally higher Fe(II) at ZT5 than ZT12 (non-significant), i.e. in principle the phase that would be required for high and low IRP activity at ZT5 and ZT12, respectively. One concern that remains is that technical reasons preclude quantification of the relevant cytoplasmically active iron pool against large amounts of protein-bound Fe(II) that the assay we used measures as well; more suitable methodology for LIP measurements in animals would be an important advance in the field. Moreover, it is conceivable that additional cues impart rhythmicity on IRPs as well, in particular oxygen, reactive oxygen species as well as nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, daily rhythms in tissue O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] levels have been described. It will thus be important, yet not trivial, to disentangle to what extent these various cues are relevant for rhythmic regulation of IRE-containing transcripts.</p><p id="P32">Our study allows refining the role of IRP2 in hepatic IRE regulation and a possible interplay with IRP1. While there is indeed a large body of literature supporting the idea that IRP2 is the principle actor in the regulation of Ferritin protein and <italic>Tfrc</italic> mRNA accumulation in liver (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]), the vast majority of former studies likely investigated regulation during the light phase (as lined out above). Our examination of time-resolved ribo-seq data indeed confirms that at the light phase timepoint ZT5, knockouts of IRP2 (but not of IRP1) present strong translational depression of Ferritin mRNAs. However, at the dark phase timepoint, ZT12, low translation efficiency is fully maintained even in the absence of IRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>), indicating that a different repressor is capable of acting on these IREs at this time-of-day. An obvious candidate is IRP1, whose knockout indeed showed a tendency to derepression at ZT12, at least for <italic>Fth1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Since the double deficiency for both IRPs is not viable – even as a liver-specific knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] – we cannot test the hypothesis that at ZT12, it is the combined activity of IRP1 and IRP2 that acts in repression. Still, based on our data we would propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>) according to which IRP1 is inactive at ZT5, and thus all repression occurs through IRP2 for the light-phase timepoint, yet IRP1 and IRP2 are redundantly active at ZT12. In terms of possible molecular mechanisms that could engender higher IRP1 activity at this time point, lower iron levels or changes in one of the other relevant cues could play a role. For example, it is interesting to note that liver H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels (a reflection of overall mitochondrial activity) are highest precisely at the light-dark transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. One may thus hypothesize that high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could engender the oxidation and destabilization of IRP1’s Fe-S cluster, leading to apo-IRP1 that is capable of binding to IREs. Experimental evidence will be needed to validate such speculations.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P33">Our investigations have brought to light a crucial aspect of regulation in the IRP/IRE system, namely its significant dependency on time-of-day. Through further analysis of this temporal dimension, we have uncovered previously overlooked redundant IRP activities notably at dark onset, a period likely overlooked in prior studies, thus challenging the notion of strict IRP2-dependence in liver. Our analyses further reveal that the daily fluctuations in IRP activity correlate with feeding-fasting cycles rather than with circadian cycles, and possibly involve hepatic Fe(II) level variations. Our findings thus reinforce the concept that rhythmic gene expression is governed by at least two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, truly circadian clock-driven oscillations, rooted in transcriptional regulation and essentially encoded within DNA sequence. Second, post-transcriptional/translational oscillations, frequently reflecting acute cues and signals such as feeding patterns. Translation emerges as a pivotal stage where such information can be ideally integrated to modulate protein output in a rapid and efficient manner. The responsiveness of the IRP/IRE system to feeding/fasting rhythms serves as a compelling example of this dynamic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Animals</title><p id="P34">Healthy adult male mice of age 12-24 weeks were used.

Left side - during the light phase (ZT5, coinciding with fasting phase in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed mice): IRP2 levels are relatively lower, but still able to exert some translational inhibition on their targets. This is why in <italic>Ireb2/Irp2</italic>-deficient animals, depression is seen. IRP1 is less active, likely due to Fe-S cluster assembly that precludes its IRE binding and this may be brought about by increased Fe(II) levels or other cues such as oxygen flucations. Right side – at beginning of dark phase (ZT12, feeding phase): IRP2 is abundant and actively repressing, but IRP1 is also active and can compensate for the loss of IRP2 in the corresponding <italic>Ireb2/Irp2</italic>-deficient animals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190123-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
