This study focuses on individuals associated with BA metallurgical production, specifically the Seima-Turbino (ST) phenomenon (∼2,200-1,900 BCE) associated with elaborate metal objects found across Northern Eurasia. The genetic profiles of nine ST-associated individuals vary widely ranging between ancestries maximized in individuals from the Eastern Siberian Late Neolithic/BA, and those of the Western Steppe Middle Late BA. The genetic heterogeneity observed is consistent with the current understanding of the ST metallurgical network as a transcultural phenomenon. The new data also shed light on the temporal and spatial range of an ancient Siberian genetic ancestry component, which is shared across many Uralic-speaking populations, and which we explore further via demographic modeling using additional genome-wide (2 individuals) and whole genome data (5 individuals, including a ∼30x genome) from northwestern Russia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ancient DNA</kwd><kwd>Bronze Age Eurasia</kwd><kwd>Siberian Ancestry</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P11">Bronze Age Eurasia (∼3000-1000 BCE) is characterized by the development of metallurgy, one of the most important cultural innovations in human history. The Early Bronze Age in Eurasia (∼3000 BCE) is associated with the emergence of the Circumpontic Metallurgical Province, and eastward expansion of metallurgical production and exchange across the Eurasian steppe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In the Late Bronze Age (∼2200–1000 BCE), a westward movement of materials was also detected, specifically in connection with the so-called Seima-Turbino (henceforth ST) phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> as seen by the presence of specific metal artifacts throughout the forest and forest-steppe regions of Northern Eurasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">The ST is represented by several sites throughout Eurasia dating to ∼2,200-1,900 BCE and constitutes a “metallurgical network” represented by many shared traits, such as the use of tin-copper, comparable artifact types, and shared metallurgical technologies that may have involved a movement of craft workers and/or groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The ST has been described as a “transcultural” phenomenon, i.e., a network of metallurgical production with shared traits on top of the underlying basis of consistent pottery types in the different areas associated with various archaeological cultures throughout northern Eurasia.</p><p id="P13">The name Seima-Turbino derives from the two eponymous burial grounds Seima and Turbino excavated in the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century CE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The ST phenomenon combines elements of several cultures and does not represent a single culture in itself, especially since there are no distinct settlements or pottery styles associated with it. Instead, certain metal objects, which were found throughout Eurasia, from China and Central Asia in the East to Finland and Moldova in the West, spanning across approximately three million square kilometers, represent key ST-associated criteria (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the entire spatial distribution of the ST, there is a certain degree of regional variation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Briefly, the artifacts in the east contain higher amounts of tin (Sn) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2 and 3</xref>) and more casting molds have been identified in the east compared to the west of the Urals, although a greater number and variation of ST objects have been found west of the Urals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). The metallic inventory of ST-complexes can be divided into two major groups: (1) objects that can be attributed to Eurasian archaeological cultures, such as Alakul, Abashevo, Sintashta, Petrovka and Srubnaya; (2) objects that are only known from ST-sites (socket axes, lamellar dagger blades, fully hilted daggers and knives and the so-called forked lanceheads) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Singular finds of objects and weaponry of the ST type have been reported from contexts otherwise attributed to Bronze Age Glazkovo, Okunevo, Elunino, Odino, Krotovo, Koptyaki, Sintashta, Petrovka, Abashevo, Srubnaya (Pokrovka), and Post-Fatyanovo cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, these finds are rare and most ST materials are found at ST-associated sites.</p><p id="P14">The people buried with ST-objects have been described as metallurgists who developed elaborate and distinct bronze objects, and possibly used river systems for transportation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Even though the horse plays a central role in the ST iconography, it remains unclear whether people associated with the phenomenon were using horses for riding, traction or transport. It has been hypothesized that the number of people associated with the ST phenomenon was small, since there are very few sites with human remains linked to the phenomenon, and ST metal artifacts are comparably few but geographically widespread. ST burials are very distinct from those of the other North Eurasian cultures: individuals were buried mostly without pottery and not in kurgans, both inhumations and cremations were common, and the grave goods included bronze, stone, and bone weaponry, as well as bone armor. In cases where pottery is present at ST-sites, it can be attributed to other local cultures, for example Koptyaki at the site Shaitanskoe Ozero II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The early history of the ST phenomenon is not well understood, however, based on the presence of tin and copper in metal alloys of ST objects, the Altai and Tian-Shan mountains have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Here, we present ancient human DNA data from a well-known, ST-associated site Rostovka (ROT), which is one of the very few ST sites with preserved human remains. The majority of the graves found at Rostovka contain bronze ST objects, bronze weapons and tools, casting molds, jewelry, bone knife handles, and armor plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In fact, the majority of Rostovka burials contain weapons, found in 60% of the female and 80% of the male burials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The radiocarbon dates for Rostovka, excluding extreme values, range between ca. 2200-2000 cal. BCE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This chronological horizon is simultaneous with the Okunevo culture, while its lower bound overlaps with the early Abashevo and Sintashta cultures, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">An identifying component in the genetic landscape of Northern Eurasia is a shared Siberian ancestry component, which is present in the genetic profiles of Finnish, Estonian, Saami-speaking, and indigenous Siberian populations today<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A previous ancient DNA study focusing on the Eastern Baltic found a genetic contribution from Siberia in the Iron Age but not in the Bronze Age, which was linked to the time of the arrival of Uralic languages to the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, the Y-haplogroup N1a1a1a1a (previously known as N3a), primarily found in present-day northern Eurasian and Uralic speaking groups, first appears in Europe in Early Metal Age individuals from the Bolshoy Oleni Ostrov site (BOO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, in northwestern Russia, together with evidence of high levels of genome-wide Siberian ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">We present new genome-wide data from two additional BOO individuals and shotgun data for five published individuals (including one high coverage genome of ∼31x).

We also investigate the demographic history of Northern Eurasia, especially in context of the Siberian genetic component. Together, we aim to provide an updated view on the genetic history and connections of populations of the forest-steppe and western Siberia, with an emphasis on the ST phenomenon in the context of metallurgical production.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P19">In this study, we report genome-wide SNP data for nine individuals from the ST site Rostovka, as well as additional new data for two BOO individuals (plus shotgun genome data for five already published individuals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We performed 1240k SNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and mitochondrial genome captures on the nine individuals from ROT, and the two new BOO individuals, as well as Y-chromosomal capture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> on just the males. Lastly, we generated shotgun sequence data for five published BOO individuals, including one 31.8x covered individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Of the newly analyzed individuals, eight ROT individuals were genetically male and one was female, while both new BOO individuals were female (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Biological relatedness analysis of the newly reported individuals was performed using READ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and lcMLkin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Based on these analyses, we identified a pair of second-degree relatives (ROT011 and ROT015), both of whom are males carrying the Y-haplogroup C2a, and could either represent a grandson/grandparent, a nephew/uncle pair or paternal half-siblings, consistent with overlapping radiocarbon dates for both individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A second-degree related pair was also found among the BOO individuals (BOO004-BOO005).</p><p id="P20">We also generated a radiocarbon date for individual BOO004, whose genome was shotgun sequenced to 31.8x coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The radiocarbon date (MAMS-57646) for this individual was determined to be 3351±25 BP, or 1735-1538 calBC (± 2σ) after calibration with OxCal 4.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, we did not correct for a potential freshwater reservoir effect, which may place BOO004 at a younger date.</p><sec id="S3"><title>General population genetic results</title><p id="P21">We used smartPCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of modern-day reference populations from Eurasia and the Americas, onto which the ROT and the BOO individuals were projected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and b</xref>). When assessing the genetic structure of Eurasian populations, plotting PC1 vs. PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) allows us to separate west and east Eurasian populations from the Native American groups, while plotting PC1 vs PC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) distinguishes the major Eurasian ecological zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Looking at the newly generated data, ST individuals spread widely on the Eurasian PCA (PC1 vs PC3), mainly throughout the so-called ‘forest-tundra’ genetic cline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) mirroring the distribution of the modern Uralic speakers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Based on an unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> of a reference set of published ancient data with K=7 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), the ROT individuals generally carry diverse ancestry components ranging between a genetic profile represented by the Western Steppe Middle Late Bronze Age cluster (Western_Steppe_MLBA, we use Sintashta_MLBA when modeling this ancestry going forward)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> - a combination of orange and dark and light blue colors - and that of the Late Neolithic/Bronze Age East Siberians (Eastern_Siberia_LNBA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> - red color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In comparison, the BOO individuals form a tighter and more homogeneous cluster that can be seen with both the PCA and the ADMIXTURE analyses, in line with what has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>F-statistics and qpAdm</title><p id="P22">We calculated various F-statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> to formally assess the relationship of the ROT and BOO individuals with each other, and with different modern and ancient reference individuals and populations. First, we performed outgroup f3-statistics of the form <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub> (Mbuti; test, modern) to test for the affinity of each ROT and BOO individual with modern Eurasian populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics results mirrored the distribution of the samples in the PCA and ADMIXTURE analyses, wherein the individuals with higher proportions of Eastern_Siberia_LNBA ancestry (e.g. ROT002) showed a greater affinity to the modern-day Siberian and Uralic-speaking populations, such as Nganasan, Evenk, Negidal, Nanai, and Ulchi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>), whereas the individuals with more Sintashta-like Western_Steppe_MLBA ancestry (e.g. ROT003) were closer to modern-day (North) Europeans, including Norwegian, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Scottish and Icelandic individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). Comparisons with ancient groups using <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>(Mbuti; test, published ancient) showed a similar trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). For example, ROT002 on the ‘eastern end’ of the Eurasian cline, had the highest observed <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-values, i.e. shared more genetic drift, with Eastern_Siberia_LNBA, Russia Ust Belaya Neolithic, and Mongolia Early Iron Age individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, ROT003, the ‘westernmost’ individual in the Eurasian PCA space, had the highest affinity with Lithuania early Middle Neolithic Narva, Russia Sintashta, Kazakhstan Georgievsky Middle Bronze Age, Russia Poltavka, and Serbia Mesolithic individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). Similar trends could be observed for the BOO, wherein the modern Uralic-speaking populations, such as Nganasan and Selkup, were among the models with the highest <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics. Among the ancient <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub> comparisons, the most closely related individuals to BOO were the Eastern European and West-Siberian hunter-gatherers (EEHG and WSHG), published BOO, and Botai Eneolithic individuals from Kazakhstan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6J and K</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Based on the geographic location of the sites, the results of the outgroup <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics, and the distribution of the ROT and BOO individuals on the PCA, we tested whether these individuals retained more local Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) ancestry compared to contemporaneous groups and individuals from the general region. To assess the genetic affinities of ROT and BOO to known populations from similar general geographic area, time period, and archaeological affiliation, we calculated <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics of the form <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>(X, <italic>test</italic>; WSHG, Mbuti) where X stood for ROT and BOO individuals, and <italic>test</italic> populations included Okunevo, Tarim_EMBA_1, Sintashta_MLBA, and Eastern_Siberia_LNBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This test allowed us to identify groups that are cladal with ROT and BOO (i.e., equidistantly related to WSHG), and cases wheere ROT and BOO may have additional affinity to ANE (represented here by WSHG from Tyumen oblast, Russia as the best spatial and temporal proxy). Based on the <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics, we find that ROT and BOO individuals carry excess affinity to ANE when compared to Eastern_Siberia_LNBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and Russia MLBA Sintashta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), except for ROT002 and ROT003. All BOO individuals are symmetrically related with the Okunevo Bronze Age group indicating no additional affinity to ANE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, we see more heterogeneity in ROT, with some individuals having significantly more, and others significantly less genetic affinity to WSHG compared to Okunevo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). All but one individual (ROT013) have significantly less ANE ancestry compared to Tarim EMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The general observations from <italic>f</italic><sub>4</sub>-statistics mirror the trends we see in the PCA, especially when PC1 is plotted against PC2, wherein ROT individuals vary with regards to their location on the ANE cline represented by Afontova Gora 3 and Mal’ta 1, while the BOO individuals are more homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The cultural affiliation of the BOO individuals remains poorly understood. Based on the archaeological information, such as the presence of ‘Waffle’ ware ceramics that are similar to the Neolithic pottery from Yakutia and Chukotka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, it was hypothesized that the BOO individuals represent a westward migration of Siberian populations along the forest-tundra and forest-steppe zones. However, potential contacts with Scandinavian archaeological cultures, such as Vardøy Ware, have been proposed for BOO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. To test this, we calculated pairwise <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>-statistics with different ancient populations from Scandinavia, which separated the BOO individuals, as well the ROT from the rest of the populations ranging between Mesolithic to Medieval time periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Together, these results suggest a non-local genetic origin for the BOO individuals, and no substantial levels of early farmer ancestry, consistent with PCA and admixture analyses.</p><p id="P25">Lastly, we performed qpAdm analysis to formally test for and quantify the admixture proportions in ROT and BOO individuals that we had identified in the previous analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Here, we could successfully model the ROT individuals as a mix of three ancestries, Eastern_Siberia_LNBA, Sintashta_MLBA, and WSHG, except for ROT002, which could be modeled instead as a two-source mixture of mainly Eastern_Siberia_LNBA ancestry and a smaller proportion of EEHG-like ancestry that could be represented by either Sintashta_MLBA, WSHG, or EEHG, whereas ROT003 could be modeled with Sintashta_MLBA as single source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We also tested whether ROT individuals could be modeled as a two-way mixture of the Eastern_Siberia_LNBA ancestry and either Sintashta_MLBA or WSHG as sources, however, this combination of ancestries did not result in consistently plausible model fits, compared to the combination of all three ancestries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). By contrast, BOO individuals could not be modeled using either the combination of all three ancestry sources (Eastern_Siberia_LNBA, Sintashta_MLBA, and WSHG), or just a two-way mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, replacing WSHG with EEHG as the putative local hunter-gatherer ancestry stratum and using Eastern_Siberia_LNBA as a second source provided good model fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We then estimated the date of the admixture event in BOO individuals between the EEHG and Eastern_Siberia_LNBA sources using DATES v.753<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

The findings from genome-wide autosomal data in PCA, ADMIXTURE and F-statistics are mirrored in the Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial data. Eight males of nine ROT individuals represent both eastern Eurasian and Western Eurasian Y-chromosomal lineages, and eastern and western Eurasian mitochondrial lineages, respectively, further highlighting the genetic heterogeneity seen in ROT. In general, the region of the Middle Irtysh around Rostovka can be characterized as the typological melting pot of the western and eastern part of the ST phenomenon mirroring in the genetic data.</p><p id="P39">On an individual level, there is no clear correlation between genetic ancestry of the screened individuals and the cultural/regional attribution of their grave goods. The inventory of the burial of individual ROT003 with western Eurasian genetic ancestry includes artifacts, which can be attributed to the eastern part of the ST phenomenon (forked lancehead with hook, trapezoidal socket axe) and there are regionally nonspecific ST-artifacts (lamellar dagger blades, forked lancehead with two loops), as well as ceramics of the Krotovo and Okunevo cultures. Artifacts with a connection to the Steppe-related cultures of the Transurals or the western part of the ST phenomenon are not present. The rather sparse burial of ROT002 does not stand out typologically in contrast to most other burials of the cemetery, despite the genetic attribution to the Eastern Siberian LNBA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">In case of BOO, we see a very homogeneous genetic profile that we can model as a recent mixture of the Neolithic Siberian and EEHG components approximately ∼2200-2000 BCE, which places this event at a similar time as the temporal peak of the ST phenomenon. Interestingly, despite the geographic location of the burial site on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, BOO individuals carry higher proportions of ‘eastern’ Siberian ancestry than most ROT individuals. The genetic homogeneity observed in BOO individuals can be explained by the genetic background relatedness as shown by IBD sharing and ROH analysis, which is indicative of a relatively small or isolated population.</p><p id="P41">We also find that BOO and ROT exhibit distinct genetic subtleties with regard to the presence of the Early European Farmer ancestry. Although relatively contemporaneous, ROT individuals, in general, carry higher levels of Neolithic farmer-related ancestry, which we were able to model as part of the Sintashta_MLBA in our admixture models.

However, due to the limited number of individuals studied, we cannot be certain as to what degree the individuals in this study represent the ST phenomenon as a whole. Genetic data from other confidently ST-associated sites will be crucial in providing a comparative analysis of the data.

We finally defined the ghost lineage for two source populations, with the same population size as their original branch, and modeled the Bolshoy lineage as the admixture of ghost lineages. When optimizing the final model, we got a series of similar likelihood results with recent admixture time and small population size in Bolshoy Oleni Ostrov lineage. We chose the final model whose admixture time matches the conclusion in DATES. To examine the stability of the parameters, we conducted 100 nonparametric bootstraps, fit the model for each bootstrap dataset using the parameter values of the final model as initial values, and computed the 95% confidence interval for each parameter. Each bootstrap dataset was created by dividing the whole genome into 100 equal-sized blocks and resampling the same number of blocks with replacement.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS188982-supplement-Supplementary_Information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d70aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS188982-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d70aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all members of the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the PALEoRIDER &amp; Population Genetics Group.
