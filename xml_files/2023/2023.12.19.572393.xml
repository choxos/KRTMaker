Several recent studies have underscored how non-conserved sequences can contribute to organismal diversification in the primate lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Actively transcribed, non-coding parts of the genome provide a potential platform for the development of new functional sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, but their biological and evolutionary roles remain largely unexplored. Here we show that a set of neutrally evolving long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) arising from small nucleolar RNA Host Genes (SNHGs) are highly expressed in skin and dysregulated in inflammatory conditions. SNHGs affect cell fate determination and can behave as evolutionary intermediates to develop new functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Using SNHG7 and human epidermal keratinocytes as a model, we describe a mechanism by which these lncRNAs can increase self-renewal and inhibit differentiation. SNHG7 lncRNA’s activity has been acquired recently in the primate lineage and depends on a short sequence required for microRNA binding. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of fast-evolving transcripts in normal and diseased epithelia, and inform on how poorly conserved, actively transcribed non-coding sequences can participate in the evolution of genomic functionality.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Advances in the annotation of the genome have yielded the unexpected finding that non-coding sequences are pervasively transcribed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. While this could imply widespread function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, some studies have highlighted that the emergence of non-functional and/or redundant sequences is, rather, a by-product of genomic evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To distinguish the functional from the non-functional part of the genome the most robust and most commonly used parameter is evolutionary conservation, which in fact is used as the defining characteristic of biological function in its narrower sense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, use of sequence conservation alone is not sufficient to capture the full extent of genome functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>; recent studies have highlighted how some poorly conserved genomic regions, either regulatory or transcribed, can play important roles in the development of new biological features, or contribute to the phenotypic diversity among species, particularly in the primate lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of transcripts that generally exhibit a lower degree of sequence conservation when compared to protein-coding or small non-coding RNA. Such conservation can be limited to only a portion of the sequence, to the intron/exon structure or simply to the gene’s position within the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In spite of this, several lncRNAs have been ascribed a wide variety of functions through many different mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. While we have accumulated considerable knowledge about the biological roles of a few non-coding RNAs, in most cases their function, if any, remains elusive.</p><p id="P4">Among the most evolutionarily dynamic tissues is the epidermis, a multi-layered epithelium predominantly composed of keratinocytes that forms the outermost surface of the body. The basal layer contains the epidermal stem cells that maintain the tissue and can either undergo cell division or begin a process of terminal differentiation, during which they migrate towards the surface of the skin, through the spinous and granular layers, and form the protective covering surface of the organism, the cornified layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Control of the equilibrium between self-renewal and differentiation of keratinocytes is essential for the correct maintenance and repair of the epidermis. Given its position as the interface with the external environment, it is perhaps unsurprising that the epidermis is a highly evolutionarily dynamic, adaptable tissue, as evidenced, for example, by the relatively high rate of amino-acid substitutions in epidermal proteins, underlying a diverse array of phenotypes between closely related species or even between different human populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. While some RNA regulators of cell fate have been described in the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, the contribution of non-coding parts of the genome to such evolutionary plasticity has received less attention.</p><p id="P5">Here, we have focussed on small nucleolar RNA Host Genes (SNHGs), a set of highly expressed, extremely poorly conserved lncRNAs whose levels are dysregulated in skin diseases. <sup>2017,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> By using primary human epidermal keratinocytes as a well-established model, we demonstrate the function of SNHGs in regulating the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, comparison of SNHG activity in keratinocytes from multiple mammalian species across different evolutionary distances, provides insights into how new functions can be acquired by the genome.</p><sec id="S2"><title>SNHGs are a class of poorly conserved, highly expressed long non-coding RNAs that can affect keratinocyte fate</title><p id="P6">The functional contribution of the major evolutionary conserved signalling pathways in normal and diseased epidermis has undergone extensive investigation. Conversely, the biological role of less conserved transcripts has remained less studied, even though they can be strongly expressed in normal tissue and altered in skin diseases. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> To identify potentially functional poorly conserved transcripts in the epidermis, we analysed keratinocyte single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. We compared cells form unaffected skin with matched atopic dermatitis and psoriasis lesions and estimated the conservation of significantly differentially expressed genes using average PhastCons scores from multiple alignments of 100 vertebrate genomes. While many of the affected transcripts were highly conserved, coding genes, we were able to identify several very poorly conserved transcripts that were altered in one or both pathological states. As the degree of conservation decreased, we could see an increasing number of lncRNA species, among which we noticed several relatively highly expressed SNHGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>), a class of lncRNA that contain small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) within their introns.</p><p id="P7">Generally, lncRNAs are expressed at low levels. However, in the case of SNHGs, the production of the abundant intronic snoRNAs requires transcription of the host gene. Indeed, when compared to other transcript classes genome-wide, SNHGs peculiarly display a very low degree of conservation, even relative to other lncRNA (FigS1A), yet retain a level of expression in the same range as most protein-coding genes, as evaluated by using the GTEx scores from data generated by the Gene-Tissue Expression project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>, Fig. S1B). In addition, there is variation in the expression of SNHGs across tissues, which suggests some degree of regulation of their abundance (Fig. S3). We also assessed the rate at which SNHG lncRNAs are evolving. We used PhyloP scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to gauge what percentages of the exonic sequence of each SNHG are under purifying selection (PhyloP &gt; 2), are evolving neutrally (-2 ≤ PhyloP ≤ 2) or are experiencing an accelerated rate of change (PhyloP &lt; -2). As expected, conserved nucleotides make up a very small fraction of each transcript and while in some cases evidence of accelerated evolution can be observed in up to 8% of base pairs, the vast majority of the sequence of SNHG lncRNAs is evolving neutrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As dermatitic and psoriatic lesions are characterised by an imbalance balance between self-renewal and differentiation of epidermal cells, we sought to understand if SNHGs could be involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation in normal tissue. We clustered scRNAseq data of keratinocytes from healthy skin donors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> into different states corresponding to stages of differentiation, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found 13 SNHGs expressed at various levels at multiple differentiation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We selected the five most highly expressed keratinocyte SNHGs whose expression was also significantly changed in AD or psoriasis (SNHG7, 8, 12, 15, and 19, Fig S2) for further investigation. Expression of these SNHGs could be detected across all clusters, although some enrichment was seen in keratinocytes transitioning from basal to more differentiated cell states, with different SNHGs having maximal expression in either of the two transition states or in certain spinous clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A variety of signalling pathways participate in regulating the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The variation in expression among SNHGs during differentiation suggests that they might be under the control of different pathways. Indeed, treatment with a panel of pathway inhibitors had differential effects on the expression of each SNHG as quantified by qPCR. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/RACα serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) pathway increased the levels of SNHG7 and SNHG8, and the latter was also significantly increased after Protein Kinase C or translation inhibition. SNHG12 levels increased upon Focal Adhesion Kinase inhibition, but decreased when the mitogen-activated kinase MEK was blocked. SNHG15 levels decreased in response to Akt or MEK inhibition, while levels of SNHG19 were reduced when the cells were treated with inhibitors of Akt or translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, Fig. S4).</p><p id="P10">In light of these results, we tested whether the presence of SNHG transcripts might have any functional relevance. We used siRNA to knock down each of five highly expressed SNHGs in primary human keratinocytes and performed a clonogenicity assay as a readout of their self-renewal potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Remarkably, a reduction in the expression levels of any of the SNHGs caused a significant decrease in clonogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>; Fig. S5), indicating that neutrally evolving non-coding transcripts arising from snoRNA host genes can affect the balance between self-renewal and proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>SNHG7 lncRNA promotes self-renewal and prevents differentiation of keratinocytes</title><p id="P11">Next, we focused on SNHG7 since it is highly expressed in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, Fig. S3), its expression is significantly changed in both AD and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-B</xref>), it strongly regulates clonogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), and its gene structure is relatively simple: SNHG7 encodes only two alternative lncRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, each about ∼1 kb, and contains two H/ACA box snoRNA genes, SNORA17A and SNORA17B, within its introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">The modulation of SNHG7 lncRNA transcription is linked to the expression of the snoRNAs hosted in its introns. Our screen of pathway inhibitors showed that SNHG7 was markedly upregulated upon PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, Fig. S4). Intriguingly, this was not mirrored by the levels of a snoRNA hosted by SNHG7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). When we inhibited transcription with Actinomycin D before blocking PI3K, a significant increase of SNHG7 could still be detected, while the transcription-dependent, PI3K-mediated up-regulation of ERBB3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> was completely prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, Fig. S6A). These results point to the presence of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for the lncRNA, allowing its expression to be decoupled from the snoRNA.</p><p id="P13">In vivo, SNHG7 was present in scattered cells throughout the living layers of human epidermis, with higher expression in the basal and spinous layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) as shown by single-molecule RNA fluorescence <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridisation (smRNA FISH), and in agreement with our scRNAseq analysis. In non-homeostatic conditions, we observed alterations in SNHG7 lncRNA levels. SmRNA FISH of AD lesions showed an increase in SNHG7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), which was consistent with scRNAseq from AD patients.</p><p id="P14">To experimentally demonstrate the modulation of SNHG7 in non-homeostatic conditions, we used <italic>ex vivo</italic> wounding of human skin explants. The re-epithelialising keratinocytes exhibited increased levels of SNHG7 lncRNA, including more prominent expression in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). This supports the idea that SNHG7 participates in the regulation of the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in the context of epidermal repair. Our results also indicate that keratinocyte SNHG7 expression can increase in response to perturbation of homeostasis in the absence of circulating immune cells.</p><p id="P15">To further characterise the reduction in clonogenicity observed upon down-regulation of SNHG7 we stained keratinocytes with antibodies to the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the differentiation marker Involucrin (IVL). We observed a reduced rate of proliferation and an increased percentage of differentiated cells upon SNHG7 knockdown. The induction of differentiation was confirmed by the increase in mRNA levels of a range of differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Knockdown cells also displayed a reduced ability to form an epidermis on de-epidermised dermal substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Off-target effects were excluded by deconvolution of the siRNA pools used in our experiments (Fig. S6B-D). The effects of SNHG7 knockdown were not due to induction of apoptosis since there was no increase in the number of cells expressing cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. S6E).</p><p id="P16">We also ruled out any potential contribution of the snoRNA genes hosted within SNHG7 to the knockdown phenotype. Firstly, no reduction in protein translation as assessed by the OP-Puro assay was seen in knockdown cells (Fig. S6F). Secondly, consistent with the post-transcriptional nature of RNA interference, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SNHG7 only affected the exonic portion of the gene (Fig. S6G). We further demonstrated that the effects we observed were due to the deficiency in SNHG7 lncRNA by overexpressing its spliced form (NR_024542). Since the siRNA is able to target both the endogenous and the exogenous lncRNA we first identified the minimum siRNA concentration necessary to see a clear phenotype (Fig. S6H). Overexpression of SNHG7 lncRNA led to a nearly complete rescue of the knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, Fig. S6I-K).</p><p id="P17">Overexpression of SNHG7 caused a significant increase in clonogenic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). This, together with the high levels of expression of SNHG7 during keratinocyte commitment and early differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), prompted us to investigate whether SNHG7 might affect suspension-induced differentiation of disaggregated human keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. While we did observe a more rapid induction of the pro-commitment phosphatase DUSP6 upon SNHG7 knockdown (Fig. S6L), the kinetics of differentiation in suspension were largely unchanged. In addition, overexpression of SNHG7 did not prevent the loss of colony forming ability with time in suspension (Fig. S6M). These results indicate that SNHG7 influences the propensity of keratinocytes to undergo self-renewal, but its activity can be overridden by the strong differentiation stimulus of detachment from the extracellular matrix.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SNHG7 function has evolved recently in the primate lineage</title><p id="P18">The low sequence conservation of SNHGs raises the possibility that their effects on the regulation of cellular fate can be acquired over relatively short evolutionary timescales. However, cases have been described of lncRNA which maintained their function across large evolutionary distances, in the absence of widespread sequence conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In order to distinguish between these alternative scenarios, we assessed the biological activity of SNHG7 in night monkey (<italic>Aotus trivirgatus</italic>) and mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) primary keratinocytes. Given the absence of genomic sequence information for <italic>A. trivirgatus</italic>, we first performed 5’ and 3’ Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) followed by sequencing of the SNHG7 lncRNA isolated from the night monkey cells. We could identify at least two transcripts (Supplementary Data 1), both of which displayed relatively high sequence similarity to the human lncRNA in their 3’ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; Supplementary Data 2-3). Conversely, the murine Snhg7 sequence retains little homology to the human lncRNA throughout its sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; Supplementary Data 4). Inhibition of PI3K increased the levels of SNHG7 in night monkey cells, as in human, while it did not affect its expression in mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Although SNHG7 expression in night monkey cells was regulated by PI3K, the colony formation ability of night monkey and mouse keratinocytes was not affected by SNHG7 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>; Fig. S7A-B). This indicates a rapid acquisition of functionality to accompany the variation in sequence. We therefore sought to investigate whether human SNHG7 was sufficient to affect the proliferation/differentiation balance in non-human keratinocytes. To this end, we stably overexpressed the human SNHG7 lncRNA in night monkey and mouse keratinocytes. Human SNHG7 lncRNA was able to increase the colony forming capacity of night monkey keratinocytes but had no effect on the mouse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>; Fig. S7B-C).</p><p id="P20">Our data therefore points to the presence of elements in the human SNHG7 sequence that are able to influence cell fate, whose efficacy however appears conditional to the presence of additional factors or conditions within their cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Presence of microRNA response elements affects SNHG7 activity</title><p id="P21">Next, we characterised the molecular mechanism of SNHG7’s action. RNAseq of primary human keratinocytes at 24 and 48 h after SNHG7 knockdown (Fig. S8A) revealed that the differentially regulated genes were predominantly involved in control of proliferation, cell motility and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>; Supplementary Tables 1-2). Already 24 h after transfection, the differentially expressed genes exhibited a notable bias towards downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that SNHG7 might be a miRNA regulator, as reported in cancer settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Importantly, the changes in gene expression occurred before cells upregulated differentiation-associated genes (Fig. S8B).</p><p id="P22">Analysis of the intracellular distribution of SNHG7 showed a predominantly cytosolic location, similar to mRNAs and compatible with the ability to bind miRNAs (Fig. S8C). To identify which microRNAs could be involved in the biological activity of SNHG7, we uploaded the list of significantly downregulated genes 24 h after transfection into MIENTURNET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and scanned for significant enrichment of miRNA targets based on validated miRNA-target interactions from MirTarBase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). The same analysis was also performed for genes significantly downregulated after 48 h (Fig. S8D; Supplementary Table 3). Among the ten most significantly enriched miRNAs, six have the potential to bind to SNHG7. miR-34a-5p and miR-193b-3p have “canonical” miRNA-response elements (MRE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> within the sequence of SNHG7, miR-124-3p can form a non-canonical type of binding that has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, miR-16-5p, miR-484 and miR-615-3p can potentially form 6-mer “marginal” pairing with SNHG7. Although this latter type of binding is less likely to be conducive to regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> miR-16-5p targeted the highest number of downregulated genes at both 24 h and 48 h post transfection.</p><p id="P23">To further investigate the interplay between SNHG7 and miR-16-5p, miR-34-5p, miR-124-3p and miR-193-3p, we performed pathway enrichment analysis of significantly downregulated genes targeted by each miRNA against the Reactome database at 24 h post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>; Supplementary Table 4). miR-34a-5p and miR-193b-3p targets were predominantly associated with cell cycle and proliferation, while miR-16-5p and miR-124-3p were more associated with signalling and cellular stress. Since the SNHG7 knockdown phenotype is related to the balance between proliferation and differentiation, we further narrowed down our pool of candidates to mir-34a-5p and miR-193b-3p. Looking at the distribution of all predicted targets for these two miRNA families confirmed a significant shift towards downregulation for both miRNAs (FigureS7E). SmRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation showed that both of these miRNAs are expressed in keratinocytes (Fig. S8F). While the activity of the miR-34-5p family of miRNA in epidermal cells has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, the effect of miR-193-3p on keratinocytes is not known. Consistent with the SNHG7 phenotype, transfection of either miR-34a-5p or miR-193b-3p caused a marked reduction in keratinocyte proliferation, accompanied by a significant increase in differentiation in the case of the miR-193b-3p mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In support of the potential for miRNA-based regulation, analysis of published Ago-CLIP datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> showed the presence of peaks of Argonaute binding on the SNHG7 lncRNA transcript overlapping with the MREs for miR-193-3p and miR-34-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). To verify the binding between SNHG7 and the miRNAs, we transfected the cells with biotinylated versions of miR-193b-3p and miR-34a-5p and a control miRNA for which no MRE is present on SNHG7 (miR-21-5p), then performed streptavidin mediated pulldown followed by qPCR. Both miRNAs, but not the negative controls, were able to co-precipitate SNHG7 at higher levels than a negative control gene (ATP5B) and compatible with positive control target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>; Fig. S8G).</p><p id="P25">We also checked whether the miRNA levels increased after SNHG7 was downregulated, as this could indicate that SNHG7 could operate via Target-Directed miRNA Degradation (TDMD) by SNHG7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. However, we observed no consistent increase of either miR-34a-5p or miR-193b-3p 48 h after transfection (Fig. S8H).</p><p id="P26">Next, we sought to confirm whether either miRNA could contribute to the biological activity of SNHG7. The night monkey SNHG7 does not contain MREs for either of the candidate miRNA families. We thus used night monkey keratinocytes as a null background to assess the activity of human SNHG7 carrying mutations in either the miR-193-3p or miR-34-5p MREs, as well as a control mutation of similar size in the central region of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>; Fig. S9A). Stable transfection of miR-193 or control mutant human SNHG7 in night monkey keratinocytes increased their clonogenic potential similar to the wild-type human transcript. However, mutation of the miR-34 MREs abolished the activity of the exogenous transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; Fig. S9B).</p><p id="P27">Expression of the wild-type SNHG7 lncRNA was able to rescue the knockdown phenotype in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). Conversely, expression of the miR-34 MRE mutant was unable to produce any attenuation of the effects of SNHG7 knockdown in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>; Fig. S9C), further indicating a role for the miR-34-5p MRE in SNHG7 biological activity. Our results thus indicate that SNHG7 regulates clonogenicity at least partially through a miR-34-5p response element and therefore that rapidly evolving, short elements in highly expressed non-coding RNA can confer or contribute to the acquisition of new functions over short evolutionary distances.</p><p id="P28">Short elements such as MREs can potentially arise and disappear rapidly during evolution. In fact, assuming a uniform base frequency and in the absence of selection, a MRE matching any deeply conserved miRNA could potentially occur by chance every ∼150 bp. In the case of SNHG7, the functional MRE has emerged recently. However, if other SNHGs could function in this way, one would expect to see a range of sequence conservation among MREs in their sequence. To evaluate this, we used the TargetScan 7 pipeline to identify and score the conservation of MREs in SNHG lncRNA sequences (Supplementary Table 5). For this analysis, we only considered broadly conserved miRNA families and only 7-mer and 8-mer MREs. Additionally, we excluded SNHGs that had significant overlap with protein-coding genes and transcripts that had exons overlapping the snoRNAs, as this would introduce a conservation bias. The majority of the sites we identified were shared only among primates, although about a quarter were conserved more deeply (Fig. S9D) and a few passed the TargetScan conservation thresholds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting that in some cases they can become selected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">In this study, we have identified a group of SNHGs, a class of highly expressed, poorly conserved non-coding genes, that have a pronounced effect on cell fate decisions in human keratinocytes. SNHGs are a known but understudied class of transcripts: they have been reported to possess biological activity in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, but only relatively few studies have explored their role in adult tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The epidermal expression of SNHGs can be controlled by specific signalling pathways; their levels vary during the early phases of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, and they are significantly altered in certain skin inflammatory conditions and during wound healing. Knockdown of several of the SNHGs in primary human keratinocytes led to a strong reduction in self-renewal capability. This result is consistent with an early report on the activity of another SNHG (DANCR) in the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>; however, this gene did not appear in the scRNAseq dataset we analysed. Our data thus paints a picture in which the interplay among multiple signalling pathways affects the levels of several neutrally evolving, non-coding transcripts that influence whether a cell undergoes self-renewal or initiates differentiation and potentially also contribute to stress responses or pathological phenotypes.</p><p id="P30">In the case of SNHG7, the effect on cell fate determination was acquired recently in the primate lineage. Xenotopic expression of the human transcript could moderately increase the clonogenic capacity of night monkey keratinocytes but did not affect mouse epidermal cells. This differential effect on evolutionarily more distantly related species suggests that SNHG7 activity relies on the presence of context-specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are present in the monkey cells but absent in the mouse. It is also interesting to note how expression of the human transcript in the monkey cells had a similar effect to the overexpression of the transcript in human keratinocytes; however, unlike human, <italic>A. trivirgatus</italic> cells were not dependent on SNHG7 to fully maintain their ability to self-renew in culture conditions. This indicates that highly expressed, neutrally evolving non-coding transcripts can exhibit a remarkably dynamic functional evolution.</p><p id="P31">The capacity of SNHG7 to influence keratinocyte fate determination was at least partially dependent on the presence of MREs for a specific miRNA family, miR-34-5p. Regulation of gene expression by competition for the binding of miRNAs has been widely described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>; however, its effectiveness is severely constrained by strict stoichiometric and biochemical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Despite this, several instances have been reported where non-coding RNAs of different types can effectively act as sponges for miRNA, mostly in cancer settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> but also in the regulation of neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and muscle differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. miR-34-5p is known to regulate keratinocyte differentiation in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, human SNHG7 was ineffectual in regulating cell fate in cells from this species, suggesting that additional agents or conditions are involved in its activity. It should also be noted that we cannot exclude the potential contribution of other, miRNA-independent, molecular mechanisms to the action of SNHG7. A full dissection of SNHG7-interacting molecules and detailed investigation of the biochemistry involved in its biological activity will be required to fully understand how it operates.</p><p id="P32">The expression of intronic snoRNAs, which do not possess their own promoters, is dependent on the transcription of the gene within which they reside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This implies that in the case of SNHGs, non-coding transcripts retain some selective pressure to be transcribed because of the presence of the snoRNA. The necessity of their transcription for snoRNA production and the lack of strong sequence constraints deriving from the need to code for protein thus potentially optimally places SNHG lncRNAs to function as substrates for the evolution of new functional genetic elements or structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Indeed, the absence of SNHG7 activity on the self-renewal/differentiation balance in species where its sequence does not include the MRE for miR-34-5p makes it a paradigmatic example of an “evolutionary spandrel”: a transcript whose presence is a by-product of the expression of a separate RNA species (in this case two snoRNAs) and whose sequence is able to neutrally accumulate mutations and act as hotspots for the acquisition of new effects, which can then be subject to the action of drift or selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">The reliance of the biological effect of SNHG lncRNAs on short MREs together with their remarkably low sequence conservation suggests that the fine-tuning of cell fate decisions and potentially other cellular phenotypes could be influenced by the rapid emergence of these genetic elements in abundant transcripts lacking strong constraints on sequence conservation. Due to the short length of MREs, the emergence of sequences with the potential to confer new functions is likely to occur relatively frequently. Most of the MREs, however, would probably be non-functional because (1) not all SNHGs are likely to operate through the same molecular mechanism, and (2) the additional limitations imposed by the context-dependent factors that limit the effectiveness of miRNA sequestration are likely to constrain the intensity and the spread of the effects of SNHGs. We speculate that upon emergence these effects are unlikely to be very strong or ubiquitous, because an excessively penetrant new property would probably be selected against. This is in fact corroborated by the noticeable but relatively limited magnitude of the effect that human SNHG7 expression has on night monkey keratinocytes.</p><p id="P34">Our data are consistent with a model in which new, limited-scope effects can emerge out of highly expressed, poorly conserved transcripts over brief evolutionary periods and contribute, for example, to the fine-tuning of the balance between proliferation and differentiation in adult tissues. Our findings experimentally corroborate the constructive neutral evolution theory and highlight the potential role played by neutrally evolving sequences in the evolution of new genomic functions in the primate lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.
