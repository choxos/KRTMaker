When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined, particularly since no stress sensitivity has been reported in deletion mutants. We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for oxidant tolerance and act to sequestering misfolded proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure. We have used the Sup35 translation termination factor as a model oxidized protein to show that protein aggregation is elevated and widespread in mutants lacking Btn2 and Hsp42. Oxidant-induced prion formation is also elevated in sequestrase mutants consistent with the idea that Btn2 and Hsp42 function to sequester oxidatively damaged Sup35, thus preventing templating to form its heritable prion form. Taken together, our data identify protein sequestration as key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteostasis is maintained by an arsenal of molecular chaperones that are able to detect non-native, misfolded proteins and act upon them to prevent aggregation or to mitigate their toxic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hartl <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). This means that misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade these quality control systems, they form aggregates that are implicated in a number of protein misfolding diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hipp <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). More recently, the organized sequestration of misfolded proteins to defined inclusion sites has been recognized as a regulated process that depends on dedicated molecular chaperones, termed sequestrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mogk &amp; Bukau, 2017</xref>). The sequestration of misfolded proteins into intracellular deposit sites helps cells to cope with an accumulation of misfolded proteins by partitioning them away from their normal productive pathways, protecting against potential cytotoxic effects and by facilitating targeted degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gallardo <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Although aggregation is a well-studied phenomenon and many key players are known, it remains unclear exactly how different growth and stress conditions cause protein aggregation and the degree of stress specificity in the chaperone response to aggregate formation is unknown.</p><p id="P3">The spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins is a highly conserved protein quality control (PQC) strategy, but the subcellular localization of deposition sites differs between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Iburg <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ogrodnik <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The yeast model is currently the best characterized system relating to stress-induced protein aggregation where extensive genetic and cell biological analyses exist. Proteotoxic stress causes the formation of spatially separated protein deposits including IPOD (Insoluble Protein Deposit), CytoQ (cytosolic quality control compartment, Q bodies) and INQ (intranuclear quality control compartment, JUNQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Escusa-Toret <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mogk &amp; Bukau, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rothe <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sontag <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Specht <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Following protein misfolding, multiple CyoQs are formed in the cytoplasm, which are resolved into other deposition sites including INQ and IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Cytosolic IPOD, CytoQ and nuclear INQ are thought to represent independent aggregate deposits which protect against overloading the proteostasis machinery during protein misfolding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Proteins targeted to CytoQ and INQ can undergo refolding, whereas terminally misfolded and amyloid aggregates are thought to be targeted to the IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>)</p><p id="P4">Hsp42 and Btn2 are two key sequestrases required for the deposition of misfolded proteins into CytoQ and INQ, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Specht <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The cytosolic Hsp42 is a member of the small heat-shock family (sHSP) of chaperones and contains a prion-like domain (PrLD) that is essential for its aggregase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Grousl <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Like other members of the conserved sHSP family, Hsp42 forms a large homo-oligomeric structure and contains a highly conserved alpha-crystallin domain. Mutations in human sHSPs have been linked to various cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases and hereditary cataracts. Hsp42 has been shown to direct protein sequestration to CytoQ during heat stress conditions using model fluorescently misfolded reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Grousl <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Specht <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The nuclear equivalent Btn2 is a small heat shock-like protein that is essential for INQ formation. Its protein levels are strongly induced by heat stress, and it functions in recruiting Hsp70/Hsp100 disaggregases for refolding of sequestered proteins during stress recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Btn2 has been shown to form high-molecular-weight complexes reminiscent of sHsp oligomers and similarly exhibits chaperone activity by associating with misfolded reporter proteins to increase their reactivation by Hsp70-Hsp100 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Yeast Btn2 has similarity to Hook1, a coiled-coil protein that associates with the cytoskeleton in mammalian cells. Its name derives from the finding that it is upregulated in response to loss of <italic>BTN1</italic>, which encodes an ortholog of a human Batten disease protein implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and early death.</p><p id="P5">Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 as cellular sequestrases, their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive, especially since no growth defects have been observed in deletion mutants including a lack of sensitivity to heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Haslbeck <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). In this current study we have investigated the roles of the Hsp42 and Btn2 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shenton &amp; Grant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Weids <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). We show that the levels of protein oxidative damage formed in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants, but protein aggregation is elevated suggesting that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cells antioxidant defence system. In agreement with this idea, we show that <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress implicating a functional role for protein sequestration in oxidant tolerance. Together, our data show that the Btn2 and hsp42 sequestrases act to protect against widespread amorphous and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress</title><p id="P6">Given the lack of sensitivity of sequestrase mutants to heat stress conditions, we examined whether Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress, as another stress condition that causes protein misfolding and aggregation. For these experiments we used single <italic>hsp42</italic> and <italic>btn2</italic> mutants as well as a double <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant. We first confirmed that mutants lacking <italic>BTN2</italic> or <italic>HSP42</italic> are unaffected in temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>btn2</italic> and <italic>hsp42</italic> mutants were sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and the double <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant showed strong sensitivity implicating a functional requirement for these chaperones during oxidative stress conditions. We also found that <italic>btn2</italic> and <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> double mutants grow poorly under respiratory growth conditions suggesting a sensitivity to endogenously generated ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cur1 is the yeast paralog of Btn2 but is not required for INQ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We examined the oxidant sensitivity of <italic>cur1</italic> and <italic>btn2 cur1</italic> mutants but found that loss of <italic>CUR1</italic> does not affect oxidant tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The rest of this manuscript therefore focusses on the requirement for Btn2 and Hsp42 during oxidative stress conditions.</p><p id="P7">Despite not being required for heat tolerance, Btn2 and Hsp42 protein levels are increased in response to heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Since we found that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to promote oxidant tolerance, we tested whether their expression levels are also increased in response to oxidative stress conditions. However, no increases in Btn2 or Hsp42 protein levels were observed in response to hydrogen peroxide stress suggesting that the basal levels of these sequestrases are sufficient to promote oxidant tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In comparison, Btn2 and Hsp42 expression levels were strongly induced in response to a 37°C heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Increased protein oxidation does not account for the sensitivity of sequestrase mutants to oxidative stress</title><p id="P8">One possibility to explain the oxidant sensitivity of the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> double mutant is that protein oxidation is increased in sequestrase mutants. We examined protein carbonylation as a commonly used marker of protein oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Nystrom, 2005</xref>). Carbonyl groups on proteins can be detected by immunoblot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the carbonyl-specific probe DNPH. Using this assay, we found that protein carbonylation is elevated by approximately 50% in a wild-type strain in response to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The basal levels of protein carbonylation were increased in the <italic>btn2, hsp42</italic> and <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants during normal growth conditions. However, no further increase in protein oxidation was detected in sequestrase mutants compared with the wild-type strain during oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These data indicate that whilst protein oxidation is elevated in sequestrase mutants during non-stress conditions, elevated levels of oxidatively damaged proteins do not appear to accumulate in sequestrase mutants that might explain the sensitivity of the double <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant to oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Oxidative stress-induced protein aggregation is increased in sequestrase mutants</title><p id="P9">We next examined whether protein aggregation is altered in sequestrase mutants to explain their sensitivity to oxidative stress. Hsp104 is the main cellular disaggregase that mediates refolding from the aggregated state and can be used to visualize the sites of protein aggregate formation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Erjavec <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Glover &amp; Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hamdan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that Hsp42 and Btn2-mediated sequestration might normally act to triage oxidized proteins and their absence would therefore lead to an accumulation of protein aggregates in <italic>hsp42 btn2</italic> mutants. Approximately 15% of wild-type cells were found to contain visible Hsp104-puncta during normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Protein aggregation was significantly increased in response to oxidative stress with greater than 30% of cells containing protein aggregates following exposure to hydrogen peroxide. The number of cells containing Hsp104-marked aggregates was increased in all sequestrase mutants (<italic>btn2, hsp42, btn2 hsp42</italic>) during non-stress conditions. For the <italic>hsp42</italic> and <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants, protein aggregation was further increased in response to oxidative stress compared with the wild-type during oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This was particularly apparent for the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant strains where 30% cells contained multiple Hsp104-marked aggregates.</p><p id="P10">Given the increase in Hsp104-marked aggregates, we examined the cellular concentrations of Hsp104 to determine whether the increased puncta formation observed in sequestrase mutants correlates with increased expression of Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, the cellular concentrations of Hsp104 were comparable in all strains during both non-stress and oxidative stress conditions suggesting that the increased Hsp104 puncta formation arises due to re-localization of existing pools of Hsp104 in sequestrase mutants rather than through new chaperone synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Btn2 and hsp42 co-localize with Hsp104-marked protein aggregates following oxidative stress conditions</title><p id="P11">Hsp104 has been variously localized to INQ, CytoQ and IPOD following heat-induced-protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Specht <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Given the increase in Hsp104-marked protein aggregates following oxidative stress, we examined whether the co-localization of Hsp104 with Btn2 or Hsp42 is affected during these conditions. If Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to triage oxidatively damaged proteins, we reasoned that Hsp104-marked aggregates would co-localize with these sequestrases. For these experiments we expressed Hsp104-RFP in wild-type strains that express Btn2-GFP or Hsp42-GFP. Co-localization of both Hsp42 and Btn2 was observed with Hsp104 during normal non-stress conditions, and this was significantly increased following hydrogen peroxide exposure for both sequestrases suggesting that Btn2 and Hsp42 play a role in triaging aggregated proteins formed during oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Overexpression of Hsp104 rescues the oxidant sensitivity of sequestrase mutants</title><p id="P12">Since Hsp104 appears to be required to protect against protein aggregation during the response to oxidative stress, but its cellular concentrations remain unaltered during these stress conditions, we hypothesised that Hsp104 may become limiting in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants.

Whilst overexpression of <italic>HSP104</italic> did not improve the hydrogen peroxide tolerance of the wild-type strain, the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant was improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that Hsp104 can become limiting in sequestrase mutant during oxidative stress conditions that promote protein misfolding and aggregation.</p><p id="P13">To further confirm that overexpression of Hsp104 rescues the oxidant sensitivity of <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants by protecting against the toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation in the absence of sequestrase activity, we directly examined protein aggregation in wild-type and sequestrase mutants. Insoluble protein aggregates were separated from soluble proteins by differential centrifugation and any contaminating membrane proteins removed by detergent washes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hamdan <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Weids &amp; Grant, 2014</xref>). Low levels of protein aggregation were detected in the wild-type strain during non-stress conditions which were increased in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Protein aggregation was decreased by overexpression of Hsp104 under both non-stress and oxidative stress conditions consistent with the function of hsp104 as a disaggregase. Protein aggregation was strongly increased in the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant and again Hsp104 overexpression reduced the cellular levels of protein aggregation. Hsp104 overexpression also appeared to cause alterations in the protein aggregates detected in the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant particularly under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Western blotting was used to confirm that Hsp104 is similarly overexpressed in wild-type and <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to protect against protein aggregation caused by oxidative stress conditions in a mechanism that requires the Hsp104 disaggregase.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Sup35 localizes with Btn2 and Hsp42 during non-stress and oxidative stress conditions</title><p id="P14">Most studies that have examined protein misfolding and aggregation in sequestrase mutants have relied on model PQC reporter substrates and little is known regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of these chaperones. We decided to examine aggregation of the Sup35 eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) in sequestrase mutants as a potential chaperone substrate. This is because hydrogen peroxide exposure has been shown to cause extensive aggregation of Sup35 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jamar <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2018</xref>).

Additionally, overexpression of <italic>NM</italic>-<italic>SUP35</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> (a fusion between the N-terminal prion domain (PrD) and the middle M domain of Sup35 with GFP) has been shown to result in the formation of multiple Sup35-marked puncta where a single puncta commonly co-localizes with Hsp42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arslan <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>).

During non-stress conditions, approximately 40% of cells contained visible Sup35 puncta, and the number of puncta was increased in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).

Btn2 and Hsp42 colocalized with approximately 35% and 15% of Sup35 puncta, respectively, during both non-stress and oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This suggests that the extent of colocalization of Sup35 with Btn2 and Hsp42 is maintained during oxidative stress conditions along with the increase in Sup35, Btn2 and Hsp42 puncta.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Oxidant-induced prion formation is increased in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> sequestrase mutants</title><p id="P16">We next examined [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion formation as a measure of amyloidogenic aggregation in sequestrase mutants.

The PrD mutant of Sup35 (<italic>ΔN-SUP35-GFP</italic>) is sufficient to maintain viability but is deficient in prion propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Vishveshwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).

In contrast, loss of the PrD significantly decreased Sup35 puncta formation in the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant indicating that the increased puncta formation in this mutant requires the PrD.

ROS have frequently been implicated in protein oxidative damage and partially misfolded proteins are known to be more susceptible to oxidation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dean <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Newly synthesized proteins are particularly vulnerable to misfolding events and widespread aggregation is thought to be toxic, especially when the proteostasis network is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Weids &amp; Grant, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Winkler <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Protein aggregation is often accompanied by an increase in oxidative damage to cells and in many aggregation diseases, oxidative stress is an integral part of the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hands <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Not surprisingly therefore, enzymes with antioxidant activity have been extensively linked with protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ling <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">MacDiarmid <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rand &amp; Grant, 2006</xref>). Despite these established links between oxidative stress and protein aggregation, surprisingly little is known regarding the requirement for chaperones to mitigate the toxic effects of oxidative stress. Our data identify the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases as key chaperones required for oxidant tolerance that are required to sequester misfolded proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure.</p><p id="P27">The proper sequestration of aggregates is an important defence strategy that prevents the dysfunction and toxicity that is associated with protein misfolding diseases. Hsp42 has been shown to direct protein sequestration to CytoQ during heat stress conditions, whereas Btn2 is a small heat shock-like protein that is essential for INQ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Grousl <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malinovska <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Specht <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 in protein sequestration during heat stress, their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive since they are not required for heat tolerance. Growth defects have been observed in mutants lacking the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases by genetically limiting the capacity of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This suggests that sequestering unfolded proteins into defined deposit sites prevents titrating Hsp70 away from its essential chaperone functions in protein folding. The induction of Btn2 and Hsp42 expression in Hsp70 mutants may therefore act to counter limitations in Hsp70 capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The finding that mutants lacking Btn2 and Hsp42 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress, but not heat stress, suggests a more direct functional requirement for these sequestrases during stress conditions that promote protein oxidation.</p><p id="P28">Hydrogen peroxide stress is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shenton &amp; Grant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Weids <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). All amino acids in proteins are potential targets of oxidation. They can be directly damaged on amino acid sidechains and backbone sites as well as through targeted oxidation of specific residues such as cysteine and methionine in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Davies, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dean <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Such modifications can significantly alter protein structure by affecting side-chain hydrophobicity, protein folding and amino acid interactions, often resulting in unfolding and protein aggregation. This contrasts with heat stress which is a well-characterized denaturing stress that causes protein unfolding and is generally reversible at non-extreme temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Vabulas <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Wallace <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the mechanistic differences in protein misfolding and aggregation caused by heat and oxidative stress accounts for the differential requirements for sequestrases during different stress conditions. The irreversible nature of many types of protein oxidation may also require sequestration as a strategy to prevent protein aggregates from accumulating at non-specific sites as we observed in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants.</p><p id="P29">The sequestration of misfolded proteins is thought to protect the proteome against an overload of protein misfolding. Refolding from the aggregated state can be mediated by disaggregases including the AAA+ family Hsp104 together with Hsp70 and Hsp40 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Glover &amp; Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ho <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rampelt <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Shorter, 2011</xref>). We found that Hsp104 co-localization with Btn2 and Hsp42 is increased in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure. However, Hsp104 localization, but not protein levels, was altered under these conditions suggesting that Hsp104 may become limiting in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants in the face of widespread protein oxidation. In agreement with this idea, we found that overexpressing Hsp104 improved oxidant tolerance in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants. Increasing Hsp104 levels in a wild-type strain did not affect oxidant tolerance indicating that Hsp104 levels are normally sufficient to protect against an oxidative stress when sequestrases are active. We found that Hsp104 suppressed the high levels of protein aggregation formed in the <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutant following ROS exposure consistent with the idea that the Hsp104 disaggregase normally acts to resolve spatially sorted protein aggregates that are formed following oxidant exposure.</p><p id="P30">CytoQ and INQ have primarily been characterized using model fluorescently labelled misfolded reporters and little is known regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of Btn2 and Hsp42. We focussed on the Sup35 protein since oxidative damage to Sup35 has been shown promote Sup35 aggregation as well as being an important trigger influencing the formation of heritable [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grant, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jamar <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Speldewinde <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide exposure increased the number of Sup35 puncta in cells, and in the absence of Btn2 and Hs42, the number of cells containing Sup35 puncta was further increased with many cells containing multiple Sup35 puncta. The increased Sup35 aggregation detected in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants required the Sup35 PrD which has previously been implicated in the formation of non-amyloid Sup35 phase separated aggregates during nutrient depletion stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Franzmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Our model is that soluble proteins, such as Sup35, undergo misfolding in response to oxidative damage, and the oxidatively damaged proteins are triaged by Btn2 and Hsp42 to the various protein deposit sites in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). In the absence of Hsp42 and Btn2, protein sequestration is deficient and non-specific protein aggregates accumulate in cells. These aggregates are targeted by Hsp104 and other chaperones, but non-specific aggregates ultimately overwhelm the protein homeostasis machinery resulting in sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. This implicates protein sequestration as key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation and resulting protein misfolding and aggregation.</p><p id="P31">[<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] is the amyloid prion form of the Sup35 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wickner, 1994</xref>).

However, another study has shown that the frequency of overexpression-induced [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] formation is increased in an <italic>hsp42</italic> mutant, and overexpression of Hsp42 effectively cures [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] suggesting that Hsp42 can protect against [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Duennwald <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). We found that the number of cells containing Sup35 puncta increased in response to oxidative stress and the colocalization of these puncta with Btn2 and Hsp42 was maintained following hydrogen peroxide exposure. Btn2 and Hsp42 appear to act as an anti-prion system that specifically suppress [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] formation during ROS exposure, but not during overexpression-induced prion formation. This is consistent with the idea that Btn2 and Hsp42 function to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins, thus preventing their templating to form the heritable prion form.</p><p id="P32">The IPOD is a site of accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, as well as oxidatively damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Tyedmers <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> prion formation following protein oxidation depends on IPOD localization which acts as a sorting centre determining whether oxidized proteins are cleared via autophagy, or alternatively, form heritable protein aggregates (prions), dependent on Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). IPOD-like inclusions have also been identified in mammalian cells, although little is known regarding their functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hipp <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Weisberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). One possibility is that proteins that are not degraded or re-solubilized at CytoQ/INQ may be trafficked to the IPOD which is thought to harbour terminally misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Escusa-Toret <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Hsp42 and Btn2 are thought to play roles in targeting terminally misfolded proteins including amyloidogenic substrates to the IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaganovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Tyedmers <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The resulting localised concentration of these proteins can facilitate the nucleation of prion protein polymerisation. This involves a two-stage process which initially involves the formation of non-transmissible extended polymers of the prion protein, followed by their fragmentation into shorter transmissible propagons, catalysed by Hsp104 and similar chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Tyedmers <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The elevated frequency of oxidant-induced [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion formation in <italic>btn2 hsp42</italic> mutants did not require IPOD localisation since it was unaffected in cortical actin mutants which have previously been shown to disrupt Sup35 IPOD localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Speldewinde <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This raises the question as to how the frequency of oxidant-induced [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion formation is elevated in sequestrase mutants. We suggest there are two possibilities by which this may occur. Firstly, the high localized concentrations of Sup35 at multiple non-specific aggregation sites may increase the likelihood of prion induction.

Prions were differentiated from nuclear gene mutations by their irreversible elimination on plates containing 4mM GdnHCl. GdnHCl effectively blocks the propagation of yeast prions by inhibiting the key ATPase activity of Hsp104, a molecular chaperone that functions as a disaggregase and is required for prion propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jung &amp; Masison, 2001</xref>).

In the absence of Hsp42 and Btn2, protein sequestration is deficient and non-specific protein aggregates accumulate in cells. These aggregates are targeted by Hsp104 and other chaperones, but non-specific aggregates ultimately overwhelm the protein homeostasis machinery resulting in sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. <italic>De novo</italic> prion formation following protein oxidation depends on IPOD localization which acts as a sorting centre determining whether oxidized proteins are cleared via autophagy, or alternatively, form heritable protein aggregates (prions), dependent on Hsp104.
