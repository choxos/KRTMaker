PDO models can be generated by culturing patient tumor cells in extracellular basement membrane extracts (BME) and plating as three-dimensional domes. However, commercially available reagents that have been optimized for phenotypic assays in monolayer cultures often are not compatible with BME. Herein we describe a method to plate PDO models and assess drug effects using an automated live-cell imaging system. In addition, we apply fluorescent dyes that are compatible with kinetic measurements to simultaneously quantitate cell health and apoptosis. Image capture can be customized to occur at regular time intervals over several days. Users can analyze drug effects in individual Z-plane images or a Z Projection of serial images from multiple focal planes. Using masking, specific parameters of interest are calculated, such as PDO number, area, and fluorescence intensity. We provide proof-of-concept data demonstrating the effect of cytotoxic agents on cell health, apoptosis and viability. This automated kinetic imaging platform can be expanded to other phenotypic readouts to understand diverse therapeutic effects in PDO models of cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) are rapidly emerging as a robust model system to study cancer development and therapeutic responses. PDOs are three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems that recapitulate the complex genomic profile and architecture of the primary tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Unlike traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture of immortalized cancer cell lines, PDOs capture and maintain intratumoral heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, making them a valuable tool for both mechanistic and translational research. Although PDOs are becoming an increasingly popular model system, commercially available reagents and analysis methods for cellular effects that are compatible with PDO cultures are limited.</p><p id="P4">The lack of robust methods to analyze subtle changes in treatment response hinders clinical translation. The gold standard cell health reagent in 3D cultures, CellTiter-Glo 3D, utilizes ATP levels as a determinant of cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. While this reagent is a useful for endpoint assays, there are several caveats, most notably the inability to use samples for other purposes after completion of the assay.</p><p id="P5">Live-cell imaging is a sophisticated form of kinetic microscopy that, when combined with fluorescent reagents, has the capacity to quantify a variety of cell health readouts within PDO models, including apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, live-cell imaging has been integral to high throughput screening of compounds in 2D platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Systems such as the Incucyte have made the technology affordable and thus accessible to research groups in a variety of settings. However, application of these systems to analyze 3D cultures is still in its infancy.</p><p id="P6">Herein we describe a method to assess drug response in PDO models of cancer using multiplexed live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Through analysis of Bright Field images, changes in organoid size and morphology can be kinetically monitored. Furthermore, cellular processes can be simultaneously quantified over time using fluorescent reagents, such as Annexin V Red Dye for apoptosis and Cytotox Green Dye for cytotoxicity. The methods presented are optimized for the Cytation 5 live-cell imaging system, but this protocol may be adapted across different live-cell imaging platforms.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Protocol</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="P7">Studies using human tumor specimens were reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (IRB), protocol #201809807 and performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.

Proof of concept experiments were performed in two separate PDO models of endometrial cancer: ONC-10817 and ONC-10811 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure S1 &amp; S2</xref> for ONC-10811 data). Apoptosis (annexin V staining) and cytotoxicity (Cytotox Green uptake) were kinetically monitored in response to the apoptosis-inducing agent, staurosporine. Specifically, PDOs were plated in 96-well plates, treated with Annexin V Red and Cytotox Green dyes, and placed in a 37 °C incubator overnight as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. We confirmed in two independent PDO models that treatment with Annexin V and Cytotox Green dyes is not toxic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). The following day, PDOs were treated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine (0.01 nM, 0.1 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM). Subsequently, protocols were established in the Gen5 software and experiments were set to run over a period 5 days, imaging every 6 hours. Data were analyzed using the Cellular Analysis function in the Gen5 software as described in the <italic>Image Analysis in Gen5 software</italic> protocol. The Primary Mask was set using the Auto threshold function with “Split touching objects” unchecked and with size parameters of minimum: 30 μm and maximum: 1000 μm. The PDO subpopulation was defined by circularity &gt; 0.25. The Object Mean Intensities in the TRITC (annexin V, apoptosis) and GFP channels (Cytotox Green, cytotoxicity) within the designated PDO subpopulation were exported as an .xlsx file for further analysis. The Object Mean Intensity for each well at each time point in both the GFP and TRITC channels was normalized to time 0. Normalized fluorescence data were then transferred to a Prism file and visualized as a line plot.</p><p id="P182">Treatment with staurosporine resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase in apoptosis and a decrease in cell health over time in comparison to vehicle control, as evidenced by the increase in Object Mean Intensity in both the TRITC (annexin V) and GFP (Cytotox) channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Videos SV1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>). The 500 nM, 100 nM, and 10 nM doses of staurosporine each resulted in a statistically significant increase in both apoptosis and cytotoxicity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-C</xref>) as well as at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Furthermore, staurosporine effectively inhibited PDO growth and formation at these concentrations as demonstrated by an overall decrease in total PDO area, whereas the control wells exhibited an increase in PDO area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><p id="P183">Since a major advantage of live-cell imaging is the ability to correct for variability in plating, we performed an experiment whereby cell viability was assessed as an endpoint measure. Proof-of-concept endpoint assay data were collected using a PDO model that was generated from a patient-derived xenograft of prostate cancer. Bright Field images were collected at the beginning of the treatment period (day 0), followed by addition of a dual dye reagent that measures both viability (acridine orange, AO) and cell death (propidium iodide, PI). The AO component emits a green fluorescent signal upon binding to double stranded DNA, an indicator of cell viability. The PI component stains dead nucleated cells and can be used to quantitate cell death in response to treatment. In order to account for variability in PDO plating, we devised a method to determine the number of PDOs per well at time 0 by converting Bright Field images to Digital Phase Contrast images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Protocols</xref>).</p><p id="P184">Prostate cancer PDOs were treated with daunorubicin, a chemotherapy agent that causes cell death, for 7 days. Upon completion of the experiment, samples were stained with AOPI as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Protocols</xref>, followed by analysis of fluorescent images in Gen5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows a panel of images from the AOPI endpoint assay on day 7. When comparing vehicle-treated PDOs (row one) to PDOs treated with 10 μM daunorubicin (row two), there was a clear decrease in green fluorescence (measure of viability, column two) and an increase in red fluorescence (measure of cell death, column three). These results were then quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, where we show the array of readouts that can be achieved using the AOPI endpoint staining technique. The upper left plot depicts the viability measurement generated from the AO stain, normalized to the PDO count determined by Digital Phase Contrast image analysis of each well on Day 0. These data correlate with the visual result from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, whereby as the concentration of daunorubicin increased, the viability drastically decreased. This is further recapitulated in the upper right graph which demonstrates an increase in cell death denoted by an increase in red fluorescence acquired with the PI stain.</p><p id="P185">The PI data were then combined with the viability reading (AO) to calculate a Viable to Dead Ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, lower left graph). This ratio is a useful approach to determine whether a drug is cytostatic or cytotoxic. Specifically, a cytotoxic drug will reach much closer to 0 than a cytostatic drug, due to the fact a drug that is cytostatic will inhibit growth but may not induce cell death. Lastly, the area of the PDOs can be accurately calculated using the green fluorescence of the AO stain, even when PDOs may be undergoing cell death and blebbing. The lower right graph depicts the average PDO area, which was calculated as the sum of the area denoted in the subpopulation analysis divided by the PDO number. Analysis of area can give further indication as to whether a treatment is simply inhibiting PDO growth or actually causing PDO regression. Note that the analysis of average PDO area was performed using the GFP channel and Cellular Analysis function, in contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> that used the Bright Field images to calculate total PDO area. These data highlight the flexibility of the analysis pipeline depending on data availability and user interest.</p><p id="P186">Finally, we compared the gold standard for viability readings, CellTiter-Glo 3D, to the viability fluorescence reading using AOPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Note that the data in this panel were not normalized to the time 0 PDO number since this normalization is not typically performed by labs using the CellTiter-Glo 3D kit. We observed the same trend for drug effect in both assays, whereby PDO viability decreased as the daunorubicin concentration increased. The only visual difference between these readouts was that the CellTiter-Glo 3D analysis reached an IC50 before the AOPI analysis and nearly completely reached 0. This result may be explained by the mechanism of action of daunorubicin. Daunorubicin is a topoisomerase-II inhibitor that introduces double stranded DNA breaks, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventually apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. During cell cycle arrest, ATP depletion can occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Given that the CellTiter-Glo 3D assay is based on an ATP-luciferase reaction to generate a luminescence signal, we hypothesize that the stronger reduction in cell viability at higher concentrations of daunorubicin was due to ATP depletion rather than complete cell death. Supporting this idea, the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> depict a population living PDOs in the culture, as denoted by green fluorescence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P187">PDO cultures are becoming an increasingly popular in vitro model system due to their ability to reflect cellular responses and behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Significant advances have been made in PDO generation, culture and expansion techniques, yet methods to analyze therapeutic responses have lagged. Commercially available 3D viability kits are lytic endpoint assays, missing out on potentially valuable kinetic response data and limiting subsequent analyses by other methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Emerging studies are applying live-cell imaging to assess drug responses in PDO models. Here, we present a method to assess PDO therapeutic responses over time utilizing multiplexed fluorescent live-cell imaging. Multiplexing fluorescent dyes allows for different cellular responses to be quantified simultaneously. In addition to apoptosis and cytotoxicity, we envision that this approach can be expanded in future studies to examine other phenotypic effects in PDOs.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Critical steps within the protocol</title><p id="P188">The protocol presented herein is designed to acquire kinetic bright-field and fluorescent images of PDOs plated as domes in a 96-well plate.

The protocol presented herein uses UltiMatrix as the BME due to minimal batch-to-batch variability and superior optical properties for imaging. Modifications for harvesting PDOs cultured in other BMEs such as Matrigel may be necessary, as well as for models that are clumpy and difficult to dissociate (see examples <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>). Next, fluorescent dyes are added to the Organoid Culture Media at the time of plating (Day-1) at a 2X concentration in a 100 μl volume and incubated overnight to determine baseline cell death. The following day (Day 0), drugs or other treatments are added to Organoid Culture Media at a 2X concentration in a 100 μl volume, and then added to each well for a final volume of 200 μl. The final volume of 200 μl reduces the meniscus effect with imaging. Kinetic images are acquired using the Cytation 5 plate reader partnered with the BioSpa tabletop incubator. The BioSpa incubator allows for incubation of experimental plates at a fixed temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> environment. Up to 8 plates can be stored in the BioSpa and thereby 8 experiments can be simultaneously conducted. Imaging parameters for each plate are set up in the Gen5 software using “Imager Manual Mode” and saved as a Protocol. The Protocol is then loaded into the scheduling software (BioSpa OnDemand). The BioSpa OnDemand software automates the workflow for kinetic image acquisition, including physical transfer of the plate from the BioSpa incubator into the Cytation 5 and dictating which protocol to run in Gen5 for data collection. Images are analyzed using the Cellular Analysis function in the Gen5 software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We describe specific methods to analyze Z Projections of fluorescent and Bright Field images. Specific methods to analyze single Z planes and/or only Bright Field images are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Protocols</xref>. Finally, users can define specific data features, such as PDO area, number, and mean fluorescence intensity, to export as an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent statistical analysis of drug effects.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Significance with respect to existing methods</title><p id="P189">Given that PDO models are a relatively new model system to interrogate drug effects, methods to accommodate the culture conditions, in particular growth in BME, are still emerging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The bulk of studies assessing PDO response to drug treatment rely on ATP-based endpoint assays as a surrogate for cell health (CellTiter-Glo 3D). This method requires cell lysis, thus precluding subsequent downstream analyses. Alternative endpoint assays, such as fluorescent staining, single timepoint imaging, and morphologic tracking, have provided other metrics to characterize drug response while allowing for sample use for additional purposes. For example, in-plate endpoint fixation protocols have been applied for high-throughput analysis of drug effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. An advantage of this method is that it circumvents the extensive processing required in typical immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and is particularly useful when sample is limited, as is the case for PDO models. It is also amenable to high-resolution imaging with confocal microscopy. Another endpoint assay that does not require cell lysis is live-cell imaging with reagents such as propidium iodide or acridine orange. Our comparative analysis of CellTiter-Glo 3D and AOPI, the latter of which does not require cell lysis, for assessment of cell viability and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) highlights the advantages of using live-cell imaging dyes in PDO models. This method has been applied by several groups, including ours, to assess phenotypic effects at the conclusion of an experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, kinetic data acquisition using either the in-well fixation or endpoint live-cell imaging methods require significant sample. Label-free morphologic assessment of PDOs over time in part overcomes this limitation and can be assessed using a wide range of imaging modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, yet changes in morphology may not be representative of the spectrum of potential drug effects such as apoptosis and changes in cell viability. We have observed significant model-to-model variability in morphologic changes in response to drugs. For example, some PDOs will increase in area as they are undergoing apoptosis, whereas other models may shrink. Kinetic morphologic assessments have been multiplexed with either fixed or live-cell fluorescent endpoint assays in a limited number of studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The methods presented herein are among the first to multiplex different fluorescent dyes to simultaneously assess multiple cellular effects in a high-throughput system.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Method troubleshooting and modifications</title><p id="P190">One of the greatest improvements provided by kinetic live-cell imaging is that it overcomes key limitations associated with endpoint assays. For example, plating an equal number of organoids per well is technically difficult because most automated cell counters are gated for objects smaller than 60 μm. Live-cell imaging allows for normalization to PDO number or area at time 0 in each well, which can then be used to adjust for variation in plating amongst wells. The gold standard endpoint assay for PDOs is the CellTiter-Glo 3D kit, which measures ATP as a surrogate for cell viability. We have extensively used this assay in our studies of gynecologic and prostate cancer PDOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In addition to requiring cell lysis for ATP measures, drugs and other therapeutic modalities can alter ATP levels, potentially providing an inaccurate assessment of therapeutic response. Utilizing live-cell imaging dyes allows for quantification of a wider scope of specific cellular responses, such as apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Importantly, these reagents do not perturb cell viability or induce DNA damage, as is the case with propidium iodide; this allows for repeated assessment of PDO response over time. While we have not explored the use of acridine orange (AO) for kinetic measures, the mechanism of action for AO should not preclude such application in the future.</p><p id="P191">Tumors consist of several distinct cell populations with varying genomic profiles and morphologies. Due to the complex heterogeneity of PDO models, individual organoid responses may vary and tracking these responses is challenging. Our protocol provides a method to assess multiple organoid response metrics on a well-by-well basis. However, certain technical considerations still apply for live-cell imaging. The number of wells of a 24-well plate needed to seed a 96-well plate will depend upon the density and growth rate of each PDO model. Because clumping can confound image analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>), PDO models may need additional processing steps prior to plating. If necessary, PDOs may be mechanically sheared during processing through vigorous pipetting with a non-wide bore p200 tip. Enzymatic digestion using TrypLE Express may also be employed prior to plating to promote PDO dissociation and decreased clumping. In our experience, we have noted that the length of TrypLE incubation is highly variable depending upon the model. Therefore, TrypLE incubation should be optimized for each model, particularly if researchers wish to obtain single cell suspensions. Recovery time prior to beginning treatment may be necessary for PDO models that are particularly sensitive to enzymatic digestion.</p><p id="P192">We present methods for specific live-cell imaging reagents. A limitation in the broad applicability of the methods presented herein is a paucity of reagents that are compatible with BME. For other dyes/reagents that have not yet been optimized for use in PDOs, additional troubleshooting may be necessary to determine the optimal concentration and minimize solvent effects. Depending on the readout of interest (e.g., apoptosis or cytotoxicity), treatment with a compound known to induce cell death, such as staurosporine or daunorubicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> should be used to optimize reagent conditions. An additional consideration is the optimal time for dye integration into the BME dome. In our experiments, we perform an overnight incubation prior to treatment to allow for complete uptake of the dye into the domes as well as determine baseline cell health. Since signal intensity will increase over time, researchers should perform pilot studies with the dyes to determine the ideal exposure time at the end of the experiment to avoid overexposed images. Finally, reagents should not interfere with cellular processes. For example, dyes that intercalate into DNA are not compatible with kinetic imaging. However, live-cell imaging can be used for data normalization in endpoint assays. Indeed, we present a supplementary method to quantify cell viability and the viable:dead cell ratio using AOPI. In this experiment, the fluorescent signal is normalized to PDO number for each well as determine by live-cell imaging on day 0 (day of treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P193">Another limitation in this methods paper is the reliance on manual pipetting for experiments, which can lead to greater variance in technical replicates. Further improvements in data reproducibility can be achieved with addition of automation to other steps of the experimental process, such as use of automated liquid handler for plating and drug dispensing as has been demonstrated by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, this addition requires an additional investment in research infrastructure that may not be available to all investigators. Given the heterogeneity in PDO area for each model, normalizing results to the initial PDO number or area at time 0 is still a useful approach with automated seeding.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Choosing metrics for analysis</title><p id="P194">A key advantage of the Cytation 5 over other live-cell imaging platforms is the ability to customize image and analysis features. However, the Cytation 5/Gen5 software has a steep learning curve and assumes that users have a foundational knowledge of imaging. One of our goals of this methods paper is to provide step-by-step instructions to decrease the barrier for other researchers to incorporate sophisticated live-cell imaging techniques in their PDO research programs. While the specific analysis steps presented herein are for one system, users can apply the multiplexing principles to other platforms, with the understanding that downstream analysis may necessitate use of third-party software, such as NIH ImageJ.</p><p id="P195">Analysis metrics should be chosen based on both experimental goals and plating conditions. For example, if the experiment is conducted using a fluorescent dye to quantify cell death, fluorescence intensity is an effective read-out. The most effective fluorescence metric (Total Fluorescence vs. Object Mean Intensity) will depend on the plating conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>). If PDOs are evenly dispersed and are of a more circular, cohesive morphology, fluorescence can be determined in a defined PDO subpopulation. The specific function in the Gen5 software is Cellular Analysis and the output is Object Mean Intensity. However, if the PDO model is clumpy or has a discohesive morphology, we recommend quantifying the fluorescence signal at the image level; this function can be found under Image Statistics and the output is Total Fluorescence Intensity. While this method is useful for observing changes at the individual well level, this metric is not specific for objects of interest and could change erroneously if the PDOs move outside of the designated plug over the duration of the experiment. In scenarios in which there is significant debris or dead single cells, use of the Cellular Analysis is suggested to gate out any fluorescent signal that is not specifically associated with a PDO. An example of differential results using Cellular Analysis vs. Image Statistics is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>.</p><p id="P196">To determine the optimal threshold for the Image Statistics function, the line tool may be utilized to determine the starting point. Using the line tool, users can determine the range of fluorescence intensity within an image. We set the background as the 25% value of the peak intensity within the image and designate this value as the lower threshold. To view the fluorescent areas that are included in the designated threshold, check the “Threshold Outliers” box. Additional fine-tuning of the lower threshold value may be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Data management</title><p id="P197">A significant challenge in live-cell imaging is storing the massive amount of data generated with each experiment. This is particularly relevant in the case of PDO cultures, where Z-Stacks are used to image across several focal planes and generate a Z Projection. There are multiple methods to overcome this issue. First, ensure adequate storage capacity. We have installed three solid state hard drives with a total of 17 TB. Other options include transferring experimental files to external hard drives or networked storage. It is not recommended to directly write files to cloud based storage. To analyze data that has been stored on an external drive, simply transfer the experiment and the image files to a computer equipped with Gen5 software (NOTE: large files may take extended periods of time to transfer). Before analysis, the images must be re-linked to the experiment. Open the experiment file, click Protocol in the toolbar, select Protocol Options. Click Image Save Options and click Select new image folder. Locate the image file and click Select Folder to relink.</p><p id="P198">Depending on the goals of the experiment, it may also be suitable to use the binning feature within Gen5. Binning decreases file size by lowering the number of pixels, which leads to lower image resolution (see Step 5.3.4 in <italic>Setting up imaging parameters</italic> section). Therefore, binning is not recommended if high resolution images are required. When using the binning feature, the exposure settings will need to be adjusted. Once the experimental file has been created, double click on the Image section, and click the microscope icon to reopen Imager Manual Mode. Use the Auto-expose function or manually adjust exposure as needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P199">In summary, we present methods for assessing apoptosis and cell health of PDOs in response to cytotoxic agents. Future studies are necessary to optimize methods and develop additional analysis strategies for kinetic imaging of PDOs, such as other phenotypes and effects of drugs that are cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. A major roadblock is the commercial availability of dyes and reagents that are compatible with BME. There is still more work necessary to better understand how kinetic live-cell imaging can be fully utilized to extract the most data from these models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Video SV1</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV1.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Video SV2</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV2.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Video SV3</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV3.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Video SV4</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV4.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Video SV5</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV5.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Video SV6</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV6.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplemental Video SV7</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplemental_Video_SV7.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" id="d26aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS191286-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAdEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the Tissue Procurement Core and Dr. Kristen Coleman at the University of Iowa for providing patient tumor specimens and to Dr. Sofia Gabrilovich in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for assisting with patient-derived organoid model generation.
