influence cell fate decisions. However, the interplay between gene position and expression remains incompletely understood, in part because the proteins that position genomic loci at the nuclear periphery remain unidentified. Here, we used an Oligopaint-based HiDRO screen targeting ~1000 genes to discover novel regulators of nuclear architecture in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. We identified the heterochromatin-associated protein, Stonewall (Stwl), as a factor promoting perinuclear chromatin positioning. In female germline stem cells (GSCs), Stwl binds and positions chromatin loci, including GSC differentiation genes, at the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, Stwl-dependent perinuclear positioning is associated with transcriptional repression, highlighting a likely mechanism for Stwl’s known role in GSC maintenance and ovary homeostasis. Thus, our study identifies perinuclear anchors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and demonstrates the importance of gene repression at the nuclear periphery for cell fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nuclear architecture</kwd><kwd>Genome organization</kwd><kwd>Nuclear periphery</kwd><kwd>Heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>Germline stem cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The distribution of the genome within the interphase nucleus can tune cell-specific gene expression. In both plant and animal cells, dense-staining heterochromatin and repressed tissue-specific genes are typically found near the inner nuclear membrane (INM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In metazoans, an INM-associated network, involving the intermediate filament protein lamin and other associated proteins, serves as a scaffold for the organization of peripheral chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This chromatin, which is associated with the nuclear lamina, is referred to as lamina-associated domains (LADs) and is usually gene-poor, transcriptionally silent, and rich in repressive histone marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Experiments using LAD-embedded transcriptional reporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and gene tethering to the nuclear periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> have shown that perinuclear positioning is generally associated with reduced transcriptional output, although exceptions can occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Functionally, perinuclear positioning of a locus has been speculated to preserve the inactive transcriptional state and stabilize cell-specific gene expression programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Consistently, detachment of specific loci from the nuclear periphery in multiple cell types is associated with ectopic gene expression and alterations in cell fate decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. While the nuclear lamina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and epigenetic modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> are known to influence chromatin association to the nuclear periphery, very few chromatin-binding perinuclear anchors have been identified thus far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. As a result, the precise relationships between perinuclear positioning, gene expression and cell fate remain enigmatic.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we leverage our recently developed HiDRO technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to conduct an RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells aimed at identifying perinuclear anchors for heterochromatin. We individually depleted approximately 1,000 genes known to possess characteristic DNA-binding domains or nuclear localization sequences, and then measured changes in the spatial positioning of genomic regions located both at the periphery and center of the nucleus. Among our hits, we isolated a significant hit, the heterochromatin-associated MADF-BESS domain containing protein, Stonewall (Stwl)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> as a factor important for the peripheral positioning of LAD-enriched chromatin. MADF-BESS proteins are transcriptional regulators that bind DNA through an N-terminal MADF (Myb-SANT like in ADF) domain, whereas the C-terminal BESS motif mediates protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated that Stwl has a cell-autonomous function in female germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> as well as later stages of oogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, likely through gene repression. Notably, Stwl-depleted GSCs are reported to differentiate precociously (as determined by fusome-containing germline cysts), even in the absence of critical differentiation genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, suggesting that Stwl plays an important role in the balance between GSC self-renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanism by which Stwl fine-tunes this vital regulatory step in GSC cell fate has remained unclear. Here, we show that Stwl is crucial for perinuclear chromatin positioning in female GSCs. Using RNA sequencing, chromatin profiling and single molecule FISH, we demonstrate that Stwl promotes repression of canonical GSC differentiation genes such as <italic>benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn)</italic> by positioning these gene loci at the nuclear periphery. Overall, our HiDRO screen has identified multiple factors regulating nuclear architecture in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> In particular, we have pinpointed Stwl as an important factor that links perinuclear chromatin organization to female GSC fate.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Discovery of novel regulators of chromosome positioning</title><p id="P4">To identify proteins involved in the positioning of chromatin at the nuclear periphery, we performed an RNAi screen using our recently developed HiDRO platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> in Drosophila Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, we seeded Kc167 cells onto 384-well plates containing individual dsRNAs in each well and performed high-throughput Oligopaint FISH to mark three 1Mb genomic regions that span Chromosome 2R and contain varying amounts of LADs (referred to as Chr. 2R-A, -B, and -C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In particular, 74% of Chr. 2R-C is designated as LADs in Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also confirmed by high-resolution FISH that this region was in closer proximity to the nuclear periphery as compared to Chr. 2R-A and Chr. 2R-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore used the normalized distance between this region and the nuclear periphery as our primary metric for isolating hits.</p><p id="P5">We performed an RNAi screen in duplicate, using a Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (DRSC)-curated transcription factor dsRNA sublibrary that targets 966 genes encoding DNA-binding or nuclear localizing proteins. A total of ~8 million cells were analyzed, which yielded 29 “peripheral” hits that significantly increased the distance between Chr. 2R-C and the nuclear periphery, normalized to the nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition to our primary metric, we also calculated peripheral distance for Chr. 2R-A and Chr. 2R-B as well as 13 secondary parameters of genome organization, including the pairwise distance between regions A, B, and C. These also included measurements related to the size and shape of each domain and the nucleus itself, creating a multimodal dataset of nuclear organization for all 966 genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Together, this revealed that 11/29 peripheral hits also altered chromosome length, with all 11 causing increased compaction, consistent with peripheral detachment leading to a global change in genome organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stwl localizes to the nuclear periphery in Kc167 cells</title><p id="P6">We used StringDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> to find any known relationships between the peripheral hits and recovered 4 distinct subgroups, one of which included the MADF-BESS domain containing proteins, Su(var)3-7 and Stonewall (Stwl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, both proteins have been associated with heterochromatin repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Stwl represented one of our top hits and, similar to lamin B depletion, its phenotypic profile consisted of increased distance for all three Chr2R regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-1H</xref>). We also note that Stwl depletion decreased chromosome arm length, as measured by the distance between Chr. 2R-A and Chr. 2R-C.</p><p id="P7">We next examined the subcellular localization of Stwl in Kc167 cells using an antibody generated against the full-length protein. Reduced immunofluorescence signal from this Stwl antibody following a four-day dsRNA knockdown of Stwl confirmed the specificity of the antibody in Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1A-S1C</xref>). Consistent with published reports from other cell types, we found that Stwl was present throughout the nucleus, with an enrichment at the nuclear periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I-1K</xref>). Using a shell analysis that divided the nuclear volume into five equi-volume nested shells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), we calculated the relative signal in each shell and observed that 82% of Stwl signal occupied the nuclear periphery while 18% occupied the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J-1K</xref>). In contrast, only 53% of H3K9me2 signal and 55% of CID/CENPA signal occupied the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>). Total DNA as stained by Hoechst showed only 68% of signal at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>), suggesting Stwl was more peripheral than expected for a random distribution throughout the nucleus. We next used affinity purification coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry to determine Stwl interactions in Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Consistent with Stwl’s perinuclear localization, we identified putative interactions with multiple components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) including Nup62 and Nup88. Moreover, we also identified interactions with three other ‘peripheral’ hits from our HiDRO screen, namely Reptin (Rept), Pontin (Pont) and CG4557. Interestingly, Rept and Pont are members of the Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and may be required in combination with Stwl to position or repress specific loci at the nuclear periphery. Overall, our data support a direct role for Stwl in anchoring chromatin at the nuclear periphery.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Stwl promotes perinuclear chromatin positioning independent of Lamin B in Kc167 cells</title><p id="P8">We next asked if Stwl was required for Lamin expression or localization in Kc167 cells. qPCR and immunofluorescence quantification showed that Lamin B expression was not reduced following Stwl depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1E-S1F</xref>). To determine if Stwl depletion affected the peripheral localization of Lamin B, we examined 5 distinct Lamin phenotypes and manually assessed &gt;350 cells following LacZ (control) or Stwl depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1G</xref>). The overall distribution of each phenotype across four Stwl RNAi replicates was not statistically significant from LacZ depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1H</xref>), suggesting that Stwl relocalizes peripheral chromatin independent of Lamin B expression or localization.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Stwl regulates chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery in female GSCs</title><p id="P9">Stwl has been previously shown to be important for GSC self-renewal, oocyte specification and egg chamber development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a previous study has also shown that germ cells transform their spatial genome organization during GSC differentiation, including changes in the perinuclear positioning of chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of Stwl function in GSC maintenance and whether it contributes to GSC genome organization remains unclear. To address this question, we turned to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, which is a powerful system to study germline stem cell (GSC) fate and tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Each <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary comprises 16-20 autonomous egg producing units known as ovarioles. The anterior tip of each ovariole contains a germarium, which houses GSCs and differentiated germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Each GSC divides asymmetrically to produce one self-renewing daughter cell (GSC, green cell) and one differentiating daughter cell (cystoblast, CB, purple cell), with cystoblasts undergoing further transit amplifying divisions to generate germline cysts (yellow cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Crucially, the balance between GSC self-renewal and differentiation maintains tissue homeostasis; excessive self-renewal can lead to stem cell tumours while precocious differentiation can lead to tissue atrophy.</p><p id="P10">We first depleted Stwl constitutively in early germ cells (including GSCs and CBs) by RNAi using <italic>nos-Gal4::VP16</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, we observed a severe agametic ovary phenotype upon Stwl depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and fully penetrant female sterility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2A</xref>). Moreover, these Stwl depleted ovaries contained very few cells containing the germ cell cytoplasmic marker, Vasa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, although Stwl is expressed in male germ cells, Stwl depletion using <italic>nos-Gal4</italic> in the male germline did not affect testis development or fertility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2B-S2D</xref>), suggesting a female germline-specific role for Stwl. Additionally, we verified the Stwl knockdown phenotype using flies carrying a precise <italic>stwl</italic> deletion (<italic>stwl<sup>KO4</sup></italic>) in trans to a <italic>stwl</italic> mutant allele (<italic>stwl<sup>LL06470</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2E</xref>). Consistent with the constitutive germline knockdown of Stwl, <italic>stwl</italic> mutant females also exhibited substantial germ cell loss and agametic ovaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2F</xref>). In contrast to the acute loss of early germ cells when Stwl was absent in GSCs, Stwl knockdown in differentiated germ cells using <italic>bam-Gal4</italic> did not affect germaria development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2G-S2H</xref>). Instead, <italic>bam-Gal4-</italic>mediated Stwl depletion led to downstream defects in egg chamber development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2I-S2J</xref>), with females exhibiting a strong reduction in fertility compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2K</xref>). The role of Stwl in later stages of oogenesis has been characterized in a separate study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Altogether, these data suggest that Stwl has a critical and cell-autonomous function in female GSC maintenance.</p><p id="P11">To elucidate the series of events linking Stwl depletion to GSC loss, we used an inducible knockdown system comprising a temperature-sensitive allele of Gal80 (<italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>) and <italic>nos-Gal4</italic>. Here, germ cell specific Gal4 expression is only induced upon shifting the adult flies to 29°C (due to inactivation of <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>), triggering RNAi and subsequent protein depletion. Using this system, we recapitulated the agametic ovary phenotype observed upon constitutive Stwl depletion 20 days post shift to 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, we observed that Stwl was depleted in early female germ cells starting from four days post shift to 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, all further Stwl depletion experiments were performed in flies shifted for 4-6 days to 29°C.</p><p id="P12">Based on our screen and our phenotypic data in Kc167 cells, we hypothesized that Stwl might position chromatin at the nuclear periphery in female GSCs. Therefore, we first assessed the position of the Chr. 2R regions (A and C) in female GSCs using Oligopaint DNA FISH. Specifically, we measured the shortest distance of these loci from the GSC nuclear boundary, which was marked by the NE-proximal cytoplasmic protein, Vasa. We observed that Chr. 2R-A was positioned closest to the nuclear periphery in control GSCs (median distance = 0 μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-2H</xref>). In the absence of Stwl, however, this locus was primarily observed in the nuclear interior (median distance = 0.44μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-2G</xref>). In contrast to region A, Chr. 2R-C did not exhibit peripheral localization in control GSCs (median distance = 0.39 μm), consistent with cell-type specific LAD composition, and, as such, its position remained unaffected following Stwl depletion (median distance = 0.28 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-2K</xref>). We further examined the position of centromeres (marked by the centromeric histone, Cid/dCENP-A) in GSC nuclei, as they are often observed in proximity to the NE in many cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. While control GSCs exhibited a substantial number of NE-proximal centromeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S3A-S3C</xref>), centromeres in Stwl-depleted GSCs were re-localized to the nuclear interior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S3A-S3C</xref>). Consistent with our data from Kc167 cells, Stwl positions chromatin at the nuclear periphery in female GSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Reduced peripheral chromatin localization in the absence of Stwl is associated with gaps in the nuclear lamina.</title><p id="P13">We next asked whether Stwl localized to the nuclear periphery in female GSCs as observed in Kc167 cells. We used ovaries enriched for GSC-like cells using <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and stained for Stwl following methanol fixation, a method that can expose otherwise inaccessible epitopes. Interestingly, we observed that a fraction of Stwl consistently localized at the nuclear periphery, interspersed with the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-3B</xref>), which agrees with our observations in cultured cells. We next sought to identify the underlying cause of the changes in the peripheral chromatin localization observed in Stwl-depleted GSCs. As loss of nuclear envelope integrity is associated with reduced perinuclear chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, we checked whether Stwl depletion affected NE components in GSCs. We first checked the localization of Lamin B (lamin Dm0) and Lamin C in the Stwl-depleted GSCs since these proteins at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) are associated with peripheral chromatin. We observed that 38% of Stwl-depleted GSCs exhibited stretches of the NE lacking nuclear lamins, referred to as lamina gaps hereafter, with these gaps spanning 10%-40% of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4A-S4D</xref>).

In the control, we observed ~1 electron-dense chromatin focus associated with the nuclear periphery per micron of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E-3G</xref>). In contrast, Stwl-depleted GSC nuclei exhibited an approximately 2-fold reduction in the perinuclear electron-dense chromatin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-3G</xref>).

We next asked whether Stwl depletion led to loss of NPCs from the NE or whether they were rather reorganized across the nucleus. We observed that the normalized number of NPCs (NPCs per micron of the NE) remained unchanged across both control and Stwl-depleted GSCs, suggesting that NPCs are reorganized into clusters in the absence of Stwl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4I</xref>). Notably, almost no electron-dense chromatin foci were found in NE stretches with NPC clusters, which correspond to lamina gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>).

To test this, we first wanted to identify the Stwl-dependent transcriptome, specifically in GSC-like cells. Although other studies have identified Stwl-dependent gene expression in ovaries, these studies were performed in young ovaries that contain early egg chambers, differentiated germline cysts as well as GSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, Stwl-depleted ovaries rapidly lose GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-2C</xref>) and are therefore unsuitable for RNA-seq experiments that seek to determine the GSC transcriptome. However, a previous study has shown that overexpression of Stwl in GSCs leads to a subtle increase in the number of undifferentiated germ cells in the ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

This data further strengthens the idea that Stwl overexpression can promote GSC fate.

Among these hits, we have revealed that Stonewall (Stwl), a MADF-BESS transcriptional regulator previously implicated in female GSC maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, is a novel factor positioning chromatin at the nuclear periphery in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells and female GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>).

We propose that Stwl-mediated repression of multiple such genes through perinuclear positioning preserves the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, thereby ensuring the long-term maintenance of the GSC reservoir and preserving tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Although the nuclear periphery is considered to be a repressive nuclear subcompartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, whether perinuclear gene position dictates transcriptional activity or whether transcriptional activity drives perinuclear positioning of genes has remained incompletely understood. Our identification of novel perinuclear anchors such as Stwl, and the genomic loci that they bind and repress, highlights a path forward to address this challenging question. For example, oligopaint DNA FISH experiments revealed that the Stwl-bound <italic>bgcn</italic> gene locus was often positioned at the nuclear periphery in GSCs and differentiated germline cysts. This perinuclear positioning was reduced 1.5-1.7-fold in the absence of Stwl and was broadly associated with increased <italic>bgcn</italic> expression across the germaria as detected by smFISH. Interestingly, <italic>bgcn</italic> nascent transcription was primarily observed in the nuclear interior and rarely observed at the nuclear periphery in the same cell types. We observed a similar lack of <italic>bgcn</italic> nascent transcription at the nuclear periphery in GSCs lacking Stwl. Since the <italic>bgcn</italic> locus is present at the nuclear periphery in 34% and 20% of control and Stwl-depleted GSCs respectively, our data are consistent with a model where Stwl primarily functions to position loci at the nuclear periphery, and that other components of the perinuclear heterochromatin subcompartment mediate direct transcriptional repression. However, Stwl may also have other complementary roles that facilitate transcriptional repression at bound loci. For example, Stwl may possess a direct transcriptional repression activity that only operates at the nuclear periphery, potentially through interactions with specific NE-associated proteins.</p><p id="P24">Cytologically, we observed that a fraction of Stwl localizes to the nuclear periphery in both cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and female GSCs. Moreover, we identified interactions between Stwl and NPC proteins (Nup62, Nup88, Nup214 and Tpr/Megator) through quantitative proteomics in cultured cells. While it is possible that these interactions could facilitate nuclear import of Stwl, recent studies have also shown that the perinuclear localization of active and repressive chromatin can occur through interactions with NPC proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we also identified that three other ‘peripheral’ hits from our screen (Reptin, Pontin and CG4557) co-purified with Stwl, suggesting that a Stwl-containing multi-protein complex may be required to facilitate perinuclear positioning of bound loci. At the same time, our discovery of multiple potential perinuclear anchors suggests a high degree of redundancy in the system. One example of this potential redundancy may be the male germline, where Stwl depletion has no effect on GSC maintenance. We therefore speculate that other proteins function in parallel to Stwl outside of the female germline, and these proteins may include other ‘peripheral’ hits identified in our screen (e.g. Jarid2 and Su(var)3-7) or one of the 45 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> MADF-BESS family members (e.g. Brwl or Hng2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, which are known to function redundantly in other tissues.</p><p id="P25">In the absence of Stwl, we observe that GSCs undergo substantial changes in chromatin organization at the nuclear envelope, including decreased electron-dense perinuclear chromatin foci and gaps in the nuclear lamina. The decreased perinuclear chromatin association in the absence of Stwl could be due to a lack of bridging interactions between chromatin and the nuclear envelope. However, another possibility is that Stwl-dependent genome organization may also promote perinuclear chromatin association. A parallel study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> has identified that Stwl is enriched at the boundaries between active and inactive genomic regions in young ovaries, in a manner reminiscent of insulator proteins that demarcate topologically associated domains (TADs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. In the absence of Stwl, they find that the chromatin states of these active-inactive regions are indistinct, which is suggestive of compartment mixing and is associated with gene misexpression. Intriguingly, previous studies have noted that transcriptionally silent lamina-associated domains (LADs) are separated from neighbouring active genomic compartments by a sharp border<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.

Kotb and colleagues have further shown that mixing of active and inactive chromatin states at the <italic>Rps19b</italic> locus in the absence of Stwl is associated with detachment from the nuclear periphery in nurse cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.
