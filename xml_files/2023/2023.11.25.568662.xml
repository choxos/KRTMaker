Here, we report the design and characterization of agonists that tune the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) activity, which is central for the proliferation and granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Using design agonists, we study the impact of varying the receptor-binding affinity and dimerization geometry on receptor association, downstream signaling, and cellular response. Hence, we achieved agonists with altered signaling specificities that are hyper-thermostable, can outcompete the native ligand (G-CSF), and bias granulopoietic differentiation over triggering proliferation. Furthermore, the design agonists differentially modulate the kinetics and amplitudes of signal transduction pathways, and gene expression patterns. Unlike G-CSF, they achieve selective activation of gene sets with hematopoietic functions with minimal unwanted effects on immunomodulatory signaling. These findings demonstrate the potential of dissecting the complex G-CSFR signaling, and open up ways for new therapeutic applications for designed cytokines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS191783-f007"/></fig>

Synthetic ligands that engage cytokine receptors in non-native ways can selectively bias the signaling outcomes, overcoming the functional pleiotropy of native agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Modulation of class I/II cytokine receptors is of considerable interest for therapeutic intervention, but is hampered by the often broad and pleiotropic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Decomposing these signaling outcomes through synthetic agonists can thus unlock previously untapped therapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The observed functional plasticity of natural ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] has inspired efforts to systematically bias signaling specificity using design agonists purposefully engineered to possess optimal pharmaceutical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. For instance, affinity-engineering of IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] or IL-22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] variants possessed immunomodulatory activity or altered tissue specificity when compared to the respective natural ligands. This highlight the effect of the ligand’s receptor-binding affinity on downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In addition to affinity, the receptors’ association geometry can provide another layer of control over downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], which was demonstrated through synthetic ligands. Specifically, diabodies and DARPins dimerizing the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in non-native orientations could induce a range of differential signaling outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Alternatively, using antibody fragment fusions, signal tuning was demonstrated for heterodimeric receptor complexes of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rβ:γ<sub>c</sub>) and the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1:IFNAR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this study, we explore the tunability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). Under physiological conditions, the native ligand (G-CSF) homodimerizes G-CSFR to induce signaling, which is crucial for granulopoiesis, and the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Despite the clinical adoption of recombinant G-CSF (rhG-CSF) for treating neutropenia and stem cell mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], its therapeutic applications are still limited due to its capacity to inadvertently activate, e.g., different types of immune cells, tumor cells, osteoclasts, which express G-CSFR. By designing G-CSFR agonists that associate the receptor subunits at varying affinities and geometries we were able to control the downstream phosphorylation of key signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Based on characterizing the biophysical properties of our design agonists and investigating their impact on receptor dimerization in the plasma membrane, in conjunction with intracellular signal activation, and cellular activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we highlight the potential to tune G-CSFR signaling towards differentiation, while avoiding its unwanted non-hematopoietic effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Computationally-guided library generation for affinity maturation</title><p id="P7">Two libraries of mutants of 6 amino acid positions on the Boskar4 receptor-binding sites were generated using either site-saturation mutagenesis or computational design. The mutated positions on the Boskar4 surface were chosen based on two criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The positions in Boskar4 were determined which had the smallest average distance to G-CSFR in a modeled complex between the Boskar4 ensemble (PDB: 7NY0, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]) and G-CSFR (PBD:2D9Q, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]). Residues known to be critical for G-CSF activity were excluded from the final choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. For the saturation library, high diversity degenerated codons were chosen which contained the original amino acid and other random amino acids constructing a library of a theoretical diversity (number of distinct gene variants) of 4.0×10<sup>6</sup> and an amino-acid diversity (number of distinct protein variants) of 3.2×10<sup>6</sup>. Finally, the library was generated by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2 and S3</xref>) using one pair of primers (primer 3 and 4), each containing 3 degenerated sites to linearize an <italic>E. coli</italic> display system plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] encoding a fusion between the N-terminal part of Intimin and Boskar4 (pNB4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4, Fig. S1B, C</xref>). The obtained PCR product was purified with the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (A928, Promega) and blunt end ligation was performed followed by electroporation of freshly made competent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] to yield 3.6×10<sup>7</sup> total transformants. The <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH10B T1<sup>R</sup> (C640003, Invitrogen) was used for all display experiments.</p><p id="P8">In more detail, prior to transformation, 0.4 U/μL T4 polynucleotide kinase (EK0031, Thermo Scientific™) was incubated with 5 ng/μL of linearized PCR product for 30 min at 37 °C, according to manufacturer instructions. After that, 0.25 U/μL T4 DNA ligase (EL0011, Thermo Scientific™) was added and incubated overnight at 16 °C. The ligation product was purified with the same PCR Clean-Up System mentioned above and eluted into 20 μL filtered ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The complete 20 μL were transformed into electrocompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> as described in Tu <italic>et al.</italic> with the following changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In short, 50 mL of freshly grown <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibiting an optical density at 600 nm (<italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic>) of ~ 0.6 were washed two times with 35 mL filtered H<sub>2</sub>O. After washing, the bacterial pellet was resuspended with the purified ligation mix. The electroporation was performed at 1250 V and 5 ms. The cells were grown in 1 mL SOC Outgrowth Medium (B9020, NEB) for 2 h in a standard glass tube at 30 °C with 160 rpm. A 10-fold dilution series of the cells was made in SOC-medium, and they were plated on agar plates containing 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 2 % (w/v) D-glucose to estimate the total number of transformants. The rest of the sample was plated on five agar plates of the same type and incubated at 30 °C for about 20 h. The bacterial lawn was scraped from the plates and well mixed in 10 mL lysogeny broth (LB) medium. From 500 μL of bacterial suspension, the display plasmid containing the Boskar4 library was isolated and analyzed by Sanger sequencing with primers 19 and 20.</p><p id="P9">For the designed library, Damietta spl application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] was used to estimate the free energy change of each single mutants of the same positions and same amino acids per position as the control library in a non-combinatorial manner. For each of the six positions, five amino acids with the lowest free energy change plus the original amino acid of Boskar4 at the corresponding position were used to define the designed, size-reduced library with a theoretical diversity of 3.89×10<sup>4</sup>. The library was generated by PCR the same way as the original one but using three pairs of primers (primer 5 to 10, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) such that the final library contained 15.6% of desired amino acids. The primer composition was designed by using the online tool of SwiftLib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The designed library had a final theoretical diversity of 2.5×10<sup>5</sup>, an amino-acid diversity of 2.3×10<sup>5</sup> and 2.7×10<sup>7</sup> total transformants were yielded.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Screening procedure for enhanced binders</title><p id="P10">The FACS-based screening of bacterially-displayed Boskar4 variants followed a slightly adapted procedure from that described by Salema <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In brief, G-CSFR was first fluorescently labelled. This was done by incubating 100 μg of recombinant human G-CSFR (381-GR/CF, R&amp;D Systems) in 950 μL PBS for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with Biotin-NHS (H1759, Sigma) in a 1:20 molar ratio (G-CSFR:Biotin-NHS). The reaction was stopped with 50 μL Tris (1 M pH 7.5). After 1 h of incubation on ice, the product was purified with a desalting column (Sephadex G25 PD-10, GE Healthcare), and the elution fractions were concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (3 kDa, UFC800324, Merck) to a concentration of 0.24 mg/mL (3.6 μM). Aliquots of the biotinylated protein (herein referred to as BioGCSFR) were stored at -20 °C until use.</p><p id="P11">For the first sorting, DH10B T1<sup>R</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were transformed with the display-vector pN containing a Boskar4 library. The bacteria were freshly grown on LB agar plates containing 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% (w/v) D-glucose at 30 °C yielding ~3.0×10<sup>8</sup> total transformants. Following the harvesting of bacteria from the agar plates, 1 mL of resuspended bacterial culture exhibiting an <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> of 3.3 was subjected to two successive washes, each involving 1 mL of LB medium. Subsequently, the culture was diluted to an initial <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> of 0.33 by adding it to 10 mL of LB medium containing 34 μg/mL of chloramphenicol. The cells were cultivated at a temperature of 30 °C and an agitation rate of 160 rpm. After a duration of 1 h, 50 μM of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was introduced into the culture, and the cultivation was continued for an additional 3 h under the same growth conditions. Cells equivalent to 1 mL of a cell resuspension possessing an <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> of 1 were collected, subjected to two washes with 1000 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and eventually resuspended in 400 μL of PBS. 190 μL of this cell suspension was incubated with 10 nM BioGCSFR for 1 h at room temperature, followed by one wash with 1000 μL PBS. The washed cells were resuspended in 200 μL PBS containing 0.375 μL PE-Streptavidin (405203, BioLegend) and were subsequently incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the sample was washed one more time with 1000 μL PBS and resuspended in 1000 μL PBS. FACS was performed with a BD FACSMelody™ Cell Sorter having set the PTM voltage for PE to 517 V, SSC to 426 V and a SSC threshold to 673 V. No gating was applied. All flow cytometry results were analyzed using FlowJo™ v10.1 Software (BD Life Sciences). 300 μL of the sample was mixed with 4 mL ice cold PBS and the flow rate was adjusted to end up with an event rate of ~8000 events/sec. 100,000 events were recorded per sample. The top ~0.1 % of the total population depending on a SSC-A/PE-A plot were sorted into a 1.5 mL tube provided with 200 μL LB medium and cooled to 5 °C. The sorting was continued until at least 20-fold more processed events were screened than the theoretical diversity of the correspondent library was. All sorted cells were plated on appropriate LB agar plates and incubated for about 20 h at 30 °C. Those plates were harvested and grown over night in LB medium containing 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% (w/v) D-glucose at 30 °C under static conditions. From this culture, 1 mL of resuspended bacteria with an <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> of 3.3 used for the next selection cycle performed in the same way as the first one.</p><p id="P12">This was followed by evaluating the relative binding of the top clones using plate-based assays. At this stage, single colonies of bacteria pools which were enriched for 3 or 5 cycles of FACS-based sorting (as described in the section above) were grown overnight in 100 μL LB (supplemented with 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 μM IPTG) in a 96-well plate sealed with Breathe-Easy ® sealing membrane (Z380059, Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 °C with 1100 rpm on a table top shaker (Thermomixer comfort, Eppendorf) covered with aluminum foil. On the next day, the cells were centrifuged at 3200 g for 5 min, the supernatant was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in 150 μL PBS. The washing was repeated the same way one more time, and the cells were resuspended in 50 μL PBS containing 10 nM BioGCSFR. After the plate was incubated for 1 h at RT, the cells were washed once with 200 μL PBS and resuspended in 50 μL PBS. To visualize the binding activity of each displayed Boskar4 variant to BioGCSFR, two separate secondary stainings, one fluorescent and one chemiluminescent, were performed as follows:</p><p id="P13">For the fluorescent staining, 25 μL of the cells were mixed with 25 μL PBS containing 0.094 μL PE-streptavidin followed by a 30 min incubation at 4 °C in the dark. After washing the cells one more time with PBS, the <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> and the fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 495 nm, emission wavelength = 574 nm) were measured on a plate reader (Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader, BioTek).</p><p id="P14">For the chemiluminescence stain, 25 μL of the cells were mixed with 25 μL PBS containing 1.25 μg/mL Avidin-HRP conjugate (Invitrogen, 434423) followed by a 30 min incubation at 4 °C in the dark. Afterwards the cells were washed once with 200 μL PBS and resuspended in 100 μL PBS. The <italic>OD<sub>600</sub></italic> of each well was measured with the plate reader. In a separate dark plate (655097, Greiner Bio One) 12.5 μL cell suspension was added to 75 μL PBS. Then 12.5 μL ECL-substrate-solution (1705061, Bio-Rad) was pipetted quickly into each well, the plate was sealed with parafilm and mixed vigorously for 10 seconds on a vortex orbital shaker. Then the luminescence of each well was measured on the plate reader (Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader, Agilent BioTek) set to an integration time of 1 second, a gain of 135, normal read speed and a 100-millisecond delay, and a read height of 1 mm.</p><p id="P15">Both readouts were analyzed by normalizing to the corresponding cell density and calculating a z-score for each sample over all wells of the same condition. From the top 5 variants of each condition, plasmids were isolated with a plasmid preparation kit (740588, Macherey-Nagel) from a 3 mL overnight culture grown at 30 °C with 160 rpm in LB with 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% (w/v) D-glucose.</p><p id="P16">Finally, to obtain the expression-normalized binding of the top clones with unique sequences another FACS experiment was carried out. The individual bacteria clones carrying the display vector pN with Intimin fused either to Boskar4 or enhanced Boskar4 variant (bv1 to bv16) were grown over night at 30 °C with 160 rpm in 3 mL LB with the addition of 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 μM IPTG. The cells were pelleted at 4000 g for 3 min, the supernatant was discarded and the sample was resuspended in 1000 μL filtered PBS. This washing step was repeated one more time and the cells were resuspended in 1000 μL PBS. 45 μL of cells suspension were incubated for 90 min at RT in a total volume of 55 μL with 10 nM BioGCSFR and 1:200 Myc-Tag (9B11) Mouse mAb (2276, Cell Signaling Technology). After one wash with 500 μL PBS, the cells were resuspended in 200 μL of PBS containing 0.375 μL PE-Streptavidin (405203, BioLegend) and 0.5 μL of anti-mouse-IgG1 conjugated to Alexa 488 Fluor (A-21202, Invitrogen) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.

This construct lacks the Tyrosine kinase domain (TK) to eliminate any bias from downstream signaling activation. Simultaneous dual-color single molecule imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy enabled identifying individual G-CSFR dimers by co-localization and co-tracking analysis (Supplementary Movie S1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S16A</xref>).</p><p id="P47">As expected, G-CSFR dimerization was negligible in the resting state, but strongly stimulated by G-CSF and all design agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). While similar dimerization levels were observed for most design agonists, dimerization induced by ori2 and ori3 was significantly lower. Importantly, similar receptor cell surface densities were used in all experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S16B</xref>), thus ensuring that dimerization levels were not biased by the two-dimensional (2D) receptor concentration. Since the three-dimensional (3D) binding affinity of all design agonists is identical as they share the same bv6 binding site, the distinct differences in dimerization potencies of different design agonist can be ascribed by different 2D binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

With the formation of 1:1 G-CSFR:agonist complexes competing with G-CSFR dimerization, reduction in 2D binding affinity is accompanied by a lower maximum of the bell-shaped concentration-dimerization relationship of homomeric dimerizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Changes in dimerization efficiency can explain differences in the <italic>EC<sub>50</sub></italic> values, as the overall receptor binding affinity depends on dimerization efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], which was reported for synthetic ligands of EPOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, different G-CSFR dimerization levels induced by different design agonists did not directly correlate with their activity. For instance, ori1 showed substantially higher dimerization levels as compared to ori2, yet their NFS-60 proliferation activity was similar. Additionally, ori1 and ori0 had similar dimerization levels, but ori0 had about ten times higher proliferation activity compared to ori1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These results therefore confirm that biased signaling observed for our design agonists is related to the altered geometry of the signaling complex rather than weakened dimerization.</p><p id="P48">Our analysis of G-CSFR complexes indicated that their diffusion coefficients were similar among the different ligands, which were ~45% lower than unbound G-CSFR monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, the fraction of immobile G-CSFR increased by a factor of ~2, with ori3 showing surprisingly higher immobilization by a factor of ~3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Receptor immobilization is very likely caused by endocytosis, and therefore differences across design agonist may indicate altered endocytic uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Finally, we tested if the low-dimerizing ori2 can override native complex formation in the presence of G-CSF. We observed effective competition of G-CSF by ori2 at equimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S16C, D</xref>). Taken together, these results corroborate that our design agonists potently induce G-CSFR dimerization at the cell surface and that biased signaling can be explained by systematically altered complex geometries.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Different design agonists tune G-CSFR signaling amplitudes, kinetics and cellular response patterns</title><p id="P49">Since STAT3 phosphorylation occurs at the membrane-distal regions of the intracellular segments of the receptor, while STAT5 is phosphorylated at the membrane-proximal receptor region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], we reasoned that the relative ratio of pSTAT3/5 might be altered by different designs. Western blot analysis after stimulating NFS60 cells for 5 and 30 min confirmed increased phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3, Tyr705) levels for bv6_st2 as compared to B4_st2, confirming the increased potency by enhancing the affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S17</xref>). For the oris however, striking differences were observed: while after 5 and 30 minutes ori0 and ori2 reached similar pSTAT3 levels and activation kinetics to bv6_st2, markedly lower pSTAT3 levels were found for ori1 for 5 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>). Designed proteins showed substantially slower and prolonged STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5, Tyr694) in comparison to rhG-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, D</xref>). Again, bv6_st2 and ori0 phosphorylated STAT5 more efficiently than B4_st2, ori2, or ori1, but the magnitude of pSTAT5 levels was markedly weaker for all variants compared to rhG-CSF. These results highlight that amplitudes and kinetics of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation are affected by G-CSFR dimerization geometry.</p><p id="P50">G-CSF induces proliferation and granulocytic differentiation of HSPCs, and until now it is impossible to dissect these two cellular outcomes intentionally. Different magnitudes and kinetics of STAT3/STAT5 phosphorylation have different outcomes on HSPCs functions, where elevated pSTAT3 triggers myeloid differentiation, while elevated pSTAT5 induces cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. We found that the designed proteins alone triggered only weak proliferation compared to rhG-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), which was potentiated by IL-3 and SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). In line with previous observations, ori0 had the highest proliferative activity, but was still weaker than rhG-CSF. Nonetheless, ori0 was as active as rhG-CSF in inducing granulocytic differentiation of HSPCs when combined with IL-3 and SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G, H</xref>). Meanwhile, the other design agonists (ori1, ori2 and bv6_st2) did not significantly induce CFU-Gs in comparison with untreated cells. Interestingly, all the design agonists had a weak effect on the formation of monocytic colonies (CFU-M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>), suggesting their selective activation of granulocytic differentiation, when compared to rhG-CSF. These results further establish the role of G-CSFR association geometry in fine-tuning of STAT3/STAT5 phosphorylation and dissecting proliferation from granulocytic differentiation of HSPCs.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Designed G-CSFR agonists modulate intracellular transcriptional programs with hematopoietic bias</title><p id="P51">To assess the transcriptomic footprints of our design agonists, we carried out RNA-Seq of NFS-60 cells undergoing 8-h treatment with 1 nM of agonist or rhG-CSF. G-CSF regulated expression of 1950 genes compared to the PBS-treated control group (log FC 1, FDR less than 0.05). The number of differentially expressed genes was lower for all designs, and was affected by the inter-TMD spacing (e.g. 1292 genes for ori0 versus 524 genes for ori1) and binding affinity (e.g. 1115 genes for bv6_st2 versus 945 genes for B4_st2). Differentially regulated genes overlapped across all design agonists and were largely subsets of the rhG-CSF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, C</xref>).

In this work, we leverage the <italic>de novo</italic>-designed G-CSFR binder (Boskar4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] through affinity and geometry engineering to tune G-CSFR activity by inducing specific signaling patterns and thus distinct cellular activity.</p><p id="P54">By enhancing the design’s receptor binding affinity, and thus dimerization efficacy, we could create agonists with increased granulopoietic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The enhanced designs remained hyper-thermostable, in contrast to all previous studies aiming to improve the stability of rhG-CSF which only led to marginal improvements in its biophysical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. The design agonists stability and the diverse binding site sequences are invaluable for de-risking further optimization to cloak any immune epitopes during further pre-clinical development. After affinity, we sought to explore the role of receptor association geometry, whereby our results set forth the inter-TMD spacing G-CSFR subunits as another key parameter of signaling. The analysis of the phosphorylation of the main secondary messengers STAT3 and STAT5 revealed that design agonists with higher affinity and shorter inter-TMD spacing selectively increase the intracellular level of pSTAT3 while only minimally inducing pSTAT5. This might relate to the different localization of STAT3 and STAT5 along the intracellular segment of G-CSFR, and the mechanisms by which they are phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>], where the inter-TMD spacing can affect the balance between these two processes. Broadly speaking, pSTAT3 primarily guides differentiation, while pSTAT5 mainly drives proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Corresponding results were obtained through CFU assays in primary human HSPCs, where more affine and shorter-spacing designs led to more selective formation of granulocytic colonies, in comparison to G-CSF.</p><p id="P55">Single molecule fluorescence imaging confirmed the ability of most design agonists to potently dimerize G-CSFR at comparable levels to G-CSF. The reduced dimerization levels observed for ori2 and ori3 indicate that manipulating the geometry of G-CSFR dimers is accompanied by a loss of 2D association kinetics. Changes in signaling activity and specificity, however, cannot be attributed to changes in dimerization and rather support the idea that design agonists associate G-CSFR dimers with altered geometry. The very similar diffusion constants of all agonist-induced dimers, however, suggest more subtle changes in orientation as compared to the predicted structures, which should significantly reduce mobility. This could be explained by the additional strain imposed by membrane anchoring and additional interactions involving associated JAKs. Nonetheless, the distinct rise in the immobile fraction observed for ori3 points towards changes in endocytic uptake for that particular agonist. This warrants further investigation, as endocytic trafficking of cytokine receptor signaling complexes is emerging as a complex determinant regulating potency and kinetics of signal activation and the specificity of cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. Indeed, we observe distinctly reduced STAT5 phosphorylation magnitude and different kinetics of STAT3 phosphorylation for the different design agonists, which could be related to altered endocytic trafficking.</p><p id="P56">By looking at the gene expression footprints of our design:receptor constellations, we observed varying degrees of tuning of the G-CSFR-triggered transcription activation or inhibition, where the design agonists minimally affect the expression of genes that are not regulated by rhG-CSF. Thus, we could fine-tune G-CSFR signaling without regulating unexpected transcriptional pathways that are not linked to physiological G-CSFR activation. This information opens up an entirely new perspective in designing hematopoietic and granulopoietic proteins with specific activity and less unwanted functions, when compared to recombinant cytokines. To date, only <italic>de novo</italic> designed IL-2 and IL-4 mimics, that bind a subset of the natural cytokine’s heteromeric receptor subunits, could achieve more selective biological responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>].

These adverse outcomes motivate the discovery of G-CSFR ligands capable of selective induction of specific granulopoietic signaling on HSPCs with minimal effect on proliferation or immune cell functions. This study thus paves the way for the further development of potent, hyperstable, and selective tunable sub-agonists of G-CSFR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191783-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project has received funding from the IMPRS (TU, KM), the European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 863952 (ACE-OF-SPACE)) (PM), the M.
