The ICM segregates into pre-implantation naive epiblast cells, which retain pluripotency, and hypoblast, or primitive endoderm cells, which will give rise to extraembryonic cells of the parietal and visceral endoderm and tissues like the yolk sack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. A second population of the pre-implantation blastocyst, the trophectoderm, will give rise to cytotrophoblast, which is crucial for embryo implantation. At the time of implantation, epiblast cells polarise into rosettes leading to the formation of a lumen, which will expand into the future amniotic cavity. The epiblast forms a polarised columnar epithelium, with the apical side facing the amniotic cavity. The epithelial identity of the epiblast is then maintained until the gastrulation stage, as the formation of the primitive streak (PS) entails a transition from epithelial to mesenchymal identity and loss of pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. It still remains unclear whether epithelial identity and pluripotency of the post-implantation epiblast are tightly coupled and whether one affects the other. It is also unclear what signals induce and maintain the epithelial identity in the post-implantation epiblast. The Zernicka-Goetz laboratory reported a critical role for the basal membrane, or basement membrane, produced by the primitive and visceral endoderm and required for the polarization and maturation of the mouse epiblast epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, remodelling of the basement membrane allows, in mouse embryos, for the expansion of the PS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the requirement for a basement membrane does not rule out the presence of instructive signals in this context, in particular in the case of the human post-implantation epiblast, which is understudied for both technical and ethical reasons.</p><p id="P6">Conventional human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are either derived from human embryos as Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, or via reprogramming of somatic cells as induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Conventional human PSCs are cultured as 2D monolayers and are molecularly close to the post-implantation epiblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. They have been extensively used to study the molecular circuitries controlling the maintenance of pluripotency and their differentiation towards germ layers. Transcription factors including POU5F1/OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, PRDM14 and ZNF398, are either required or sufficient to maintain human pluripotency in PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These transcription factors cross-regulate each other, forming a network that is stabilised by signalling via the canonical TGF-beta, FGF and Insulin pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Culture of PSCs in a 2D monolayer however does not capture the spatial constraints and cell-cell dynamics of the early embryo. To overcome such limitations several 3D models of the human post-implantation embryo have been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. These are useful tools for the study of cell-cell communication and self-organisation, which advanced our understanding of some developmental processes. For example, it has been shown that lumenogenesis of the epiblast is controlled by actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, that amnion specification occurs in response to BMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and that the production of the basement membrane of hypoblast cells is induced by TGF-beta ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Across these models, there is a clear trade-off between the complexity (i.e. number of cell types generated) and the efficiency/reproducibility (e.g. fraction of structures correctly organised). Moreover, the presence of multiple cell types and the use of undefined reagents (i.e. conditioned medium, foetal serum or KO serum replacement) might represent a hurdle to identifying the molecules controlling a process of interest.</p><p id="P8">For these reasons, we optimised a minimal model of the post-implantation epiblast. Under chemically defined conditions, conventional PSCs undergo lumenogenesis and form a polarised columnar epithelium. Epithelial identity is then maintained until a symmetry-breaking event occurs, in which mesenchymal TBXT+ cells are formed. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) confirmed the acquisition of post-implantation epiblast and PS identities.</p><p id="P9">TGF-beta signalling is crucial during the initial 48 hours for the establishment of epithelial identity, which appears uncoupled from the expression of pluripotency OCT4, NANOG and PRDM14, but under the control of ZNF398. Once the pluripotent epithelium is established, TGF-beta inhibition is inconsequential, while stimulation with the TGF-beta ligand Activin A alone leads to efficient mesoderm induction. We conclude that TGF-beta dynamically orchestrates the epithelial identity of post-implantation pluripotent cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Efficient generation of a 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> minimal model of epiblast-like structures resembling post-implantation epiblast and primitive streak</title><p id="P10">After implantation, epiblast cells self-organise in a columnar epithelium that undergoes lumenogenesis, while maintaining pluripotency.

With the aim of studying the mechanisms controlling the epithelial identity of the epiblast, we optimised a chemically defined 3D epiblast model. We first analysed scRNAseq data of human embryos asking what signals the post-implantation epiblast might be responsive to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-b</xref>). All 4 FGF receptors (FGFR1/2/3/4), Insulin and IGF1/2 receptors, TGF-beta (TGFBR1/2/3) and Nodal/Activin receptors (ACVR2A/B) were highly expressed in the post-implantation epiblast. Moreover, the ligands FGF2, FGF4, NODAL and TGF-beta 1 were expressed by the post-implantation epiblast; NODAL and IGF1 were highly expressed in the hypoblast, while TGF-beta 1, Activin A and IGF2 were highly expressed by cytotrophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-b</xref>). We conclude that in the post-implantation epiblast, the TGF-beta, FGF and Insulin/IGF pathways could be active, thus we decided to use a chemically defined medium (E8), which contains ligands of these 3 pathways.</p><p id="P11">We plated a suspension of single hPSCs on top of a layer of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (GFRM) in E8 medium containing 5% GFRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). By optimising the number of cells plated, we observed the efficient formation of cell aggregates that after 2 days started to form a lumen and at day 4 appeared as large cysts composed of a columnar epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). From 50,000 single cells seeded we obtained 11652 +/- 1400 cysts at day 4, and &gt;95% displayed the correct formation of a lumen and epithelial organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The cysts displayed apical accumulation of F-actin and basal nuclei, as reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Up to day 4 the cysts maintained expression of pluripotency markers NANOG, OCT4 and ZNF398 at levels higher than those of conventional hPSCs in 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Pluripotent cells of the epiblast form the PS, a migratory cell population of the human embryo, transiently expressing TBXT (also known as T or BRACHYURY), GATA6, MIXL1 and EOMES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> ultimately giving rise to the mesoderm and endoderm germ layers. We observed robust expression of several PS/mesoderm markers from day 4 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>), with TBXT+ cells forming clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results were unexpected, given that we did not provide exogenous BMP or WNT ligands, which induce PS in several human <italic>in vitro</italic> models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

These results indicate that autocrine WNT and BMP signalling might be responsible for the induction of PS genes.</p><p id="P14">Next, we performed scRNAseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> to determine the identity of individual cells forming cystic structures. We analysed the PSCs cultured in 2D used to form 3D structures (day 0) and structures collected at day 2, 4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a, left</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We identified 6 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a, right</xref>).

Cluster F comprised only cells from day 0 and day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>), which expressed only SOX2, but no other pluripotency or PS markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). We conclude that these cells underwent rapid spontaneous differentiation, they failed to maintain any defined cell identity, and thus we excluded them from further analyses.</p><p id="P16">Next, we integrated our scRNAseq data with data from human embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

These conditions lead to the formation of rosette structures after 96 hours, with basal nuclei and apical accumulation of F-actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). Inhibition of TGF-beta throughout the process led to the formation of structures in which the epithelial organisation was lost and cavity formation was impaired in ~30% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Pou5f1, also known as Oct4, is highly expressed in rosettes, like in the peri-implantation embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and its expression is reduced by TGF-beta inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Second, we combined wild-type mouse ESCs with inducible-Gata4 ESCs in the absence of exogenous extracellular matrix proteins. This system has been shown to self-organise into structures with an inner epiblast-like layer of pluripotent, OCT4 positive cells, surrounded by a layer of visceral endoderm (VE)-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-f</xref>). Accumulation of F-actin and Podocalyxin strongly marks VE-like cells as well as the lumen-facing, apical side of the epiblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Inhibition of TGF-beta completely ablated lumen formation and epithelial organisation. F-actin and Podocalyxin staining was retained only by VE-like cells, but was not detected in the core of the structures, indicating impaired polarisation. The expression of Oct4 was dramatically reduced both at the protein and mRNA levels. We conclude that TGF-beta is required for the correct organisation of a pluripotent epithelium and for maintenance of the pluripotency marker Oct4, as also observed in our human PSC-based model.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ZNF398 promotes epithelial identity downstream of TGF-beta</title><p id="P29">We previously reported that ZNF398 induces pluripotency and epithelial identity downstream of the TGF-beta pathway in hPSCs in 2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, thus we wondered whether it could also play a role during the self-organisation of hPSCs in 3D.

However, TGF-beta signalling is also known to induce PS and mesendoderm specification in several model systems, including human PSCs.

Given that 3D-hE-gastruloids recapitulate both processes, we decided to exploit it to study TGF-beta responsiveness at different times. As PS-like cells of 3D-hE-gastruloids expressed MIXL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>), we employed a MIXL1-GFP HES3 reporter hESC line.</p><p id="P34">We allowed for the acquisition of epithelial identity in E8 for 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

However, our results indicate that additional instructive cues are needed, as hPSCs cannot form a correctly organised epiblast epithelium in the absence of TGF-beta signalling, even though a basement membrane is provided. Thus TGF-beta actively stabilises epithelial identity, as we previously reported for hPSCs in 2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">Interestingly, 2 days of TGF-beta signal are sufficient to stabilise the epithelial identity. In contrast, the expression of key pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and PRDM14 requires constant TGF-beta stimulation. If TGF-beta signal is present only for the first 2 days, we obtained structures with full epithelial character that lost expression of pluripotency markers. In other words, the epithelial identity is maintained for several days even in the absence of key pluripotency factors.</p><p id="P41">We also observed that ZNF398 is sufficient to induce epithelial identity downstream of TGF-beta. Indeed, hPSCs stably expressing a ZNF398 transgene can form, in the absence of TGF-beta, 3D structures with stable epithelial identity, while key pluripotency factors are not expressed. Based on these observations we conclude that epithelial identity and pluripotency are two separate, uncoupled processes, as cells can lose pluripotency while maintaining their epithelial character.</p><p id="P42">In the gastrulating embryo, some epiblast cells form the PS and lose both epithelial identity and pluripotency. However, epiblast cells not contributing to the PS will default towards ectoderm lineage, losing pluripotency while maintaining epithelial identity, indicating that also during embryonic development the two processes are uncoupled.</p><p id="P43">Epithelial identity appears to be stable once established, unless an external cue induces an EMT. Conversely, pluripotency needs constant support by external cues. These two behaviours underlie different needs of the developing embryo: pluripotency is an intrinsically unstable state that should be rapidly extinguished upon germ layer specification, while epithelial identity is found in several tissues and should be maintained throughout development and in the adult.</p><p id="P44">TGF-beta signalling is known to induce EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and PS, as we also observed in our model.

Although TGFB1 and Activin A should activate the same downstream mediators (i.e. SMAD2 and SMAD3), they might do so with different intensities and durations. For instance, the Siggia and Brivanlou laboratories showed in human 2D gastruloids, in which PSCs form spatially defined territories of embryonic and extraembryonic cell populations in response to extracellular cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, that a transient SMAD2 activation is sufficient to induce pluripotency genes, while a more prolonged activation is needed for mesendodermal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P47">Third, SMAD2/3 can interact with different transcription factors in a stage-dependent manner, like OCT4 in PSCs and FOXH1 in mesodermal precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, resulting in the regulation of different transcriptional programs.</p><p id="P48">We observed a strongly increased responsiveness to Activin A in 3D conditions compared to 2D, in terms of induction of PS/mesoderm.
