While the proneural factor Ascl1 is widely used for neuronal reprogramming, in the early postnatal mouse cortex Ascl1 fails to induce glia-to-neuron conversion, instead promoting proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Since Ascl1 activity is post-translationally regulated, here we investigated the consequences of mutating six serine phospho-acceptor sites to alanine (Ascl1SA6) on lineage reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ascl1SA6 exhibited increased neurogenic activity in glia of the early postnatal mouse cortex, an effect enhanced by co-expression of Bcl2. Genetic fate-mapping revealed that most induced neurons originated from astrocytes while only a few derived from OPCs. Intriguingly, many Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-induced neurons expressed parvalbumin and were capable of high-frequency action potential firing. Our study demonstrates authentic conversion of astroglia into neurons featuring subclass hallmarks of cortical interneurons, advancing our scope of engineering neuronal fates in the brain.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Changing the identity of a terminally differentiated cell into another desired cell type via lineage reprogramming is an emerging experimental strategy for tissue repair in organs with little or no endogenous stem cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In the context of the CNS, the generation of induced neurons (iNs) from other resident cell types, such as glial cells, opens new avenues for the remodeling and restoration of diseased brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Following pioneering studies demonstrating the possibility of generating iNs from primary glia <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), proof-of-principle studies have since provided evidence for glia-to-neuron conversion in various brain areas <italic>in vivo</italic> through ectopic expression of proneural transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). More recently, however, important concerns about the authenticity and efficiency of <italic>in vivo</italic> glia-to-neuron conversion have been raised since many studies lacked effective lineage tracing to demonstrate the glial origin of iNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Indeed, subsequent efforts that scrutinized the origin of putative iNs uncovered inadvertent labeling of endogenous neurons that could not be traced back to a glial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This emphasizes the importance of robust genetic fate mapping to unambiguously determine the glial origin of iNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor achaete-scute complex-like 1 (Ascl1) is a key regulator of neural fate decisions ranging from cellular proliferation and cell cycle exit to neural fate specification in the embryonic and adult nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Given its neurogenic activity, Ascl1 has been widely and successfully used for converting somatic cells such as fibroblasts, glia and other cell types into iNs <italic>in vitro</italic>, either alone or in combination with other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, the neurogenic activity of Ascl1 is highly cell- and context-dependent. For instance, on its own, Asc1 failed to convert glia in the early postnatal cortex into neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and instead promoted the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Likewise, when expressed without other factors, Ascl1 reprogrammed reactive glia in the lesioned adult cortex or the epileptic hippocampus into iNs only inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). While several studies have highlighted the capacity of Ascl1 to act as a pioneer transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), the high degree of variability of Ascl1 effects <italic>in vivo</italic> is suggestive of additional layers of regulation that may hinder its neurogenic activity. Indeed, Ascl1 activity has been shown to be regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Interestingly, preventing phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Ascl1 activity by mutating serine residues of six serine-proline motifs to alanine (Ascl1SA6), has been found to increase its neurogenic activity in the embryonic cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This finding has led us to hypothesize that employing the Ascl1SA6 mutant variant as a reprogramming factor could enhance glia-to-neuron conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P4">Here we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated overexpression of Ascl1SA6 in glia undergoing proliferative expansion in the early postnatal mouse cerebral cortex has enhanced neurogenic capacity compared to that of wildtype (wt) Ascl1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we found that co-expression of Ascl1SA6 with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), previously demonstrated to enhance iN survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), can more efficiently reprogram postnatal cortical glia into iNs. Through genetic fate mapping, we show that iNs originate predominantly from astrocytes and to a much lesser degree from OPCs. Intriguingly, we also found that Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-induced neurons frequently exhibit hallmarks of fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons, an important subclass of GABAergic interneurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A phospho-site mutant of Ascl1 exhibits enhanced neuronal reprogramming activity <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P5">We have recently established an experimental model to explore glia-to-neuron conversion in the early postnatal mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), in which MMLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus) retroviruses enable efficient targeting of both astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergoing proliferative expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Given that we had previously observed that Ascl1 failed to induce substantial neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), here we wondered whether utilizing a more neurogenic phospho-site mutant Ascl1 (Ascl1SA6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), in which six serine-proline sites had been altered to alanine-proline exhibited improved neuronal reprogramming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). To address this question, we compared the effects of Ascl1- or Ascl1SA6-encoding retroviruses upon injection in the mouse cerebral cortex at postnatal day 5 (P5). When analyzed at 12 days post injection (dpi), a time point when previous studies had observed successful glia-to-neuron conversion by other neurogenic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), we found that Ascl1 elicited very limited expression of immature and mature neuronal markers doublecortin (Dcx) and NeuN, respectively, in transduced cells, which mostly retained glial morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). In sharp contrast, MMLV retrovirus-mediated expression of Ascl1SA6 induced neuronal marker expression (Dcx, NeuN, or both) in almost half of the transduced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B, C</xref>). These data suggest that the activity of Ascl1 in proliferative glia is subject to post-translational regulation and that the phospho-site mutant is more powerful in inducing neuronal fate conversion from glia than wt Ascl1.</p><p id="P6">Glial cells undergoing reprogramming by forced expression of proneural transcription factors are susceptible to cell death via ferroptosis, which can be mitigated by co-expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Thus, we next examined the effect of Bcl2 co-expression alongside Ascl1 or Ascl1SA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cells transduced with Bcl2 alone (GFP+) retained glial identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). While Ascl1 expression alone showed negligible lineage conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>), when co-expressed with Bcl2 we observed a significant neurogenic response, as determined by Dcx and NeuN immunoreactivity in double-transduced cells (GFP+/RFP+) at 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Neuronal fate conversion was further enhanced when Bcl2 was co-expressed with Ascl1SA6, resulting in higher levels of NeuN expression and the appearance of cells with clear neuronal morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Twenty-eight days after retroviral injection (28 dpi), the vast majority of Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs did not express NeuN and maintained glial morphology, while around 80% of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs expressed NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Thus, the enhanced neurogenic activity of the phospho-site mutant Ascl1SA6 versus wt Ascl1 is further potentiated when combined with Bcl2.</p><p id="P7">To ascertain the specificity of the MMLV retroviral vectors in stably transducing only proliferating glial cells and rule out unintended labeling of endogenous post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), we injected thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label proliferating cells on the day of, and day following, MMLV retrovirus injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). As expected, we found that a large proportion of transduced cells were BrdU-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B, C</xref>). Importantly, we found that the vast majority (~ 80%) of retroviral transduced cells that had acquired a neuronal morphology were BrdU-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B, C</xref>) and co-expressed NeuN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>), indicating that iNs derived from cells that had proliferated during this stage of postnatal cortical development. Interestingly, we consistently observed that the level of the BrdU signal was lower in cells retaining glial morphology, possibly due to dilution of the BrdU signal as a result of continued proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E-G</xref>). These data provide indirect evidence that lineage conversion from glia to neuron occurs in the absence of significant cell division, as iNs maintain significantly higher BrdU signal levels as compared to non-reprogrammed glia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Astroglial origin of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs</title><p id="P8">Several glial cell types undergo local proliferation in the early postnatal cortex and could, therefore, be targeted by our retroviral constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), raising the question of the cellular origins of iNs following Ascl1SA6 and Bcl2 mediated lineage conversion in early postnatal cortex. To address this question, we combined reprogramming with Ascl1SA6 and Bcl2 together with genetic fate mapping. Astrocytes were fate-mapped using Aldh1l1-CreERT2/RCE:loxP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), in which Cre-dependent recombination of CAG-boosted EGFP expression was induced by administration of tamoxifen in the days preceding viral injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To allow for tracing EGFP-positive cells expressing the two reprogramming factors, we designed a single retroviral vector encoding for both Ascl1SA6 and Bcl2 (Ascl1SA6-Bcl2) and the DsRed reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), which exhibited a similar reprogramming efficacy as the individual vectors when injected in wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). Tamoxifen-treated Aldh1l1-CreERT2/RCE:loxP mice were injected with the Ascl1SA6-Bcl2 encoding retrovirus at P5 and the identity of fate-mapped cells was analyzed by immunostaining for GFP (identifying cells of astroglial origin), DsRed (identifying transduced cells) and Dcx or NeuN (identifying iNs) at 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that more than two-thirds of the DsRed-positive transduced cells also expressed EGFP (i.e., retrovirus-targeted cells of astroglial origin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-E</xref> white and yellow sections, large pie charts). Of these transduced astroglial cells, a high proportion was immunoreactive for Dcx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, D</xref>) and NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, E</xref>). Importantly, of all cells classified as iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref> white and pink sections, large pie charts) 80 % could be lineage-traced to astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref> white sections, small pie charts). To independently confirm these results, we performed lineage tracing in mGFAP-Cre/ RCE:loxP mice in which astrocytes are stably labelled with EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Similarly, we found that a substantial proportion of Dcx-positive and NeuN-positive transduced cells were also EGFP-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B-E</xref>). These results unambiguously confirmed the astroglial origin of a substantial proportion of Ascl1SA6-Bcl2 iNs.</p><p id="P9">OPCs also sustain high proliferation in the postnatal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and are transduced by retroviruses injected in the P5 postnatal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We therefore tested next whether cells of the oligodendroglial lineage were also converted by Ascl1SA6-Bcl2 into Dcx-positive or NeuN-positive iNs. To this end, genetic fate mapping was performed in NG2-CreERTM/RCE:loxP transgenic mice, in which cells with an active <italic>Cspg4</italic> locus encoding neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) are stably labelled by EGFP reporter expression upon tamoxifen injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that only approximately 3% of DsRed-positive transduced cells also expressed EGFP and Dcx or NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-I</xref>), suggesting that a very small fraction of the Ascl1SA6-Bcl2 iNs were of oligodendroglial origin. To validate that MMLV retrovirus-transduced OPCs could be effectively lineage traced, we injected a control MMLV retrovirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). We found that 22% of all transduced cells could be lineage traced to the oligodendroglial lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G-H</xref>), consistent with a previous characterization of MMLV retrovirus targeted glial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). As expected, transduced cells that were not fate-mapped were mostly Sox9-positive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G-H</xref>). Altogether, our genetic fate mapping experiments demonstrate the authenticity of Ascl1SA6-Bcl2 glia-to-neuron lineage conversion in the early postnatal cortex, with astrocytes being the predominant cellular origins for observed iNs. Despite our retroviral vectors being able to successfully transduce cortical OPCs, these contribute only a very small fraction of iNs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Parvalbumin expression in Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs</title><p id="P10">A central aim of glia-to-neuron conversion is to identify reprogramming factors that allow for the generation of neurons with subtype-specific features <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ascl1 is known to be a pioneer transcription factor involved in GABAergic neuronal fate specification at early embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). At 28 dpi, we detected GABA immunoreactivity in a very small fraction of Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs. In contrast, approximately 25% of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs expressed this marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>), consistent with a role of unphosphorylated Ascl1 in GABAergic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). To further characterize these iNs, we next examined whether they had acquired hallmarks of main subclasses of cortical interneurons such as expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) or the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). At 28 dpi, SST mRNA was found neither in Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs nor in AsclSA6/Bcl2 iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Likewise, virtually none of the Ascl1/Bcl2 transduced cells expressed PV. Remarkably, however, approximately 20% of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs acquired PV immunoreactivity at 28 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). Further, smFISH revealed that Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs expressed PV mRNA already at 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F, G</xref>), albeit at lower levels than endogenous PV cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Taken together, these results show that overexpression of Ascl1SA6 and Bcl2 can induce the conversion of postnatal cortical glia into iNs expressing both GABA and PV.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fast-spiking phenotype of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs</title><p id="P11">PV-positive cortical interneurons show characteristic electrophysiological properties including fast-spiking (FS) firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Given the expression of GABA and parvalbumin in our Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs, we next asked whether they acquired functional properties reminiscent of FS/PV interneurons by performing patch-clamp recordings in acute <italic>ex vivo</italic> cortical slices at 28 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, C</xref>). While Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs, mostly retained glial-like membrane properties, Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs showed significantly higher input resistances, and exhibited an overall tendency towards more negative resting membrane potentials and greater membrane capacitances, which were suggestive of an immature neuronal phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A-C</xref>). Consistent with this, Ascl1/Bcl2 cells had the ability to generate only a single spikelet followed by non-regenerative membrane potential oscillations in response to sustained depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This single spikelet was blocked by tetrodotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), confirming that it was mediated by voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Only one Ascl1/Bcl2 cell out of 13 cells recorded showed passive responses to depolarizing current pulses.</p><p id="P12">In sharp contrast, all Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 cells recorded (n=14 cells) were able to repetitively fire well-developed action potentials in response to depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-E</xref>). About half of them generated sustained trains of spikes with an instantaneous firing frequency in the range of 50 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Remarkably, the other half of the recorded cells exhibited sustained high-frequency firing, reaching frequencies above 150 Hz with a small drop in frequency firing during a period of constant activation (i.e., adaptation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E, F</xref>) - two distinctive features of endogenous cortical FS interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Most Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs exhibited a narrow action potential that included a well-developed afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in response to 10-ms somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>), resembling action potential waveforms of endogenous FS interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). As expected, the amplitude of the action potential and the AHP of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs were significantly higher, and the action potential half-width was significantly shorter than their counterparts in Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B-D</xref>). We also evaluated whether iNs became integrated into the host circuitry by monitoring spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Consistent with the immature functional phenotype of Ascl1/Bcl2 iNs, only a small proportion of these cells exhibited spontaneous synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7D, F, G</xref>). In contrast, the vast majority of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs exhibited postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7E, F, G</xref>) that were blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor blocker CNQX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7H</xref>). Interestingly, while the number of iNs receiving synaptic input were fewer in the Ascl1/Bcl2 compared to AScl1SA6/Bcl2 group (Ascl1/Bcl2: 4/13 cells vs Ascl1SA6/Bcl2: 11/14 cells), the inputs did not differ significantly in frequency and amplitude between the two cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7F, G</xref>). Since we observed FS properties in iNs, we analyzed the expression of the delayed rectifying potassium channel Kv3.1 in iNs. Kv3.1 expression is mainly restricted to FS cortical interneurons and is critical for FS properties by providing rapid membrane repolarization after an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Accordingly, we found that most of the Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs expressed Kv3.1 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>), albeit at lower levels than endogenous interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>).

At 28 dpi, the relative proportion of PV-positive Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 iNs in layer I was similar to that found in deeper layers (layers II-VI), suggesting that PV-positive iNs are generated similarly across different layers of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

While the proportion of astrocytes targeted by the Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mouse line is very high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), it does not capture all cortical astrocytes.

The enhanced neurogenic potential of the mutant variant reported here could be attributed to different mechanisms of action: i) Higher protein stability of Ascl1SA6 due to differences in ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) that might increase the efficiency to target binding sites with less accessibility, such as neuronal differentiation genes; ii) changes in binding properties, e.g., different binding partners by Ascl1SA6 compared to wt Ascl1. Indeed, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the proneural factor Neurogenin 2 (Neurog2) promotes binding to LIM-homeodomain transcription factors in the embryonic spinal cord to induce a motor neuron fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>); iii) mutations might cause direct changes in protein structure, enhancing the pioneer activity of Ascl1SA6, especially given that phosphorylation adds a negative charge that might interfere with interactions with negatively charged DNA.

While our retroviral approach targets both proliferative astrocytes and OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), we found that astrocytes are more efficiently converted into iNs by Ascl1SA6/Bcl2 compared to OPCs. Which subtypes of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) were converted into iNs and whether astrocyte heterogeneity may have an impact on reprogramming competence remains to be elucidated. Given that OPCs can be transduced by control retroviruses in a proportion of around 20% of the total transduced cells, it is intriguing that less than 3% of Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-iNs were OPC-derived. One intriguing possibility may consist in differential phosphorylation of serine 150 in the second helix region of Ascl1, due to enhanced activity of a non-proline directed serine/threonine kinase in OPCs as compared to astrocytes. Phosphorylation of this serine has been proposed as a general off-switch for proneural factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Alternatively, neurogenic activity of Ascl1SA6 might induce enhanced cell death of OPCs despite retroviral Bcl2 expression. The limited reprogramming competence of OPCs in the early postnatal cortex contrasts with the high reprogramming competence of OPCs previously observed in the injured adult brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P18">A key finding of our study is the observation that Ascl1SA6 promotes the emergence of FS phenotype and PV expression from glia <italic>in vivo</italic>, properties that are hallmarks of FS/PV+ GABAergic interneurons.

Recording pipettes (10-15 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (BF150-86-10, Sutter Instruments, Novato, USA or 1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA) in a horizontal pipette puller (P-1000 Micropipette puller, Sutter Instruments, Novato, USA) and were filled with (in mM): K-gluconate, 125; NaCl, 5; Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10; and biocytin, 10 to allow a posterior morphological analysis; pH 7.4, osmolarity, 280 mOsm. Voltage and current clamp recordings were obtained using Axopatch 200B or MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA), digitized (Digidata 1440A or 1550B, Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA), and acquired at 20 kHz onto a personal computer using the pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) which was also used for further analysis. Criteria to include cells in the analysis were: 1) visual confirmation of GFP or DsRED in the pipette tip, 2) attachment of the labeled soma to the pipette when suction was performed, 3) seal resistances between 4 and 18 GΩ, 4) initial series resistance less than 40 MΩ and did not change by more than 20% throughout the recording period. Whole-cell capacitance and series resistances were not compensated. In current-clamp recordings, the membrane potential was kept at -70 mV or adjusted to different values, if necessary, by passing a holding current. Passive and active membrane properties were recorded by applying a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps (2 or 10 pA steps, 500 ms). The instantaneous firing frequency (IFF) was calculated as the inverse value of the inter-spike interval, which was determined by the time difference between adjacent action potential peaks. Maximum firing frequency was calculated dividing the number of spikes by the step duration. The resting membrane potential (RMP) was assessed immediately after break-in by reading the voltage value in the absence of current injection (I=0 configuration). Input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was calculated from the peak of the voltage response to a -20 pA, 500 ms current step according to Ohm’s law (Vhold = -70 mV). The membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) was obtained with the following equation: membrane time constant (τ<sub>m</sub>) = R<sub>in</sub>.C<sub>m</sub>. τ<sub>m</sub> was derived from single exponential fitted to voltage response to - 20 pA, 500 ms current step. The action potential properties were analyzed on the first spike observed at the rheobase. Spike amplitude was measured from threshold to positive peak and after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude, from threshold to negative peak during repolarization. Spike width was measured at the half amplitude of the spike. Frequency and amplitude of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded during 60 s in mode Gap-free at Vhold = -70 mV and the analysis was done using Clampfit template search (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). No correction was made for the junction potential between the pipette and the ACSF. In some experiments, tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM, Tocris, Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, USA) to block Na channels or 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 µM, Tocris, Minneapolis, USA) to block AMPA/kainate receptors were introduced to the standard ACSF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Morphological identification of the recorded cells</title><p id="P29">Retroviral transduced cells expressing DsRed or GFP were first imaged in acute slices. During whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, cells were filled with biocytin included in the pipette. Then, slices were fixed by immersion in 4% PFA for 24 hours. Following TBS rinsing, the slices were blocked with 0.5% BSA in TBS (1 hour) and then incubated in TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 with the streptavidin-fluorophore complex, 1:400, for 2 hours, and subsequently mounted for confocal imaging.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P30">Statistical analysis was performed using OriginLab (Northampton, Massachusetts, USA) or GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) or SPSS Statistics V5 (IBM).
