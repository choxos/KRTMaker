However, the identification of highly selective small molecule drugs against these channels has been challenging due to the high degree of structural and functional conservation that exists not only between K2P channels, but across the whole K+ channel superfamily. To address the issue of selectivity, we generated camelid antibody fragments (nanobodies) against the TREK-2 (<italic>KCNK10</italic>) K2P K<sup>+</sup> channel and identified selective binders including several that directly modulate channel activity. X-ray crystallography and CryoEM data of these nanobodies in complex with TREK-2 also reveal insights into their mechanisms of activation and inhibition via binding to the extracellular loops and Cap domain, as well as their suitability for immunodetection. It also facilitated design of a biparatropic inhibitory nanobody with markedly improved affinity and efficacy. These new tools therefore provide important insights into TREK channel gating and suggest alternative, highly selective approach to modulation of K2P channel activity via their extracellular domains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Ion channels control or contribute to the electrical activity and function of almost every living cell. Their selective pharmacological manipulation therefore offers wide-ranging approaches to plant, animal and human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In particular, the regulation of K<sup>+</sup>-selective ion channels presents therapeutic potential for a wide variety of human disorders including epilepsy, arrhythmias and various other cardiovascular diseases and neurological conditions, especially the control of pain. Significant effort has therefore been expended in the identification of drugs that target specific types of K<sup>+</sup> channels for the treatment of such disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, although there are over 80 different K<sup>+</sup> channel genes in the human genome, most have a similar architecture in their pore region because this highly conserved structural feature facilitates the selective permeation of K<sup>+</sup> as well as some of the conserved gating mechanisms they employ. As a consequence, the identification of highly selective small molecule agonists and/or antagonists that exhibit no cross-reactivity with other K<sup>+</sup> channels is challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Two-Pore Domain K<sup>+</sup> channels (K2P) are a distinct subset of K<sup>+</sup> channels where each gene encodes a subunit with two pore-forming domains that dimerise to create a single pseudotetrameric K<sup>+</sup> selective channel across the membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These channels underlie the background K<sup>+</sup> currents that control the membrane potential in many different cell types where their activity is often regulated by diverse stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In particular, the TREK subfamily of K2P channels (TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK) are regulated by a wide variety of physical and chemical stimuli. This polymodal regulation allows them to integrate cellular electrical activity with a diverse range of cellular signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">A number of structures now exist for members of the TREK subfamily that has allowed detailed gating models to be proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Like many other K<sup>+</sup> channels, movement of the pore-lining helices, in particular the M4 helix appears important for the regulation of TREK channel gating. However, unlike many other K<sup>+</sup> channels these movements do not constrict a lower ‘bundle-crossing-like’ gate at the cytoplasmic entrance to the pore. Instead, the channel appears to be gated primarily by much smaller structural changes in the selectivity filter with the ‘M4 Up’ conformation supporting a more active state of the channel than the M4 down conformations. However, there is evidence that the channel can support K<sup>+</sup> conduction in both conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests that the movement of M4 couples to the filter gate via changes in the network of interactions that support the selectivity filter in its activated state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">The expression of TREK channels within the central and peripheral nervous systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and their involvement in processes such as pain perception, neuroprotection, and anaesthesia makes them attractive therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Recent approaches have focused on the development of TREK channel agonists as potential analgesics and several lead compounds have been identified that target different elements of the gating mechanism within the selectivity filter of the channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, although such small molecules have proven to be highly effective agonists, and much is now known about their mechanism of action, they often exhibit cross reactivity within the TREK subfamily. Also, in many cases, these agonists activate other classes of K<sup>+</sup> channel thereby limiting their potential use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Other approaches to target these channels may therefore be required.</p><p id="P8">For some classes of ion channels, the adaptation of channel toxins and the development of RNA-based antagonists has been successful in achieving greater target selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, but perhaps the most promising approaches involve biologics that exploit protein-protein interactions for target recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Many antibody-based therapies are now in clinical use for the treatment of a variety of disorders and have a number of potential benefits compared to traditional approaches although their identification and development can be costly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Nanobodies are single-domain (V<sub>HH</sub>) antibodies derived from camelid heavy chain antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

Briefly, purified human TREK-2 protein, identical to that used in previous structural studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> was used to elicit an immune response in llamas. The resulting immune repertoire was isolated and positive clones selected by phage panning and screening against the same TREK-2 protein. Overall, a panel of 29 unique nanobodies were produced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and these were further examined for their ability to produce a peak shift on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to determine which nanobodies were capable of forming tight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These tight binders were considered more suitable for subsequent structural and/or functional applications.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Screening for functional effects</title><p id="P13">To determine possible functional effects of the nanobodies on channel activity, human TREK-2 channels were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and currents measured before and after extracellular addition of nanobody (0.5 μM). An increase (or decrease) in current size by more than 50% was used as the initial threshold in this screen. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and reveal that from this initial panel, three exhibited clear functional modulation of TREK-2: nanobody CA10761 inhibited channel activity, whilst CA10767 and CA10776 both activated TREK-2. Functional effects of these nanobodies were also consistent with their tight binding as determined in the SEC shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These modulatory nanobodies were then selected for further structural studies. Another tight binder that exhibited no functional effect (CA10758) was also included.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Nanobody binding to the extracellular Cap domain</title><p id="P14">Structures of these four nanobodies in complex with TREK-2 were then determined by X-ray crystallography using approaches similar to those previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and were resolved between 2.4 Å and 3.6 Å resolution. For clarity these nanobodies were also renamed to reflect their functional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P15">All four of these nanobodies exhibited binding to the extracellular Cap domain of TREK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the functionally inactive binder only interacted with the extracellular tip of the Cap domain whilst the modulatory nanobodies interact with both the Cap and extracellular loops much closer to the selectivity filter where the primary gate is located. In one case (CA10767), binding was also observed to the intracellular face as well as the Cap domain. The properties of these structures and the functional effects of each modulatory nanobody are described in more detail below.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Immunodetection of TREK-2 expression at the cell surface</title><p id="P16">Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of nanobodies for immunodetection as well as in various immunoassays and other nanobody-based protein targeting strategies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The structures determined above show that these TREK-2 nanobodies bind to the extracellular Cap domain indicating that immunodetection of TREK-2 at the cell surface should be possible. To examine this, we chose the functionally inactive nanobody CA10758 which interacts with the most exposed tip of the Cap domain. This nanobody is hereafter referred to as Nb-Binder-58 (or Nb-58).</p><p id="P17">Many K2P channels exhibit N-linked glycosylation to their extracellular surfaces that may affect nanobody binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, only one glycosylation site exists within TREK-2 in the extracellular loop that precedes Pore-Helix-1 (PH1). None of the four chosen nanobodies interact with, or near this loop. Instead, Nb-Binder-58 binds as a dimer to the very tip of the Cap domain where it interacts with several residues that are unique between TREK-2 and the closely related TREK-1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To determine whether this nanobody can detect TREK2 expression at the cell surface, Nb-Binder-58 was fused to the mVenus fluorescent protein and applied to HEK-293 cells expressing TREK-2 tagged with the mCherry fluorescent protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> shows overlapping signals that are not observed on cells expressing TREK-1, nor for any other K2P channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). A similar, functionally inactive nanobody (CA10757: Nb-Binder-57 or Nb57) that exhibits almost complete sequence identity with Nb-Binder-58 is also capable of similar immunodetection of TREK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. S1 &amp; S3</xref>). This indicates that both these nanobodies represent useful tools for the specific immunodetection of homomeric TREK-2 channels.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A partially-selective activatory nanobody</title><p id="P19">The first activatory nanobody (CA10767) hereafter referred to as Nb-Activator-67 (or Nb67), binds to the side of the Cap domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) with all three CDR loops interacting with the external face of the Cap helices. However, these interactions are not symmetrical and on one side the EH1 Cap helix is partially unwound at the midpoint (residues 107-109; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The structure also reveals a nanobody bound to the intracellular side where it occludes the entrance to the inner cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, upon closer examination of the crystal structure this ‘intracellular’ interaction appears to result from tetramerisation of the nanobody within the unit cell that may drive the crystal packing and the resulting non-canonical structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>). Nevertheless, to rule out any functional effects of this intracellular interaction we examined the effect of this nanobody on TREK-2 currents in excised patches where it could be applied to the intracellular surface of the membrane. No functional effect on TREK-2 activity was observed even at 10 μM intracellular application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>). This is in marked contrast to its clear activatory effect when applied extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Further examination revealed that Nb-Activator-67 rapidly increased channel activity ~3-4 fold with nanomolar efficacy (EC<sub>50</sub>= 101 ± 12 nM) when perfused onto oocytes expressing human TREK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To address its selectivity, we examined effects on other K2P channels. No functional modulation was observed on either TALK-2 or TRAAK. However, an inhibitory effect was observed on the closely related TREK-1 channel at high concentrations of nanobody &gt;1μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This opposite effect initially appeared interesting because of the opposite effects of extracellular pH on the activity of TREK-2 and TREK-1, and the role of the extracellular Pore/TM loops in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, Nb-Activator-67 does not appear to contact these loops and instead only interacts with the extracellular face of the Cap domain resulting in an unwinding of the EH1 Cap helix on one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Intriguingly, both M4 helices in this TREK-2 structure are in the Up conformation consistent with a more activated state of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), although this could also be due to its interactions with the nanobody bound to its intracellular surface. Full occupancy of ion binding sites within the filter of TREK channels is also usually associated with an activated state of the channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and in this structure all the sites appear occupied, albeit in an asymmetric fashion due to unwinding of the Cap on one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Although it is tempting to associate the effect of unwinding of EH1 with the activatory effects of Nb-Activator-67, the crystal packing interactions make interpretation of this particular structure challenging. Due to the additional lack of specificity between TREK-1 and TREK-2, the mechanism of activation by this nanobody was not investigated further. However, its robust activatory effect on recombinant homomeric TREK-2 channels, especially at lower concentrations, indicates that this nanobody may remain a useful tool in situations where the identity of its target is already known.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A selective activatory nanobody</title><p id="P21">Unlike Nb-Activator-67, the second activatory nanobody (CA10776, hereafter referred to as Nb-Activator-76 or Nb76) exhibited highly selective activation of TREK-2 with an efficacy of 412 ± 14 nM and had no effect on TREK-1 or other K2P channels tested, even when used at high concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4C</xref>). The structure of this nanobody in complex with TREK-2 reveals that the CDR loops interact with the side of the Cap domain involving residues at the intersubunit interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). In particular, W98 on CDR3 of the nanobody inserts into the intersubunit groove between helices in the Cap domain of TREK-2 to form an interaction with E128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). R53 on CDR2 also helps anchor the nanobody to the Cap helices by H-bonding with Q106 on TREK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that mutation of either of these residues on Nb-Activator-76 (W98A or R53A) severely impaired its activatory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Nb-Activator-76 also contacts the extracellular P2-M4 loop. In particular, N56 on CDR2 interacts with N292 on the P2-M4 loop of TREK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This extracellular loop has previously been implicated in the regulation of filter-gating by external H<sup>+ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The importance of this interaction with the P2-M4 loop is confirmed by mutation of N56 on Nb-Activator-76 which reduces its activatory effect, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with an activated state, both M4 helices in this structure are also in the Up conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). The role of ions in gating the filter is unclear because crystals of sufficient quality could only be obtained using a crystallisation solution containing Ba<sup>2+</sup> which contributes to the crystal contacts. However, this does not change the selectivity filter in comparison to the Up-state conformation (PDB ID 4BW5).</p><p id="P23">ML335 is a small molecule TREK channel agonist that binds within the ‘K2P Modulator Pocket’, a cryptic binding site created by displacement of the top of M4 where its interactions with the P2-M4 loop and Pore-Helix-1 (PH1) are proposed to stabilise TREK-2 in a more conductive conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. It is therefore highly significant that interaction of Nb-Activator-76 with the P2-M4 loop also induces a displacement in the top of the M4 helix similar to that seen in the ML335-bound structures of TREK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that the reorientation of a tryptophan residue at the top of M4 (W306 in TREK-2) also correlates with the activated state of TREK channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and that any hydrophobic moiety occupying this space is capable of stabilising this activated state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In this nanobody-bound structure W306 sidechains in both helices are in the inward orientation and occupy this space. But unlike other TREK structures where this M4 tryptophan has rotated inwards, here the adjacent residues on PH1 (F164) also flips orientation to interact with the top of M4 to stabilise this displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). This demonstrates a mechanism whereby movement of the M4 helix may communicate with PH1 to influence the selectivity filter gate and highlights the importance of this ‘K2P modulator pocket’ in channel gating <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>An inhibitory nanobody with dual effects</title><p id="P24">The inhibitory nanobody, CA10761, hereafter referred to as Nb-Inhibitor-61 (or Nb61), rapidly inhibited TREK-2 currents (IC<sub>50</sub> = 685 ± 18 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Its structure in complex with TREK-2 indicates only one nanobody bound per asymmetric unit, but this appears to result from its crystal packing where interactions between the Cap domains prevent binding of a second nanobody to the opposite side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The position of Nb-Inhibitor-61 on the side of the Cap domain allows it to form extensive interactions between the Cap helices and CDR1, as well as with the β5 sheet and β5-β6 loop. In addition, its long CDR3 loop forms multiple interactions with the top of M3 and the M3-PH2 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) as well as additional interactions with the top of M2 and the P2-M4 loop. However, the most striking feature of this long CDR3 loop is that it also inserts a lysine residue (K103) deep within the extracellular ion exit pathway that emerges just below the Cap domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-F</xref>). Overall, the position of this nanobody obstructs most of this ion exit pathway with the remaining gap being only 1.35 Å wide compared to &gt; 4 Å in the <italic>apo</italic> state. Intriguingly, the position of this positively-charged lysine within the ion exit pathway is reminiscent of the way some toxins block K<sup>+</sup> channels via a “cork in a bottle” or “plug” type mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. It also shares similarities with the ‘finger in the dam’ mechanism of TREK channel block by Ruthenium Red where interaction of this the positively-charged inhibitor with the ‘keystone inhibitor site’ below the Cap domain directly blocks K<sup>+</sup> permeation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Unlike these other toxins, K103 does not insert far enough into the pathway to interact directly with ions exiting the filter, but it clearly has the ability to impede K<sup>+</sup> movement through this exit pathway and so we examined its role further.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A critical role for Lysine 103 in channel inhibition</title><p id="P26">This lysine appears to make no specific H-bonding or charged interactions within the ion exit pathway and mutation to a serine (K103S) resulted in a marked reduction in its inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also examined other substitutions at this position (K103R, K103N and K103D). Consistent with a role for a positively charged residue at this position, the K103R mutant produced similar, if not greater, inhibition whilst neutral or negative substitutions (K103N and K103D) resulted in a markedly reduced inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also examined the effect of this nanobody on TREK-2 activity at the single channel level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Due to the low intrinsic open-probability of TREK-2, only a qualitative comparison was made between the behaviour of multi-channel patches with or without Nb-Inhibitor-61 included in the pipette solution. This revealed a marked suppression of TREK-2 activity via reduction in the durations of bursts of openings and increase in the time spent in the long-closed states. This is consistent with the idea that this nanobody acts as a slow blocker resulting in a complete cessation of K<sup>+</sup> flux through the channel.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Possible allosteric effects of Nb-Inhibitor-61</title><p id="P27">Together, these results with Nb-Inhibitor-61 support the contribution of a direct toxin-like (or ‘finger in the dam’) block of ion permeation by the nanobody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, the bifurcation of the ion exit pathway means that such a mechanism would also require nanobody binding to both sides of the Cap domain. There are no obstructions to the binding of a second nanobody on the other side, but due to crystal packing only one is observed in this structure. It is therefore possible that other, allosteric mechanisms may also contribute to its inhibitory properties. For example, multiple effects are also seen in some toxins where, in addition to direct pore block, interactions with the external pore loops result in allosteric modulation of channel gating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. For Nb-Inhibitor-61, this may arise through the extensive contacts it makes with the M3-PH2 loop as well as with the P2-M4 loop and M2/M3 helices. Consistent with such an allosteric effect, the M4 helix of the subunit that interacts with this nanobody is in the Down conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, the relative orientation of side chains for both W306 on M4 and F164 on PH1 are reversed compared to their positions the Nb76/TREK-2 structure, and its interaction with the P2-M4 loop pulls the top of M4 closer to PH1 compared to the activated state induced by Nb-Activator-76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). However, all 4 ion binding sites in the filter appear to be occupied and no obvious structural changes are seen in this region. Thus, although additional allosteric effects of this nanobody on the filter gate cannot be excluded, Lysine 103 clearly contributes to channel inhibition by directly blocking the ion exit pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>A biparatopic inhibitory nanobody with improved efficacy</title><p id="P28">The two activatory nanobodies identified in this study function with relatively high efficacy (EC<sub>50</sub> ~100 &amp; 300 nM) compared to Nb-Inhibitor-61 (IC<sub>50</sub> ~650 nM).

At ~7.4Å resolution, the map was sufficient to reveal two copies of Nb-Inhibitor-6158 bound with one Nb-Inhibitor-61 domain on either side of the Cap domain similar to its position in the crystal structure. This confirms that this nanobody can interact with both subunits of TREK-2 to exert allosteric effects as well as occluding both extracellular ion exit pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title><p id="P32">In this study, we describe the generation and characterisation of a panel of nanobody binders to the TREK-2 K2P channel resulting in one inhibitor, two activators and other nanobodies suitable for immunodetection of TREK-2. One activator in particular (Nb-Activator-76) elicits highly selective activation of TREK-2. These nanobodies therefore not only provide useful probes for analysing the structure and function of homomeric TREK-2 channels, but also identify a new class of highly specific extracellular modulators that can be further investigated for therapeutic potential.</p><p id="P33">Ever since the first structures of K2P channels were resolved over a decade ago the role of their large extracellular Cap domain has remained unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. It was initially suggested this domain may have evolved to protect the selectivity filter of K2P channels from the small peptide toxins that often target other members of the superfamily of tetrameric cation channels. However, the complex domain swap involving the M1 helix required to assemble this extracellular domain suggests this is an unlikely strategy, especially as examples of toxin-resistance in ion channels often only require single mutations in the extracellular toxin binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Nevertheless, the Cap domain is a defining feature of K2P channels, and whatever its purpose, it obviously makes toxin block of the pore much less likely. It is therefore significant that we have identified a nanobody in which the longer CDR3 loop inserts a lysine sidechain directly into the extracellular ion exit pathway in a manner analogous to some K<sup>+</sup> channel toxins. In the case of TREK channel inhibition by Ruthenium Red, this small positively charged inhibitor is able to access deeper into the exit pathway to block permeation directly above the filter, whereas it may not be possible for this CDR3 loop to insert deep enough to access the keystone Inhibitor site, even if it were longer. Nevertheless, this inhibitory nanobody is highly effective and its mechanism of action likely involves both allosteric and direct blocking effects on permeation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Also, the structure of this TREK-2/nanobody complex, and those of the others solved in this study, reveal that the Cap domain is highly immunogenic and provides a good scaffold on which nanobodies can anchor themselves to influence TREK channel function. We also demonstrate that the Cap domain offers the opportunity for the design of biparatropic nanobodies with improved affinity and functional efficacy. In addition, the nanomolar efficacy of the linked Nb-inhibitor-5861 now provides a powerful analytical tool for probing TREK-2 function.</p><p id="P35">In the case of the two activators, the first (Nb-Activator-67) is a highly effective probe for the study of homomeric TREK-2 when the identity of the target is known, but uncertainties about this crystal structure make interpretations of its mechanism of action difficult. However, the second activator (Nb-Activator-76) provides important insights into the mechanism of TREK channel activation and demonstrate how the extracellular P2-M4 loop and rearrangements at the top of the M4 helix play a critical role in the regulation of channel gating. Overall, these rearrangements expand current models for TREK channel gating via the K2P modulator site to suggest that outward displacement of the top of M4 changes the contacts between M4, the P2-M4 loop and Pore-Helix-1 to activate the selectivity filter gate, whereas displacement in the other direction results in the opposite effect and inhibition. Similar to that proposed for other TREK channel modulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, this may also involve reorientation of the W306 and F164 side-chains, or their equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This model is also consistent with recent observations that covalent attachment of ML335 derivatives within the K2P modulator site via a conserved serine on PH1 can irreversibly activate TREK channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">However, the mechanism by which nanobody binding is then coupled to changes in ion occupancy within the filter and the dynamics of K<sup>+</sup> permeation remain unclear. A limitation of this study is that the relative dynamics of these specific regions are probably critical for the regulation of gating, but most structures, including those in this study are determined in high [K<sup>+</sup>] (&gt;100 mM). This often results in high ion occupancy within the filter in such crystal structures, whereas the physiological situation is obviously very different and difficult to compare.</p><p id="P37">The nanobody ‘binders’ that have no functional effects are also likely to be useful tools for the immunodetection of TREK-2, although future studies will be required to demonstrate the sensitivity required for detection <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also known that TREK-2 can form heteromeric channels with either TREK-1 or TRAAK, and nanobodies capable of detecting such combinations would be extremely powerful for dissecting the role of such heteromeric channels <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is therefore significant that the domain swap involved in assembly of the Cap domain generates an intersubunit interface that forms extensive contacts with nanobodies in these structures and which would be unique in any heteromeric channel combinations; thus, if binders can differentiate between these interfaces in homomeric TREK channels, then it may be possible to generate similar nanobodies that are uniquely selective for heteromeric K2P channels.</p><p id="P38">Thus, although ion channels remain underexploited as antibody drug targets, this study demonstrates that the unique nature of the Cap domain combined with the role of the extracellular loops in K2P channels allows nanobodies to be considered as an exciting alternative to small molecules as highly-selective probes to K2P channel structure-function studies, and of TREK channels in particular. This therefore expands the potential of nanobodies as effective therapeutics and their role in future drug development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Nanobody generation, expression and purification</title><p id="P39">Nanobodies were generated as part of the Nanobodies4Instruct program using the method described by Pardon <italic>et al.</italic> (28).
