Survival during colonisation is likely one of the major drivers of <italic>S. aureus</italic> evolution. Here we use a genome-wide mutation enrichment approach to analyse a genomic dataset of 3,060 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from 791 individuals to show that despite limited within-host genetic diversity, an excess of protein-altering mutations can be found in genes encoding key metabolic pathways, in regulators of quorum-sensing and in known antibiotic targets. Nitrogen metabolism and riboflavin synthesis are the metabolic processes with strongest evidence of adaptation. Further evidence of adaptation to nitrogen availability was revealed by enrichment of mutations in the assimilatory nitrite reductase and urease, including mutations that enhance growth with urea as the sole nitrogen source. Inclusion of an additional 4,090 genomes from 802 individuals revealed eight additional genes including <italic>sasA/sraP, pstA</italic>, and <italic>rsbU</italic> with signals adaptive variation that warrant further characterisation. Our study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of the heterogeneity of adaptive changes that occur in the genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> during colonisation, revealing the likely importance of nitrogen metabolism, loss of quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance for successful human colonisation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2"><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an important pathogen but also commensal bacteria and part of the human microbiota.

This most likely represents examples of directional selection, wherein <italic>S. aureus</italic> adapted to antimicrobial evolutionary pressures <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was supported by the identification of well-known resistance mutations in these genes, and concomitant reduced antibiotic susceptibility in isolates with these mutations, when compared to quasi ‘isogenic’ wild-type strains isolated from the same host. However, not all mutations detected in AMR loci were likely to be adaptive. This is exemplified by the characterisation of <italic>fusA</italic>, which had five mutations known to be involved in resistance leading to increases in MIC, and five never reported to cause resistance and not affecting fusidic acid susceptibility. It is therefore the excess of adaptive resistance-conferring mutations that increases the statistical significance of <italic>fusA</italic> and that of other AMR genes. We also identified novel mutations suggesting that the full diversity of resistance mutations to these drugs is yet to be fully understood and warrants further study. The mutations identified in the transglycosylase domain of PBP2, two of which resulted in cefoxitin susceptibility, are consistent with the cooperation of this native PBP with the acquired PBP2A to mediate beta-lactam resistance in MRSA, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and suggests that these might be compensatory mutations to optimise the function of the transglycosylase domain of PBP2.</p><p id="P26">Our results support previous observations that agr variation is selected for during colonisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> It has been proposed that a balance exists between wild-type and agr-defective cells in the population, where the latter, termed as ‘cheaters’, benefit from the secretions of wild-type cells without having to produce the costly cooperative secretions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> However, in the context of colonisation, expression of the agr locus results in the down regulation of several surface proteins including cell wall secretory protein (IsaA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and fibronectin binding protein B (FnBPB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> which are known to be involved in the attachment of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cells in the nasal epithelium. Given the importance of these proteins to colonisation, it would be beneficial for <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations to maintain subpopulations of cells that are primed for attachment should transmission to a new host occur. Thus, mutations in agr most likely represent an example of balancing selection, where the bacterial population as a whole benefits from having both active and defective agr systems, as opposed to a case of directional selection.</p><p id="P27">Our study has several limitations. First, the full genetic diversity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in colonising sites was not captured by the datasets as we only had a median of two sequenced colonies available per individual. Having sequenced many more colonies, or directly from plate sweeps would have captured the full heterogeneity and provided a higher resolution picture of adaptation within bacterial sub-populations. Second, genetic changes identified between isolates of the same individual may not have arisen during colonisation of the sampled host (as assumed) but transmitted from another host, though these mutations still likely reflect recent diversification during colonisation. Third, we did not investigate changes in the gene content and large genetic re-arrangements, as those driven by movement of bacteriophages, between isolate genomes of the same host, this would require long-read sequencing. Fourth, we did not have metadata, such as antibiotic usage or the specific site of colonisation for 30.3% of isolates (e.g., multi-site screens). Finally, many of the isolates came from studies of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in hospital patients or with infections, which may have incorporated a bias towards mutations selected by antibiotics or other therapies. However, by increasing the overall sample size from ~3,000 to ~7,000 genomes we identified new genes significantly enriched for mutations including five currently uncharacterised genes and <italic>sasA/sraP</italic> which has not been previously been reported to be involved in colonisation, though it is known to mediate attachment to human cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> This suggests that studies using even larger sample sizes have the potential to identify further new signatures of adaption.</p><p id="P28">Future work focused on pre-defined patient groups (healthy colonised individuals), narrowly defined infection types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> with larger sample sizes and availability of host metadata will improve the identification of bacterial adaptive changes that promote survival in specific host niches and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions; as well as pinning down strain/lineage-specific adaptations.

These growth parameters were compared between isolates/strains (e.g. mutant vs. wildtype) using a one-way ANOVA to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the means (across replicates) of growth parameters between isolates (script: compare_growth_parameters.R).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Manuscript</label><media xlink:href="EMS192675-supplement-Manuscript.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d148aAdHbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This publication presents independent research supported by Wellcome grants 201344/Z/16/Z and 204928/Z/16/Z awarded to Francesc Coll.

B. Multiple isolates are whole genome sequenced from the same individual. C. A core-genome phylogeny is used to ensure isolates from the same host are clonal and to identify an appropriate outgroup. Isolate short reads are mapped to the outgroup assembly to call genetic variants. The sequence of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all isolates from the same host is reconstructed. D. The short reads of each isolate are mapped to the MRCA reconstructed sequence to call variants wherein the reference allele represents the ancestral allele and the alternative allele the evolved one. The coordinates of variants in a complete and well-annotated reference genome (Reference lift-over) are determined. Variants on repetitive, low-complexity and phage regions are removed as well as those attributable to recombination (Variant filtering). In the last step, the effect of variants on genes is annotated (Variant annotation). E. The number of protein-altering mutations are counted on protein-coding genes (CDS), transcriptional units (operons) and high-level functional units across all individuals. F. Each functional unit is tested for an enrichment of protein-altering mutations compared to the rest of the genome. G.
