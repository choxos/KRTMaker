Biogenesis of the outer membrane requires the transport of phospholipids across the cell envelope. Recently, YhdP was implicated as a major protagonist in the transport of phospholipids from the inner membrane to the outer membrane however the molecular mechanism of YhdP mediated transport remains elusive. Here, utilising AlphaFold, we observe YhdP to form an elongated assembly of 60 β strands that curve to form a continuous hydrophobic groove. This architecture is consistent with our negative stain electron microscopy data which reveals YhdP to be approximately 250 Å in length and thus sufficient to span the bacterial cell envelope. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo bacterial growth assays indicate essential helical regions at the N- and C-termini of YhdP, that may embed into the inner and outer membranes respectively, reinforcing its envelope spanning nature. Our in vivo crosslinking data reveal phosphate-containing substrates captured along the length of the YhdP groove, providing direct evidence that YhdP transports phospholipids. This finding is congruent with our molecular dynamics simulations which demonstrate the propensity for inner membrane lipids to spontaneously enter the groove of YhdP. Collectively, our results support a model in which YhdP bridges the cell envelope, providing a hydrophobic environment for the transport of phospholipids to the outer membrane.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The tripartite cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria provides a formidable barrier against harmful exogenous substances, such as antibiotics, and thus is a major contributor to intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. The cell envelope consists of an inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) separated by an aqueous periplasm. The OM is asymmetric in nature, with phospholipids (PLs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) populating the inner and outer leaflets respectively, and adorned with an array of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). To build and maintain this complex OM structure, various hydrophobic constituents must be transported across the aqueous periplasm. Thus far, several proteinaceous transport systems have been demonstrated to orchestrate this process, either by shuttling lipids/proteins between membranes via soluble carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), or assembling large periplasmic-spanning systems that directly connect the inner and outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To date, a major unknown in OM biogenesis is the mechanism by which PLs are transported to the OM. The most extensively characterised intermembrane PL transport pathway remains the <italic>E. coli</italic> Maintenance of Lipid Asymmetry (Mla) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), which consists of a periplasmic protein that shuttles PLs between an IM ABC transporter and an OM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, whilst some studies indicate a role in anterograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), the majority of research suggests the Mla pathway facilitates retrograde transport, removing mislocalised PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Indeed another protein, YhdP, has recently emerged as a potential anterograde PL transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This arose during a screen for genetic interactions of MlaA*, a gain of function mutation in MlaA, an OM component of the Mla pathway. MlaA* causes increased transit of PLs into the outer leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), causing destabilisation of the OM and increased OM vesicle production. The <italic>mlaA*</italic> cells compensate for this destabilisation by elevating anterograde PL flux from the IM to the OM. This increased flux can be modulated by loss of function mutations in <italic>yhdP,</italic> suggesting the involvement of YhdP in anterograde PL trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P5">YhdP is one of six paralogous AsmA-like proteins found in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelope, which have been recently reviewed by Kumar and Ruiz, 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). All six proteins are predicted to be anchored to the IM and extend into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), well situated for transport across the cell envelope. Strains lacking <italic>yhdP</italic> possess phenotypes indicative of a defective OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), which are exacerbated in a <italic>yhdP tamB</italic> double knockout strain, resulting in altered cell morphology and significant sensitivity to antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Moreover, <italic>yhdP</italic> depletion in combination with the removal of <italic>tamB</italic> and <italic>ydbH</italic> induces an accumulation of PLs in the IM, presumably due to defective anterograde PL transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Importantly, the simultaneous deletion of <italic>yhdP, tamB</italic> and <italic>ydbH</italic> results in the loss of cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), implying their involvement in an essential cell process.</p><p id="P6">Beyond <italic>E. coli</italic>, AsmA-like proteins are widespread in the cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria, and have been linked to virulence in pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), which, in combination with their role in antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), pose AsmA-like proteins as attractive therapeutic targets. Furthermore, AsmA-like proteins likely share a common ancestor with transport systems widespread across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), which have emerged as bridges through which lipids from neighbouring organelles may be transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Consequently, it is anticipated that bacterial AsmA-like proteins, and their eukaryotic homologues, likely perform a common role in inter-membrane lipid transport.</p><p id="P7">Collectively, these existing data support the notion that YhdP functions as an anterograde PL transporter, acting to build and maintain the OM. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which YhdP functions at the molecular level remains fundamentally uncertain. Here, we present data to support a model in which YhdP forms an elongated groove across the periplasm that directly connects the inner and outer membranes, through which PLs are transported to build and maintain the bacterial OM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>YhdP forms a long thin rod consisting of stacked β strands</title><p id="P8">The gene <italic>yhdP</italic> encodes one of the largest proteins from the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, a 1266 aa residue (139 kDa) polypeptide. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking <italic>yhdP</italic> exhibit distinct phenotypes indicative of OM defects, such as sensitivity to vancomycin and SDS+EDTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)); that are alleviated by trans expression of <italic>yhdP</italic> from a complementary plasmid. These data are consistent with YhdP facilitating OM biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). YhdP is expected to be anchored to the IM via an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix, with the bulk of the protein extending into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Intriguingly, a putative TM region is also predicted at the C-terminus of YhdP, but with much lower confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>), thus YhdP may conceivably provide a physical link between both bacterial membranes. YhdP also contains two periplasmic domains (DUF3971 and Asma_C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), both of which are members of the AsmA-like Pfam domain clan (CL0401) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). These domains represent regions of sequence homology that are collectively conserved amongst all bacterial AsmA-like family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Furthermore, the N-terminus of YhdP contains a region of sequence homology to the Chorein-N domain present within eukaryotic lipid transfer proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To better understand how YhdP may function as a transport protein, we investigated its architecture. We utilised the AlphaFold structural prediction of YhdP to explore its expected secondary structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The per-residue confidence scores associated with the prediction were high for the majority of the model (87 % and 47 % of residues with pLDDT values &gt;70 and &gt;90 respectively) with regions of lower confidence mainly clustered towards the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The AlphaFold model predicts that YhdP adopts an elongated architecture, ~250 Å in length.</p><p id="P10">To assess the overall shape of YhdP experimentally, we isolated purified YhdP protein for negative stain electron microscopy. Recombinantly expressed YhdP was isolated from the <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane fraction, demonstrating that YhdP is indeed a membrane protein, yielding a polypeptide of the expected 139 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). We imaged YhdP by negative stain electron microscopy, and observed that the protein assembles long, thin rod-type structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Subsequent 2D class averages allowed us to estimate the length of YhdP to be approximately 250 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), reinforcing our confidence in the validity of the AlphaFold model.</p><p id="P11">The YhdP AlphaFold prediction constitutes a backbone of 60 stacked β-strands that curve inwards to form a groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the β-taco fold first described in the X-ray structure of a TamB fragment, a paralog of YhdP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>)). This groove appears to extend along the length of YhdP, reminiscent of the Lpt bridge for LPS transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), whilst the entire protein twists along its axis. The continuity of β-strands is regularly interrupted by short helical or disordered loop regions along the length of YhdP, a pattern described as the repeating β-groove (RBG) domain in eukaryotic AsmA-like homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), though in bacteria their periodicity appears less defined.</p><p id="P12">The β-strand dominated architecture of YhdP is reflected in the AlphaFold predicted structures for the remaining five <italic>E. coli</italic> AsmA family members, which vary predominantly in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). It should be noted that the AsmA-like Pfam domains representing regions of sequence homology between the <italic>E. coli</italic> AsmA-like proteins (i.e. domains “DUF3971” and “AsmA_C” in YhdP; “TamB” domain in TamB, “DctA-YdbH” domain in YdbH; and the “AsmA” domain in AsmA, YhjG, and YicH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>)) do not form structurally distinct regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, these domains are indistinguishable as distinct modules within the β-sheet construction of these proteins, implying that the homology between AsmA-like proteins extends far beyond the domains currently annotated.</p><p id="P13">The structural predictions of bacterial AsmA-like proteins also resemble homologs found in distantly related bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>)). The Chorein-N domain represents a small homologous region detected between the eukaryotic and bacterial AsmA-Like proteins, based on their amino acid sequences. However, their predicted structures are remarkably similar, implying a substantial structural conservation across life. Indeed, the eukaryotic AsmA-like homologues are also predicted to form long, thin, twisting grooves, further indicating the homology between these groups is far more extensive than sequence homology suggests, and not simply limited to the Chorein-N domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Overall, predicted structures for both the bacterial and eukaryotic proteins highlight the potential limitation of relying solely upon sequence based homology detection and indicate the β-taco fold to be exceptionally conserved throughout evolution, potentially as a module for inter-membrane transport.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>YhdP has the potential to bridge the inner and outer membranes, spanning the periplasm</title><p id="P14">Periplasmic-spanning systems are emerging as a common means for bacteria to transport hydrophobic components between the inner and outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Our negative stain EM data shows that YhdP is ~250 A in length, a dimension reinforced by the AlphaFold prediction. YhdP is therefore of sufficient size to span the 210-240 Å periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), directly linking the inner and outer membranes. This model would require the N- and C-termini of YhdP to interact with the IM and OM, respectively. In addition to the TM helix at the N-terminus, we observed other helical regions towards the N- and C-termini of the YhdP AlphaFold prediction that may conceivably form membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A+D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To investigate potential membrane interactions of the N- and C- terminal regions of YhdP, we performed a series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. First we sought to investigate interactions between the N-terminal region of YhdP and the IM. Here we utilised an N-terminal fragment of YhdP (residues 1-387) which was inserted into a model IM with a representative lipidic composition comprising 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and cardiolipin 2- (CDL2) in a 7:2:1 ratio. We performed three simulations, each of 5 μs duration. Inspection of the trajectories revealed substantial protein interactions with the membrane which, interestingly, were not confined solely to the TM region. The N-terminal entrance of the groove consists largely of hydrophobic residues and sits upon the surface of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Many of these hydrophobic residues insert into the membrane, and form interactions with the lipid tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B+C</xref>). A small amphipathic helix (residues 94-103) situated between the β3 and β4 strands, henceforth referred as the P (parallel)-helix, sits especially deep within the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). The residues on the lower face of the P helix, along with two residues (W61 and F64) within the loop region separating the first two β strands, form a line of hydrophobic residues that appear to stabilise the membrane interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In particular, W95 of the P-helix embeds deeply in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and has the highest percentage occupancy (68.6%) of any residue with the lipid tail moieties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that the P-helix partially resides within the hydrophobic core of the inner membrane.</p><p id="P16">Next, we considered interactions between the C-termini of YhdP and the OM, utilising a second truncated fragment comprising the final 169 residues of YhdP (residues 1098-1266). Unlike the N-terminus, where an obvious TM domain is present, it was unclear if or how the C-terminus could interact with a lipid bilayer. Therefore, we employed coarse-grained simulations to investigate membrane self-assembly in the presence of the YhdP C-terminus. Simulations were initiated from randomly placed POPE, water and neutralising ions around the C-terminal YhdP fragment, enabling determination of the preferred protein orientation and localisation with respect to the self-assembled bilayer with minimal bias. We performed six simulations, each of 5 μs duration. In each case a stable lipid bilayer assembled, interacting with the C-terminal end of the hydrophobic groove and two C-terminal helical regions of YhdP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E+F</xref>). Both C-terminal helices (Chelix_1 - residues 1202-1238, Chelix_2 - residues 1120-1145, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) are amphipathic, though the most C-terminal of the two (Chelix_1) is primarily hydrophobic. Indeed, Chelix_1 corresponds with the aforementioned second, putative TM region (predicted with much lower confidence by the TMHMM - 2.0 server (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>)). In our simulations, Chelix_1 was consistently repositioned to reside closer to Chelix_2, such that the centre of mass separation between the helices was reduced to ~14 Å, in all but one simulation, having started at a distance &gt;20 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A+B</xref>). At the end of the simulations, the hydrophobic groove was positioned perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The C-terminal membrane-interacting regions coalesced to form a large, mostly hydrophobic patch to adhere to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Membrane insertion was limited to the inner leaflet of the bilayer, occurring predominantly via the Chelix_1 and Chelix_2 moieties, both of which were inserted into the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Indeed, Chelix_1 and Chelix_2 accounted for 49.5% and 24.6% of all protein-lipid tail interactions, respectively, with interactions between these helices and the POPE acyl tails dominated by hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Finally, we investigated whether the membrane interactions we had identified using N-and C-terminal protein fragments were sufficient to anchor YhdP within the context of the Gram-negative cell envelope. We simulated the entire system, with each TM region embedded in an appropriate OM or IM model membrane, for 3 simulations of 2 μs. We utilised our previously published <italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelope system containing the AcrAB-TolC efflux system to define the spacing between the two membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). YhdP remained stably bound throughout the simulation, displaying membrane interactions at both termini in this full system similar to those previously observed with the smaller protein fragments (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C+D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). We did not observe any interaction between YhdP and the outer leaflet of the OM, strengthening our hypothesis that the C-terminus only interacts with the inner leaflet of the OM.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Putative membrane-interacting helices at the N and C-termini are essential for YhdP function</title><p id="P18">Collectively, our negative stain EM data, the AlphaFold model, and our molecular dynamics simulations support a model where YhdP forms an envelope spanning groove, that may directly interact with the inner and outer membranes, via helical regions at its N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We therefore sought to further investigate the importance of these helical regions by assessing the functionality of YhdP mutants with these helices removed. Consequently, we utilised the vancomycin and SDS+EDTA sensitivity of a <italic>yhdP</italic> knockout, as described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)), to evaluate the ability of <italic>yhdP</italic> mutants to alleviate these defects in a phenotypic complementation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">First, we investigated the requirement of YhdP to interact with the IM at its N-terminus. We targeted the N-terminal TM helix by constructing two mutants; one with the TM domain deleted (ΔTM), resulting in presumed cytoplasmic retention of YhdP, and another where the TM domain was replaced with a PelB leader sequence (ΔTM_PelB), for secretion of YhdP into the periplasm. In the presence of vancomycin, neither of these mutants could complement the <italic>ΔyhdP</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, while the ΔTM mutant was unable to complement in the presence of 0.5% SDS+0.75 mM EDTA, the ΔTM_PelB mutant almost fully restored growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, increasing the amount of EDTA further decreased the growth of the ΔTM_PelB mutant relative to the WT, suggesting it is still less functional than WT YhdP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the periplasmic localisation of YhdP is essential for its function but that some functionality is retained upon removal of its N-terminal TM region.</p><p id="P20">In addition to the TM domain, we also targeted the N-terminal P-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>+<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To assess the importance of this helix, we constructed two further mutants; one where the entire P-helix was deleted (ΔP-helix), and a second with the four hydrophobic helix residues mutated to polar or charged amino acids (P-helix_mut). Neither mutant could restore growth of the <italic>ΔyhdP</italic> strain, though the P-helix_mutate mutant grew slightly better than ΔP-helix on SDS+EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, these results suggest that the P-helix has a larger impact upon YhdP function than its TM helix. Indeed, its embedding within the IM may explain the ability of YhdP to remain partially functional without its TM helix.</p><p id="P21">Considering this possibility, we utilised molecular dynamics to assess YhdP-IM interactions in the absence of the TM region. We performed 3 x 5 μs coarse-grained simulations starting with YhdP in the same position as the original N-terminal simulations, but with the TM domain (residues 2-31) removed. The resulting Δ2-31 N-terminal fragment remained associated with the membrane throughout our simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref>). Indeed, this observation corroborates our hypothesis that the P-helix alone is sufficient to maintain YhdP’s IM interaction and reinforces its importance for YhdP functionality. As previously, we analysed the protein-lipid contacts and observed a similar pattern of lipid tail interactions, with W95 once again displaying the highest lipid acyl tail occupancy (67.7%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8B+C</xref>). Overall, we anticipate the P-helix to be particularly important in stabilising the YhdP-IM interaction; however, considering YhdP’s possession of a canonical TM region, it seems unlikely that the P-helix exists purely to mediate IM interactions. Indeed, this notion is reinforced by the substantial decrease in the ability of YhdP to complement the <italic>ΔyhdP</italic> phenotype upon removal or mutation of the P-helix in constructs retaining their TM regions.</p><p id="P22">Finally, we probed the C-terminal helices of YhdP, regions that may interact with the OM and/or other proteins within the OM. We observed that deletion of either ΔChelix_1 or ΔChelix_2 prevented complementation of the <italic>ΔyhdP</italic> phenotype on vancomycin, though ΔChelix_2 grew better than ΔChelix_1 in the presence of SDS+EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that both C-terminal helical regions of YhdP are required for function, with Chelix_1 appearing essential, potentially due to its predicted ability to embed in the inner leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). To support these observations, we performed three molecular dynamics simulations of randomised bilayer assembly in the presence of a YhdP C-terminal mutant lacking Chelix_1 (residues 1098-1266, replacing residues between E1202 and S1238 with GS repeats). The three simulations each resulted in rather different protein-membrane binding modes, none of which permitted a productive interaction between the YhdP groove and the membrane, suggesting Chelix_1 is required for stable attachment of YhdP to the OM during our simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8D</xref>). These molecular dynamics simulations, together with our phenotypic complementation assays, support a model whereby the C- terminal helices of YhdP, particularly Chelix_1, are required for YhdP function, potentially in anchoring YhdP to the OM.</p><p id="P23">Indeed, whilst further investigations are required to fully investigate the functions of the helical regions at the N- and C-termini of YhdP, our data thus far supports a model in which YhdP interacts with both membranes, thus spanning the periplasm.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phospholipids traverse the groove of YhdP</title><p id="P24">Given YhdP is anticipated to transport PLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), we inspected its predicted structure for insight into how such transport may be mediated. The most pronounced feature of YhdP is a groove, which using the MOLE<italic>online</italic> server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) was revealed to be continuous along all but the extreme N-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Visualisation of the molecular lipophilicity potential and Coulombic electrostatic potential of YhdP revealed the groove interior to be hydrophobic and uncharged, whilst the periplasmic-facing exterior face is hydrophilic and predominantly negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B+C</xref>). This predicted groove presents an ideal environment for shielding the acyl tails of PLs, or other hydrophobic moieties, whilst their hydrophilic portions remain exposed to the aqueous periplasm.</p><p id="P25">During 8 of our 9 previously described simulations containing the YhdP N-terminus, we observed a single lipid moving into the hydrophobic groove of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 2</xref>), noting that multiple different lipid species entered across our simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). The mechanism of entry into YhdP was consistent in each of our simulations. First, if not already in close proximity to YhdP, lipids in the outer leaflet of the bilayer moved towards the mouth of the groove of YhdP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stages 0 -1). Next, the lipid tails tilted away from the membrane towards the groove of YhdP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stage 1). The tails then started to explore deeper in the groove of YhdP, while the headgroups remained in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stage 2). Complete entry of the lipid into the hydrophobic groove then occurred via the following mechanism; an acyl tail extended higher into the hydrophobic groove, followed by the glycerol backbone moieties and finally the polar headgroup, resulting in the lipid adopting a splayed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stage 3). The headgroup subsequently emerged in a small periplasmic-exposed cavity, with the acyl chains remaining deep within the groove of YhdP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stage 4). In 3 of our simulations, the lipid then travelled further up the groove and the headgroup re-emerged in a second cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, Stage 5). Here, the lipid is at the base of a continuous lipid conduit through which it could travel towards the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). While the mechanism described here requires further investigation, our molecular dynamics simulations support a model where PLs can enter the groove at the N-terminus of YhdP, to gain access to the lipid conduit.</p><p id="P26">To directly test if PLs traverse the groove of YhdP, we sought to utilise an <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking assay for the capture of phosphate-containing molecules, such as PLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Specifically, we wanted to examine if PLs interact directly with YhdP and, if so, where within YhdP they are located. We incorporated the unnatural, photo-crosslinkable amino acid p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa) into YhdP at 15 different locations. We chose 10 locations along the length of the protein that are predicted to line the aforementioned groove for Bpa substitution: W227, F297, F464, F639, F705, W843, F888, W992, F1070, and Y1085 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In parallel, we selected 5 residues predicted to face outwards into the periplasm: K264, R663, E873, K960 and K1057.</p><p id="P27">Wild type YhdP and the 15 mutant proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of 32P orthophosphate resulting in the bulk labelling of all phosphate-containing molecules, including PLs. After UV treatment, which induces crosslinks between Bpa and nearby molecules, we purified the proteins and analysed them by SDS-PAGE and phosphor imaging. For 9 of the 10 inward facing residues, we observed a very strong phosphor signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). As Bpa forms crosslinks with C-H bonds, and there is evidence for YhdP as a PL transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), we hypothesise that the modified residues form crosslinks with the acyl chains of PLs as they transit the protein. The single inward-facing residue that formed less crosslinks was F464, which may be explained by its location towards the edge of the groove where it would potentially have less contact with PL acyl chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P28">In contrast to the inward facing residues, the detected phosphor signal was distinctly lower for the outward facing residues, and the WT control, indicating that efficient cross-linking to phosphate-containing substrates required the modified residues to line the groove of YhdP. To ensure the observed signal arose from site specific crosslinking, we selected the 4 inward facing residues yielding the highest phosphor signals (F297, F705, W992, F1070), and performed a separate set of replicates with both crosslinked and uncrosslinked samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Whilst the crosslinked samples reflected those previously observed, there was a distinct reduction in the phosphor signal of the uncrosslinked samples confirming that the signals detected reflected Bpa dependent crosslinking to phosphate-containing molecules at these specific locations.</p><p id="P29">Our Bpa crosslinking assay provides two key insights into the function of YhdP. Firstly, YhdP directly interacts with phosphate-containing molecules, consistent with the genetic data that YhdP functions as a PL transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Secondly, these data indicate that phosphate-containing molecules, such as PLs, are present along the entire length of the YhdP groove, supporting our hypothesis that PLs would travel along this groove for transport between the inner and outer membranes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">In this study we provide direct evidence to support a model in which YhdP forms a periplasmic-spanning bridge through which PLs are transported to the bacterial OM. We identify that helical regions at the N- and C-terminus of YhdP are functionally important, potentially due to interactions with the inner and outer membranes, respectively. Of interest is the short amphipathic helix (P-helix) that our molecular dynamic simulations indicate to embed within the outer leaflet of the IM. Similar helices have been reported previously in a cryo-EM structure of the IM PL transport complex, MlaFEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and are implicated in coordinating interactions between protein subunits, suggesting that the P-helix in YhdP could perform a similar role with yet-to-be identified partner proteins. The two helices towards the C-terminus of YhdP we anticipate to directly interact with the inner leaflet of the OM. It is unclear whether such interactions would be purely to anchor YhdP to the OM, or if they somehow aid in OM lipid insertion, either directly or via interaction with OM protein(s). Nevertheless, as OM proteins usually adopt β barrel conformations or are anchored as lipoproteins, the direct interaction of helices with the OM is an unusual observation and one which merits further investigation.</p><p id="P31">A striking feature of the YhdP Alphafold model is a hydrophobic groove that is continuous along all but the extreme N-terminus of the protein. Our molecular dynamics simulations of YhdP revealed IM PLs to spontaneously enter the groove, in a splayed conformation, with one tail facing upwards towards the OM, whilst the other faces downwards toward the IM. A similar splayed PL conformation has been previously observed in MlaFEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), suggesting this may be an energetically favourable conformation for PLs to be extracted from or inserted into the membrane. While our simulations suggest that YhdP is amenable to PL uptake, further analyses are required to fully assess the validity of the splayed conformation, and how this may alter in the event of bulk PL transport in which AsmA proteins have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Nevertheless, our <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking data indicates the presence of putative PLs throughout the length of the groove, supporting a model in which PLs traverse the length of the YhdP groove for direct transport between the inner and outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Together, our model supports the previous studies proposing YhdP as the principal anterograde PL transporter in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P32">The observation that YhdP provides a continuous, shielded, lipophilic environment between the inner and outer membranes evokes comparison to the LptA bridge structure of the Lpt system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Transport of LPS to the OM occurs via a periplasmic bridge, constructed of multiple LptA copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Whilst there is no detectable sequence homology between LptA and YhdP, bridge-type transporters appear a logical mechanism for transporting molecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts through the aqueous periplasm. One important difference between the Lpt system and YhdP is the presence of identified protein binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The IM LptB2FGC ABC transporter uses ATP hydrolysis to extract LPS from the IM and transfer it to LptA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). LPS binding sites are always occupied along the length of the LptA periplasmic bridge, meaning LPS insertion at the IM triggers a sequence of movements that displaces and inserts an LPS molecule into the OM, through the OM complex LptDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). With the exception of TamB that is known to interact with the OM β barrel, TamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), no binding partners are currently reported for YhdP or the remaining <italic>E. coli</italic> AsmA-like proteins. It is plausible that, like LptA, YhdP would require IM binding partner(s) for the extraction of lipids from the IM, perhaps utilising ATP hydrolysis or the proton motive force. However, it is also conceivable that PL transport occurs independently of cellular energy sources and instead responds to the concentration gradient of PLs present across the cell envelope. This notion is supported by the observation that PL transport to the OM, and the YhdP-dependent flow of PLs, can occur in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Furthermore, it is yet to be determined whether YhdP would require an OM interactor for the insertion of PLs into the inner leaflet of the OM.</p><p id="P33">Of note, the DedA family of proteins are emerging as potential IM interactors of the AsmA-like family based upon the observation that plant homologs of the DedA and AsmA-like proteins directly interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). The DedA family of proteins are conserved across life, and are implicated in the transport of lipid molecules across membranes. Furthermore, a recent publication implicated a <italic>Bacillus</italic> DedA protein in the flipping of phosphatidylethanolamine across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).

A nanopore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>) was placed within one of the lipid bilayers to enable exchange of water between the two compartments.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Simulations</title><p id="P47">The velocity rescale (V-rescale) thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) with a coupling constant of t = 1 was used for all simulations to maintain the system temperature at 323 K. The pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>) with a time constant of t = 12 ps. An elastic network was added to all models using Martinize.py (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>) with a dual cut-off of 0.5 and 0.9 nm, and a force constant of 500 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-2</sup>. The exception was AcrAB-TolC of the full system simulation, which used the ElNeDyn Martini forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>), according to the details provided in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). All simulations using Martini2.2 used the recommended parameters for treatment of electrostatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Atomistic simulations used the simulation parameters generated by CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>).</p><p id="P48">The full N-terminal fragment was first subjected to the default CHARMM-GUI energy minimisation protocol. Equilibration followed a modified CHARMM-GUI protocol, where the system was initially simulated within the NVT ensemble, followed by simulation within the NPT ensemble, which involved successively increasing the time step from 2 fs to 20 fs, initially using a Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>) (5.0 ps coupling constant) and then switching to the Parrinello-Rahman barostat. Restraints were lowered successively, starting at 1000 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> on the backbone beads and 200 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> on the lipid headgroups, ending with zero restraints by the fourth equilibration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Three separate simulations each of 5 μs duration were carried out within the NPT ensemble, each with randomly assigned velocities. The N-terminal fragment without a TM domain was simulated using the same protocol for three separate simulations of 5 μs.</p><p id="P49">The C-terminal fragment was first subjected to energy minimisation using the steepest descents algorithm. The minimised system was simulated within the NPT ensemble using the V-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat as described above. Six separate simulations of 5 μs each were carried out, each with randomly assigned velocities. The mutated Chelix_1 fragment was simulated using the same protocol three separate times for 5 μs each.</p><p id="P50">The full system used the default CHARMM-GUI energy minimisation protocol albeit for an extended number of steps. The system was then equilibrated within the NPT ensemble as according to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, with integration time step successively increasing from 5 fs to 15 fs. Simulation within the NVT ensemble was not used to allow the membrane to fill in holes left by removal of one AcrAB-TolC. Three simulations of 2 μs were carried out, each with randomly assigned velocities.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Analysis</title><p id="P51">Analysis was carried out using PyLipID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>), MDAnalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) using in house scripts, and in-built GROMACS functions.

IM lipids are loaded into the N-terminal of YhdP, potentially assisted by as yet unidentified IM partner proteins. Lipids traverse along the hydrophobic groove of YhdP towards the OM. Once again, the mechanism of unloading at the OM is unclear and is potentially facilitated by additional partner proteins. In contrast, LPS is loaded into the periplasmic bridge structure, formed of LptA monomers, by the IM LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC machinery and sequentially shunted towards the OM. Once at the OM, the insertion of LPS is performed by the LptDE subcomplex.
