This approach has been useful in the field of drug discovery, ranging from phenotype-based screening to identifying a compound’s mechanism of action or toxicity. As a greater amount of data becomes available however, there are growing demands for deep learning methods to be applied to perturbation data. In this paper we applied the transformer-based SwinV2 computer vision architecture to predict the mechanism of action of 10 kinase inhibitor compounds directly from raw images of the cellular response. This method outperforms the standard approach of using image-based profiles, multidimensional feature set representations generated by bioimaging software. Furthermore, we combined the best performing models for three different data modalities, raw images, image-based profiles and compound chemical structures, to form a fusion model, Cell-Vision Fusion (CVF). This approach classified the kinase inhibitors with 69.79% accuracy and 70.56% F1 score, 4.20% and 5.49% greater, respectively, than the best performing image-based profile method. Our work provides three techniques, specific to Cell Painting images, which enable the SwinV2 architecture to train effectively, and explores approaches to combat the significant batch effects present in large Cell Painting perturbation datasets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In the field of drug development, the vastness of the “drug-like” chemical space makes it impractical to explore through clinical trials alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. As a result, less complex model systems such as cells or tissues are commonly employed for the initial testing of potential drug candidates. Powered by the latest advancements in high-throughput microscopy, image analysis has become a core component for investigating the impact of chemical compounds on cellular morphology, structures and processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Image-based profiling (IBP) is one popular method of analyzing the cellular phenotypic changes caused by chemical perturbations. The choice of profiling assay influences the information that can be extracted from the cell’s response, ranging from multi-omic representations to single readouts of cell health, such as viability or apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The most commonly applied IBP assay is Cell Painting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, where six fluorescent dyes are used to stain eight specific cellular components, including the “nucleus, nucleolus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, mitochondria, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and cytoskeleton” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. A microscope is then used to image the cell’s response across five channels. The standard approach processes these images using a software package, such as CellProfiler <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, to extract morphological features at the single-cell level after applying segmentation techniques. These features are aggregated into several thousand profile-level features which aim to represent the overall cellular response to a particular perturbation. The feature sets measure changes to the cell’s size, shape, intensity, protein colocalization and texture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Post-processing steps including normalization, standardization, feature selection and dimensionality reduction are then applied to facilitate downstream supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Cell Painting has proven effective in the field of drug development, enabling the comparison of cellular response between patients with a disease and healthy patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, predicting the mitochondrial toxicity of drug compounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and for inferring the mechanism of action (MOA) of different compounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The assay captures fundamentally distinct information from transcriptomic or proteomic profiling, while being a higher throughput and lower cost approach to obtaining quantifiable information about a cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Despite this, the historical lack of a large-scale dataset, produced using a standardized assay and labelled with ground truth information, has limited the application of deep learning methods in the field. Prior work has typically been restricted in scale, often incorporating fewer than 1,000 perturbations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and predominantly utilizing clustering algorithms to differentiate between compounds which often have unrelated mechanisms. This data scarcity, coupled with a growing demand for high throughput approaches to assess cellular phenotypic response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, prompted the formation of the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium, which released “cpg0016”, a Cell Painting dataset containing more than 140,000 chemical and genetic perturbations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Prior IBP research has postulated whether large Cell Painting datasets, with data produced at multiple centres under varying conditions, could be combined successfully, despite the inevitable batch effects. Novel deep learning solutions are sought-after, given their ability to handle complex, high dimensional data. Therefore, they may be able to model the “subtlety of cellular phenotypes” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, while navigating the noise created by confounding factors such as off-target toxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the current standard approach is reliant on single-cell segmentation, making it less relevant for specific cell types, such as adhesion cells which typically grow close together, making their borders difficult to segment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This limitation has led previous phenotypic profiling research to focus on “broad cell groups, such as lymphocytes, granulocytes, and erythrocytes, that have morphologies easily distinguishable to the human eye” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Advanced computer vision-based methods can learn directly from the images themselves, rather than being reliant on an intermediate feature set. Firstly, this introduces the possibility of uncovering previously unanticipated biology, not accounted for by the well-established profiling features. Secondly, by learning from the whole image, greater context behind the cellular response may be captured, allowing the model to incorporate a more accurate representation of dynamic spatial features like cell motility. Deep learning-based approaches have proved successful in many biological domains, from the classification of radiographic and pathological images <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to industrial-level drug discovery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. They have also recently been applied in the context of image-base profiling to develop phenotypic models of active SARS-CoV-2 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and in the identification of new potential compounds to rejuvenate the immune systems of elderly adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In this paper, we predict the MOA of 10 different kinase inhibitor compounds, tested in the cpg0016 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The MOA of many drugs is often poorly understood at a molecular level, resulting in the high failure rates of clinical drug development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Phenotypic drug discovery is seen as an alternative to target-based approaches, and one that has led to comparatively high numbers of recent first-in-class molecular entities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, determining the MOA of compounds of interest with high accuracy has been a major barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, one which may be subsiding with the development of sophisticated phenotypic assays like Cell Painting, in combination with the latest machine learning methods. Imaging offers researchers a bird’s-eye view of cellular phenotypic changes, providing a physical definition of the cellular response. For example, some inhibitors rupture cell membranes or nuclei, others induce gross structural defects or render cells non-functional by causing such significant damage to core machinery to promote senescence. These signals reside in the imaging data and can be used to compare and characterize the multiplicity of effects of different drug compounds.</p><p id="P9">The kinase inhibitor class was selected for this research due to their importance in the field of drug discovery, particularly in targeted cancer therapy, as well as their well-documented off-target effects which make them, theoretically, a difficult subpopulation to classify with high accuracy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Our class-specific MOA classifier, enabled by the greater data availability present within cpg0016, is therefore distinct from prior MOA research, which has often compared disparate mechanisms such as ATPase inhibitors with retinoid receptor agonists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, or Eg5 inhibitors with microtubule stabilizers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Within this work we compare and contrast different computational methods of normalization, standardization, feature selection and data augmentation when training models with the three separate modalities which are present within the cpg0016 dataset – Cell Painting images, image-based profiles, and compound chemical structures. We introduce three methods, specific to five-channel Cell Painting image data, which enable the SwinV2 computer vision architecture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> to classify images directly from the raw pixels with better performance than the standard approach using CellProfiler IBP features. Finally, we combine the three data modalities to form a fusion architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), referred to as Cell-Vision Fusion (CVF), which outperforms the single modality approaches, confirming similar results found in other Cell Painting papers where more than one modalities were combined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Feature selection</title><p id="P11">The CellProfiler-produced IBP data contains 4,762 features representing the cellular response to a perturbation in a specific experimental well. To reduce these features to focus on those which are specific to identifying kinase inhibition, we compared the impact on model performance of using a Shapley value <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> feature ranking with the current standard approach of using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pycytominer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pycytominer</ext-link> package (v1.0.1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The Shapley importance values revealed that there were a relatively small number of important features. The top 20 features had substantially higher importance than the other features, and there were many features in the long tail of the distribution with very little positive contribution to model performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This observation was confirmed when these ranked features were used to select model features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the cross-validated accuracy and F1 scores of an XGBoost model, trained with varying numbers of features, revealing that, past the top 150 Shapley ranked features, including more features reduces performance. 150 features were selected as the optimal number due to the lower standard deviation between cross-validation folds (the shaded areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as being the number which elicited the highest F1 score. This number of features is similar to the 184 Cell Painting features used by Seal et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> to predict assay hit calls.</p><p id="P12">Comparatively, applying Pycytominer’s feature selection module resulted in 871 retained features. Using these features in the same baseline XGBoost model achieved an average cross-validated accuracy of 57.05% and F1 score of 53.43%, underperforming the 150 Shapley feature model which recorded 60.26% accuracy and 57.57% F1 score. In the following sections we compare how these two feature selection methods perform when combined with different normalization and standardization approaches, as well as when using a range of different model types.</p><p id="P13">The Shapley value analysis also highlighted two important results. Firstly, prior to performing quality control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Quality control</xref>), the feature with the greatest importance was one representing the image quality of the DNA channel, implying image quality was impacting model performance to a greater degree than the underlying biological signal. Post quality control measures, these image quality features dropped significantly in terms of Shapley importance, with the DNA image quality feature falling to the 110th rank. Secondly, the importance of Zernike moment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> features was highlighted. Zernike moments are a set of orthogonal complex-valued polynomials defined over a unit disk which are widely used in image processing and computer vision for shape analysis and pattern recognition. In this context they have been applied by CellProfiler to represent the shape of the single cells captured in the images. Zernike moment features account for only 1.88% of the original 4,762 feature set, but 38% of the top 100 Shapley-ranked features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), displaying the significance of cellular morphology shape changes when classifying kinase inhibitors. This finding aligns with prior kinase inhibitor research, which shows cell shape can be significantly altered by inhibitors preventing kinase proteins from regulating cytoskeleton dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, as well as affecting cell adhesion, migration and death via apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. This also suggests computer vision models, given their aptitude for object detection, are well-suited for the task of differentiating between cellular response where morphological changes are so prominent.</p><p id="P14">One further strength of using Shapley values is the ability to be able to interpret their individual impact on the model for each separate class. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> shows the Shapley importance values for the top 10 features that contributed to the classification of the mTOR class. The top ranking feature for mTOR relates to the correlation between the nuclei and the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria channels. mTOR is an important regulator of mitochondrial function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and plays a regulatory role in endoplasmic reticulum stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> where the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling has been found to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Furthermore, there are several features representing “tubeness”, i.e., how “tube-like” the mitochondrial structures in the images are, as well as their distribution or prevalence throughout the image. This feature of mTOR inhibition can be observed in the example mitochondrial channel image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p id="P15">The Shapley feature ranking can therefore be useful to provide an understanding of how the CellProfiler features relate to underlying morphological changes as well as being directly relatable to literature. Additionally, these rankings may provide new insights into mechanisms of action, which can form the basis for experimental studies or applications. The top 10 Shapley-ranked CellProfiler features for each class can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reducing batch effects: Image-based profiles</title><p id="P16">Batch effects are a key consideration when training models on Cell Painting data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, especially in the case of cpg0016 where experiments were performed by different contributing partners (referred to as “sources”), under a variety of experimental conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Data acquisition</xref>). To attempt to reduce the impact of these batch effects, different normalization and/or standardization methods were employed. Normalization scales and centres data within a specific range (often between zero and one) and is commonly used when algorithms require input values in these ranges to function effectively. Standardization transforms data to have zero mean and unit variance, centering the data around zero. Prior work has shown using control samples from the same experimental plate to normalize/standardize data can help to partially eliminate batch effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To visualize the impact of these effects within our kinase inhibitor dataset, and to gain some insight into how well each approach counteracted them, while retaining the underlying biological signal, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">UMAP plots were created showing how the IBP datapoints clustered in two dimensions. Three different labels were used to colour the datapoints, being the microscope which was used to take the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), the source where the experiment was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the MOA of each compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Each plot is titled according to the processing techniques which were applied, where “Baseline” reflects the raw data prior to these steps. The baseline plots show the extreme impact of the batch effects in the data, causing datapoints to cluster according to the microscope and source, but showing no association between compounds with the same MOA.</p><p id="P18">Using median absolute deviation (MAD) normalization in combination with either spherization or Harmony (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for more detail) resulted in a clearer separation of the datapoints compared to the baseline approach or min-max normalization. While Harmony appeared to be more adept at reducing the impact of the microscope, overall, the datapoint MOA clusters are less well aligned than when using MAD normalization, spherization and Shapley-ranked feature selection (“Sphere MAD + Shapley”). Spherization and MAD normalization works more effectively when using only the top 150 Shapley-ranked features, rather than the 871 features retained by Pycytominer. This suggests some of Pycytominer features are highly correlated to the underlying microscope and source batch effects, and removing them would improve a model’s ability to classify by MOA. Based on these plots we would expect a classifier, trained on the Shapley-reduced feature set, MAD normalized and using a spherization transformation to have the best performance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Classifying Kinase Inhibitor MOA</xref>). Looking at individual MOA classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) we can observe that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), Aurora kinase (AURK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors appear most well-distinguished. In contrast, Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF), Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) appear the least well clustered, implying these classes will be the most difficult to classify with high accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reducing batch effects: Raw images</title><p id="P19">UMAP embeddings were also plotted for the raw image data, before and after using per-channel normalization (PCN) and plate-wise, channel-wise standardization (PCS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). PCN min-max normalizes the image channels separately between zero and one, while PCS standardizes each channel based on either the DMSO negative controls or the positive control compound average pixel values for the specific plate where the experiment image was captured (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Raw Images: Normalization and standardization</xref>). Both methods perform similarly in terms of counteracting the obscuring batch effects visible in the baseline UMAP embeddings, caused by both the experiment source and microscope used. Unlike the UMAP plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, where the ROCK, AURK and CDK inhibtors partially clustered according to MOA, there are no clear MOA clusters revealed by the UMAP embeddings of the images. This was anticipated given these embeddings were obtained by passing each image through a pre-trained ResNet-50 classifier that had not been fine-tuned on any Cell Painting data, and because the information contained in the raw pixels is likely too complex to represent effectively in two dimensions. A computer vision architecture, specifically trained on Cell Painting data, is therefore likely required to separate classes effectively. The positive impact these methods had on eliminating batch effects can be evidenced in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> results and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>, which show the model performance improvements when PCN and PCS are applied, in addition to using channel-weighted data augmentation (CWA) throughout training (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Raw images: Data augmentation</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Classifying Kinase Inhibitor MOA</title><p id="P20">Five-fold average test set performance metrics were computed, comparing models trained using the three different data modalities (image-based profiles, images and compound structure), as well as the fusion model architecture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The best performing model trained on a single modality was the SwinV2 model as it achieved greater average accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall and AUPR metrics than all other single modality approaches. Despite also being trained on images, EfficientNet performed comparatively worse, achieving accuracy and F1 scores of 62.05% and 54.17% respectively, compared to SwinV2’s 66.67% and 69.59%, reflecting EfficientNet’s inability to classify the EGFR or mTOR inhibitor classes. For both the IBP and compound structure modalities, the MLP models sourced from prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> outperformed the less complex XGBoost approach. However, the improvement was only marginal for the IBP data, likely due to the XGBoost-based Shapley feature selection.</p><p id="P22">The confusion matrices of the best performing models for each modality enable a comparison of how well suited each modality is to predicting each MOA class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 A-D</xref>). The SwinV2 model is comparatively worse at predicting the majority class (PI3K inhibitors), the IBP-based model predicts the EGFR class with only 11.11% accuracy, while the compound structure-based MLP finds it most difficult to predict the ROCK and GSK classes. The only consistently well-predicted class is p38 MAPK.</p><p id="P23">Overall the fusion model achieved the best performance, gaining a macro-averaged F1 score of 70.56% alongside strong performance in the other measure metrics. This demonstrates there was a clear synergistic impact from combining the different modalities and each model architecture was extracting partially unique information from the data. This was suggested by the confusion matrices which show distinctly different predictions per class between the approaches. The performance improvements gained when applying different model architectures, normalization, standardization and feature selection methods were compared for the image-based profile data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>) and the raw image data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). The best performing IBP-based MLP and XGBoost models (results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) both utilized MAD normalization, spherization and the top 150 Shapley-ranked features, as predicted from observing the UMAP embedding plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P24">For the image data, channel-weighted augmentation (CWA) boosted performance by 0.91% and 3.84% over the respective accuracy and F1 score of the baseline approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Combining per-channel normalization (PCN) with CWA improved accuracy by 4.21% and F1 score by 4.57%, while plate-wise, channel-wise standardization (PCS) in combination with CWA increased accuracy and F1 score by 5.31% and 4.87%. However, using all three techniques in unison resulted in a much greater performance improvement, increasing accuracy by 12.72% and F1 score by 18.28%, ultimately enabling the SwinV2 architecture to outperform the IBP-based approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">We have successfully applied the SwinV2 computer vision architecture to predict kinase inhibitor MOA directly from Cell Painting images with performance exceeding that of the current standard IBP-based approach. Our work confirms assumptions that additional context can be derived by incorporating the whole images into a deep learning model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, providing additional information that is not captured by the CellProfiler features derived from single-cell segmentations. Combining three separate data modalities into the Cell-Vision Fusion architecture proved to be beneficial for model performance overall. When put in the context of a compound screen of thousands of potential drug candidates, the 4.2% improvement in both accuracy and precision over the best image-based profile approach is impactful in terms of correctly identified MOAs which can inform further testing.</p><p id="P26">Our work has also shown the batch effects present in cpg0016 can be at least partially eliminated, through various normalization and standardization techniques. In the case of using the images, taking a channel-based approach to augmentation, as well as normalization and standardization, proved to be beneficially additive to the model during training, reflecting the channel-specific information included in the Cell Painting five-channel format. Our work also explored the benefits of using Shapley rankings to perform feature selection over the current standard approach to use Pycytominer. While the performance gain was not excessive (1.3% greater accuracy and 3.5% greater F1 score - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), the additional interpretability of the model features with greatest importance for class-specific prediction is a noteworthy benefit as it provides comparability with known literature, as well as the possibility of uncovering previously unanticipated biology.</p><p id="P27">ROCK, AURK, p38 MAPK and MEK inhibitor classes are well predicted across both image and IBP modalities. All of these MOA classes were shown to cluster more distinctly than other classes in the UMAP diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the Shapley importance features tend to be more unique for these classes, suggesting there are definitive morphological changes specific to the inhibition of those proteins which are captured by CellProfiler and are well represented in the amalgamated profiles. Lastly, the DepMap TPM gene expression values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note S2</xref>) for genes related to these inhibited proteins are relatively high compared to other classes in our dataset, suggesting their inhibition results in a strong phenotypic response which is more easily able to be captured by morphological feature representations.</p><p id="P28">Looking at the individual MOA class predictions across model types, there are some insights into why particular inhibitors may have been classified with lower comparative accuracy. The SwinV2 model exhibits a lower predictive accuracy on the majority PI3K class (17.7% of all compounds) with 41.18% accuracy, compared to 73.33% using the IBP data and 64.71% with the compound structures. The image-based model commonly miss-classifies PI3K as EGFR, while the IBP-based model does the opposite, identifying EGFR samples with only 11.11% accuracy. This may reflect the fact the PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the major signalling pathways downstream from EGFR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and PI3K/Akt signal transduction has been shown to be inhibited by antibodies binding directly to EGFRs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. On inspection of the highly ranked Shapley features for both classes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note S1</xref>), both classes share common important features relating to the F-actin cytoskeleton, Golgi and plasma membrane (AGP) channel. The EGFR is an actin-binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> which has been shown to reorganize the junctional actin cytoskeleton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. PI3K can also disrupt the actin cytoskeleton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, while both contribute to actin filament remodelling throughout the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. EGFR is also highly connected to the functioning of the Golgi apparatus in protein transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> and is a plasma membrane receptor. Comparatively, PI3K-generated PIP3 is localized to the plasma membrane and is involved in protein kinase localization and activation as well as the EGFR regulation of membrane ruffling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. These impacts to both cytoskeletal rearrangement, membrane activity and cell motility are likely causes for the models to misclassify PI3K and EGFR when only the cellular phenotypic response is considered. Notably, the prediction of both classes improves when only relying on compound structure. Futhermore, both EGFR and PI3K-related DepMap TPM gene expression values were among the lowest of all the kinase inhibitor classes tested within cpg0016 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note S2</xref>), implying there would be a less significant phenotypic response to these compounds in U2OS cells specifically. For similar inter-related pathway reasons, mTOR, which operates downstream from PI3K/Akt, is most commonly misclassified as PI3K by all models. Additionally, both classes exhibit phenotypic shape changes that elongate the mitochondria, demonstrated in the images, as well as the high ranking of “tubeness” features for both classes in the Shapley values. This issue is likely exacerbated by the fact that there are only six unique mTOR inhibitors in the dataset, compared to 17 PI3K inhibitors.</p><p id="P29">EfficientNet comparatively performed poorly at this prediction task. There are several factors which may have contributed to this result. Firstly, the reduction in image size to 240 × 240 pixels compared with the 896 × 896-pixel images fed into the SwinV2 model, may have meant EfficientNet missed some of the fine-grained contextual information retained at higher resolutions. Also, due to being convolution-based, EfficientNet is better suited to modelling local contextual interactions, rather than the global context captured by transformer-based models owing to the attention mechanism. EfficientNet would likely be more adept at modelling single-cell or smaller image crops, compared to being passed the whole image. However, this approach would likely yield similar information to the CellProfiler-generated IBP data, therefore negating the necessity to use the images directly. The results do align with the work of Tian et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, where an EfficientNet model achieved an overall macro-average F1 score of 81%, but only 48% on the AURK inhibitor class, despite AURK being classified against more disparate classes than it was in this work.</p><p id="P30">One of the major limitations in the study is the use of a single cell line – U2OS. It is possible, therefore, that models trained on this dataset would fail to generalize with similar performance to a different cancer, or non-cancer, cell line. Similarly, experiments were assayed at the same concentration (10uM, excluding Source seven – see Experimental Conditions). It is highly likely that different compounds have varying potencies and incorporating IC50 information for each compound, or performing experiments at multiple doses could result in more accurate identification of activity. Some evidence of this can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, where datapoints in Source 7 still appear to cluster according to source post-normalization. Our approach also excluded compounds with multiple target classes (i.e., PI3K/mTOR inhibitors), focusing on compounds with a single documented target. This simplistic approach is not reflective of how the majority of kinase inhibitors function, especially when “polypharmacology is the rule rather than the exception for small molecules” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">Additionally, the computational complexity in terms of compute resources, energy cost and expertise needed to design and implement the fusion architecture compared with an XG-Boost model trained on IBP data is vastly more demanding. This work, however, sets an initial benchmark for what can be achieved by leveraging computer vision models in this setting. While over 5,000 images were used to train/validate the SwinV2 model, the actual number of unique kinase inhibitor compounds was only 96, revealing a lack of diversity in the data. Utilizing the methods put forward in this paper did allow the computer vision architecture to learn effectively, however this constrained data situation is not typically where deep learning-based modern computer vision methods thrive. A larger, more diverse dataset could arguably yield greater performance gains over the more traditional approaches to classifying Cell Painting data. For further work it would also be interesting to evaluate the impact of including proteomic or transcriptomic feature sets as additional data modalities, to compare and contrast their relative strengths on a class-specific basis.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Data acquisition</title><p id="P32">The cpg0016 dataset is part of the JUMP Cell Painting collection of datasets which were either produced or reprocessed by the JUMP Consortium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

Shapley values are a concept originally taken from cooperative game theory, in the context of machine learning they can be used to assess the relative contribution of each feature towards the eventual classification. To calculate feature importance, models are created with all possible combinations of feature sets, observing the impact of feature exclusion or inclusion on a model’s performance.

XGBoost was used to generate Shapley values for the kinase inhibitor dataset, using the training data to determine feature importance for each cross-validation fold. To determine the number of features to select, the Shapley values were plotted and the “elbow method” was used to visually observe where the marginal contribution from additional feature inclusion was negligible. To aid interpretability of this method, the contribution of each feature towards each predicted class was plotted for the top 10 features.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Image-based profiles: Normalization and standardization</title><p id="P57">Several different normalization and standardization approaches were tested with the dataset, post-feature selection.

We found optimal performance occurred when, for each image, the brightness and intensity shift augmentation is triggered with probability P<sub>A</sub> = 0.8, and for each channel within that image, it is then applied with a secondary probability P<sub>C</sub> = 0.4. The intensity shift ranged from -0.6 to 0.6, whist the brightness change ranged from -0.1 to 0.1, where both augmentation output images are subsequently clipped in the range [0, 1]. An exploration of the impact of the parameter P<sub>C</sub>’s impact on model performance can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note S6</xref>.</p><p id="P71">Additionally, each image was cropped because the images contributed by each source range from 996 × 996-pixels (sources two and five) to 1,280 × 1,080 (source seven). They were cropped to 896 × 896 pixels so the images are divisible into the corresponding patch sizes required by SwinV2. Random vertical and horizontal flips were also applied during training to help combat overfitting.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Compound Structure</title><p id="P72">Prior research has shown that incorporating compound chemical structure as a feature can provide a context-free (i.e., cell line agnostic) approach to MOA prediction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Including this information, alongside cell painting images, lead to a significant improvement in the ability of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to predict MOA.</p><p id="P73">In this research we have replicated the approach of Tian et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> by using the chemical simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) included within the metadata of the cpg0016 dataset. The SMILES were converted into their molecular structures using the RDKit package function “Chem.MolFromSmiles” before transforming them into 2,048-long Morgan Fingerprint <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> vectors using the “GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect” function of RDKit. We used the Extended-Connectivity Fingerprint (ECFP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> iteration which encodes the compound’s molecular structure as a binary bitstring representation based on the connectivity of atoms and their neighbouring atoms within a defined radius. The resulting vectorized fingerprint therefore captures the presence or absence of specific substructures or chemical features in a molecule.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Modelling approaches</title><p id="P74">For the IBP data, three different machine learning approaches were chosen to test. Random Forest (RF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and Support Vector Machines (SVM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> were trialed due their success in previous MOA or cellular perturbation based tasks. XGBoost (XGB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> was also selected due to the relative success of tree-based models in prior work, and because of its success in predicting drug-induced cell viability in research using L1000 gene expression profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, representations which are similar to the phenotypic profiles in this work. Both RF and SVM were imported from the sklearn package, while XGB was implemented using the dmlc XGBoost implementation.</p><p id="P75">Additionally, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model was utilized, based on the results of Way et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>’s work where it outperformed all other models tested for predicting the MOA of compounds represented by both Cell Painting and L1000 data. The model was adapted from Way et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>’s original Tensorflow code into Pytorch to be consistent with the other models in this work, but the core elements were retained, which included: six fully connected layers with batch normalization, drop out in the first two layers, combinations of the “ELU” (first, third), “ReLU” (second, third), and “SELU” (fifth layer) activation functions and the Adam optimizer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P76">For the raw image data, a transformer-based model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> was desired because we aimed to process the whole images directly and required an architecture which would be capable of modelling long-term dependencies in the data, capturing the overall inter and intra-cellular context of the phenotypic changes caused by the kinase inhibitors. The Swin Transformer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> was selected due to its usage of shifting image patch windows between self-attention layers, limiting the computational complexity while still computing attention globally. This was important due to the scaling nature of the number of images for each compound in the dataset (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), whereby 96 unique compounds equate to 5,191 underlying five-channel images. The SwinV2 implementation was chosen due to its ability to train with greater stability given higher resolution input data. This represents one of the first instances of a deep learning, transformer-based model being applied to Cell Painting data for MOA prediction.</p><p id="P77">EfficientNet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> was used as a comparison for SwinV2, given its popularity in prior cellular perturbation research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that aim to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency by balancing the model’s depth, width, and resolution by using a compound coefficient to scale each component uniformly. Depth refers to the number of layers in the network, width represents the width of the layers (number of channels), and resolution indicates the input image size. This makes the architecture well-suited to handle the five-channel Cell Painting images. The EfficientNet-B1 implementation was applied in this paper and an extra processing step was added, to resize each input image to 240 × 240 pixels during pre-processing, similar to prior work.</p><p id="P78">Tian et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> showed that incorporating a model trained to classify MOA based on the underlying compound chemical structure can provide a context-free (i.e., cell line agnostic) approach to prediction. Furthermore, by concatenating the output from their structural model with a separate model trained on five-channel Cell Painting data, their overall model performance increased from “a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.58 when training on only the structural data, [to] 0.81 when training on only the image data, and 0.92 when training on both together”. Following the approach of Tian et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>‘s research, a similar MLP model was constructed to classify data based on the underlying compound’s chemical structure.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Cell-Vision Fusion (CVF) approach</title><p id="P79">Once the best performing model architecture and hyperparameters were established for each data modality, the CVF architecture was constructed which incorporated all three modalities, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for a schematic of the approach.</p><p id="P80">Since there are multiple fields of view for each experimental well, there are many more images than profiles, as each profile is summarized at the well level. Similarly, as there are replicates of each compound spread across different wells, there are many more well-level profiles than there are individual compounds (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Data Selection</xref> for full details). Therefore, to prevent the fusion model for overfitting, weight decay regularization of 1e-2 was applied using the AdamW optimizer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, in addition to a dropout of 0.2 for the IBP MLP and 0.5 for the compound structure MLP model. Several different methods of fusion were tested when trying to combine the model outputs, including using a learnable fusion layer, an attention-based combination and concatenation. The most successful method, however, utilized Multi-modal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB) fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, combining the three modalities through four separate arithmetic operations which are concatenated before applying a convolutional layer to the resulting matrix. Min-max normalizing the IBP data resulted in greater performance compared to other normalization approaches when all modalities were combined, likely due to the MOAB combination of different model outputs.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Analysis and evaluation</title><p id="P81">XGBoost was selected as the method to investigate the impact of feature selection on model performance as tree-based models are generally not affected by a lack of normalization/feature scaling. This allowed us to first isolate the impact of feature selection on model performance, before applying normalization and standardization methods. Tree-based models also have a hierarchical structure, which generally makes them more interpretable than deep-learning methods, aligning well with the feature contributions of Shapley values. Furthermore, for generating Shapley values, tree-based methods lead to a more efficient value calculation and greater stability and accuracy of feature value predictions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P82">We applied a 5-fold double-stratified cross-validation strategy, similar to Way et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, whereby compounds were stratified by MOA, while ensuring replicates of the same compound were retained in the same training, validation or test set. We utilized a training, validation, test split of 70:10:20, ensuring there was at least one compound of each MOA across each test set. Validation data was used to search for optimal hyperparameters before models were trained with the training and validation data, before being evaluated on the held-out test data of each fold.</p><p id="P83">Prior MOA research has typically used a combination of accuracy, macro-averaged F1 scores, recall and precision to assess model performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) has also been used to represent the trade-off between precision and recall and can be a less optimistic measure than the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve when dealing with datasets with imbalanced, but equally important classes. These metrics were calculated in this paper using the sklearn package.</p><p id="P84">For the IBP data, predictions are made by the models at a well-level. When calculating model metrics, these class prediction probabilities are averaged across wells (i.e., technical/experimental replicates) to result in a compound-level prediction. For the image data, this amalgamation has one further step, as predictions are first averaged across the fields within a well, before being combined into average well-level predictions and finally a class prediction for each compound. The structural model is trained at the compound level initially, so no further processing is required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS192763-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d189aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the UKRI/BBSRC Collaborative Training Partnership in AI for Drug Discovery, led by Exscientia in partnership with Queen Mary University of London.

An ideal plot would display no clustering according to the microscope type in A or originating source in B (as these are not biologically relevant), and instead would show datapoints clustering close together if the compounds they represent operate with the same mechanism (C), and thus should result in similar observed phenotypic changes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192763-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Reducing the impact of batch effects by normalizing and standardizing the image data</title><p>UMAP plots displaying the raw image data, reduced to two dimensions after being passed through a ResNet-50 classifier to obtain embeddings.
