We recently reported an unexpected usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), instead of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), for cellular entry by NeoCoV and PDF-2180, close relatives of MERS-CoV that infect African bats. However, the presence and distribution of other ACE2-using merbecoviruses remain enigmatic. In this study, through sequence and structural analyses, we predicted that two newly discovered merbecoviruses infecting European Pipistrellus bats (<italic>Pipistrellus nathusii</italic>), namely MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B, may also utilize ACE2 as their receptors. Functional profiling of 103 ACE2 orthologues from a variety of mammals confirmed that several ACE2 from bats efficiently facilitate the entry of MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B. Conversely, no binding or entry signals for both viruses were detected when assessing seven DPP4 orthologues from humans, hedgehogs, and bats. Characterization of Pteronotus davyi (P.dav) ACE2 mediated entry of MOW-15-22 reveals a significant exogenous protease dependence, which can be dose-dependently neutralized by soluble P.dav ACE2 recombinant protein and a broadly neutralizing S2-targeting antibody. Verification of the previously reported critical ACE2 determinants for <underline>NeoCoV recognition reveals that</underline> MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B displayed a glycan-independent binding mode with significantly altered interaction details.

Notably, the three high pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, all belong to the β-coronaviruses genus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. MERS-CoV, classified under the merbecoviruses subgenus, is the causative agent for the Middle East respiratory syndrome with a case-fatality rate of 36%, which caused sporadic transmission since its outbreak in 2012 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Although dromedary camels have been well documented as intermediate host of MERS-CoV, the evolutionary origin of this virus remains unclear and has been linked to potential recombinations in bat merbecoviruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The viral receptor is a key host factor for viral entry, determining tissue tropism, host range, and transmission efficiency of viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Thus far, ACE2 and DPP4 have been widely acknowledged protein receptors for β-coronaviruses. both are engaged by the C-terminal domain (or domain B) of subunit 1 (S1-CTD) of viral spike proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Typically, ACE2 is considered the primary entry receptor for sarbecoviruses, whereas DPP4 is thought to mediate entry for many merbecoviruses, although uncharacterized receptor usage has been found in viruses from both subgenus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, recent discoveries have challenged these notions. NeoCoV and PDF-2180, two close relatives of MERS-CoV found in African bats, employ a novel interaction mode to recognize ACE2 as their functional receptors, revealing a receptor usage promiscuity among merbecoviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. While these two viruses exhibit limited efficiency in using human ACE2 (hACE2), a single mutation (e.g., T510F) in the receptor binding motif (RBM) enhances their ability to enter human cells. Moreover, NeoCoV and PDF-2180 display a broad ACE2 recognition spectrum across various mammals, underscoring a relatively high zoonotic risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Nonetheless, the receptors for many merbecoviruses, including hedgehog coronaviruses (EriCoVs) such as HKU31, as well as several other bat coronaviruses like HKU5, MOW-15-22, and PN-βCoV remain elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Previous studies have suggested that HKU5 and HKU31 may not use DPP4 or ACE2 as their receptors, leaving their entry receptor identities to be determined. MOW-15-22 and PN-βCoV are two bat merbecoviruses recently identified in <italic>P. nathusii</italic> bats, a bat species commonly found in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To avoid confusion, we designated a specific virus of PN-βCoV (Betacoronavirus sp. isolate BtCoV/P.nathusii/NL/2018-403.3) as PnNL2018B in this study since both viruses are β-CoVs infecting the same host. MOW-15-22 was discovered in the Mosco region, while the PnNL2018B was identified in bats residing in the Netherlands with complete genome sequenced, although its relative VM314 (defined based on a sequence fragment in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) has been reported as early as in 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

Our findings suggest that the diversity of ACE2-using merbecoviruses may be broader than previously recognized, raising concerns about the potential human emergence of these viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Phylogenetic and structural analyses suggest ACE2 usage by MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B</title><p id="P6">Recently, two novel bat merbecoviruses with complete genome sequenced, MOW-15-22 and PN-βCoV (designated PnNL2018B in this study), were independently reported by research teams in Russia and Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both viruses were discovered in <italic>P. nathusii</italic>, a bat species inhabiting a wide range of Europe and undertakes a seasonal long-distance migration, usually from northeast to southwest Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In our quest to identify receptors for representative merbecoviruses, we noticed these two viruses form a distinct clade and exhibited an unknown receptor usage. At the complete-genome level, MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B share less genetic similarity with the African bat coronaviruses NeoCoV and PDF-2180 but show greater genetic homology with a Italian bat merbecovirus (Hsavll/ltaly/206645-40/2011) and a DPP4-using virus HKU25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, their RBD sequences from these viruses cluster with the ACE2-using NeoCoV/PDF-2180 and an Asian hedgehog virus HKU31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Aligning of equivalent sequences based on the NeoCoV receptor binding motif (RBM) reveals a relatively variable region with low conservation, signifying uncertainty regarding receptor usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, the MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B possess two insertions at the putative RBM compared to other merbecoviruses, potentially significantly influencing receptor interactions. Notably, the AlphaFold-predicted RBD structures of MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B more closely resemble the ACE2-utilizing merbecoviruses NeoCoV and PDF-2180 in view of the presence of an helix region within the RBM, albeit with elongated putative receptor binding loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Simplot analysis queried by MERS-CoV genome sequences demonstrates that the RBD regions of MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B display lower similarity to MERS-CoV compared to the DPP4-using HKU4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest potential ACE2 usage by MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B, eventhough they are phylogenetic distant from NeoCoV and PDF-2180 at the whole-genome level.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Multi-species ACE2 usage spectrum of MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B</title><p id="P7">To determine whether MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B utilize ACE2 as their receptors, we conducted a series of cell-based experiments to evaluate the functionality of various ACE2 orthologue in facilitating viral RBD binding and pseudovirus entry. As the complete genome sequences or coding sequences of ACE2 and DPP4 orthologues from <italic>P. nathusii</italic> are currently unavailable, we utilized a well-characterized receptor library consisting of 103 ACE2 and 7 DPP4 orthologues from 52 bats and 53 non-bat mammals to comprehensively assess RBD binding and pseudovirus entry efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These assays were carried out in 293T cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing the receptors, all of which were previously confirmed to be properly expressed.. Our findings indicate that MOW-15-22 pseudovirus entry occurred in cells expressing bat ACE2 from P. par, P. dav, L. bor, and several other bat species, while the the PnNL2018B pseudovirus entry was supported by bat ACE2 from L. bor, N. hum, P. pip, and several other bat species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, in contrast to NeoCoV and PDF-2180, which exhibit a broad potential host tropism, both MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B were incapable of efficiently utilizing ACE2 from non-bat mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Although we lack ACE2 binding data from the host species P. nat, we observe efficient RBD binding of MOW-15-22 in cells expressing two ACE2 orthologues from the <italic>Pteronotus</italic> genus (P. dav and P. par) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, no binding or entry signal was detected in cells expressing human ACE2 and several DPP4 orthologues from the indicated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-g</xref>). It’s important to note that the observed inconsistency between RBD binding and viral entry is a phenomenon commonly observed in other coronaviruses, including NeoCoV/PDF-2180 and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that RBD binding is dynamic, whereas pseudotype entry is a cumulative event. Consequently, some receptors with kinetic features of fast association and fast dissociation can mediate efficient entry but may not exhibit strong binding in end-point binding assays. Indeed, the relative entry efficiency is also greatly influenced by the presence of exogenous trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h-j</xref>), which is believed to lower the energy barrier and facilitate viral entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, ACE2 orthologues that are less efficient in supporting viral binding, such as L. bor ACE2, exhibited significantly higher dependence on the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterization of bat ACE2-mediated entry of novel ACE2-using merbecoviruses</title><p id="P8">We proceeded to characterize the functionality of representative bat ACE2 in mediating the infection of these European merbecoviruses. A live-cell immunofluorescence-based RBD-hFc binding assay demonstrated that P.dav and P.par ACE2 efficiently facilitated the RBD binding of MOW-15-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Flow cytometry was subsequently conducted to confirm specific RBD binding supported by the ACE2 orthologues from P.dav and P.par, with human ACE2 (hACE2) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Binding kinetics between MOW-15-22 RBD and P.dav or human ACE2 were analyzed using the Biolayer Interferometry (BLI). In general, P.dav ACE2 exhibited rapid association with MOW-15-22 RBD. However, the dissociation of P.dav ACE2 from MOW-15-22 RBD was also fast compared to the P.pip ACE2-NeoCoV RBD complex, resulting in a KD of approximately 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). By contrast, no binding signal was detected between human ACE2 and MOW-15-22 RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We further investigated the viral spike-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion assisted by different ACE2 orthologues. The two novel ACE2-using viruses lack furin cleavage sites at the S1/S2 junction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Consequently, MOW-15-22 exhibited a prominent trypsin-dependent membrane fusion phenotype in bat ACE2-expressing cells, as was similarly observed in NeoCoV and PDF-2180<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Notably, although L.bor ACE2 failed to support detectable MOW-15-22 RBD binding, its expression and interaction with MOW-15-22 spike proteins induced a considerable amount of membrane fusion in the presence of exogenous trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). We also investigated whether the entry of ACE2-using viruses could be neutralized by interfering with the viral-receptor interaction. We demonstrated that viral entry could be efficiently inhibited by recombinant soluble ACE2 or MOW-15-22 RBD-hFc fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, and S2). Additionally, we evaluated the potency of MERS-CoV RBD-specific nanobodies and pan-β-CoV broadly neutralizing S2 antibodies targeting the stem helix (S2P6) or the S2’ cleavage site/fusion peptide (76E1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g-i</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. However, neither the MERS-CoV RBD-specific nanobodies nor S2P6 cross-reacted with MOW-15-22 or PnNL2018B to show inhibitory activity. This might be attributed to the discrepancy of equivalent sequences from these viruses in the S2P6 epitope compared with that of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). Nevertheless,, 76E1 maintained its potency to neutralize the entry of these viruses due to the conservation of the critical residues in this epitope across these merbecoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Glycan-independent ACE2 recognition by MOW-15-22</title><p id="P10">Previous investigations into the interaction between P.pip ACE2 and NeoCoV/PDF-2180 revealed a unique glycan-dependent ACE2 binding mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Four molecular determinants, designated A to D, located in the binding interface in ACE2 were demonstrated crucial for species-specific ACE2 recognition. Among them, determinants A and C carry glycosylation sites, while determinants B and D are characterized by critical residues capable of forming salt bridges in P.pip ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Probably due to the RBM sequence variation, molecular docking did not provide a convincing interaction model for MOW-15-22 and P.dav ACE2 complex <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">(Fig. S3)</xref>. Nevertheless, sequence analysis of P.dav and P.par ACE2 indicated that P.dav ACE2 shares similar residues with NeoCoV within these determinants, while P.par contains unfavorable residues in determinants B and C for NeoCoV interaction. Therefore, several P.dav and P.par ACE2 mutants carrying theoretically unfavorable residues, as indicated in previous studies based on NeoCoV, were generated to test the involvement of these determinants in MOW-15-22 receptor recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays indicated that these mutants were expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,e</xref>). As expected, introducing unfavorable residues within these determinants impaired NeoCoV RBD binding and pseudovirus entry. However, all these mutants maintained their receptor functionality for MOW-15-22, including P.par-T56I ACE2, which lost glycosylation in both A and C determinants <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">(Fig.4d-e)</xref>. Unfavorable residues in determinant D are crucial in restricting human ACE2 from supporting NeoCoV binding and entry. However, hACE2 carrying the N338D mutation remains incapable of supporting MOW-15-22 or PnNL2018B entry <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">(Fig. S4)</xref>. These results indicate that the ACE2 recognition mode utilized by these European ACE2-using merbecoviruses differs considerably from NeoCoV and PDF-2180, which displayed a glycan-independent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">Coronaviruses exhibit remarkable variations in RBD sequences, resulting in diverse receptor usage modes across different viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

Consequently, it becomes imperative to explore the global prevalence and distribution of ACE2-using merbecoviruses. Through scrutiny into RBM sequences and functional screening of receptor usage based on a mammalian ACE2 library, we identified two European bat coronaviruses, MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B, as novel ACE2-utilizing merbecoviruses, despite prior studies proposing DPP4 usage based on molecular docking. Our findings strongly emphasize the need to verify <italic>in silico</italic> receptor usage predictions through functional binding and entry experiments, especially for coronaviruses with promiscuous receptor usage patterns.</p><p id="P13">In a previous report, we demonstrated that NeoCoV and PDF-2180 employ a glycan-assisted ACE2 interaction mode. However, glycan appears dispensable for ACE2 recognition by MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B. Furthermore, it seems that the two other ACE2 determinants established by NeoCoV and PDF-2180 do not apply to the two European ACE2-using merbecoviruses. These discrepancies suggest a variation in ACE2 interaction mode. Revealing the cryo-EM structure of the viral MOW-15-22 RBD-Bat30 ACE2 complex in future studies could provide critical insights into the receptor recognition details of these viruses.</p><p id="P14">Compared to NeoCoV/PDF-2180, the two European ACE2-using merbecoviruses exhibit a narrow ACE2 recognition spectrum, with only a few bat ACE2 receptors facilitating pseudotyped virus entry or RBD binding. It is likely that both viruses have a strict preference for their hosts’ ACE2 receptors. Unfortunately, we were unable to test the ACE2 or DPP4 orthologues from this host species due to the unavailability of the complete genome sequence of <italic>P. nathusii</italic>. Neither of these viruses could use hACE2 based on their current sequences, and it remains unknown whether these viruses can acquire efficient recognition of hACE2 through point mutations in their RBM, akin to T510F in NeoCoV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.

In-depth research on these viruses is warranted to provide valuable insights into their pathogenicity and transmission abilities. Although we demonstrated that bat ACE2 recombinant proteins or broadly neutralizing antibodies can effectively block the entry of these viruses, future efforts of developing specific antibodies and vaccines are necessary to achieve better protection. Additionally, it is paramount to prepare effective antiviral drugs and vaccines to mitigate the risk of potential outbreaks caused by ACE2-using merbecoviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P18">HEK293T (CRL-3216) and I1-Hybridoma (CRL-2700) cell line was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
