Transplanting functional, healthy intestinal tissue could be a novel therapeutic approach, particularly for chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The colonic mucosa is the main functional layer of the colon and is thus a focus for colonic regeneration therapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Loss of mucosa is a component of the pathological triad of IBD and thus restoring healthy mucosa may aid in breaking the cycle of chronic inflammation and microbial colonisation, to aid healing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). There is also an urgent need for accurate experimental mucosal models to investigate disease mechanisms and identify novel targets for therapy.</p><p id="P7">The colonic mucosa is characterised by epithelial crypts supported by a range of mesenchymal cells including fibroblasts and endothelial cells and a deep band of smooth muscle, called <italic>muscularis mucosae</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These cell populations derive from endoderm and splanchnic mesoderm embryologically and arise in tandem from the developing gut tube. Other cell populations, such as haemopoietic and neural cells migrate in during embryonic life from other germ layers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Since colonic pathologies often involve complex interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal populations (containing multiple cell types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)), any model should contain all these cell types. Investigating disease biology is further complicated as stroma is now known to contain several cell populations, which are precisely localised in the lamina propria (such as the peri-crypt fibroblasts and <italic>SOX6</italic> expressing cells around the stem cell niche(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)). Differing populations may therefore have different relationships with epithelium(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Finally, since cells of the colon form a dynamic ecosystem, pathological change in one mesenchymal population may result in changes to other mesenchymal or epithelial cell populations.</p><p id="P9">The most popular existing intestinal models are <italic>in-vitro</italic> organoids and recent improvements in methodology have increased their utility. However, these models require access to primary tissue (usually surgical resection specimens) and are not able to replicate fully the complex cellular population profile and 3D colonic architecture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Mouse disease models are an alternative with certain advantages; but are expensive, can be difficult to manipulate and, critically, observations in mouse models may not translate to humans.</p><p id="P10">Our aim was to generate human intestinal cell populations from hiPSCs and illustrate their potential to reconstruct normal colonic mucosal tissue <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. For successful <italic>in vivo</italic> engraftment, we reasoned that a transplant should resemble, as much as possible, normal colon in organisation and cell types. We hypothesised that a protocol with reproducible co-differentiation of hiPSCs into various cell populations present in normal colonic mucosa would represent a more developmentally relevant approach, given the importance of inter-lineage cues in shaping differentiated cell phenotypes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). These would then need to be grown on an <italic>in vitro</italic> scaffold allowing assembly into architecturally normal mucosa, and which would be robust enough to allow transplantation. We reasoned that such a cellular construct should respond to known biological cues in colonic mucosa, therefore tested a selection of key growth factors involved in mucosal maintenance and disease.</p><p id="P11">Here, we present a rapid and robust co-differentiation protocol for generating intestinal cells from hiPSCs that can develop into normal colonic mucosa both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and is biologically responsive.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S8"><title>Defining a novel serum-free protocol</title><p id="P12">To replicate the complexity of the mucosa, we aimed to co-differentiate hiPSCs simultaneously to form endoderm and mesoderm. We favoured a co-differentiation approach as this would allow interactions between different cell populations during differentiation, mimicking early developmental events in gut tube and early intestinal development. Many published protocols rely on poorly defined media components which are prone to batch-to-batch variation (such as conditioned media and animal derived serum) or use antibiotics(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). As our aim was to design a protocol that could be suitable for eventual transplantation and for easy adoption in other laboratories for use in <italic>in vitro</italic> models, we reasoned that using serum-containing components would limit application(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Thus, we set out to explore protocol options in which differentiation could be achieved with recombinant or small molecules only. The resulting co-differentiation protocol replaced serum with defined products, reduced recombinant proteins and was conducted in antibiotic-free conditions. We tested this novel protocol against two alternatives that contain the major non-serum components utilised in other widely used published protocols(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Novel protocol leads to co-differentiation of hiPSCs into endoderm and mesoderm</title><p id="P13">By day 4 of the novel protocol (protocol 1), there was up-regulation of endoderm markers <italic>SOX17</italic> and <italic>FOXA2</italic> and the mesoderm marker, <italic>TBXT</italic> (Brachyury) which was not seen in comparative protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). All protocols showed a strong downregulation of pluripotency markers, <italic>POU5F1</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic>.</p><p id="P14">We identified transcriptomic profiles by RNA-Seq at Day 8 in cells cultured under protocol 1 and undertook a comparison with cells cultured using alternative protocol 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>, Table 1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Differentiated cells derived using both protocols showed similar levels of expression of intestinal epithelial markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>, lower left panel), but cells grown under the novel protocol were also strongly enriched for stroma-related genes including <italic>HAND1, LUM, BMP4, ACTA2, SOX6</italic> and <italic>KDR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>, lower right panel)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We further validated cell identity by separating cultures at the end of the novel protocol into enriched “epithelial” and “mesenchymal” groups using magnetic cell separation (MACS) based on EpCAM expression (a marker of epithelium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Expression profiling by mRNA-Seq confirmed intestinal epithelial identity of the EpCAM+ group (compared with the EpCAM-group) including enrichment of general epithelial markers (<italic>SOX17</italic>,<italic>LGR5</italic>,<italic>SHH</italic>,<italic>IHH)</italic> and specific intestinal markers (<italic>CDH17</italic>,<italic>ALPI</italic>,<italic>VIL1</italic>). Compared with the EpCAM+ group, the EpCAM-group showed enrichment for mesenchymal markers including <italic>ACTA2, BMP4, LUM</italic> and <italic>SOX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). There was no difference in pluripotency marker expression between the separated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Moreover, expression was &gt;1000 fold lower in differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated iPSCs.</p><p id="P16">From Day 9 onwards, co-differentiated cells (without MACS separation) were placed on collagen I hydrogels formed in Transwells to create “colonic patches” (CoPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These colonic patches were intended to simulate the organisation of the colonic mucosa, with exposure of the culture surface to culture medium. By Day 22 of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture the epithelial cells in the CoPs lined the surface of the hydrogel and had assembled into crypt-like structures. These cells expressed the intestinal epithelial markers, E-cadherin and CDX-2, together with Villin-1 (which demonstrated notable polarised expression limited to the apical cell membrane). Vimentin-positive mesenchymal cells in CoPs were stratified beneath the surface epithelium and around the crypts. No evidence of residual pluripotent cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry for OCT3/4 and NANOG. Thus, the colonic patches self-assembled into colonic mucosa-like structures with a polarised epithelium supported by an underlying mesenchyme.</p><p id="P17">Finally, our data were replicated and were consistent among four different hiPSC lines (Fig.S1A/B) including being performed independently by collaborators in another academic institution (Fig.S1B), thus demonstrating the robustness and the ease of implementing the protocol. In addition, EpCAM+ cells showed abundant <italic>LGR5</italic> transcripts by RNAscope, and formed proliferating (Ki67+) organoids when encapsulated in Matrigel.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Determining effects of intestinal cytokines on mucosal CoPs</title><p id="P18">Colonic Patches (CoPs), as developed here, contain multiple mesenchymal and epithelial cell populations. We investigated the behaviour of the cell populations by stimulating established CoPs with specific cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A-C</xref>) to determine how well derived cell populations recapitulated known features of intestinal biology. In response to sustained CHIR-99021 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>), epithelial and stromal compartments showed marked proliferation with cell stratification (similar to adenomatous tissue) seen in the epithelium. Treatment with either BMP4 or the Wnt inhibitor, ICG-001, caused a reduction in cell number. ICG-001-treated cultures showed extensive apoptosis demonstrating the requirement of Wnt activity for cell viability in both the epithelium and the stroma. Interestingly, the baseline condition (no exogenous Wnt stimulation) showed sustained viability, suggesting that endogenous stromal Wnt ligands produced in CoPs are capable of meeting epithelial Wnt requirements. When treated with the fibrogenic cytokine TGF-β1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>), the mesenchymal compartment of CoPs took on a well-described myofibroblast molecular profile characterised by expression of genes related to matrix-synthesis and contractile-proteins (<italic>COL1A1</italic><sup>high</sup>/<italic>ACTA2</italic><sup>high</sup>). <italic>TIMP1</italic> was upregulated but there was no change in <italic>MMP1</italic> expression. These changes were all abrogated if the CoPs were treated with A83-01 (a potent inhibitor of TGF-β receptors, ALK4, 5 and 7)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). TGF-β1 stimulation was accompanied by contraction of the CoP, features resembling fibrous scarring seen in IBD, and deposition of extracellular matrix was confirmed with picrosirius red stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). Treatment of CoPs with A83-01 (without TGF-β1 stimulation) prevented remodelling and fibrosis of the CoPs demonstrating intrinsic TGFβ1 activity in CoPs and further supporting CoPs as a model of normal colon.</p><p id="P19">To determine whether stromal cells could be further differentiated to recently described mucosal stromal subsets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), EpCAM-cells were cultured in isolation and stimulated with different growth factor combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C-E</xref>). When a monolayer culture of stromal cells was treated with only TGFβ1 supplemented in the media, cell proliferation was inhibited and we found that cell number and RNA quantity was insufficient for analysis. It was therefore necessary to add mesenchymal mitogen PDGFbb to increase cell numbers for the experimental work. We stimulated cells with TGFβ1 and A83-01 and investigated several genes related to the myofibroblast profile (<italic>MYH11, COL1A1, FN1</italic>) and pericryptal fibroblast profile (<italic>SOX6</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). We showed that on treatment with TGF-β1 (+PDGFbb), stromal cells took on a myofibroblast profile (<italic>COL1A1</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>FN1</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>MYH11</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>WNT2B</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>, <italic>SOX6</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>). Stimulation with A83-01 (in combination with PDGFbb, but without TGF-β1) showed <italic>SOX6</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>WNT2B</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>, <italic>MYH11</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>, <italic>FN1</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>-with no change in <italic>COL1A1</italic>. At the protein level, addition of TGF-β1 suppressed SOX-6 expression while Myosin-11 was only detected under TGF-β1 treatment conditions. These data show that, in the absence of epithelial cells, TGF-β1 appears to inhibit the pericryptal fibroblast profile whilst promoting the myofibroblast profile. More importantly, they show the flexibility and utility of our model.</p><p id="P20">We sought to mimic a population of pericryptal fibroblasts described previously as a characteristic of Hedgehog-responsive stromal cells surrounding the colonic crypt niche in mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) by treating stromal cells with purmorphamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>). We found an increase in <italic>GLI1</italic> and <italic>WNT2B</italic>, while SOX6 was downregulated, and myofibroblast-related genes were unchanged. This was supported at the protein level by a reduction in SOX-6 and increase in GLI1 after purmorphamine treatment. In previous studies, <italic>SOX6</italic> expression has been described as associated with BMP ligand production (i.e. a crypt apex localisation)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The inverse relationship of <italic>GLI1/WNT2B</italic> and <italic>SOX6</italic> expression is thus unsurprising and suggests a similar phenotype to that observed in Gli1+ crypt-base mesenchyme in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms co-differentiation of hiPSCs into multiple epithelial and mesenchymal sub-populations</title><p id="P21">To characterise the cellular populations in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments, sc-RNAseq was performed following cell sorting (EpCAM+ and EpCAM-cells) immediately at the end of the novel protocol on day 8 and following a further 6 days of <italic>in vitro</italic> monoculture of EpCAM-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A/B</xref>). From day 8 to day 14, EpCAM-cells were cultured with or without purmorphamine to study differentiation of the stromal population in more detail. Single-cell expression profiles of cells were compared to publicly available single-cell reference atlases generated as part of the human cell atlas project, using CellTypist (“Developing_Human_Organs”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). This demonstrated a diversity of emerging intestinal epithelial and stromal populations indicative of mesoderm differentiation towards the cell types seen in the mature intestinal stroma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The epithelial cell population was separated into subsets from the main dataset and mapped to the human gut cell atlas (“Cells_Intestinal_Tract”); revealing that epithelial cells mapped predominantly to “distal progenitors” as well as “transit amplifying” cells, supporting colonic identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>). The identity of all populations was further confirmed by demonstrating enrichment of marker genes for intestinal epithelium, endothelium, mesoderm and more mature mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated a posterior homeobox programme (important for specifying the fate of the mesoderm towards an appropriate intestinal mesenchyme), dominated by <italic>HOXA10/11, HOXB9</italic> and <italic>HOXC6-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3F</xref>). Our data showed expression of <italic>CDX2</italic> in both epithelial and mesenchymal populations at day 8, which are consistent with a recent finding that <italic>CDX2</italic>, although ultimately expressed only in mature epithelial tissue, is required for both intestinal endoderm and mesoderm fate specification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3G</xref>). Within later mesenchymal clusters (clusters annotated 3+4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B/G</xref>) subclusters of cells showed enrichment for expression of smooth muscle markers (<italic>MYH11</italic>,<italic>ACTA2</italic>,<italic>CNN1</italic>,<italic>ACTG2</italic>) whilst others demonstrated a phenotype typical of specific mature fibroblast subsets (<italic>CXCL14</italic>,<italic>F3</italic>,<italic>RSPO2</italic>,<italic>NPY</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The Hedgehog pathway is important for directing intestinal stromal lineages, as demonstrated in earlier experiments where stromal cells were stimulated with purmorphamine. We found that Hedgehog ligands were restricted to the epithelial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3G</xref>). To understand further the effects on population profiles, stromal cells were profiled by single-cell RNAseq after treating with purmorphamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3H</xref>). This caused enrichment of <italic>GLI1</italic> and <italic>PTCH1</italic> thereby confirming a Hedgehog response.

CoPs were modified by chemically cross-linking the lower part of the collagen gel (to increase strength for handling) while the upper part was not cross-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). Day 15 CoPs (eight-days of novel protocol and seven days of culture of the mixed cell population on collagen I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4B/C</xref>) were transplanted into the sub-cutis of immunocompromised (<italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-<italic>/</italic> -</sup> <italic>IL2RG</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice and harvested after 2, 3 or 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C/D</xref>). Across all experiments we found viable tissues consistently in around 55% mice indicating high transplant efficiency. This was higher than previously reported engraftment rates of approximately 10% achieved in a similar mouse model using a different protocol, where multiple separately derived primary intestinal cell populations cultured on tissue scaffolds were transplanted subcutaneously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In our transplants, there was progressive increase in tissue organisation and cell maturation and, by four weeks, luminal spaces lined by epithelium with concentric layers of specialised mesenchyme emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D</xref>). The epithelium showed intestinal differentiation including multiple cell types (neuroendocrine, goblet cells, and proliferative cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4E</xref>). Underlying mesenchyme resembled lamina propria and smooth muscle fibres (identified by Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) and desmin expression) formed a boundary beneath this, recapitulating <italic>muscularis mucosae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4F</xref>). The tissues became highly vascularised and, using antibodies specific for human mitochondria, the vascular channels were shown to be lined with human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4G</xref>). The vascular channels contained blood indicating that human blood vessels had undergone anastomosis with murine dermal blood vessels to become functional.</p><p id="P24">One concern with transplantation of iPSC-derived tissues is the possibility of residual pluripotency leading to teratoma development. To confirm earlier molecular assays (Fig.1/S1) that the risk of teratoma had been removed through differentiation, we tested the cell populations in a teratoma assay performed at Day 8. This assay was performed in immunocompromised mice, which would permit any pluripotent cells to form teratomas. When undifferentiated hiPSCs were implanted into the mouse testicular subcapsular space (Fig.S2A), they formed large teratomas with all three germ layers represented. In contrast, when co-differentiated hiPSCs (Fig.S2B) were implanted, the transplants underwent degeneration with fibrosis and dystrophic calcification indicating apoptosis. Occasional intestinal glands were seen. No tumours formed and no other tissue type that may have derived from other germ layers was seen. These experiments indicate that differentiation fate specification is complete and there is no residual teratoma-forming activity following differentiation using the novel protocol. This model is relevant to human transplantation conditions where immunosuppression may be required for successful engraftment of tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Digital Spatial Profiling of transplanted colonic patches reveals maturation and development of gradients of normal biomarker expression along the crypt axis</title><p id="P25">The colonic mucosa is dynamic; epithelial cells migrate from crypt base to crypt apex over 3–5 days(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), differentiating from multipotent stem cells into terminally differentiated cells as they migrate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).

The mesenchyme retained <italic>GLI1</italic> expression, important for maintaining the stem cell niche, while epithelium became enriched for Hedgehog ligand, <italic>IHH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5D/E</xref>).

To use hiPSCs as a cell source for the generation of healthy tissue, differentiation must be precisely controlled so that only the target tissue is produced. Furthermore, since a tissue rarely consists of only one cell type, all cell populations should be present and in the correct spatial location if the tissue is to be functional.</p><p id="P28">Here we have described a simple co-differentiation platform that can generate transplantable colonic grafts from hiPSCs within just 15 days. Unlike many published protocols, the novel protocol is serum- and antibiotic-free, facilitating translation into a clinically useful therapeutic or for use as a reproducible <italic>in vitro</italic> model. It has been replicated in several iPSC lines and in different laboratories illustrating the robustness of the protocol. The novel protocol generates multiple intestinal cell lineages simultaneously; confirmed by single-cell mRNA sequencing as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> engraftment studies. Co-differentiated cell populations do not contain residual pluripotency and they have been grown on biocompatible collagen gels (already in routine use in surgical applications) to create CoPs.</p><p id="P29">Finding cell sources for replacement therapies has largely focussed on derivation from native tissues or stem cell sources from adult tissue. Intestinal stem cells isolated from adult tissue can be cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> as 3D organoids that mimic the function and structure of the original tissue. These 3D stem cell units are self-organising and self-renewable, and usually cultured in Matrigel containing signalling factors important for the maintenance and regulation of the cells within the organoid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Organoid cultures of intestinal stem cells have played an integral role in our understanding of intestinal stem cell biology and its regenerative potential(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and the concept of organoid regenerative medicine has been explored previously in animal models of IBD. Related studies have demonstrated that replacement mucosal cells can integrate into mucosa and aid healing in the disease tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) illustrating the potential of a cellular regenerative medicine therapy to support healing in IBD. To consider organoids as a cell therapy, organoids would have to be fully characterised requiring extensive optimisation, be able to undergo mass expansion in a controlled, time-efficient manner, and their efficacy in human disease would need to be demonstrated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A further issue is that in diseased tissues it may not be possible to isolate healthy cells to then expand in cell culture. iPSC-derived intestinal cell generation offers several advantages over a primary intestinal organoid approach, particularly that protocols can rapidly generate large numbers of cells and multiple cell lineages can be generated simultaneously. Other iPSC studies have demonstrated some degree of co-differentiation but have considerably longer and more complex protocols including the use of serum, which we consider would limit clinical application(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Compared with other published protocols, our method achieves rapid differentiation, with a greater diversity of cell types which form mature intestine. This method is simpler than others published in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and makes use of defined media supplements which have the potential for either direct substitution with a GMP-compliant equivalent or will require minimal effort in refinement towards a GMP-compliant method.</p><p id="P30">To demonstrate maturation potential, xenograft transplantation into immunosuppressed mice is regarded as a gold-standard method for both intestinal organoid and iPSC-derived intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Our subcutaneous model provides comparative data with other hiPSC-derived intestinal cells and primary intestinal organoid methods in which xenografts have been made at extra-intestinal sites including subcutis and renal. While in this study, we did not transplant xenografts into the intestine, the ability of our hiPSC-derived tissues to mature into colonic tissues outside the intestine is additional testament to their committed colonic differentiation without tissue-specific microenvironment cues. Transplanted CoPs into the <italic>subcutis</italic> of mice showed development of colonic mucosa complete with human-derived <italic>muscularis mucosae</italic> and human-derived blood vessels that successfully anastomosed to murine blood vessels. Compared with previous iPSC approaches(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), we saw similar levels of colonic maturation including ability to form smooth muscle bundles and anastomose with host vasculature, but with a shorter timeframe to transplantation from starting intestinal differentiation to transplantation (15 days vs. 37 days). We were able to be grow and mature our multi-lineage cells on the surface of hydrogel scaffolds to form CoPs, which we consider is likely to be more amenable to colonic transplantation in future. This scaffold model is similar to that developed by Meran et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), where the authors were able to successfully transplant <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded primary intestine-derived jejunal tissue (rather than colon) into the subcutis of mice. We consider several advantages of an iPSC approach in comparison as (i) iPSC-derived cells could be grown on a relatively simple hydrogel platform and (ii) give rise to multiple populations of cells in a single protocol, compared with harvesting multiple cell populations. Our hiPSC-derived stromal populations replicate the full complexity of the intestinal stroma, as demonstrated by scRNA-seq studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Thus, it follows that this may mediate appropriate epithelial crypt organisation, through Wnt and BMP signals, as well as releasing pro-angiogenic signals to promote vascularisation. This is exemplified by increased expression of PDGFRA over several weeks of transplantation, correlated to gradual acquisition of PDGFRA+ cells, which are known to drive intestinal epithelial differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Finally, we anticipate the use of hiPSCs using our novel differentiation protocol offers greater opportunity for scale-up manufacture of these cell populations, unlocking the cell supply chain to produce tissue grafts for engraftment to the bowel to support healing.</p><p id="P31">We believe that CoPs represent a significant modelling development as they are the closest to normal colonic mucosa of any current <italic>in vitro</italic> model. The fact that our model responded in the expected way to stimulation with a variety of cytokines demonstrates validity of the model, such as in investigating progression of intestinal fibrosis development from normal mucosa and to test novel therapeutics to inhibit or even reverse fibrosis. Furthermore, hiPSC-derived CoPs grow on the surface of hydrogel scaffolds, giving rise to application for barrier / absorption studies. Another advantage of our model lies in the heterogeneity and responsiveness of stromal populations which would allow the study of specific diseases. For example, the SOX6+ population (also known in published literature as stromal 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)) identified in our model is considered important in maintaining signalling pathways in normal intestinal crypts. Depletion of this population has been demonstrated in IBD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We showed that stimulation with cytokines active in IBD reduced numbers of SOX6+ cells and consequently reduced <italic>SOX6</italic> mRNA, indicating the potential of this model system for the study of IBD.</p><p id="P32">In summary, we have developed a simple colonic co-differentiation platform that derives multi-lineage cell populations from hiPSCs which can then be used to form transplantable colonic patches (CoPs) in 15 days. This represents a significant step in the development of a cell supply chain for regenerative cell transplants to treat colonic disease. CoPs also offer great potential for use as an accurate, dynamic and biologically responsive <italic>in vitro</italic> model for investigation of intestinal pathobiology.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Ethical review</title><p id="P33">Animal experiments were conducted under the overview of the University of Nottingham Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and authorised by UK Home Office Project Licence numbers PPL P435A9CF8 and PP5089113.</p><p id="P34">hiPSC lines were approved and derived under University of Nottingham ethics committee number 09/H0408/74 with appropriate consent.

The IDs of Taqman Gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) used in this study are EpCAM (Hs00901885_m1), Cdx-2 (Hs01078080_m1), Sox17 (Hs00751752_s1), Nanog (Hs02387400_g1), Klf5 (Hs00156145_m1), Wnt2b (Hs00921614_m1), BMP4 (Hs00370078_m1), GAPDH (HS99999905-m1).</p><p id="P53">CT values for individual primers were compared with reference to a housekeeping gene using Livak’s 2<sup>-ΔCT</sup> method or 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method if an appropriate reference condition was available for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Flow cytometry (EpCAM)</title><p id="P54">Cells were washed once with PBS and detached with brief TrypLE treatment. Following aspiration of the TrypLE, cells were resuspended in warm RPMI-1640 and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 300 xg for 5 minutes and then washed once with PBS, followed by further centrifugation. Reactions were performed in Eppendorf tubes and each step was followed by centrifugation at 300 xg for 5 minutes unless otherwise specified. Primary Anti-EpCAM APC conjugated antibody with isotype control was used for all experiments (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, United Kingdom). Cells were blocked in 3% (<italic>w/v</italic>) BSA in PBS for 15 minutes, followed by washing and addition of primary antibody diluted in 3% (<italic>w/v</italic>) BSA in PBS, with incubation for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Cells were analysed using either an FC500 or MoFlo (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) flow cytometer, with all procedures kindly optimised by the staff of the School of Life Sciences Flow Cytometry Facility, University of Nottingham (Dr David Onion and Mrs Nicola Croxall).</p><p id="P55">Data were analysed using the Kaluza Analysis software package (Beckman Coulter). Gating parameters on forward/side scatter were used consistently across all samples, and non-singlet cells were excluded from fluorescent intensity analyses to avoid overestimation. Negative and isotype controls were performed, which determined the threshold fluorescent intensity values for positive staining.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Bulk mRNA sequencing</title><p id="P56">Cells lysates were prepared directly from plates and RNA was extracted as described earlier. After quantification by Nanodrop, samples were frozen and stored at -80 °C. Samples were diluted in nuclease-free water to obtain 2 μg total RNA in 20 μL sample volume. All samples were sent on dry ice via overnight courier to Novogene Limited for sample QC and subsequent library preparation and sequencing. Results were returned in raw FastQC format, BAM alignment files and raw and normalised count matrices for bioinformatic analysis. Subsequent analysis was performed using open-source SeqMonk and R software. Briefly, normalised gene matrices were generated using SeqMonk and initial hierarchical clustering was performed using dual approach based on intensity difference (based on log-transform) and DESeq2 packages (raw counts) to compare gene expression differences across multiple datasets. For comparison between two conditions, R was used to run DESeq2 on raw gene count matrices followed by Volcano plots based on log10 adjusted p-value and log2 fold change for individual genes. All DESeq2 analyses were performed with default parameters including correction for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Single-cell mRNA sequencing</title><p id="P57">Cells were dissociated as described earlier, but with a prolonged dissociation time of 8 minutes to ensure a fully dissociated single cell population. Cells were resuspended in dPBS with 1% (<italic>w/v</italic>) BSA to prevent intercellular adhesion. Cells were counted within the cell culture facility, using an automated counter, and resuspended at 1 million cells mL<sup>−1</sup>. A second count was performed within the DeepSeq facility as described below.</p><p id="P58">Single cell 3’ whole transcriptome sequencing libraries were prepared from dissociated cell suspensions using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1, the Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit and the Dual Index Kit TT Set A (10X Genomics; PN-1000147, PN-1000127 and PN-1000215). Cell counts and viability estimates were obtained using the LUNA-II Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems), Trypan Blue Stain, 0.4 % <italic>(w/v)</italic> and Luna Cell Counting Slides (Logos Biosystems; T13001 and L12001). Live cell counts were used to calculate cell input, rather than total cell count, as visual inspection of cell field on the LUNA II and the gating histogram, showed that &gt; 90% of cells were viable and that the cell counter appeared to be counting some extracellular debris as non-viable cells. The number of input cells targeted was 3,300 cells per sample, with the aim of generating sequencing libraries from ∼ 2,000 single cells. All steps, including GEM Generation and Barcoding, Post GEM-RT Cleanup and cDNA Amplification and Library Construction were performed according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1 User Guide, Rev B (CG000315).</p><p id="P59">Variable steps of this protocol included using 12 cycles of cDNA amplification and 8-12 cycles of library amplification. Amplified cDNA was quantified using the Qubit Fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific; Q32854) and fragment length profiles were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation and Agilent High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape Assay (Agilent; 5067-5592 and 5067-5593). Completed sequencing libraries were quantified using the Qubit Fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and fragment length distributions assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation and the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay (Agilent; 5067-5584, 5067-5585).</p><p id="P60">Libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and the final library pool was quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platforms (Roche; KK4824). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 over two NextSeq 500 High Output v2.5 150 cycle kits (Illumina; 20024907) to generate &gt; 25,000 raw reads per cell for each sample, using custom sequencing run parameters described in the 10X protocol. Following sequencing, raw outputs from the sequencer were converted to FastQC files, aligned to the reference genome (hg38) and outputted to raw and filtered count matrices using the CellRanger (v6.1.1) pipeline from 10X genomics.</p><p id="P61">Individual analysis was performed using jupyter-lab tools on Ubuntu Linux using the following packages: Scanpy (1.8.2), anndata (0.7.8), UMAP (0.5.1), NumPy (1.20.3), SciPy (1.7.3), Pandas (1.5.2), scikit (1.1.3), statsmodels (0.12.2), igraph (0.10.8), PyNNDescent (0.5.5), scvelo, cellrank, MatPlotLib, Scrublet and CellTypist (1.6.2). Briefly, samples were imported and merged. Predicted doublets were removed using Scrublet using a threshold of 0.25. Basic filtering for gene detection included presence in at least 5 cells and all cells with a minimum of 200 and maximum of 7000 genes. Genes with greater than 20% mitochondrial reads were filtered out. Cells were normalised and log-transformed and highly variable genes were then identified. Normalised expression levels next underwent principal component analysis (PCA), nearest-neighbour analysis (neighbours=15 and PCs = 10, optimised using the PCA elbow plot) and uniform mapping and approximation projection (UMAP), followed by clustering using the leiden algorithm (resolution=0.3).</p><p id="P62">Next clusters were annotated using unbiased CellTypist automated labelling. The “Developing_Human_Organs.pkl” model was selected as it is based on cells representing similar differentiation stages. Annotations were made over leiden clusters using the majority-voting method. Feature plots, dot plots and matrix plots (heatmaps) were generated using scanpy functions. The epithelial leiden cluster was extracted from the main anndata object and assessed using the “Cells_Intestinal_Tract.pkl” model within CellTypist.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>In vivo assays</title><p id="P63">BVA/FRAME/RSPCA/UFAW Refining Procedures for the Administration of Substances Working Group report, the NCRI Guidelines on Experimental Neoplasia, and NC3Rs Guidance for <italic>in vivo</italic> techniques were followed, as were the ARRIVE reporting guidelines. A total of 6 female and 12 male CD-1 NuNu mice at 6–7 weeks old were purchased from Charles River, (Margate, UK), and 6 female and 12 male Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> IL2RG<sup>-/-</sup> immunodeficient mice at 6-7 weeks old were purchased from Envigo, (Hillcrest), UK. Both strains were tested in order to identify if the different immune statuses of the strains had any effects on the resulting tissues.</p><p id="P64">It was essential to use only males for the testicular teratoma study, while equal numbers of males and females were used for the subcutaneous engraftment study. Numbers used per condition group were between 3-4. This was because the object of the studies was tissue generation and growth for analysis, rather than achieving statistical significance. The mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages (Tecniplast UK, Northampton, UK) within a barriered unit, illuminated by fluorescent lights set to provide a 12 h light–dark cycle (on 07.00, off 19.00), as recommended in the guidelines from the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (UK). The room was air-conditioned by a system designed to maintain an air temperature range of 21 ± 2 °C and a humidity of 55% ± 10%. During the study, the mice were housed in social groups, three per cage, with irradiated bedding and autoclaved nesting materials and environmental enrichment (Datesand UK, Stockport, UK). A sterile, irradiated 5V5R rodent diet (IPS Ltd., London, UK) and irradiated water (SLS, UK) were offered ad libitum. The animals’ conditions were monitored throughout the study by an experienced animal technician. After a week’s acclimatisation, the mice were initiated with cells or scaffold as detailed. At the scientific end point of the studies, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation and testes or scaffolds were removed under sterile conditions.</p><p id="P65">Animals were anaesthetised using a Ketamine (Ketaset, Animalcare, York, UK)/Medetomadine (Sedastart, Animalcare, York, UK) cocktail (Ketamine: 75mg kg<sup>-1</sup> / Medetomadine: 1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) injected subcutaneously and reversed using Atipamezole (Sedastop, Animalcare, York, UK) at 1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> <italic>s.c</italic>‥</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>In vivo teratoma assay</title><p id="P66">Undifferentiated iPSCs and cells differentiated according to the novel protocol and comparator protocol were dissociated and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 xg for 5 minutes. For initial experiments, either one million or two million cells were implanted to optimise conditions. Either CD1 nude or Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> IL2RG<sup>-/-</sup> immunosuppressed mouse models were used for optimisation. In final conditions, one million cells were implanted into Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> IL2RG<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Cell pellets were transported on ice to the Biosupport Unit (BSU), University of Nottingham as well as thawed Matrigel ® on ice. Immediately prior to implantation, 50 μL of Matrigel was added to the cell pellet and cells were resuspended within the matrix.</p><p id="P67">This cell suspension was then injected into the testicular subcapsular space. Mice were monitored by BSU staff throughout the period for weight and signs of ill health. Seven weeks after implantation, the mice were sacrificed and a post-mortem examination of the testicular space and abdominal cavity was undertaken. Any tumour tissue or evidence of cell growth was excised. All tissues were photographed and then placed in formalin in preparation for further histological examination.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>In vivo subcutaneous engraftment of populated collagen scaffolds</title><p id="P68">Tissue scaffolds were prepared from collagen following an optimised protocol in which 250 μL collagen (2mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) from rat’s tail was neutralised to form a hydrogel within a Transwell ® mould. After gelation, collagen gels were chemically crosslinked using a protocol adapted from Kim et al. (168). After extensive washing, a further 250 μL of neutralised collagen (2mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) was added to the surface of the crosslinked collagen and allowed to gel. Next, 500,000 iPSC-derived intestinal cells at day 8 were passaged to the surface of the gel in the presence of CHIR (5μM), Noggin (100ng mL<sup>−1</sup>), ROCKi (10μM), IGF-1 (100ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) and FGF2 (50ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with B27 and N2 supplements. The following day, medium was replaced with basal medium with additional IGF-1, FGF-2 and Rspo-1 (50ng mL<sup>−1</sup>). Medium was replaced again on day 4 and then on day 6 (one day before implantation). This culture medium contained IGF1 (200ng mL<sup>−1</sup>), FGF-2, Rspo-1 and Wnt-3a (50ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) to enhance to proliferation of intestinal epithelial stem cells.</p><p id="P69">On the day of transplantation, tissue grafts were carefully lifted out of the Transwell and placed in medium with the same constituents as well as ROCKi (10μM) to improve cell viability during engraftment. Tissues were engrafted by making a small incision into the flank of Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> IL2RG<sup>-/-</sup> immunosuppressed mice within a sterile hood. The tissue graft was inserted into the pouch formed by incision, and the incision was closed with a surgical clip. After two, three or four weeks, mice were sacrificed and the surgical site opened. Tissue from the site was removed and photographed, and fixed in formalin prior to histological examination.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>NanoString GeoMx DSP RNA profiling</title><p id="P70">Slides for NanoString analysis were prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Multiple tissues were combined on a single slide to allow simultaneous analysis. NanoString data was collected from two separate slides consisting of representative tissues collected from different <italic>in vivo</italic> transplantation timepoints (slide1) and a reference normal adult human colon. Each NanoString slide consisted of two to six different pieces of tissue.</p><p id="P71">Slides were stained with pan-cytokeratin (NanoString) and DAPI stains and then hybridised with Cancer Transcriptome Atlas probes. The slides were kept hydrated at all times. The slides were then loaded onto the NanoString GeoMx data spatial profiling (DSP) instrument. Areas of illumination (AOI) were selected based on areas of relevant morphology, such as apical and basal crypt regions. Automated segmentation was also performed based on cytokeratin expression. Each AOI was selected to contain at least 100 predicted cells (nuclei) based on DAPI staining. Having selected the AOIs for each slide, automated harvesting was performed on the DSP machine and probes were collected in 96 well plates each with well-specific barcodes. Library preparation was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions and the pre-made libraries were sequenced by NovoGene Limited using Illumina NovoSeq 6000 using a PE-150 sequencing strategy on a single flow-cell lane. After sequencing, fastq files were loaded into the DSP instrument for pairing with AOIs.</p><p id="P72">To process the NanoString data, we utilised the SpatialDecon package. Prior to deconvolution, we generated cell type expression profiles from the integrated foetal gut cell atlas object, considering cells with more than 10 genes and cell types with more than 5 cells. Background counts were determined using negative probes, and the SpatialDecon algorithm was applied to estimate cell type abundances for each AOI.</p><p id="P73">Subsequently, we employed the SpatialOmicsOverlay package to visualise the data on the image data. Initially, we made necessary modifications to package functions to resolve compatibility issues. We then imported the image and annotation data along with counts into the SpatialOverlay object. AOIs were grouped based on gene expression profiles using hierarchical clustering to identify similarities, resulting in four main clusters. Then, the cell types were assigned to each AOI based on the highest cell type abundance. Since each main slide consisted of 2 to 6 different sub slides, AOIs from each main slide were annotated according to their location, such as top-right or bottom-left. To focus on individual sub slides, the SpatialOverlay object was cropped accordingly, and marker expression levels were visualised by plotting them onto the AOIs.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Basic histology</title><p id="P74">Slides were dewaxed and rehydrated by sequential immersion in xylene, methanol and distilled water.
