Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation is relatively less studied. We found <italic>hTERT</italic> was transcriptionally altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types (fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in <italic>hTERT</italic>, respectively. Mechanistically, we show <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter activity from an exogenously inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> reporter. Increase in TL over days followed by gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of <italic>hTERT</italic> in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation. Notably on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was evident along with telomere elongation and <italic>hTERT</italic> upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in iPSCs, <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with marked reduction in <italic>hTERT</italic> further supporting the causal role of TL in <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. Mechanisms of tight control of <italic>hTERT</italic> by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing and pluripotency.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Teaser</title><p id="P3">Telomere length controls <italic>hTERT</italic> expression by modulating TRF2 distribution and PRC2-mediated repression, highlighting a self-regulatory mechanism in cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures comprising guanine-rich DNA sequences at the end of linear chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The catalytic subunit of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, <underline>h</underline>uman <underline>te</underline>lomerase <underline>r</underline>everse <underline>t</underline>ranscriptase (hTERT) is necessary for replicating telomeric repeats to maintain telomeres(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Most cancer cells, in contrast to normal adult somatic cells, maintain telomeres through reactivation of <italic>hTERT</italic> (~90% of cancers); alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is used in other cases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). <italic>hTERT</italic> therefore is tightly regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional and translational levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The role of <italic>hTERT</italic> in the synthesis and maintenance of telomeres has been extensively studied(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Relatively recent work suggests how telomeres, on the other hand, might affect <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation. Physical looping of telomeres reported as the <underline>T</underline>elomeric <underline>P</underline>osition <underline>E</underline>ffect-<underline>o</underline>ver-<underline>l</underline>ong-<underline>d</underline>istance (TPE-OLD) was shown to extend up to 10 Mb of telomeres (sub-telomeric). The resulting telomeric heterochromatinization gave TL-dependent repression of sub-telomeric genes. The <italic>hTERT</italic> loci(~1.2 Mb away from telomeres) was shown to be repressed through (TPE-OLD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); loss of looping in short telomeres induced <italic>hTERT</italic>. Notably, another conceptually distinct mechanism of TL-dependent gene regulation was reported which influenced genes spread throughout the genome: expression of genes distal from telomeres (for instance 60 Mb from the nearest telomere) was altered in a TL-dependent way, but without physical telomere looping interactions. First, non-telomeric binding of TRF2 was found to be extensive (&gt;20,000 sites), spread across the genome including promoters, and affected the epigenetic regulation of genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).Second, the shortening or elongation of telomeres led to the release or sequestration of telomeric TRF2, respectively,thereby increasing or decreasing the availability of TRF2 at non-telomeric promoters and affecting gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The telomeric sequestration-dependent partitioning of telomeric versus non-telomeric TRF2 was proposed as the <underline>T</underline>elomere-<underline>S</underline>equestration-<underline>P</underline>artitioning (TSP) model, linking global gene regulation to telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Further, we found promoter-bound TRF2, not associated with telomeres (or non-telomeric), repressed <italic>hTERT</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Based on these, here we tested the hypothesis non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter was TL-dependent. If so, this would molecularly link telomeres to <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation.</p><p id="P6">Findings show TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter increased with telomere shortening and downregulated <italic>hTERT</italic>. Conversely, reduced promoter TRF2 on telomere elongation upregulated <italic>hTERT</italic>; consistent with TSP described above. This was clear in multiple cell types engineered for either telomere elongation or shortening. An artificially inserted <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter (&gt;40 Mb from telomere) showed TRF2-dependent and telomere-sensitive regulation, confirming the mechanism to be independent of physical telomere looping. For a temporal model, we elongated telomeres using doxycycline (dox) inducible cells and stopped elongation after a desired time. TRF2 binding at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter decreased as telomeres elongated over several days, and increased again with telomere shortening when dox treatment was stopped. Together, these show a heretofore unknown mechanism of telomere-dependent regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic>, the sole enzyme necessary for synthesizing telomeres, revealing a cellular feedback machinery connecting telomeres and <italic>hTERT</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Telomere elongation upregulates <italic>hTERT</italic> through non-telomeric TRF2</title><p id="P7">To test if telomere length (TL) of cells affected TRF2 occupancy at the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter, we first elongated telomeres in cancer cells under isogenic backgrounds (termed as <underline>S</underline>hort <underline>T</underline>elomere, ST or <underline>L</underline>ong <underline>T</underline>elomere, LT cells hereon). We used HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080-ST) or the TL-elongated version HT1080-LT (with constitutive expression of <italic>hTERT</italic> and the RNA component <italic>hTERC</italic>; previously characterized by others and us, see Methods)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).

Here, we asked if TRF2-dependent <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation was TL-sensitive. With TL elongation, the H3K27me3 mark was significantly reduced in HT1080-LT relative to the ST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). As expected from reduced promoter H3K27 trimethylation, <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription was enhanced by &gt;3 folds in HT1080-LT relative to ST cells; 3’UTR-specific primers were used to distinguish from exogenously expressed <italic>hTERT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To rule out any effect of exogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> (HT1080-LT cells above) we sought to elongate telomeres in an <italic>hTERT</italic>-independent way. Using a reported method, telomeres were elongated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with guanine-rich telomeric repeat (GTR) oligonucleotides (characterized by others and us, see Methods; termed MDA-MB-231-ST/LT; TL difference quantified using FACS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>, and qPCR based method, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1A</xref>, and telomerase activity in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).

Briefly, 25μL of supernatant of the reaction mix was pipetted, added to the anti-H3K27me3 antibody-coated strip wells with 25 μL of antibody buffer (provided with kit ab115072) and incubated at room temperature for 2h; the wells were covered properly by Parafilm M to prevent evaporation. Post incubation, the wells were washed thrice with kit-provided wash buffer. Diluted detection antibody (as directed by kit) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1h at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. Next, the wells were washed thrice after aspirating the antibody solution. The suggested amount of Color Developer solution was added to the wells and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2-10 minutes. The colour development (blue) was monitored across the wells of sample and standard solution. Once the color in the standard well containing a higher concentration developed a medium blue colour, 50 μL of Stop Solution was added to all wells to stop the enzymatic reaction. Upon stopping the reaction, a yellow colour develops and the absorbance reading at 450nm was noted within 15minutes on a microplate reader. Fold change in trimethylation over reference condition is determined by the following formula:</p><p id="P87">Fold change of Tri-methylation = (Treated (tested) sample OD – blank OD) / (Untreated (control) sample OD – blank OD)</p><p id="P88">Blank in case of experiment was the reaction mix without PRC2 complex and TRF2 protein forms.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p id="P89">Western blot analysis for checking the integrity of the purified bead-bound protein was also carried out. An equal volume of bead (5μL) was loaded for both TRF2-WT and TRF2-R17H on a 10% SDS- PAGE and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Biorad). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and then probed suitably with primary antibodies- anti-TRF2 antibody (Novus Biological), and anti-FLAG antibody (Merck). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibodies from CST respectively were used. Blots were developed using BioRad ClarityMax HRP chemiluminescence detection kit and images acquired on the LAS500 GE ChemiDoc system.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Gaussia-luciferase assay</title><p id="P90">Secreted Gaussia luciferase signal in the CRISPR-modified short telomere and control cells (WT, -124G&gt;A and -146G&gt;A -ST/LT) was quantified using Promega Gaussia luciferase kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
