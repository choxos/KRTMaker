The cortical representation of spatial information has been extensively studied and was found to range from combinations of muscle synergies to cognitive maps of locations in space. How such abstract representations of target space evolve during a behavior, how they integrate with other behavioral features and what role they play in movement control is less clear. Here we addressed these questions by recording the activity of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in the motor cortex using two-photon calcium imaging in head-restrained mice, while they reached for water droplets presented at different spatial locations around their snout. Our results reveal that a majority (&gt;80%) of L2/3 neurons with task-related activity are target-space selective and their activity is contingent on a single target position in an ego-centric reference frame. This spatial framework is preferentially organized along three cardinal directions (Center, Left and Right). Surprisingly, the coding of target space is not limited to the activity during movement planning or execution, but is also predominant during preceding and subsequent phases of the task, and even persists beyond water consumption. More importantly, target specificity is independent of the movement kinematics and is immediately updated when the target is moved to a new position. Our findings suggest that, rather than descending motor commands, the ensemble of L2/3 neurons in the motor cortex conjointly encode internal (behavioral) and external (spatial) aspects of the task, playing a role in higher-order representations related to estimation processes of the ongoing actions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Manipulating objects in our surroundings is an integral part of our everyday life and is key to survival. Rodents, much like primates, rely on their hands to manipulate and eat food and deploy motor programs specially adapted to each type of food <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Coordination and execution of such complex behaviors occur at multiple levels of the neuraxis, with the motor cortex playing a central role <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, microstimulation, inactivation, anatomical and physiological experiments suggest that the medial part of the anterior motor cortex (Medial Anterior Cortex, MAC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>) is involved in controlling reach-to-grasp movements in the mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is convergent evidence across different species that the cerebral cortex is functionally organized into distributed action maps that orchestrate ethologically relevant behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Although the exact mechanisms by which the motor cortex controls movement are still debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, it is generally accepted that cortical output is generated in layer 5b as the result of local dynamics and inputs from other cortical areas and the thalamus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. While recent studies have started to elucidate the role of thalamocortical inputs in motor preparation, movement timing and activity pattern generation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the origin and nature of additional external inputs is less clear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Most motor control theories emphasize that the optimal generation of motor commands is achieved through the continuous integration of feedback signals to guide movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The brain uses sensory information, such as proprioception and vision, to estimate the current state of the body and environment, which, combined with the current motor goal, helps in computing the best motor commands to achieve a successful movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests that such state estimation mechanisms might take place in the parietal cortex and the cerebellar circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, whether and how these mechanisms influence motor cortex activity is not clear. From a cytoarchitectonic point of view, layer 2/3 neurons are optimally connected to fulfill this role, since they receive multimodal inputs from other cortical areas and they are hierarchically connected to layer 5b neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To investigate a possible role of layer 2/3 motor cortex neurons in state estimation mechanisms, we decided to utilize a behavioral paradigm for head-fixed mice, inspired in the center-out reaching task of primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In this task, water-deprived mice perform directional reaching movements to retrieve a water drop from a waterspout that entered and exited the peripersonal space of the mouse at different locations in front of their snout. The dynamics of this paradigm created opportunities for specific motor actions depending on the current state of the animal and its spatial relation to the object, thereby providing complex and naturalistic real-world-like interactions. By performing simultaneous two-photon imaging recordings, we found that layer 2/3 neurons of the MAC are simultaneously dictated by the location of the waterspout and by the ongoing action of the animal. This joint representation of space and behavior is expressed across all phases of the task and reflects a general role of continuous integration of internal and external feedback, compatible with state estimation mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reaching maps in layer 2/3 of the MAC</title><p id="P5">Neurons in the primate motor cortex are widely recognized for the encoding of kinematic parameters of movement. This is particularly evident in the center-out reaching task, where population coding of arm directionality has been thought to be one of its defining characteristics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It is only recently, however, that studies have begun to investigate how directional arm movements are encoded in the rodent cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Through anatomical, optogenetic and microstimulation experiments, the MAC has been pinpointed as the principal cortical region related to the control of reaching in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we aimed to determine the tuning properties of reach-related neurons within this region by performing two-photon microscopy imaging of layer 2/3 neurons while head-fixed mice reached for drops of water presented at 3 different locations around their snout (Left, Center and Right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1ab</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We first focused our analysis on reach-related neurons, as defined by responding within a 500 ms time window before reach onset and up until the first touch of the waterspout. Reach-related neurons were readily observed across layer 2/3 of the MAC with an average response time of −53±18.9s (mean ± S.D.) from reach onset. Over half of the reach-related neurons (57.4%) responded before movement initiation and the rest responded during the reaching movement.</p><p id="P7">As previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, a striking feature of neurons in MAC is their pronounced trial type modulation, with a discernible lateralization bias towards the right and individual neurons distinctly active depending on whether the mouse reached to the left, center, or right. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 2</xref>). This type of activity is reminiscent of directional neurons in the primate motor cortex. However, reach-related neurons in the mouse appeared to display an ‘all or nothing’ response pattern, rather than the cosine tuning pattern observed in primates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, the majority of the neurons (81.3±2.0%) were selectively active when the animal reached towards only one of the three target locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This response pattern raised the possibility that reach-related activity could be associated with reaching target locations, rather than the movement direction of the arm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To address this question, we analyzed the activity of the same neurons while the animal initiated reaching from two different origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). This manipulation forced the animals to execute different arm trajectories to reach the same endpoint, thereby decoupling both factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Contrary to our expectation, the neuronal activity remained unaffected by this manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref>) suggesting that these neurons are dictated by the endpoint but not by the starting point or the trajectory of reaching. Importantly, the activity of these neurons was specific to which arm performed the task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 3</xref>), underscoring that reach-related neuronal activity in the MAC is actually linked to the execution of hand movements. Furthermore, these results highlight that a prominent feature encoded by layer 2/3 neurons is the location of the reaching target and suggest that the MAC encodes an egocentric reaching endpoint map instead of a movement kinematics map.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Properties of cortical reaching maps</title><p id="P9">To more precisely quantify the spatial representation of the reaching space, we increased the number of target locations from three to seven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Consistent with our initial findings, reach-related neurons exhibited a strong preference for specific target locations, as evidenced by a high target selectivity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-d</xref>). Interestingly, the finer mapping of the reaching space revealed that reach-related neurons possess small response fields of an average width of 4.42 ± 2.02 mm on the mediolateral axis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 4</xref>). As a consequence of a smaller spacing between target locations, in the seven-target variant of the task, the majority of the neurons responded to up to 3 contiguous reaching locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P10">At the population level, the distribution of response fields did not form a continuous map of the reaching target space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Instead, the spatial selectivity of cortical neurons gave rise to three distinct clusters, each of which showed a preference for target locations around the left, center, or right of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 5</xref>). This indicates a compartmentalized spatial representation, demarcated by relatively sharp boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,g</xref>). Notably, these boundaries were observed at the level of some individual neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 4</xref>), which responded robustly within their preferred area of the reaching space but exhibited no response for the immediate neighboring locations. Interestingly, the division of the reaching space into three cardinal directions is biased towards the Center, Outer-Left and Outer-Right positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>), and does not appear to be the result of training. Recordings from naïve animals performing the three-target reaching task for the first time revealed the same spatial compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 5</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest a potential innate role for MAC neurons as spatial location classifiers.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Encoding of task events beyond reaching</title><p id="P11">The majority of studies of motor control typically focus on a range of behavioral phases strictly related to movement, such as instruction, preparation and execution. However, neurons in motor and premotor cortices have been implicated in higher order phenomena that extend beyond movement, such as reward processing, behavioral outcome or memory traces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Whether neurons in the MAC encode these kinds of signals and how spatial information is integrated with them, is less clear. To answer these questions, we took advantage of the multiple phases of the water reaching task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 1</xref>) and investigated the neuronal activity of the MAC beyond reaching.</p><p id="P12">We identified a substantial number of neurons (57.2% of all task-related neurons) that were active during different phases of the task, from the start to the end of the trial and during the inter-trial interval. Besides reach-related neurons, the second largest proportion of neurons responded at trial start and during the delay period, followed by neurons active during water consumption, and finally, by neurons active during the inter-trial period. Purely touch-related neurons were also observed, but in many occasions their activity extended to neighboring phases. Indeed, many neurons, including the reach-related ones, displayed persistent activity and were active during more than one phase of the task, with a few extreme cases where the activity spanned from waterspout presentation to waterspout retraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P13">When we analyzed the spatial tuning properties of all task-related neurons, we found that they, too, were modulated by the location of the reaching target. Surprisingly, this modulation was as pronounced as that of reach-related neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 7</xref>), suggesting that task-related neurons may collectively form functional sets determined by the location of the reaching target. Indeed, this tuning was so prominent that it was already visible at the level of spontaneous activity of task-related neurons and in the pairwise cross-correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The onset and offset boundaries of single neurons’ activity were generally sharp and determined by specific external events (e.g. target presentation and retraction), or mouse’s actions (e.g. drink beginning and ending) in conjunction with the reaching target location. Therefore, neurons with the same spatial tuning revealed a sequential and continuous representation of all the phases of the task as a chain of events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3c,d</xref>). We confirmed this finding by applying a dimensionality reduction technique of the full dataset (principal component analysis, PCA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 8</xref>), where we observed that the neural state space trajectories diverged upon waterspout presentation and remained separated across all the phases of the task beyond target retraction. These trajectories followed near-orthogonal paths, each determined by the location of the reaching target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3e,f</xref>). Importantly, PCA of neurons that were classified as non-task-related, revealed that they did not carry significant information related to the task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 8</xref>), suggesting that the organizing principle of cortical activity during the execution of this task is the location of the reaching target.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Dynamic representation of task events</title><p id="P15">The data so far suggest that task progression in the MAC is represented by a sequence of task-related neurons whose activity is conjointly determined by the phase of the task and the location of the reaching target. If this was the case, sudden changes in the waterspout position should produce predictable changes in cortical activity. To test this, we designed a variant of the three-target reaching task where, immediately after reach onset, the waterspout was unexpectedly relocated (“jumped”) from one target location (“Source”) to another (“Destination”). Mice readily performed this variant of the task executing hand movement corrections towards the new position of the waterspout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The leftmost panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref> shows the activity of four example neurons that were sequentially active at different phases of control trials with the waterspout on the Left. The first two neurons were active during the “start” and “reach” phases, while the remaining two, were active during the “drink” and “end” phases of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> “no jump” trials). The middle panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref> shows the activity of the same neurons during trials in which the waterspout jumped from the Left (source) towards the Right (destination) locations. As expected, the activity of the “start” and “reach” neurons (Cell #1 and #2) was not affected during these trials, because the waterspout was in their preferred location. Just after reach onset, the waterspout jumped to the Right location leading to the silencing of the “drink” and “end” neurons (Cell # 3 and #4). Finally, in the complementary jump trials (source on the Right and destination on the Left) the effect was reversed, meaning that the “start” neuron was not reactivated, but the “reach”, “drink” and “end” neurons were recruited once the waterspout was in their preferred location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, rightmost panel).</p><p id="P17">To determine the effects of this manipulation at the population level, we transformed the recorded activity to its PCs and compared the neural state trajectories of control and jump trials. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>), Left and Right control trials occupied near orthogonal regions of the neural state space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). On the other hand, jump trials initially followed trajectories similar to the control trajectories of the matching source target location, but upon waterspout jump, they diverted towards the neural state space corresponding to the destination target location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d-h</xref>). Therefore, according to our prediction, the activity of MAC neurons was updated in real time to match the current location of the waterspout and the ongoing phase of the task. It is noteworthy that in addition to this, we observed the presence of neurons that were not active during control trials but were recruited exclusively during specific combinations of Source-Destination jump trials, pointing, as well, to a possible role in predictive processing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 9</xref> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>)</p><p id="P18">Finally, we observed that the distance between neuronal trajectories of congruent trials (Source-Source distances, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>) consistently decreased after reach onset, throughout water drinking and during the intertrial period, suggesting a reduced neural state variability. This reduction in variability may be due to the accumulation of direct proprioceptive and tactile feedback information, leading to an increased level of certainty at the neuronal level. Taken together, our data indicate that the main role of L2/3 neurons in the MAC is to represent the ongoing behavioral state of the mouse in conjunction with the location of the reaching target suggestive of a higher-order function in behavioral control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Contrary to the traditional belief that the motor cortex encodes kinematic parameters, such as movement directionality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, our data in mice provides a somewhat different picture. We demonstrate that during the water reaching task the principal determinant of neuronal activity within layer 2/3 of the MAC is, in fact, the spatial location of the target. This spatial influence unexpectedly extends well beyond the execution of target-oriented movements, encompassing all the phases of the task, even the intertrial period when the target has been retracted. Thus, more than movement features, the MAC exhibits an overarching encoding capacity, continuously representing the ongoing behavior of the mouse in relation to the most recent location of the reaching target.</p><p id="P20">Interestingly, the neuronal tuning patterns and spatial coding in the MAC bear stronger similarities to the activity in the PMd than that of the primary motor cortex of primates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This resemblance takes on added significance considering that experimentally induced activation of the PMd and the MAC trigger reaching-like movements of the arm in both monkeys and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Given that reach-to-grasp movements in rodents are considered innate and evolutionarily conserved, it is expected that the neural principles governing this behavior are shared across species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, the converging evidence points to a possible degree of functional homology between the PMd of primates and the MAC of rodents.</p><p id="P21">In addition, optogenetic inactivation of the MAC, but not the primary motor cortex, impairs directional reaching in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, supporting a potential direct role in the control of movements. At first glance, layer 2/3 neurons of the MAC could contribute to this function. For instance, target-related and reach-related neurons could encode movement goals towards the reaching target during the preparatory and executions phases of the task. However, this interpretation does not account for neurons active during drinking and intertrial periods, whose activity is equally tuned to the reaching target location. A way of reconciling these findings could be that layer 2/3 neurons perform a variety of independent functions, such as motor preparation, outcome processing and working memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Alternatively, we propose a more cohesive interpretation in which layer 2/3 neurons in motor areas perform a unified function where their activity is combinatorially determined by behaviorally relevant dimensions. In the case of the water reaching task, these dimensions include the position of the reaching target, the behavioral phase and the effector executing the task. Therefore, the population of layer 2/3 neurons in the MAC integrate real-time internal (somatosensory and motor) with external (spatial) information providing a cellular basis for high order representations of the animal’s actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In principle, this representational interpretation might seem at odds with the current views of cortical functioning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, most models of cortical motor control emphasize the importance of feedback in guiding behavior. By continuously integrating sensory and motor feedback, the brain estimates the current state of the body within the environment, thereby enabling real-time adjustments to achieve the desired outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,420,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While state estimation for reaching movements has been proposed to take place in the cerebellum and parietal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, the motor and premotor cortices are believed to use these signals to refine ongoing motor commands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In our experiments, the temporally low-pass filtered responses of GCaMP6s imaging limit our ability to investigate state estimation during rapid arm movements. Nevertheless, the conspicuous signals observed in layer 2/3 of the MAC highlight the possibility of an overarching state estimation mechanism operating at the task’s timescale. Such estimations would provide layer 5b, the output of the MAC, with contextual information regarding the state of the world (e.g. “the target is located on the left”) and of the animal (e.g. “mouse is drinking with the left hand”), critical for establishing upcoming actions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore the activity of layer 2/3 could indirectly influence the generation of motor commands by conditioning the cortical activity in layer 5b to produce the appropriate output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> before reaching motor centers in the midbrain and spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Finally, we suggest that a corollary function for these high-order representations could be to provide the animal with a cognitive map allowing for conscious perception of the executed actions, supporting a general role of layer 2/3 in cognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><p id="P24">All experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Geneva and by the “Direction générale de la santé” of the Canton of Geneva.

A balanced anesthesia regimen was administered for pain and inflammation management before, during and after surgical procedures. Prior to general anesthesia, mice received a subcutaneous [s.c] dose of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine. Twenty to forty minutes later, general anesthesia was induced with gaseous isoflurane (5% for 1 to 2 minutes). After nociceptive reflex responses (toe and tail pinch) disappeared, the mouse was secured onto a custom-made stereotaxic frame equipped with an anesthesia mask (isoflurane maintenance at 1.5%) and received analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (2.5 mg/kg intramuscular dexamethasone, and 5 μL s.c. of 1% lidocaine under the scalp) to reduce brain swelling and pain. The mouse’s body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a heating plate. To prevent corneal damage the eyelids were closed with petroleum jelly. Five minutes after lidocaine injection, the scalp was cleaned (ethanol 70%), disinfected (chlorhexidine 0.5%) and excised. The exposed periosteum was removed using sterile cotton swabs and corneal scissors. Fiduciary marks on the skull were made at the level of bregma and the midline to provide reliable reference points for future imaging experiments. The marks were performed by making small incisions with a scalpel and permanently staining them with a waterproof marker. An oval shape craniotomy of approximately 2.3 by 4.2 mm was delineated around the medial anterior cortex (MAC) region of the secondary motor cortex of the left hemisphere to image the activity of reach-related cortical circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The surface of the skull was gently scraped to increase adherence and covered with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (ergo 5011 or Loctite 401). The skull around the craniotomy area was thinned with a dentist drill equipped with a cylindrical bur. During this procedure, the skull was bathed with sterile saline at room temperature to soften the bone, reduce bleeding and prevent excessive heating of the brain. Once the skull was thinned down to approximately 100 μm, the craniotomy was performed using a scalpel. The cortical surface was rinsed with sterile saline and bone debris were removed before replacing the excised bone with a glass cranial window. The cranial window, matching the shape of the craniotomy, was made out of two hand-cut coverslips (150 μm thick) using a diamond scribe (Fiber Instruments, FO90C) and stacked together with UV glue (Norland 61). The cranial window was gently positioned on top of the brain and secured against the bone with cyanoacrylate glue. A custom made titanium head-bar was positioned on top of the interparietal bone and all the implants were covered with clear acrylic resin (Ortho-Jet resin powder and liquid, Lang). At the end of the surgery and for the 2 to 5 following postoperative days, mice received a daily dose of 5 mg/kg carprofen s.c. for prolonged analgesic and antiinflammatory effects. Mice were typically housed in groups of 2 to 4 and left to recover from surgery for at least 5 days before behavioral manipulations.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Behavior: naturalistic water reaching task</title><p id="P26">Mice performed a directional water reaching task adapted from a previously described task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Briefly, after recovering from surgery, mice were water deprived and entered the handling period. Daily handling was performed following published recommendations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and consisted of gradual habituation to the experimental area and head-fixation setup. The head-fixation setup consisted of a 3D printed mouse enclosure and a pair of custom-machined steel headbar clamps. The clamps were held at an angle of 8° in the sagittal plane and elevated 40 mm from ground level allowing the mice to remain in a standing position during head-fixed behavior. The 3D printed enclosure was designed to minimize animals’ discomfort, promote natural body postures and allow for a controlled manipulation of the behavioral output. Habituation to head-fixation was achieved progressively by increasing head-fixation duration at a rate of ∼5 minutes per day, while simultaneously providing the mice with tap water (up to 1 ml) to counteract head-fixation discomfort. During this period, mice were encouraged to grab a resting bar located close to the body midline with their right hand while a 3D printed paw blocker limited the use of their left hand. During this period, water was manually provided through a syringe coupled to a blunt needle, which the mice licked from. Unless stated otherwise, mice were typically induced to reach and grasp water droplets by placing the needle away from their mouth.</p><p id="P27">After the habituation period (5-7 days), mice started the automatized water reaching task in the dark. In this task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 1</xref>), inspired by the primate center-out reaching task, head-fixed mice performed directional reaching movements from a starting point (“Origin”) towards a reaching target located around their snout. The reaching origin was determined by the resting bar position and the reaching target location by a mobile waterspout which provided water droplets. At the beginning of each trial, the waterspout was at a distant “home” location (5 cm away from the snout aligned within the midline of the animal) and moved rapidly (25 mm/s) to the “target” location. Target locations were pseudo-randomly selected from a predetermined set of coordinates within the horizontal plane ∼5 mm below the tip of the snout. In order to trigger the droplet presentation, mice were required to continuously touch the resting bar for a delay period of 1 or 2 seconds. Releasing the resting bar before that period, reset the timer. If the mice didn’t touch the resting bar within a window of 6-10 seconds, the trial ended. In the dark, mice detect the presence of the waterspout and water droplet using chemosensory cues and typically reach for, grasp, retrieve, and drink the water within 2 seconds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, the waterspout was left in the target position for 2-4 seconds after the initial touch before the trial ended. However, if mice failed to touch the waterspout within 4-8 seconds after droplet presentation, the droplet was suctioned away and the trial ended. At the end of each trial, the waterspout returned to the home position and a new trial began. Therefore, in addition to reaching, the water reaching involves multiple well defined phases determined by specific task events with which the animal interacts with: target presentation followed by a delay period (Start), movement response (Reach), water consumption (Drink onset and offset) and target retraction followed by an intertrial period (End).</p><p id="P28">We would like to highlight that, in contrast to the majority of primate reaching tasks where movements are typically performed through a manipulandum or towards virtual reaching targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, the water reaching task is naturalistic, providing greater affordances as it allows head-fixed mice to interact with a graspable physical object that enters and exits their peripersonal space mimicking the dynamics of real-world experiences. The animal’s output is a cohesive reach-to-grasp-to-mouth sequence of movements. These aspects add an ethological value to the task, which, except for the head fixation, resembles the types of movements and interactions that the mice would likely encounter in their natural environment. Therefore, the neuronal correlates of the task probably reflect innate neuronal circuits for behavioral control.</p><p id="P29">To probe for different coding aspects of cortical neuron activity, we introduced a series of variants to the standard task: (1) Alternative reaching origins, (2) Arm switch, (3) Seven-target reaching, and (4) Waterspout jump.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Alternative Reaching Origins</title><p id="P30">To determine whether cortical neurons encoded kinematic aspects of reaching movements, we analyzed the neuron activity during trials in which reaching movements were initiated from two alternative origins. This manipulation was achieved by displacing the resting bar using a linear stage (T-LSM100A, Zaber Technologies). The standard origin of reaching was typically aligned to the midline of the animal (Origin A) and the alternative origin (B) was 8 to 10 mm away in the mediolateral axis. During a given session, several blocks of 10-30 trials from each origin were probed to compare the activity of the same neurons under both experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Arm Switch</title><p id="P31">All mice used for two-photon imaging underwent cranial window surgery on their left hemisphere. In the standard task, mice were trained to use their right hand for reaching. This was achieved by placing a paw blocker in front of the left hand. To determine if neuronal activity was tuned to the hand executing the reaching movements, mice were also trained to reach using their left hand by switching the paw blocker’s position. Achieving comparable performance levels with Left-Hand reaching typically required 3 to 5 training sessions. During “arm switching” sessions, mice performed at least two alternate blocks of Left-Hand and Right-Hand reaching, with each block typically consisting of 30-50 trials.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Seven-target reaching</title><p id="P32">After training in the three-target reaching task, mice were introduced to a seven-target reaching task in order to investigate the fine-scale spatial tuning properties of cortical neurons. While the original targets in the standard task (Left, Center and Right) were spaced by 4.2 mm, the expanded version added four novel target locations (Outer-Left, Inner-Left, Inner-Right, and Outer-Right), thereby reducing the average target spacing to approximately 2.13 mm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 4</xref>). Most mice adapted to this task variant did not require any specific training. However, because Outer-Left and Outer-Right locations were at the edge of the maximal reaching space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, some mice did not perform as well to these target locations.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Waterspout Jump</title><p id="P33">To investigate how changes in the reaching space are processed by cortical neurons, we introduced a variant to the standard three-target reaching task. In this variant, the waterspout’s location was unpredictably altered during an ongoing trial. For control trials (“no-jump”), the waterspout’s behavior was the same as those of the standard task. Conversely, in “jump” trials, the waterspout arrived in a specified location (“Source”) and, shortly after reach onset, it was relocated (“jumped”) to one of the other two target locations (“Destination”; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 9</xref>). The waterspout relocation event occurred in two-thirds of the trials chosen at random. In order to investigate all 9 possible Source-Destination combinations for the three-target reaching task, mice had to perform between 120 and 200 trials. It is important to note that this variant of the task was performed spontaneously by the mice without any specific training and mice were allowed to perform multiple attempts before water drop retrieval.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Behavioral control system</title><p id="P34">The behavioral task was controlled using a real-time linux state machine through a MATLAB interphase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brodylabwiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol">https://brodylabwiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol</ext-link>). The real-time system controlled various actuators such as solenoid valves (LHDA1231215H, The Lee Company), linear stages (T-LSM100B and T-LSM100A, Zaber Technologies) and LEDs. It also recorded touches of the resting bar and waterspout through transistor based sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. A custom made double lumen waterspout was made using a pair of nested 18G and 20G needles for water droplet delivery and suction. High speed usb cameras (MQ013RG-ON, Ximea) equipped with 5 mm lenses (Navitar) were used to video record the movements of the arm. 320 by 300 pixels images were acquired at 200 fps using Streampix 7.0 (Norpix) and arm trajectories were offline reconstructed using DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Experiments were performed in the dark under infrared (IR) illumination (IR-LED ELJ-810-629, Roithner and IR-LED arraysM120, Kemo Electronic).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Two-Photon, widefield fluorescence and image processing</title><p id="P35">Two-Photon imaging of layer 2/3 neurons was performed using a custom built two-photon microscope (MIMMS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openwiki.janelia.org/wiki/display/public/Home">https://openwiki.janelia.org/wiki/display/public/Home</ext-link>) controlled by Scanimage 5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vidriotechnologies.com/">https://vidriotechnologies.com/</ext-link>). A 16x 0.8 NA objective (Nikon) with a pulsed laser excitation wavelength at 920 or 940 nm (Ultra II, tunable Ti:Sapphire laser, Coherent) and a resonant scanner system (Thorlabs) were used to image GCaMP6s fluorescence changes within fields of view (FOVs) ranging from 450 to 650 μm per side and captured at 29.38 frames per second on averge. Laser power was modulated by a pockel cell (350-80-LA-02, Conoptics) to a maximum power of 40 mW at the end of the objective. 512 by 512 pixel images were continuously acquired using a gated photomultiplier tube (H11706P-40 SEL, Hamamatsu) and digitally written in 16 bit format to disk in separate files triggered by the behavioral system using TTL pulses. For statistical purposes, imaging sessions typically lasted between 60 to 160 consecutive trials depending on the behavioral manipulations and up to 4 different FOVs were imaged during the same behavioral session. Except for the “naïve” mice experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 5e</xref>), two-photon imaging recording sessions started after mice were pre-trained to proficiently perform the water reaching task. A path for a CCD camera with the center of the field of view aligned to that of the two-photon microscope was integrated into the microscope setup. The CCD camera path was illuminated with green LED to obtain well contrasted reference images of the cortical blood vessel map across sessions and the fiduciary marks performed on the skull during surgery. CCD camera images were obtained using custom MATLAB code to precisely identify the location of bregma and the imaging coordinates. The imaging plane of the microscope was oriented parallel to the cranial window for each animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. The imaging FOVs were located within the MAC region (∼1.5 mm anterior to bregma, ∼1.25 mm lateral to the midline) at different depths (ranging from 150 to 300 μm below the cortical surface). Images were processed with adapted scripts from the CaImAn toolbox for MATLAB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Automatically detected regions of interest (ROIs) and extracted GCaMP fluorescence traces were curated and post processed with custom written MATLAB scripts. CaImAn parameters were empirically determined by iterations of extraction and visual curation of ROIs and calcium traces.</p><p id="P36">To obtain anatomo-functional reference maps, the cortical sensory representations of the right forelimb and hindlimb were mapped through widefield fluorescence imaging (Camk2a-GCaMP6s mice) and somatic vibratory stimulation. After the mice had fully recovered from the cranial window surgery, they were anesthetized with isoflurane and received a vibrotactile stimulation (1s at 100 Hz for 20 to 40 repetitions) on the forelimb or hindlimb while imaging fluorescence changes through the cranial window at 10 fps (256 by 332 pixel resolution, 12-bit Retiga EX camera, QImaging). The surface of the cranial window was illuminated with a blue LED light (470 nm, ROITNER) and the optic path was arranged with a set of FITC excitation and emission filters (NIKON). Stimulation and image acquisition were controlled with Ephus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Images were processed with custom MATLAB scripts by subtracting the baseline fluorescence of the pre-stimulation period (1 s average) to all the frames of each trial. Baseline-subtracted images were then averaged across trials and the peak fluorescence response within 1 s after the end of the stimulation was used to delineate primary somatosensory regions of the cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Calcium Data Analysis</title><sec id="S19"><title>Task-related neurons</title><p id="P37">To determine the presence of task-related neurons, we denoised the calcium traces with two consecutive moving average window filters (9-datapoint median followed by a 3-datapoint mean). We then screened the neuronal activity and performed perievent calcium traces (PECTs) by aligning the extracted fluorescence signal (ΔF/F) to a series of observable task events (“triggers”): waterspout presentation, drop delivery, reach onset, waterspout touch (first touch after drop delivery), drink onset, drink offset, and waterspout retraction. The timing of these task events was obtained from the behavioral control system or extracted from video analysis using DeepLabCut. We compared the normalized fluorescence of the extracted ROIs using a paired t-test based on the time-averaged fluorescence intensity from a window of 1 s before and after each triggering event. An ROI was identified as related to a specific phase of the water-reaching task if it displayed a significant response. This response was determined by a p-value below 0.01, an amplitude &gt; 4%, an onset of calcium events within 300 to 1000 ms around the task event, and an increase in the ΔF/F slope before and after the event. Neurons were classified as reach-related only if their onset took place before the waterspout touch, thereby ruling out any touch-related influence. Using this method, we classified task-related neurons into the categories: start, reach, touch, drink, and end.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Spatial tuning, Selectivity Index and Clustering</title><p id="P38">To assess spatial tuning, task-related neurons were categorized based on the number of targets eliciting a significant response. Neurons were then grouped according to the number of targets eliciting response, with categories ranging from 1 to 3 or 1 to 7 depending on the number of reaching target locations. Inspired by the orientation selectivity index, we also computed an unbiased measurement of spatial tuning called the target selectivity index (TSI). The TSI quantifies the degree of response selectivity for each neuron using the formula: TSI = 1-(mean(non-preferred response)/preferred response), where ‘preferred’ refers to the highest response amplitude and ‘non-preferred’ includes all the others. A TSI of 1 implies that the neuron responded maximally to only one target location and had no response to all the others. Conversely, a TSI of 0 indicates equal response amplitude across all target locations. Similarly, to assess neuronal tuning based on different starting points of reaching movements, we devised an origin selectivity index.</p><p id="P39">To further describe the tuning patterns of task-related neurons, we applied clustering analyses, focusing on both the neuronal spontaneous activity and the response amplitude patterns. For the analysis of spontaneous activity, we generated a pairwise cross-correlation matrix from the neurons’ activity throughout the behavioral session. Hierarchical clustering was employed using the farthest distance method, with clusters delineated using the median distance as a cutoff.</p><p id="P40">Next, we established the response amplitude pattern of individual neurons by assessing the response amplitude elicited by each reaching target location. These amplitude profiles were standardized via z-score normalization, setting the stage for k-means clustering. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method (optimal number of clusters 3, not shown). To visually represent the clustered data, we transformed the full set of response patterns to its principal components (PCA) and plotted them in a three-dimensional space, utilizing the first three principal components. Each data point in this 3D projection was color-coded based on its k-means cluster designation and tuning bias. Finally, to ensure an unbiased determination of the optimal number of clusters, we implemented a bootstrap resampling strategy with 1000 resamples. Each resampled dataset underwent k-means clustering, examining a potential cluster range from 2 to 10. We next computed the Silhouette score for each bootstrap, and determined the highest Silhouette score as the optimal number of clusters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. These values were used to establish a 95% confidence interval for the optimal number of clusters.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Trial alignment</title><p id="P41">Owing to behavioral variability, task events and durations of behavioral phases are inherently inconsistent, making straightforward alignment of full-length trials unfeasible. To simultaneously visualize neurons responsive to different task events, we employed a pseudo-alignment technique on the PECTs. For each neuron tuned to a particular event, we generated a corresponding PECT aligned to that event. We then determined the trial-averaged timings of the events that occurred before and after the primary event. Using the averaged task event times, we aligned traces across neurons. This technique allows the visualization of each neuron’s activity relative to its most closely tuned event, while preserving the temporal relationship between simultaneously recorded neurons. For quantitative comparisons of population activity across trials, sessions and mice, we implemented a time-stretching methodology. Each trial was segmented into discrete time series based on relevant task events: target presentation, water drop delivery, reach onset, waterspout touch, target retraction and next trial start. Subsequent to this division, each segment was linearly interpolated to adjust its length to match the standardized average duration of the associated behavioral phases across the whole population. This approach ensured trial uniformity in length across sessions and conditions, enabling inter-trial and across subjects comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Dimensionality reduction</title><p id="P42">For a comprehensive visualization and comparison of population activity, we employed the Principal Component Analysis (PCA; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary figure 8</xref>). The full dataset of calcium traces from each session was transformed into its principal components. Before this transformation, fluorescence time series were denoised with a Gaussian filter, using a time window of 15-datapoints. After transforming the data, trials underwent time-stretching and were visualized in a three-dimensional space, to reveal the neural state trajectories throughout different task phases and behavioral conditions. To compare neural state trajectories across different sessions, we employed the Procrustes method to align and re-orient the first 15 PCs of the PCA results. Angles between trajectories of different conditions (i.e. target location) were calculated using the dot product of the normalized scores of the first 15 PCs.</p><p id="P43">To compare non-task related neurons and determine whether they convey significant information, the PC transformation was initially performed on the full data set of control trials and the dataset of non-task related neurons was further projected into the same space for comparison. Similarly, in the waterspout jump experiments, the PC transformation was initially performed on the control trials alone (i.e. “no-jump” trials) and the “jump” trials were projected into that space.</p><p id="P44">To determine the temporal evolution of neural state trajectories and compare them across conditions, we calculated the Euclidean distance between pairs of conditions using bootstrapped average trajectories derived from the first 9 PCs. This method illustrated the temporal evolution of the distance between different conditions (e.g., Right trials vs. Left trials or control trials vs. jump trials) as well as, through resampling, established the within-condition distances (e.g., Right trials vs. Right trials).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Video analysis</title><p id="P45">Video recordings were processed using a DeepLabCut model trained on thousands of images to reliably reconstruct reaching trajectories, determine the drinking probability and the position of the resting bar and the waterspout across mice and sessions. The right hand of the mice was reconstructed using five “body parts”, with one marker for the wrist and one for each digit. Body parts extracted with a confidence value below 0.6 were excluded. Gaps in the data, resulting from missing body parts and spanning up to 10 consecutive data points, were interpolated using the ‘pchip’ method. Each body part was denoised with two consecutive filters: a 3-datapoint median filter followed by a 3-datapoint Gaussian filter. To represent the hand’s trajectories during reaching, the positions of all body parts associated with the hand were averaged in both X and Y dimensions. Velocity profiles for both the hand and the waterspout (expressed in pixel units) were determined using the gradient of their X and Y positions. The magnitude of the velocity was obtained by computing the sum of squared velocities in the X and Y directions. This velocity data was subsequently denoised using a 20-datapoint moving median filter. The velocity of the waterspout was used to determine the start (target presentation) and the end (target retraction) of each trial. The stereotyped velocity profile of reaching movements was used to align reaching trajectories across trials before computing average trajectories. The angle of reaching trajectories (θ) was determined by fitting a linear regression to the initial part of the reaching movement, from the onset to the peak velocity. The angle was computed against the vertical axis, where positive angles denote a rightward movement deviation. The drinking probability was extracted from the kinematic signature of the reconstructed body parts. The factors used were the orientation of the hand, the opening of the fingers, the vertical distance to the resting bar and the velocity of the hand.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistics and data analysis</title><p id="P46">No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size and all experimental animals were included in the analysis.
