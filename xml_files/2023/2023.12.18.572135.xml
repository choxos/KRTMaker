In this respect, microdroplet technologies have already revolutionised the field of biotechnologies, but remain ill-suited to the culture of adherent cells. In this report, we describe the engineering of albumins with cell adhesive peptides for the stabilisation of microdroplets enabling the scale up of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) expansion. We characterise the modified albumins prior to study their self-assembly at liquid-liquid interfaces via interfacial shear rheology, and mechanical strengthening through the formation of crosslinked nanosheets. The biofunctionalisation of these protein nanosheets is then characterised by fluorescence microscopy. In turn, the ability of the resulting bioactive microdroplets to promote rapid cell adhesion and expansion is examined and the extensive deposition of matrix associated with such cultures is characterised. The culture of MSCs is then scaled up 100 fold, first at the surface of fluorinated oil emulsions, then on plant-based emulsions stabilised by engineered protein nanosheets and the phenotype of resulting cells is characterised. The microdroplet culture system presented displays attractive advantages over existing technologies, in terms of simplicity of processing, compatibility with regulatory expectations and costs of production, and offers exciting opportunities for translation to cell manufacturing, for cell therapies and cultivated meat applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Albumin</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cell</kwd><kwd>interfacial rheology</kwd><kwd>microdroplet</kwd><kwd>bioprocessing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In the last three decades, progress in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine has enabled the demonstration of a range of different cell therapies enabling to tackle a wide range of diseases and conditions, from wound healing and bone reconstruction to cardiac repair, ocular regeneration and lung repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Similarly, cell-based therapies have been proposed to correct deficiencies in the production of factors and hormones, such as Factor VIII and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], or the production of exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Although these studies have demonstrated promising performance in small and sometimes large animals, their translation to the clinic has been slow, owing to a range of different factors, including poor translation to a human context and human biology, poor cell retention and viability, an immune response, the difficulty to deliver cells using scaffolds approved by regulators and the manufacturing of sufficient cell densities for implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Indeed, although cell densities of 1-5 million per animal are often sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in mouse or rat models, translation to larger animals and patients would typically require the implantation of several hundred million cells. The scale up of cell manufacturing therefore remains an important hurdle to address to enable the translation of cell therapies to the clinic. Similarly, the scale up of biotherapeutics production, whether defined factors or exosomes, will require novel platforms to reduce costs and limit the potential for contamination of products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. These requirements are also shared by emerging applications of cell-based technologies, such as cultivated meat production, which remains prohibitively costly and difficult to scale up to the potential consumer demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P3">A number of key challenges remain in order to address pitfalls associated with current cell manufacturing. Although some mammalian cell lines can be engineered or selected for culture in suspension, many cell lines studied at the laboratory scale and proposed for translation (apart from CAR-T cells and pancreatic islet cells, for example) are adherent and require solid substrates or hydrogels to enable adhesion and spreading, as well as expansion and the retention of cell phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The gold standards in this area consist in cultivating adherent cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells or fibroblasts, on solid microcarriers (typically polystyrene modified with cell adhesive peptides), which can be scaled up in stirred tank bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, recovery of the resulting cell products and separation from microcarriers in mild conditions is difficult to scale up and limits translation. In addition, microcarrier solutions remain expensive (estimated between 40 and 80 % of the total cost of cell culture reagents; based on the cost of Synthemax microcarriers for the culture of a range of different adherent cell types) and lead to contamination of cell products and biotherapeutics with microplastics.</p><p id="P4">Recently, liquid substrates, in the form of oil microdroplets, were proposed to replace solid microcarriers. This has enabled the culture and retention of phenotype of a broad range of cell types, from fibroblasts, keratinocytes and HEK293 cells, to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells and neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Underpinning these technologies, it was demonstrated that protein nanosheets self-assembling at corresponding liquid-liquid interfaces and presenting strong interfacial mechanical properties enabled the adhesion, spreading and proliferation of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. In order to support cell adhesion and expansion at the surface of oil microdroplets, protein nanosheets were proposed to require a combination of tensioactive (stabilising droplets), scaffolding (strengthening interfacial mechanics to resist cell adhesion) and bioactive properties (engaging with cell membrane receptors such as integrins to sustain cell adhesion). The resulting bioactive emulsions, or bioemulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], have been shown to enable the retention of stem cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], even over prolonged periods of time corresponding to multiple passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], to support the secretion of biotherapeutics including exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], and to enable the formation of biomimetic niches for haematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. However, most of these systems relied on fluorinated oils that do not enable direct implantation, and likely will require separation from final cell products. In addition, the proteins used required co-surfactants such as pentafluorobenzoyl chloride or perfluorooctanoyl chloride, which should be replaced or avoided prior to translation. The extra-cellular matrix protein fibronectin, enabling integrin-mediated cell adhesion, was showed to enable direct nanosheet formation without additional of additional co-surfactant or crosslinker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], likely due to its ability to fibrillate at some hydrophobic interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], but is poorly tensioactive. On the other end, β-lactoglobulin, a protein excellent at stabilising emulsions and displaying inherent scaffolding properties, required biofunctionalisation with cell adhesive peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In this report, we engineer bovine serum albumin (BSA) with functional groups enabling the coupling of cell adhesive peptides via radical thiol-ene coupling and Michael addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The resulting proteins are then used to stabilised oil microdroplets and further crosslinked to confer scaffolding properties, in a scalable format. We investigate the interfacial shear mechanical properties of corresponding interfaces during these processes and characterise the stability of associated emulsions. We then compare the ability of these different proteins to promote the adhesion and expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs at the surface of microdroplets, first in the context of fluorinated oil, then plant-based (rapeseed oil) interfaces. We further demonstrate the scale up of cell culture on these bioemulsions, in conical flask bioreactors, to scales relevant to pre-clinical studies (100 fold). Finally, we characterise the retention of stem cell marker expression upon culture on corresponding bioemulsions and demonstrate the simple recovery of cells from these culture systems via a range of strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Synthesis of functionalized BSA</title><p id="P6">NB-BSA was obtained using the following protocol. 10 g of BSA (15 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 100 mL of carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) buffer at pH 9.

The Du Nouy ring has a diamond-shaped cross section that improves positioning at the interface between two liquids to measure interfacial rheological properties while minimizing viscous drag from upper and sub-phases. The ring has a radius of 10 mm and is made of a platinum−iridium wire of 400 μm thickness. The Derlin trough was filled with 4 mL of fluorinated oil (Novec 7500, ACOTA). Using axial force monitoring, the ring was positioned at the surface of the fluorinated oil and was then lowered by a further 200 μm to position the medial plane of the ring at the fluorinated phase interface. 4 mL of the PBS solution was then gently introduced to fully cover the fluorinated sub-phase. Time sweeps were performed at a frequency of 0.1 Hz and temperature of 25 °C, with a displacement of 1.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup> rad (strain of 1%) to follow the self-assembly of the proteins at corresponding interfaces. 15 min after the beginning of the time sweep, the protein solution (100 mg/mL in PBS) was added in the aqueous phase to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.

To introduce reactive moieties, acrylate, methacrylate and norbornene residues were coupled to bovine serum albumin, using corresponding anhydrides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This coupling step was carried out in carbonate buffers typically used for the functionalisation of amines with succinimidyl esters and anhydrides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Following purification via dialysis, the resulting functionalised proteins were characterised via <sup>1</sup>H NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of the integration of the peaks in the olefin range (norbornene protons at δ: 6.0–6.3 ppm; acrylate protons at δ: 5.8–6.5; methacrylate protons at δ: 6.1–5.7 ppm), allowed the quantification of functionalisation levels, through comparison with aromatic protons of BSA near δ 7.5 ppm. Hence, we determined that 24 norbornyl, 71 acrylate and 28 methacrylate residues functionalised the corresponding NB-, AC- and MA-BSA proteins. These functionalisation levels were considered to be sufficient to enable effective bioconjugation of multiple peptides per protein.</p><p id="P27">The impact of functionalisation on the structure of the resulting proteins was next assessed, as the globular conformation of albumins is considered essential to their tensioactive and self-assembly properties at hydrophobic interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Indeed, BSA is composed of multiple α-helices bundled together and forming a hydrophobic pocket enabling the binding of various apolar compounds, for example to modulate their transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], and underpinning assembly at hydrophobic surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Evaluation of protein structures through circular dichroism (CD) indicated the retention of highly α-helical architectures upon functionalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, NB-BSA, AC-BSA and MA-BSA molecules displayed CD spectra presenting a characteristic positive peak at 196 nm and two negative peaks at 209 nm and 222 nm, comparable to those observed for pristine BSA and matching literature reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Only a moderate shift in the position of the 196 nm peak, and therefore loss of some of the α-helicity of the corresponding proteins, was observed. This retention in overall globular conformation is an excellent indicator that functionalisation levels should not interfere with self-assembly properties and the ability of corresponding albumins to stabilise emulsions. A globular architecture and striking changes in secondary structure were indeed associated with assembly at liquid-liquid interfaces, including hydrophobic and fluorophilic oil interfaces, and the stabilisation of associated emulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].</p><p id="P28">The assembly of functionalised proteins at the surface of the fluorinated oil Novec 7500 was next examined, using interfacial rheology. This oil, often used in microdroplet microfluidic technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], was selected as displaying high cytocompatibility, high density and low viscosity. It was found to support the adhesion and expansion of a broad range of cell types, after functionalisation with protein nanosheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Upon assembly at Novec 7500/PBS interfaces, the interfacial shear storage modulus (iG’) of corresponding interfaces increased significantly and rapidly in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was followed by the establishment of a plateau that persisted even following washing of the excess free protein from the aqueous phase. However, we noted an overall reduction in iG’ for interfaces stabilised by MA- and AC-BSA, compared to pristine BSA and NB-BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is perhaps reflecting the more significant reduction in the negative peaks seen in the CD spectra of the two former proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), implying a more prominent loss of α-helicity.</p><p id="P29">As the interfacial shear moduli, elasticity and toughness of protein nanosheets was found to play a critical role in regulating cell adhesion and expansion at liquid-liquid interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], we investigated whether further crosslinking of the engineered proteins assembled could enhance corresponding interfacial mechanics. To do so, we used the heterobisfunctional crosslinker sulfo-SMCC, which was previously found to mediate the effective crosslinking of β-lactoglobulin at liquid interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Interfacial rheology was used to monitor changes in interfacial shear moduli during crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To avoid protein aggregation in solution, we first washed the aqueous phase with PBS, prior to introduction of sulfo-SMCC. This led to a rapid increase in interfacial shear storage modulus for all three engineered proteins as well as pristine BSA, to 59-73 mN/m. Evaluation of different concentrations of sulfo-SMCC established that effective crosslinking was observed systematically above a concentration of 1 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Examination of the frequency sweeps corresponding to the crosslinked and non-crosslinked interfaces further confirmed the striking increase in interfacial shear storage moduli in sulfo-SMCC treated assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). In addition, whereas pristine BSA, and in particular engineered BSAs, displayed clear signs of failure at higher frequencies, all crosslinked nanosheets displayed stable viscoelastic profiles over the range of frequencies tested. Comparison of the interfacial shear storage (iG’) and loss moduli (iG”) also revealed important differences in behaviour between pristine BSA and engineered albumins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The iG’ of BSA was found to be higher than its iG”, but the two moduli were closer in the case of NB-BSA and AC-BSA and iG” was higher than iG’ in the case of MA-BSA. This suggests significant levels of viscosity in engineered proteins. In contrast, all crosslinked nanosheets displayed significantly higher iG’, compared to their corresponding iG”. To further confirm such findings, interfacial stress relaxation experiments were carried out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. These experiments demonstrated relatively elastic recovery profiles, with moderately high residual interfacial elastic stresses in the case of crosslinked nanosheets, whereas engineered albumin assemblies without sulfo-SMCC treatment displayed fast relaxation profiles typical of viscous materials.</p><p id="P31">Therefore, these results are consistent with the effective crosslinking, the strengthening and increase in elastic component of pristine BSA and engineered albumins treated with sulfo-SMCC. The reduction in interfacial shear moduli and the increase in viscous character of engineered protein assemblies in the absence of sulfo-SMCC, in particular for AC-BSA and MA-BSA, suggests that the partial denaturation of these proteins limits the establishment of protein networks with strong interfacial mechanics. This may indicate that protein denaturation is not only responsible to promote assembly at hydrophobic interfaces, but is also required for the physical crosslinking of associated networks. Such phenomena were found to be occurring more extensively in the case of pristine BSA and NB-BSA assemblies. However, variations in the surface densities of the various adsorbed proteins cannot be ruled out, although we note that the crosslinked nanosheets all displayed comparable interfacial shear moduli, suggestive of comparable surface densities.</p><p id="P32">The stability of emulsions formed with BSA and engineered albumins was next examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The size of microdroplets was quantified by mastersizing and via brightfield microscopy. All emulsions, with and without treatment with sulfo-SMCC, were found to be stable over 15 days, at 37°C, in static conditions, as well as with agitation on an orbital shaker. Hence engineered albumins maintained excellent tensioactive properties for the stabilisation of emulsions, which were not significantly affected by crosslinking with sulfo-SMCC. Resulting bioemulsions were found to be more stable in culture conditions than previously reported poly(L-lysine) nanosheet-stabilised bioemulsions, which displayed modest signs of destabilisation (increase in droplet size) over 7 days of culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Finally, bioconjugation of the engineered proteins with cell adhesive peptides was achieved through Michael addition (for AC-BSA and MA-BSA) and radical thiol-ene coupling (for NB-BSA). Coupling-specific sequences, namely CGG-terminated for Michael addition, and GCGG-terminated for radical thiol-ene chemistry, were selected based on their established effectiveness to promote corresponding conjugations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Fluorescence microscopy of resulting emulsions (after assembly of the protein bioconjugates), with FITC-tagged peptides, confirmed the specificity of these coupling strategies, compared to the pristine BSA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D and E</xref>). To further validate the coupling of peptides to NB-BSA via radical thiol-ene reaction we carried out gel electrophoresis, comparing native BSA, norbornylated BSA and RGD peptide functionalised NB-BSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Although the molecular weight of native BSA and functionalised BSA (e.g. NB-BSA) was found to be comparable, after peptide coupling the molecular weight of the resulting bioconjugate increased by approximately 10 kDa. Considering the molecular weight of the peptide selected (862 g/mol), coupling of approximately 12 peptide per protein was achieved, corresponding to 50% efficiency with respect to the number of norbornene residues per protein. Therefore, our results confirmed our ability to selectively bioconjugate engineered albumins enabling the stabilisation of bioemulsions, and further crosslinking with sulfo-SMCC for improved scaffolding properties.</p><p id="P34">The culture of MSCs on engineered protein nanosheet-stabilised bioemulsions was next investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured on RGD-coupled albumin nanosheet-stabilised bioemulsions, with and without SMCC crosslinking. Cell adhesion to uncrosslinked nanosheets was limited, with few clusters of cells seen at the surface of microdroplets 5 days post-seeding, but without evidence of extensive cell spreading or expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cells adhering to these uncrosslinked nanosheets did not assemble a structured cytoskeleton and did not form mature focal adhesions. In contrast, MSCs adhered and spread extensively at the surface of crosslinked nanosheets and corresponding bioemulsion microdroplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). After 5 days of culture, these cells displayed a well-structured cytoskeleton, with apparent mature stress fibres radiating from focal adhesions. Hence the adhesive machinery, underpinned by actomyosin assembly and contractility, and mediated by integrin clustering promoting focal adhesion development was found to be engaged in adherent cells spreading at the surface of bioemulsions. Considering the role of this machinery in the maintenance of stem cell phenotype and fate decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], these observations suggested SMCC-crosslinked bioemulsions could sustain the expansion of bone marrow derived MSCs.</p><p id="P35">In turn, cell expansion and initial seeding efficiency were also found to be enhanced on bioemulsions crosslinked with SMCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B and C</xref>). Significant increases in cell densities were observed on all crosslinked bioemulsions, with densities overtaking those observed even on 2D plastic cultures, in the case of MA-BSA. In agreement with the high spreading observed at day 5, MSCs cultured on crosslinked nanosheets adhered more effectively (high initial seeding efficiencies achieved) and proliferated more rapidly than cells adhering to uncrosslinked counterparts. Considering the importance of ECM ligation and matrix mechanics in supporting cell adhesion, these results indicate that the important change in nanoscale mechanics achieved through the crosslinking of nanosheets is essential to promote MSC expansion on bioemulsions. This result is in agreement with observations made with poly(L-lysine) nanosheets that had been found to sustain stem cell adhesion and expansion when displaying sufficiently strong and elastic interfacial mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P36">MSCs often play an important role in assembling, remodelling and maintaining ECM in corresponding niches, for example in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Examination of matrix deposition after 7 days of culture on bioemulsions indeed confirmed the deposition of substantial levels of fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This process was again modulated by interfacial mechanics and nanosheet crosslinking, as uncrosslinked bioemulsions supported only the deposition of patchy fibronectin domains, potentially associated with the poor adhesion and expansion observed at these interfaces. In contrast, significant fibronectin deposition, extending between droplets aggregating together into small tissue-like structures were observed on SMCC-crosslinked bioemulsions. This was particularly striking in the case of AC-BSA and MA-BSA, perhaps suggesting that residual acrylate and methacrylate moieties may contribute to such matrix deposition, whereas norbornyl residues do not. Indeed, thiols and amines may bind to acrylates and methacrylates in physiological conditions, via Michael addition, whereas norbornyl groups are unable to sustain coupling without activation (e.g. through radical initiation). Therefore MSCs growing on bioemulsions are able to assemble and remodel their extra-cellular microenvironment, recreating tissue-like structures resembling adipose tissues. Such phenomena is attractive to the formation of stem cell niches in vitro, for example for the culture of hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P37">To demonstrate the scalability of bioemulsions for MSC culture, we next selected MA-BSA stabilised microdroplets for culture in conical flask bioreactors. The selection of 250 mL conical flasks with vented caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) allowed us to scale up MSC culture 100 times compared to culture on multi-well plates. Hence 3 M cells were seeded on RGD-coupled MA-BSA bioemulsions and cultured for 15 days in a conical flask bioreactor, on an orbital shaker. Although seeding efficiencies were found to decrease compared to those achieved in 2D cultures, they remained close to 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), comparing favourably with seeding protocols on solid microcarriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Indeed, seeding protocols on microcarriers face the challenge of promoting cell adhesion sufficiently fast to compete with the sedimentation of cultures. The high seeding densities achieved enabled the sustaining of homogenous cell coverage and expansion in the following 15 days, with bioemulsion cultures displaying high confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Throughout this culture time, cell viability was found to remain unchanged (typically above 95%) and comparable for cells cultured on bioemulsion and on 2D tissue culture plastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D and E</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The phenotype of MSCs cultured on bioemulsions was examined next. Specifically, we quantified the co-expression of the membrane markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, three positive markers of bona fide MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], after 15 days of culture, via FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall, &gt;99% cells remained CD73+ and CD90+, and 95% cells were CD105+, after 15 days culture on MA-BSA emulsions, with overall triple positive populations equivalent to those of MSCs cultured on 2D tissue culture plastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Triple marker expression typically correlates tightly with the capacity of MSCs to differentiate in multiple lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] and is considered to be a good predictor of therapeutic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Therefore, key features defining MSC phenotype and therapeutic capacity were maintained on MA-BSA bioemulsions.</p><p id="P39">The ability to recover cells rapidly, whilst limiting processing steps and potential cell loss, is often considered an important hurdle to the scale up of cell manufacturing. We explored two methods of cell recovery requiring no-to-limited processing, compared to enzymatic cell detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Cell colonies growing around droplets were either directly deposited on 2D tissue culture plastic and allowed to adhere and spread, transferring to this new substrate, or directly embedded in fibrin gel, to promote cell migration in a 3D matrix. Alternatively, cells adhering to emulsions were gently dissociated by pipetting through narrow pipettes, prior to transfer to 2D substrates or fibrin gels. Both methods enabled cell transfer and recovery, similarly to what was observed for cells recovered via enzymatic treatment, from bioemulsions or after culture on 2D substrates. Therefore, bioemulsions also enable simpler cell recovery, without enzymatic treatment, reducing processing time and costs and potentially limiting cell losses.</p><p id="P40">Direct implantation of cells following culture is attractive as limiting processing steps, time and costs, but the implantation of fluorinated oils, even with good cytocompatibility profile and inertness, as for Novec 7500, pauses hurdles to regulatory approval. Instead, other oil types such as silicone, mineral and plant-based oils constitute more attractive candidates for translation, and to allow direct implantation of cell colonies growing around droplets. To demonstrate the versatility of the engineered proteins developed for bioemulsion design, the culture of MSCs on plant-based oil emulsion (rapeseed oil) stabilised by NB-BSA, AC-BSA and MA-BSA was investigated. After 7 days of cultures, MSCs could be seen spreading around rapeseed oil microdroplets coated by all three proteins and crosslinked with SMCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Cell densities steadily increased at each time points for all three protein-stabilised bioemulsions, although this increase was more pronounced in the case of MA-BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P41">Although seeding efficiencies were lower than those determined for fluorinated oil emulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), cell densities caught up rapidly with those measured for 2D cultures and, in the case of MA-BSA stabilised bioemulsions, expansion folds reached comparable or slightly higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The reduced seeding efficiency is likely due to the buoyancy of plant-based bioemulsions. Indeed, with these bioemulsions, care had to be taken whilst depositing the cell suspension, so that cells could gently sediment whilst passing through the emulsion layer, to enable adhesion. Once cells had sedimented below this emulsion phase, they had no further opportunity to adhere to adhesive microdroplets and therefore this resulted in limited seeding efficiencies. However, this process could be potentially further optimised by increasing the height of the emulsion phase, or increasing the viscosity of the loading medium. Finally, MSCs cultured on rapeseed oil bioemulsions were reseeded, either directly after gentle disaggregation, or after enzymatic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), displaying capacity to re-adhere to a new substrate and comparable potential for the simplification of cell processing to Novec 7500 bioemulsions.</p></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p id="P42">A growing number of reports has demonstrated the importance of local physical and mechanical properties on the regulation of cell adhesion and phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. The rational design of liquid-liquid interfaces to promote cell adhesion, expansion and stemness retention is in excellent agreement with this literature and illustrates the importance of local nanoscale mechanics in regulating cell phenotype. This concept offers an unprecedented flexibility of engineering for the design of novel biomaterials for application in the fields of biomanufacturing, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. As bioconjugation tools and the control of tensioactive properties are well-established, an important component of design to enable cell culture at liquid interfaces is the control of interfacial shear mechanics. These properties, rather than dilatational mechanics, underpin the design of protein nanosheets, distinguishing these interfaces from more classic protein assemblies. In this context, sulfo-SMCC is one example of crosslinker that demonstrated consistent performance for the various albumins explored in this study. However, its precise crosslinking mechanism remains only partly established. Indeed it could originate from hetero-bicoupling within protein assemblies, but could equally arise from hydrophobic interactions, which have been proposed to dominate the crosslinking of protein nanosheets assembled with hydrophobic co-surfactants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P43">The combination of these three properties for the rationale design of interfaces enables the development of bioactive emulsions. Bioemulsion design can increasingly make use of materials approved by regulators for a range of procedures and permanent implantation (e.g. oils and proteins of interest), without relying on cytotoxic components. Costs are also reduced through such design, broadening their scope of applications. The use of engineered proteins, which could be produced recombinantly, and the possibility of using rapeseed oil and other plant-based oils as substrates are important steps towards further translation of bioemulsions. In this context, engineered globular proteins are well-suited to stabilise a broad range of such oils, extending on concepts developed for formulation in the food industry.</p><p id="P44">Some hurdles remain to be addressed for translation, for example allowing the improvement of initial cell seeding. This can however be addressed through a combination of emulsion engineering (e.g. regulating size distribution and viscosity), as well as process engineering (e.g. the design of devices enabling to maximise cell adhesion during sedimentation, in a scalable flowable process. The advances in bioemulsion design achieved may allow tackling other pitfalls in cell manufacturing, bypassing the complex processing steps typically required to recover cell masses, e.g. through centrifugation, direct cell disaggregation, or altogether bypassing any processing required, allowing direct implantation following culture. These advantages may find application in other fields, such as in cultivated meat, where cell output, processing and costs are critical hurdles to the translation of tissue culture technologies to the development of affordable and scalable food products. Overall, bioemulsions present unique opportunities to transform biomanufacturing and bioprocessing for cell therapies, not only enabling scale up in safe and cost-effective formats, but also allowing to re-think harvesting and implantation protocols and strategies to speed up the translation of novel cell technologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary
