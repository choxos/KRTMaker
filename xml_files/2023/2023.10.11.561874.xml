These conditions include age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. Regulatory T cells play a vital role in immunoregulation of the nervous system by limiting inflammation and tissue damage in health and disease. Because the retina was long-considered an immunoprivileged site, the precise contribution of regulatory T cells in retinal homeostasis and in age-related retinal diseases remains unknown. Our study shows that regulatory T cell elimination leads to retinal pigment epithelium cell dysmorphology, and accumulation of phagocytes in the subretinal space of young and aged mice. However, only aged mice experience retinal neurodegeneration and gliosis. Surprisingly, adoptive transfer of young but not aged regulatory T cells reverse these changes. This study reveals a previously unknown protective role of regulatory T cells in maintaining aged retinal homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>Regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>Retina</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Aging represents the most significant risk factor for various sight-threatening retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or glaucoma. Although the precise pathobiology underpinning age-related retinal degeneration remains ill-defined, there is broad recognition of the crucial role played by chronic low-grade chronic inflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Xu et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kaur &amp; Singh 2021</xref>). Historically, the retina has long been regarded as immunoprivileged. This privileged status is maintained by protective retinal-blood-barriers such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a localized immune system including microglia, which prevent the entry of pathogens and systemic inflammation into the retina(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al. 2019</xref>). The aging retina is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation (also referred to as “para-inflammation” or “inflammaging”) resulting in age-mediated endogenous insults and impaired defense mechanisms (i.e. reduced phagocytic activity, migration from microglia, disruption of blood-retinal barrier, etc). However, it is now recognised that age-related immune dysregulation contributes to retinal degeneration even in the absence of overt disease, challenging the notion of complete immune privilege in the retina. This dysregulation leads to detrimental age-related pathologies such as AMD, diabetic retinopathy or glaucomatous retinopathy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chen et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Regulatory T cells (Treg) maintain and restore tissue homeostasis by regulating immune responses and inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration in a range of tissues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Muñoz-Rojas &amp; Mathis 2021</xref>). In the central nervous system (CNS), Tregs have key neuroprotective functions by modulating microglial and astrocyte activation to prevent gliosis and inflammation and enhance remyelination to limit axonal degeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Shi et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Yshii et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ito et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dombrowski et al. 2017</xref>). Treg density in healthy retinal parenchyma is very low, although Treg infiltration of the neuropil occurs during retinal inflammatory diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">McPherson et al. 2012</xref>). During acute retinal inflammation, such as in uveitis, Tregs exert immunosuppressive functions which counterbalance uncontrolled immune responses and thereby limit degenerative pathology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">McPherson et al. 2012</xref>). Ischemia also increases Treg density in the retina where they participate in preventing supra-retinal damage and fostering reparative intra-retinal angiogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Deliyanti et al. 2017</xref>), demonstrating that Treg play important roles in retinal disease. Yet the role of Treg in age-associated retinal pathology has been largely unexplored.</p><p id="P5">As we age, levels of Treg increase in blood(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Garg et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elyahu et al. 2019</xref>), but whether this supports immune regulation in the aged retina is unknown. To address this, we asked whether genetic ablation of Treg impairs retinal homeostasis in young and aged mice. Here, we show that Treg depletion leads to accelerated retinal neurodegeneration and gliosis in aged but not young mice. Thus, we demonstrate that Treg have a pivotal role in preventing aged retinal neurodegeneration and subsequent gliosis. We have also shown that young Treg are more efficient than aged Treg in reversing age-related retinal degeneration. This work sets the groundwork to investigate Treg immunosuppressive and neuroprotective capacity as an effective treatment for age related retinal degenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Absence of aged Treg leads to retinal neurodegeneration</title><p id="P6">To determine the role of Treg in the adult and aged retina in the absence of apparent disease, we depleted Treg using diphtheria toxin (DT) in young (&lt;4 months) and aged (&gt;18months) B6.129(Cg)-<italic>Foxp3</italic><sup><italic>tm3(DTR/GFP)Ayr</italic></sup>/J(FoxP3-DTR) mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kim et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dombrowski et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1A, B</xref>) and evaluated changes in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Histological analysis at 2.5 weeks post-Treg depletion identified a significant decrease in total retinal thickness in aged but not young mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1C, D</xref>). On further analysis, no changes in photoreceptor nuclei were observed in young mice lacking Treg, while aged mice had a significant reduction of total photoreceptors (DAPI<sup>+</sup> rows in the ONL) following Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). Specifically, photoreceptor loss was associated with a decrease in both, Cone arrestin<sup>+</sup> (CA<sup>+</sup>) cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, D</xref>) and CA<sup>-</sup> rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, E</xref>). To further investigate Treg depletion-associated neurodegeneration, we examined the second-order neurons in the retina. In normal retinas, the bodies of rod bipolar cells reside in the outer region of the inner nuclear layer (INL). These cells exhibit a cluster of dendrites that extended into the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Treg depletion did not affect overall rod or cone bipolar cell number in young or aged Treg-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-J</xref>). However, in PKCα<sup>+</sup> rod-bipolar cells and secretagogin<sup>+</sup> cone-bipolar cells, Treg depletion in aged mice altered cell body laminarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, I</xref>). This was more pronounced in PKCα<sup>+</sup> rod-bipolar cells; in which despite unaltered total number of somas, there was a significant increase of ectopic PKCα<sup>+</sup> cell bodies located below the outer plexiform layer (OPL) due to shorter axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Upon Treg depletion, we also found bipolar dendrites and synaptophysin sprouts expanding from the OPL towards the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). This cellular remodelling (consisting of the retraction of the bipolar cells, sprouting of dendrites and formation of ectopic synapses) has been previously observed in diseases associated with photoreceptor loss(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cuenca et al. 2014</xref>). We did not observe any alteration in retinal ganglion cells across experimental groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV1E-G</xref>) suggesting that neurodegeneration following Treg depletion in aged mice predominantly impacted the outermost layers of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Retinal gliosis is associated with the lack of Treg in the aged retina</title><p id="P7">To determine if Treg depletion affected retinal glia, we first examined Müller glial cell responses. In the absence of Treg we observed a significant increase in GFAP<sup>+</sup> staining in the neuroretina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>) in aged but not young Treg-depleted mice, suggesting an intense Müller cell gliosis. In addition to overall increased GFAP expression (GFAP<sup>+</sup> area of retina) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K, L</xref>) we also observed an expansion in reactive Müller cell number in the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K, M</xref>). Müller cell hypertrophied branches could be a compensatory response growing towards the outer limiting membrane to compensate for photoreceptor loss in an attempt to maintain retinal cytoarchitecture, as described in other retinal diseases characterised by photoreceptor loss, such as retinitis pigmentosa. Hyperreactivity has also been observed in other retinal diseases characterised by photoreceptor loss such as retinitis pigmentosa(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fernández-Sánchez et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next examined whether Treg depletion modified microglial activity in the neuroretina. Microglia are the localized immune cells in the retina, and they show an increased activation in the aged retina(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Xu et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al. 2019</xref>). While Treg depletion in young mice did not affect retinal microglia, a significant increase in the density of IBA-1<sup>+</sup> microglia was observed in the neuroretina of aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K, N</xref>). This increase was detected in all retinal layers, but most significantly in the ONL which is normally devoid of microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2A</xref>). IBA-1<sup>+</sup> cell increase was mostly related to ameboid-shaped microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2B</xref>), a morphological and phenotypic shift usually associated with pro-inflammatory responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Madry et al. 2018</xref>). To validate this phenotype, we quantified the number of MHCII<sup>+</sup> pro-inflammatory microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Frank et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Butovsky &amp; Weiner 2018</xref>) in aged Treg-depleted mice and observed a significant increase of these IBA-1<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> microglia in the neuroretina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">These results indicate that Treg are necessary to prevent photoreceptor death and distorted lamination of bipolar cells in aged retinas. This appears to be linked with Müller cell hypertrophy as well as the accumulation of pro-inflammatory microglia in the nuclear layers of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Treg adoptive transfer prevents retinal degeneration and rescues gliosis</title><p id="P10">We next sought to determine if Treg reconstitution could rescue age-associated retinal neurodegeneration. To do so, we adoptively transferred purified young and aged Treg into Treg-depleted aged mice to determine whether aging affects the capacity of Treg to maintain retinal normal immunoregulation and limit the negative effects of an uncontrolled inflammation in the aged neuroretina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We first examined if reconstitution with young and aged Treg diminished photoreceptor loss. Surprisingly, transfer of young but not aged Treg rescued photoreceptor (cone and rod) loss in the neuroretina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). Although no differences were detected in the number of rod and cone bipolar cells upon Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G, H, J</xref>), adoptive transfer of young but not aged Treg improved the bipolar lamination pattern, showing a decrease in the number of ectopic PKCα<sup>+</sup> somas, as shown by the diminished number of PKCα<sup>+</sup> cell bodies with a lower nuclear location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, I</xref>). Additionally, young Treg also succeed in reducing the bipolar dendrite sprouting into the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, I</xref>). We next evaluated if adoptive transfer of Treg in aged mice inhibited Müller cell gliosis. In line with what we observed for photoreceptor loss, only young but not aged Treg transfer prevented Müller cell gliosis in Treg-deficient aged retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K, L, M</xref>), supporting the concept of Müller cell gliosis being a compensatory response to retinal degeneration as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bringmann et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hippert et al. 2015</xref>). Lastly, we studied the effect of Treg adoptive transfer on microglia density in the neuroretina. In contrast to what we observed with Müller cells, both young and aged Treg reduced the number of total IBA-1<sup>+</sup> microglia as well as the number of IBA-1<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> microglia present in the neuroretina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K, N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig EV2A-D</xref>). Therefore, since adoptive transfer of aged Treg reduces the number of microglia in the neuroretina, but not photoreceptor loss, these data indicate that the increased microglia in the neuroretina is not triggering photoreceptor loss and neurodegeneration at the outermost layers of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Treg maintain RPE integrity and limit phagocyte accumulation in the subretinal space</title><p id="P11">It was previously reported that a range of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) defects occur in the aging retina. With age, RPE cells show an altered morphology, which includes discontinuity of the cytoskeletal bands between adjacent cells and altered cytoarchitecture (appearance of enlarged and irregular cells), contributing to altered retinal immune regulation and enhanced chronic low-grade inflammation described in the aged retina(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Tarau et al. 2019</xref>). In agreement with this, we also observed significantly more enlarged RPE cells in aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Such age-related RPE pathology, was exacerbated by Treg depletion and even developed in young mice lacking Treg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). In addition, CD68<sup>+</sup> phagocytes were increased in the subretinal space of both, young and aged mice upon Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). As per our observations in the neuroretina, phagocyte infiltration in the subretinal space mainly consisted of IBA-1<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> proinflammatory microglia/macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F-J</xref>). Thus, Treg depletion led to accumulation of innate immune cells in the subretinal space and RPE alterations in both young and aged mice. However, these alterations were associated with neurodegeneration and gliosis only in the aged retina. Taking into account that neurodegeneration is present mostly in the outermost part of the retina, these data suggest that aged retinas are more susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of accumulated pro-inflammatory innate immune cells in the subretinal space. Hence, aged retinas are more dependent on Treg for retinal immunoregulation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Interestingly, transfer of young Treg diminished the RPE cell morphological changes, while transferred aged Treg failed to do so efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Similarly, transfer of aged Treg did not limit CD68<sup>+</sup> and IBA-1<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the subretinal space, while transfer of young Treg was highly efficient at doing so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). Therefore, Treg are essential to limit age-related RPE dysmorphology and innate cell accumulatio in the subretinal space. However, in older age Treg have a limited capacity to control an already established retinal inflammatory environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">Despite the paucity of Treg in the retina, in certain conditions, such as retinal neovascularization or uveitis, systemic Treg are actively recruited to the retina, where they influence microglial activation and attenuate disease severity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">McPherson et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Deliyanti et al. 2017</xref>). Aging is characterized by a low-grade chronic inflammation, and a marked gliosis in different areas of the CNS including the brain. Recent work showed that local expansion of Treg in the brain through interleukin-2 overexpression reverses molecular and cognitive signatures of aging such as gliosis, inflammation, and cognitive decline(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lemaitre et al. 2023</xref>). Similar to what has already been described in the brain, disruption of retinal immune regulation is a key contributor to the development of age-related diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al. 2019</xref>). The role of Treg has been extensively studied in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory eye diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lee &amp; Foulsham 2022</xref>), but its role in retinal aging and homeostasis in the absence of overt pathology remains unknown. In part due to the low number of Treg found in healthy retina, Treg have not been previously investigated in the context of the non-pathological aging retina. Our study has addressed this question revealing a novel physiological role of Treg in maintaining retinal homeostasis and thereby limiting age-associated degenerative changes. We have shown how Treg, are essential in the maintenance of a healthy age-related para-inflammation, since its depletion led to exacerbated damage in RPE, phagocyte accumulation and neurodegeneration in the outermost layers of the neuroretina. Additionally, we have shown that once immunoregulation in the aging retina is lost, young Treg are more efficient at limiting inflammation and neurodegeneration than aged Treg, suggesting an intrinsic functional deficit in aged Treg in this setting. This study has identified Treg as key players in limiting age-associated retinal neurodegeneration, opening a new therapeutic avenue to preventing retinal degeneration in aged-related eye diseases. Future work that identifies the molecular mechanisms of Treg-mediated retinal neuroprotection could help to harness the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential of Treg to treat age-associated retinal diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><p id="P13">All animals were housed and bred in a standard pathogen free experimental facility and exposed to a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.

Primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were added and incubated overnight at 4ºC in 0.5% donkey serum and 0.2% triton-X followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) for 1h at room temperature, in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)/Choroid Flatmount staining</title><p id="P18">RPE/choroid flatmounts were dissected under a microdissection microscope (Nikon smz800, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The anterior segment of the eye (cornea, lens, iris and ciliary body) was removed, and the retina was carefully peeled off of the RPE/choroidal eyecup. RPE/choroid flatmounts tissues were washed in PBS followed by treatment with 2% Triton-X 100 for 2 h at RT. After washing, samples were blocked with 5% Donkey serum albumin in 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 1 hour at RT, and then incubated with the corresponding primary antibody and secondary antibodies shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p id="P19">The samples were cover-slipped with Vectashield (H-1000-10, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and examined by Leica DMi8, DM550 epifluorescence microscope or confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 and SP8, Leica Microsystems Ltd., Wetzlar, Germany).

First, normal distribution was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. When only two groups were compared, such as when checking Treg percentage changes upon Treg depletion U-Mann Whitney was used. For comparisons involving more than two groups, 1-way ANOVA analysis was performed followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. When the data was described as percentage, an arcsin conversion was performed to analyze the data using parametric tests for normally distributed data. For all statistical tests, differences were considered significant with p values below 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS189688-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d85aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge extensive technical support from the staff of the animal facility and Advanced Imaging CTU of the Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine.
