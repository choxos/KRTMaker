Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During preimplantation development, mammalian embryos form the blastocyst, a structure sharing many conserved features among mammals that, in eutherians and some marsupials, is required for implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The eutherian blastocyst forms after a series of morphogenetic movements, the first one being compaction. Compaction is a developmentally regulated adhesion process during which cells of the mammalian embryo come into close contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Before compaction, cells of mammalian embryos appear loosely attached to one another and cell-cell contacts do not grow substantially between cleavage divisions. In the mouse, compaction takes place at the 8-cell stage within 8-10 h of the 3<sup>rd</sup> round of cleavage divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Some of the cellular and mechanical mechanisms underlying compaction have been characterized. Compaction requires the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1, also known as E-cadherin and initially called <italic>uvomorulin</italic> after it was discovered in compacting mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). After this striking discovery, changes in Cdh1-mediated cell-cell adhesion were proposed to drive compaction and multiple components of adherens junctions were investigated during compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Changes in adhesion molecules were thought to drive compaction by increasing adhesion energy, in a way similar to what takes place in contacting soap bubbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Assuming cells of compacting embryos behave as liquid droplets, increasing adhesion energy reduces the tension at cell-cell contacts γ<sub>cc</sub> and lowers the ratio of tensions at the cell-cell and cell-medium interfaces γ<sub>cc</sub> / γ<sub>cm</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Following the Young-Dupré equation cos (θ/2) = γ<sub>cc</sub> / 2γ<sub>cm</sub>, this increases the external angle of contact θ and drives compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, estimations of the adhesion energy provided by cadherin adhesion molecules, such as Cdh1, were found to be too weak when compared to another powerful morphogenetic engine in animal cells: actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In mouse and human embryos, actomyosin contractility is also required for compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Actomyosin contractility raises the surface tension at the cell-medium interface γ<sub>cm</sub>, which changes the ratio of surface tensions between the cell-cell and cell-medium interfaces γ<sub>cc</sub> / γ<sub>cm</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). This increases the contact angle θ between cells and compacts the embryo. In maternal Cdh1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), which lack Cdh1 at the time of compaction, cells do not expand their cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Despite the absence of Cdh1, contractility increases the surface tension at the cell-medium interface γ<sub>cm</sub>. However, contrary to wildtype embryos, contractile forces cannot be transmitted between cells without Cdh1. Therefore, compaction results from increased contractile forces that pull cells together via Cdh1 mechanical anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">During compaction, mechanical coupling between cells is expected to strengthen. Indeed, cell-cell contacts become larger and should lead to an increased number of bonds connecting cells, provided that bond density remains at least at the same level. In fact, when forming a cell-cell contact, cadherin adhesion molecules become enriched and bond density often increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In some cases, cadherin adhesion molecules cluster at the edges of the cell-cell contact, which, in doublet of cells, forms a ring of adhesion molecules where it can engage with the cytoskeleton and modulates the effective bond density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between cell-cell contact area and the number of adhesion molecules holding cells together may not be trivial. Adhesion rings are thought to act as a scaffold on which actomyosin contractility can effectively pull and extend the cell-cell contact area. Pulling on adhesion complexes at the edges of cell-cell contacts can also lead to mechanosensitive reinforcement of adherens junctions. Mechanosensitive strengthening can occur via the recruitment of adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and/or via their anchoring to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Cadherin adhesion molecules are connected to the actin cytoskeleton via several proteins including α-catenin, which can unfold when stretched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). This leads to increased connections with the actin cytoskeleton and mechanically strengthens cell-cell contacts by changing the effective bond density. Therefore, during compaction, cell-cell contacts could be mechanically stabilized by increased contact surface, increased adhesion molecule recruitment, adhesion molecule reorganization at the contact rims, and/or increased coupling of individual adhesion complexes. Each of these parameters are susceptible to modulate the effective bond density and to determine the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts. Taken together, while the mechanics of cell-cell contact spreading are well studied, how mechanical coupling may change during compaction is not.</p><p id="P4">Assessing the mechanical coupling of cell-cell adhesion can be done by separating cells while measuring the force necessary to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This is typically performed in doublets of cells forming a single cell-cell contact. Assays based on atomic force microscopes (AFM) have measured adhesive coupling between cells up to tens of nN, which are typically reached within a few minutes of contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). While AFM allows for highly accurate measurements, stronger cell-cell contacts can be difficult to separate using AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To measure adhesive coupling up to hundreds of nN, dual pipette aspiration (DPA) assays can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Also, DPA is easily compatible with light microscopy, which allows one to obtain information about how contacts reorganize during separation. Notably, separation of cell doublets often leads to the formation of membrane tethers connecting separated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). This indicates that some adhesion complexes remain attached in trans and rather detach intracellularly. The weakest link of the adhesion complex may be located at the level of α-catenin or of the actin cytoskeleton, depending on the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In fact, modifying the intracellular binding of cadherins to the cytoskeleton directly affects mechanical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This can also be measured when comparing the intracellular domains of different cadherin adhesion molecules, with Cdh1 intracellular domain showing stronger coupling than that of Cdh7 as shown, for example, using chimeric adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Interestingly, in mouse embryos, replacing Cdh1 by a chimeric adhesion molecule, called EcNc, composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2, also known as N-cadherin, affects preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, the precise effect on compaction and in particular on the mechanical coupling of cells expressing an EcNc chimeric adhesion molecule has not been characterized.</p><p id="P5">Finally, another function of adhesion molecules is to signal to reorganize the underlying cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). This can have multiple effects on contacting cells such as contact inhibition of locomotion in migratory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In particular, cadherin signaling via small GTPases leads to the downregulation of actomyosin contractility at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) or locally at cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). During compaction, this is key to reduce or maintain contact contractility and associated tension γ<sub>cc</sub> at low levels, as seen in mouse or human embryos with impaired Cdh1-based adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The ability of different cadherin adhesion molecules to signal to the actomyosin cytoskeleton is mostly unknown and it is for example unclear how an EcNc chimeric adhesion molecule would affect contact expansion during compaction as compared to Cdh1.</p><p id="P6">Here, we set out to study the mechanical coupling of cells during mouse embryo compaction. Using a DPA assay, we measured the mechanical coupling of compacting blastomeres and analyzed its relationship to contact size, adhesion molecule recruitment and reorganization. We find that mechanical coupling increases during compaction and can be almost entirely explained by contact growth. We further measure that adhesion molecules do not increase in concentration at the growing cell-cell contacts but become enriched in a ring located at their periphery. This reorganization of adhesion molecule is not associated with increased mechanical coupling. Instead, using mice expressing lower levels of Cdh1 or an EcNc chimeric adhesion molecules knocked in the Cdh1 locus, we find that both contact expansion and mechanical coupling are impacted by the intracellular binding of adhesion molecules. Together, this study of compaction provides valuable insights into the regulation of mechanical coupling during physiological increase in cell-cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Embryo work</title><sec id="S4"><title>Recovery and culture</title><p id="P7">All animal work is performed in the animal facility at the Institut Curie, with permission by the institutional veterinarian overseeing the operation (APAFIS #11054-2017082914226001 and APAFIS #39490-2022111819233999 v2).

After division, doublets of sister cells formed a cell-cell contact that grew over time, as observed in whole embryos during compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie 1</xref>, time lapse of whole embryo obtained from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>)).

Therefore, during compaction, cell-cell contacts increase their mechanical stability. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), the contact angles and radii of doublets increased throughout the 8-cell stage before we separated them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).

To gain further insights into what explains increased mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts during compaction, we considered different scenarios. In the simplest case, increased contact size allows for more adhesion molecules to engage into adhesive bonds and, with a circular contact with homogeneous adhesive bond density, we would expect mechanical stability to scale with the area of contact. The scaling of mechanical stability with the area of contact may not be linear since in addition to growing in size, cell-cell contacts could recruit and increase the density of adhesion molecules. Furthermore, as measured in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), adhesive bonds may become enriched at the rim of cell-cell contacts, where they can more efficiently engage with the actin cytoskeleton and strengthen the mechanical coupling between cells by increasing the effective bond density. In this case, we would expect mechanical stability to scale linearly with the perimeter of cell-cell contacts rather than with the contact area. When comparing the correlations of F<sub>s</sub> with the perimeter or the surface area of contacts, both yield similarly high correlations (Pearson correlation values R = 0.774 and 0.773 for 88 doublets, respectively, p &lt; 10<sup>-2</sup>), which does not allow us to discriminate between those scenarios. Therefore, we decided to look into the molecular and structural organizations of adherens junctions during compaction.</p><p id="P41">To investigate the localization of adhesive bonds during compaction, we labelled Cdh1 using immunostaining and filamentous actin using phalloidin on doublets of increasing age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). We measured that actin becomes strongly reduced at cell-cell contacts as compared to the contact-free interface of cells when contacts grow larger during compaction, while Cdh1 shows limited change (Pearson correlation values R = -0.742 and 0.329 for 45 doublets, p &lt; 10<sup>-2</sup> and &gt; 10<sup>-2</sup> between contact angles and actin or Cdh1, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2A, S2C</xref>). This is similar to previous measurements on mouse and human whole embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Furthermore, we measured a progressive enrichment of Cdh1, but not of actin, at the periphery as compared to the inside of the contact disc when contacts grow larger during compaction (Pearson correlation values R = 0.266 and 0.496 for 45 doublets, p &gt; 10<sup>-2</sup> and &lt; 10<sup>-2</sup> between contact angles and actin or Cdh1, respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2B, S2D</xref>), as observed in other doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Therefore, while Cdh1 does not seem to be further recruited to cell-cell contacts during their expansion, adhesion complexes reorganize to form a ring at the contact edges where the remaining actin cytoskeleton is found. We conclude that, in addition to contact growth, increased mechanical stability may be associated with the accumulation of adhesive bonds at the contact rim.</p><p id="P42">To test the potential influence of the structural reorganization of adhesion complexes during compaction without the contribution of contact expansion, we normalized the separation force to the radius of contact R<sub>c</sub>.

We observed no change in rupture tension F<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>c</sub> during compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating that the enrichment of Cdh1 at the contact rim is not associated with stronger effective bond density during mouse embryo compaction. Instead, increased mechanical stability during compaction is primarily explained by increased contact size.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Reduced mechanical coupling in embryos lacking Cdh1-mediated adhesion</title><p id="P43">Since Cdh1 mediates cell-cell adhesion during compaction, we reasoned that reducing its levels, should reduce the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts. Maternal heterozygous Cdh1 mutant (mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup>) embryos should have less Cdh1 at the time of compaction since they lack maternal Cdh1 and can only rely on zygotic expression from their paternal allele. Lower levels of Cdh1 should likely decrease the mechanical stability cell-cell contacts and potentially their effective bond density. Moreover, compaction is impaired in mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> embryos, which form smaller cell-cell contacts than WT embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). With both smaller contacts and fewer adhesion molecules, the effective bond density of mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> embryos is difficult to predict.</p><p id="P44">To characterize this, we generated doublets from mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie 3</xref>). Binning doublets over groups of 4 h after division, we found that mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets start with smaller contacts than WT and compact less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>), as observed previously in whole embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). As expected from the smaller contacts, we also measured lower separation forces F<sub>s</sub> in mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets than in WT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Nevertheless, mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets could grow from ~30 to ~40 nN during the 8-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Therefore, mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets reach, at the end of their 8-cell stage, a level of mechanical coupling comparable to WT doublets at the start of their 8-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). This could be explained by mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets catching up to contact sizes of WT doublets. However, when measuring the rupture tension F<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>c</sub> for mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets at the beginning of the 8-cell stage, we found that it is higher than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). Then, as mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> contacts enlarge and reach the levels of WT at the start of compaction, the rupture tension F<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>c</sub> decreases to reach WT levels. This suggests that the smallest contacts of mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> mutants may have higher effective bond density than contacts formed by WT. Therefore, at low level of expression, the relationship between Cdh1 levels and effective bond density appears complex.</p><p id="P45">Together, we conclude that reducing the levels of Cdh1 leads to decreased mechanical coupling of cell-cell contacts, which cannot be explained solely by the reduced contact size.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>The intracellular domain of Cdh2 is less effective than that of Cdh1</title><p id="P46">In addition to the levels of adhesion molecules, their individual mechanical stability is likely to influence the overall mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts. The mechanical stability of adherens junctions is limited by their intracellular coupling rather than the extracellular binding of cadherin adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Indeed, as observed in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), separating doublets of 8-cell stage blastomeres leads to the formation of long membrane tethers connecting separated cells, indicating that some cadherin adhesion molecules were not separated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). To test the role of intracellular coupling, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse in which the endogenous locus of Cdh1 has been replaced with the cDNA encoding a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 called EcNc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). To generate embryos expressing only the chimeric protein at the stage of compaction, we removed Cdh1 maternally and provided the EcNc allele paternally using heterozygous fathers Cdh1<sup>EcNc/+</sup>. To distinguish between mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> and mCdh1<sup>EcNc/-</sup> embryos, we used immunostaining using antibodies targeting either the extra- or intra-cellular domains of Cdh1, or the HA tag added to the EcNc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P47">At the start of the 8-cell stage, the contacts of mCdh1<sup>EcNc/-</sup> doublets are small, similar in size to the ones of mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie 4</xref>). However, unlike mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets, mCdh1<sup>EcNc/-</sup> doublets do not increase their contact size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A-B</xref>). Therefore, expression of EcNc chimeric cadherin does not elicit compaction, which could be due to reduced signaling or mechanical coupling from the cytoplasmic domain of Cdh2 compared to Cdh1. As expected from their contacts remaining small, mCdh1<sup>EcNc/-</sup> doublets display overall weak mechanical coupling, which does not increase during the 8-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Finally, calculating the rupture tension F<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>c</sub> in mCdh1<sup>EcNc/-</sup> doublets revealed that it is lower than in mCdh1<sup>+/-</sup> doublets at comparable contact size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). This suggests that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 may be less mechanically stable than the one of Cdh1. Together, we conclude that Cdh1 mediated cytoskeletal anchoring is key to elicit compaction and to build mechanically stable cell-cell contacts.</p></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P48">The shaping of the eutherian embryo begins with compaction, a developmentally regulated adhesion process during which cells form a tighter structure. The mechanical characterization of compacting human and mouse embryos previously revealed the changes in surface tensions responsible for contact expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).

We found that, as compaction proceeds, cell-cell contacts require higher forces to be separated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie 2</xref>). This increased mechanical stability is primarily explained by the spreading of cell-cell contacts associated with compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). While adherens junctions are remodeled during compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>), this does not seem to be associated with increased mechanical stability since the rupture tension, indicative of effective bond density, does not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). However, when reducing the levels of adhesion molecules to a level that impairs the expansion of contacts, we measured an effect on contact mechanical stability, which also depends on the molecular nature of the intracellular coupling of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). Together, our ex vivo analysis reveals the contributions of contact spreading and molecular reorganization to the mechanical strengthening of cell-cell contacts during compaction.</p><p id="P49">Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement in eutherian mammals, such as mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). In human embryos, weak or delayed compaction is associated with poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) but could be indicative of other developmental defects such as aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). In fact, mutant mouse embryos, which lack maternal Cdh1 or maternal non-muscle myosin II but express these genes from their paternal alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), fail to compact but form blastocysts and viable mice. Therefore, compaction is not essential to mouse development and its function is unclear. However, defective compaction in some cells of human embryos is associated with their exclusion from the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), which can eventually cause cells to detach from the compacted embryo, especially in the absence of egg shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Here, we show that contact spreading associated with compaction provides increased mechanical coupling between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, compaction may simply prevent cells from detaching from the embryo.</p><p id="P50">Surface tension measurements revealed the prominent role of actomyosin contractility in controlling the surface tensions driving compaction in mouse and human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Increased contractility and associated surface tensions pulling on adherens junctions have been proposed to lead to their mechanosensitive strengthening in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). This is associated with the relocation of adhesive bonds to the contact periphery, which forms a ring in doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), as well as in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In compacting mouse embryos, for which contractility doubles the surface tensions applied at the edges of cell-cell contacts, we also observe the relocation of Cdh1 in a peripheral ring, without significant recruitment of Cdh1 to cell-cell contact from the remaining of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). However, this relocation is not associated by increased effective bond density, since the rupture tension F<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>c</sub> does not change during the formation of an adhesive ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). We do not observe a significant relocation of the actin cytoskeleton to the adhesive ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>), as observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Since increased actin recruitment is a hallmark of mechanical reinforcement of adherens junction via the mechanosensitive recruitment of junctional proteins such as vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), the lack of actin recruitment in compacted doublets further indicates the absence of reinforcement of the intracellular coupling of Cdh1 during mouse compaction. Taken together, our experimental results point at a simple explanation for the mechanical reinforcement of cell-cell contact stability during compaction: increased contact size leads to larger peripheral adhesive rings cumulating more adhesive bonds of constant effectiveness.</p><p id="P51">While effective bond density does not seem to change during compaction, the intracellular coupling of cadherin is essential to their function as a mechanical anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Different cadherins have distinct mechanical coupling, as measured for example for type I Cdh1 and type II Cdh7 cadherin adhesion molecules using chimeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Here, we looked into the difference between Cdh1 and Cdh2 cytoplasmic domains. A previous study looked into zygotic replacement of Cdh1 with a chimeric protein EcNc made of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2, which did not cause compaction defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We eliminated the maternally provided Cdh1, zygotically expressed in its place the chimeric adhesion molecule EcNc and found that 8-cell stage doublets from these embryos do not compact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). This indicates that in the initial characterization of zygotic EcNc mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), maternally provided Cdh1 could most likely compensate for the presence of EcNc at the time of compaction. Since zygotically expressed Cdh1 elicits some compaction, the ability of EcNc to function as an adhesion molecule is unclear. EcNc adhesion molecules may fail at signaling to the actomyosin cytoskeleton to allow compact expansion and/or fail at mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells. Since we measured weaker rupture tensions when zygotically expressing EcNc than when expressing Cdh1 in maternal Cdh1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), this suggests that EcNc cannot provide much adhesive coupling. Therefore, the intracellular coupling of Cdh2 is likely weaker than the one of Cdh1. Further studies into the specificities of cadherin adhesion molecules signaling and mechanical coupling will be needed to uncouple the distinct functions of cadherins in cell-cell adhesion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Movie 1</label><caption><title>Time lapse of a compacting whole embryo and of a doublet.</title><p id="P52">Images of a whole embryo (left) and of a doublet (right) undergoing their 3<sup>rd</sup> cleavage division and compacting.
