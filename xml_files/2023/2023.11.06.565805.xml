The vast majority of existing tools are, however, limited to light-triggered induction of gene expression. Here, we inverted this mode of action and created two complementary optogenetic systems capable of efficiently terminating transcriptional activation in response to blue light. First, we designed highly compact regulators, by photo-controlling VP16 transactivation peptide exposure. Then, applying a two-hybrid strategy, we engineered LOOMINA (<bold>l</bold>ight <bold>o</bold>ff-<bold>o</bold>perated <bold>m</bold>odular <bold>in</bold>ductor of transcriptional <bold>a</bold>ctivation), a versatile transcriptional control platform for mammalian cells that is highly adaptable and compatible with various effector proteins. Leveraging the flexibility of CRISPR systems, we integrated LOOMINA with Cas9 as a DNA-binding domain to control transcription from various endogenous promoters with exceptionally high dynamic ranges in multiple cell lines, including neuron-like cells. Both functionally and mechanistically, LOOMINA represents a valuable addition to the optogenetic repertoire for transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Transcriptional control is a key strategy for regulating RNA and protein levels in cells. The ability to turn gene expression on or off in a user-defined manner provides tailored control over a wide variety of cellular processes. As a result, tools for the induction of gene expression have applications in all areas of biology from basic research to biotechnology. Among these approaches, optogenetic systems are particularly appealing due to the high degree of spatiotemporal control they offer.</p><p id="P3">Various optogenetic tools are available to regulate transcription in mammalian cells. The majority are based on pairs of protein domains that form heterodimers in response to light. Fusing one of the dimerization domains to a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the other to a transactivation domain (TAD) enables light-induced recruitment of the TAD to DNA, as has been successfully demonstrated in cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The modularity of these two-hybrid systems allows for easy modifications by exchanging individual components. Existing tools include both blue- and red light-responsive dimerizers that have been combined with different DBDs and transactivator domains, depending on the application context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In particular, the repurposing of CRISPR nucleases, such as Cas9, as DNA-binding modules has increased the versatility of these systems by enabling the simple and efficient targeting of endogenous loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, recruitment of the VP64 or p65 transactivation domain to a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) via fusions to the well-established CRY2/CIB1 photosensory heterodimerization system facilitates potent light-activated transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to TAD recruitment, several mechanistically distinct optogenetic CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) strategies have been described, including split-dCas9 architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, optogenetic recruitment of TADs to single guide RNAs (sgRNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, light-activated anti-CRISPR proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or the steric control of Cas9 via light-dependent occlusion of the DNA-binding groove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Importantly, all these strategies share the common feature of light-induced transcriptional activation.</p><p id="P5">However, if longer periods of active transcription are desired, an inverted mechanism of action, i.e. light-induced termination of transcriptional activation would be highly advantageous. This strategy could minimize the time that cells are exposed to light and allow for the controlled and rapid shutdown of gene expression upon illumination. Yet, only a few light-off systems for transcriptional regulation have been developed. While the activity of dCas9-VP64 could be successfully controlled via light-dependent subcellular re-localization, this indirect approach yielded only a modest fourfold difference in gene expression between the light and dark condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Alternative strategies showed higher dynamic ranges of gene expression control, but relied on sequence-specific DBDs, hence rendering the optogenetic control of selected, endogenous genes infeasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To fill this gap in the optogenetic repertoire, we set out to create a versatile light-off toolkit for transcriptional control. First, building upon our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we photo-controlled the VP16 transcriptional transactivator peptide by incorporating it into the C-terminal Jɑ helix of the blue light-inducible LOV2 domain of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototropin 1 (<italic>As</italic>LOV2). Following this initial compact, single-component design, we created a powerful modular system based on a two-hybrid-like approach employing the LOVTRAP optogenetic dimerizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. LOVTRAP consists of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain and a peptide, Zdk (or Z-dark), which binds <italic>As</italic>LOV2 only in the dark. Fusing one or more <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domains to a DBD and linking Zdk to a transactivation domain facilitated robust activation of transcription in the dark and efficient deactivation in the light. Our <bold>l</bold>ight-<bold>o</bold>ff <bold>o</bold>perated <bold>m</bold>odular <bold>in</bold>ducer of transcriptional <bold>a</bold>ctivation (<bold>LOOMINA</bold>) is compatible with various DBDs including Gal4 and Cas9, and multiple TADs such as VP64, p65 or VPR, enabling the optogenetic expression control of reporter genes, as well as the induction from endogenous promoters. With up to 1000-fold changes in gene expression at endogenous loci, the system has an exceptionally wide dynamic range. Finally, the characterization of our toolbox with respect to spatial expression control as well as in different cell lines establishes LOOMINA as a robust and versatile means for the plug-and-play control of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Light-inhibited gene expression with photocaged transactivation peptides</title><p id="P7">To create a transcriptional control system that can be turned off by light, we first adapted a photocaging strategy that we had previously employed for optogenetic control of nuclear import and export of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The approach exploits the unique structural dynamics of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain. In its dark-adapted state, the C-terminus of LOV2 constitutes a C-terminal α-helix, denoted Jα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, whereas photoinduction triggers the reversible unfolding of Jα, as well as its undocking from the LOV2 protein core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As a transactivation domain, we used the widely applied <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> VP16 peptide, which adopts an a-helical structure when interacting with target proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We reasoned that fusing VP16 to the Jɑ helix of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 would allow us to activate transcription in the dark, when Jɑ exhibits its helical fold, and deactivate VP16 in the relaxed light-adapted conformation of <italic>As</italic>LOV2. Of note, this light-off peptide control modality is essentially the reverse concept of previous, <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based peptide photocaging strategies employed by us and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. As our initial design, we replaced the seven C-terminal amino acids of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain with the 11 amino acid VP16 transactivation motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both sequences consist of negatively charged amino acids, interspersed with hydrophobic residues, rendering a successful incorporation into Jɑ highly likely.</p><p id="P8">This photo-controlled VP16 (pcVP16.1) variant was then fused to the C-terminus of a Gal4-DBD, to enable recruitment of the fusion protein to a Gal4-UAS reporter construct driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As benchmarks for gene induction potency and assay controls, we used a fusion of Gal4 to either the full-length VP16 domain or the VP16 transactivation peptide only. We then transiently co-transfected HEK293T cells with the GFP reporter and either the pcVP16.1 or the benchmark constructs and incubated the samples under blue light illumination (~460 nm) or in the dark for 20 hours. Subsequent fluorescence measurements in a plate reader showed potent GFP expression for the control construct with the full-length VP16 domain, whereas the 11 amino acid-long VP16 peptide fused to Gal4 did not induce gene expression above basal levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Our pcVP16.1 construct, in contrast, was both potent and light-switchable, exhibiting high reporter induction in the dark and only background levels of GFP expression when samples were incubated in the light. For further characterization, we switched to a more sensitive dual-luciferase assay and used a Gal4-UAS-driven firefly luciferase together with a co-transfected <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase as internal reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We compared pcVP16.1 with a number of alternative designs, again including Gal4-VP16-domain and Gal4-VP64 as benchmarks. pcVP16.1 exhibited a more than 140-fold induction of reporter gene expression in the dark as compared to the light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We also tested a naive fusion of the VP16 peptide to the untruncated Jα helix, which showed only modest light-dependency, when compared to pcVP16.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Extending the length of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 controlled VP16 construct to include additional VP16 repeats, i.e. VP32-VP64, resulted in a graded increase in light-dependent activation, but similarly increased leaky expression in the light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we fused pcVP16.1 to dCas9 (from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>) as an alternative DBD that would allow the targeting of endogenous genomic loci. To this end, we used a firefly luciferase reporter, downstream of multiple Tet operator repeats and targeted a sgRNA to these operator sites in multiplex. The DBD exchange was generally successful, but longer VP48 or VP64 transactivator repeats were required to achieve sufficient induction, which came at the cost of increased levels of leaky expression in the light condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Thus, our reversed photocaging approach yielded a compact and potent transactivators with wide dynamic ranges of optogenetic gene expression control, but was only partially compatible with other DBDs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LOOMINA - a versatile transcription control platform based on the optogenetic LOVTRAP system</title><p id="P11">To create a light-off system for transcriptional regulation that is compatible with dCas9 and larger TADs such as VP64 and VPR, we took a different approach harnessing LOVTRAP, an <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based heterodimerization system thus far mainly employed to control protein subcellular relocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In order to adapt LOVTRAP for direct transcriptional regulation, we fused the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain C-terminally to dCas9. Zdk2, a <italic>As</italic>LOV-binding peptide that dissociates upon illumination, was linked to the C-terminus of VP64 and expressed from a different plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We tested our strategy with the previously described luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells. Indeed, we observed light-dependent transcriptional activation with an up to 11-fold change in reporter activity between the light and dark samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This effect was most pronounced when the transcriptional activator was added in excess of the dCas9-LOV encoding construct. Although this initial attempt was successful overall, the transcriptional activation in the dark was in all cases significantly lower (&gt;26-fold) in comparison to the positive control samples expressing a direct fusion of dCas9 to VP64 (dCas9-VP64). Hypothesizing that domain architecture and order might affect the dimerization and transactivation efficiency, we screened N-terminal Zdk2-VP64 fusions and previously described alternative Zdk peptides (Zdk1 and Zdk3) under the same conditions as our prototype construct. Rearranging the domain order resulted in significantly improved transcriptional activation, especially for Zdk1, which was indistinguishable from the dCas9-VP64 benchmark in the dark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). However, only small differences were observed between light and dark conditions, i.e. these designs showed impaired switchability. While the dynamic range of gene expression control could be improved by simply increasing the amount of dCas9-<italic>As</italic>LOV2 relative to the Zdk1-VP64 construct supplied during transfection, this improvement came at the cost of overall lower reporter activation in the dark condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, we decided to take an alternative route of optimization. We hypothesized that an increase in the number of (light-dependent) Zdk-binding sites per Cas9 molecule could improve affinity and hence transactivator recruitment in the dark without compromising photo-switchability. To realize this concept, we concatenated up to three <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domains via genetic fusion and appended them to dCas9 via flexible glycine-serine linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-f</xref>). Screening these constructs using our luciferase assay, we observed greatly increased differences between dark and light conditions from 2.6-fold for the single <italic>As</italic>LOV2 design to 36-fold when three <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domains were concatenated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We were able to further improve the system’s performance by adding multiple nuclear localization signals (NLS) to dCas9-3x<italic>As</italic>LOV2 (consisting of two SV40 NLS and a C-myc NLS), instead of the single SV40 NLS that was used up until this point. This new NLS configuration greatly reduced leaky reporter expression under illumination while maintaining full induction in the dark, resulting in a 150-fold change in reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). We refer to this system and its derivatives as LOOMINA (for <bold>l</bold>ight-<bold>o</bold>ff <bold>o</bold>perated <bold>m</bold>odular <bold>in</bold>ducer of transcriptional <bold>a</bold>ctivation).</p><p id="P12">To investigate the modularity of LOOMINA, we explored the effects of altering its LOVTRAP components. We combined VP64 separately with different Zdk variants (Zdk1-3), that were reported to have varying affinities to <italic>As</italic>LOV2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Comparable differences between light and dark conditions were observed for all three Zdk variants tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The combination of LOOMINA with Zdk1 resulted in exceptionally low background reporter activity in the light, but also in lower levels of induction in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This observation reflects the comparatively lower affinity of Zdk1 to <italic>As</italic>LOV2 compared to Zdk2/3, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Zdk3 performed robustly under all tested conditions and was used in the further experiments. Similar to the Zdks, also the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain could be replaced by a recently published circularly permuted variant (cpLOV2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which performed comparably well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Having identified a robust LOOMINA design, we next combined it with TADs other than VP64. As expected, Zdk3-VP64 could be readily replaced by Zdk3-VPR or Zdk3-p65 resulting in light-switchable transcriptional activation that was in the range of the dCas9-TAD positive controls in the dark and at basal levels in the light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h-i</xref>). In addition, the efficiency of LOOMINA could be tuned by varying the vector mass ratio of the transfected DBD and TAD components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h-i</xref>). In the case of VPR, for instance, lower DBD:TAD vector mass ratios (1:7 instead of 1:3) turned out beneficial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). We could even further enhance the system’s performance in conjunction with VPR by expressing its components from a CMV-promoter instead of the slightly weaker Eflɑ promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we tested the compatibility LOOMINA with different DBDs. To this end, we replaced dCas9 with Gal4 or TetR and evaluated these variants using the reporter constructs described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a-b</xref>). Various configurations including one or two <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domains and an N-terminal cpLOV fusion in combination with either Zdk3-VP64 or Zdk3-VPR were tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c-d</xref>). As expected, all variants were potently light-switchable, with the Gal4 constructs exhibiting a stronger light response than the TetR configuration.</p><p id="P15">Finally, to further simplify the use of LOOMINA, we combined its two components into a single vector. To this end, we designed a LOOMINA transgene co-expressing the Zdk3-TAD (encoded 5’) and 3xNLS-dCas9-3xLOV parts (encoded 3’) from the same mRNA using a P2A peptide strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This particular configuration was chosen to prevent the unintended formation of constitutively active fusion proteins in case of insufficient “self-splicing” by the P2A sequence, which would emerge if the Zdk3-TAD part was located 3’. All P2A constructs successfully mediated strong light-dependent transcriptional activation when expressed under an Eflɑ promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) and will enable users to easily combine a single plasmid version of LOOMINA with their sgRNA of choice.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LOOMINA works efficiently in various cell types and enables spatially controlled gene expression activation</title><p id="P16">A key advantage of optogenetic tools is the precise spatial control of activation that can be achieved by illuminating only specific areas of a sample. To demonstrate this feature of LOOMINA, we employed a TetO-controlled mCherry reporter targeted by a TetO-specific sgRNA and used VPR as TAD. Following transient transfection of HEK293T cells, we covered half of the culture with a black photomask followed by illumination with blue light. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a clear difference in reporter expression levels between the illuminated and non-illuminated parts of the dish, showing that LOOMINA facilitates spatially confined gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To further assess LOOMINA’s applicability, we tested the system in several commonly used human cell lines such as HeLa, U2OS, HepG2. Evaluation of our lead candidate 3xNLS-dCas9-3xLOV in combination with all three TADs (VP64, p65 and VPR) via luciferase assays revealed light-dependent transcriptional activation in each cell line under all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>). For every cell line, at least one TAD was identified that mediated a more than 30-fold switch in reporter activity between dark and light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, all constructs achieved activation levels in the dark that were comparable to the respective dCas9-TAD fusion protein benchmarks. Importantly, assay conditions were not individually optimized for each cell line or TAD, i.e. robust photoswitching was readily obtained simply by using LOOMINA with the same configuration and vector mass ratios as previously in HEK293T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LOOMINA mediates strong transcriptional control at endogenous loci</title><p id="P18">One major limitation of previously published light-off switches for gene expression control is their reliance on sequence-specific DBDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. As LOOMINA is compatible with multiple DBDs, fusion with dCas9 allows for site-specific, light-dependent transcriptional activation at targeted genomic loci. We investigated this feature by co-transfecting HEK293T or HeLa cells with plasmids encoding LOOMINA in combination with a mixture of sgRNA-expressing constructs that target the promoter region of a selected gene and measuring its expression by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) three days post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We tested the LOOMINA VP64 and VPR variants, as well as the all-in-one P2A-constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Targeting the promoter of <italic>IL1RN</italic> in HEK293T cells resulted in blue light-inhibited control with exceptionally high dynamic ranges spanning two and three orders of magnitude for VP64 and VPR, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>). To our knowledge this is the most effective <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based photoswitch reported in mammalian cells to date. When we targeted <italic>IL1RN</italic> in HeLa cells, the overall transcriptional activation reached by the dCas9-TAD fusion controls was lower, but LOOMINA again spanned the entire range from full activation in the dark to background levels of the negative control under light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).

In contrast to the experiments described above, we adopted a commercially available LED array and tested different dCas9-<italic>As</italic>LOV2 variants together with Zdk3-VP64 and Zdk3-VPR in Neuro2a (N2a) cells, a neuron-like cell line, using a luciferase reporter. Despite weaker overall reporter activation in the neuron-like cells as compared to the other cell lines tested, light-dependent gene expression control was obtained for the LOOMINA samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next, moving from reporter control to optogenetic control of endogenous gene expression in N2a cells, we decided to use a shorter light pulsation cycle (1 s light on, 1 s light off), which reduced the leakiness of LOOMINA in the light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). These experiments revealed an up to 5-fold difference in transcriptional activation when targeting the murine <italic>Arc</italic> locus, an important regulator of synaptic plasticity and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12 and 13a-b</xref>). In order to cross-validate the RT-qPCR results, we performed an RNAscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> experiment, using specific probes against the <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA. To visualize all components of the system, we added a fluorescent mCherry reporter to the Zdk3-VPR construct via a P2A peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and co-expressed GFP from the sgRNA-encoding plasmid. We confirmed by RT-qPCR that the system's functionality was not affected by the presence of mCherry or GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13b</xref>). Confocal image analysis revealed that 10–20% of cells co-expressed all transfected components, i.e. mCherry/Zdk3-VPR, dCas9-LOV and the sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13c-d</xref>). Importantly, quantification of <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA levels in the triple-positive cells confirmed that <italic>Arc</italic> expression was significantly lower when cells were illuminated, confirming that LOOMINA induces transcription only in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, we evaluated the LOOMINA lead candidate design (NLS-dCas9-3xLOV, Zdk3-VPR) on additional endogenous loci in N2a cells, targeting the promoter regions of <italic>Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>Neurog2</italic>, genes implicated in synaptic transmission and neuronal differentiation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

The reverse-photocaging approach was inspired by concepts developed by us and others for the optogenetic control of diverse cellular processes, such as nuclear protein import<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> or export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In line with previous work, we modified the Jɑ helix of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 only from I539 onwards to preserve its function. Within the engineered portion, various different configurations were tolerated and functional, confirming that the C-terminal part of the Jɑ-helix is highly amenable to modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). As a key novelty of our pcVP16 design, we have successfully fused the Jɑ helix to a structured helical motif, thereby inverting the previously described mode of LOV2-based peptide photocaging. While other approaches have relied on masking of signal peptides in the dark state, VP16 is active in the helical conformation and was in turn deactivated by Jɑ unfolding in the light. We expect that this strategy could easily be adapted for the optogenetic control of other helical peptides. Another remarkable difference between pcVP16 and previous systems is its highly potent light response with &gt;100-fold changes in reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), whereas other photocaging tools have exhibited only up to 40-fold changes in activity. Further investigation is needed to understand whether this particularly potent switchability of pcVP16 is due to specific features of the LOV2-VP16 fusion or a general property of the reverse photocaging concept developed here. Finally, we note that pcVP16 is particularly compact. Including Gal4 as DBD, the complete fusion protein is only 318 amino acids long, rendering it an interesting candidate for future control of virally delivered transgenes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P23">LOOMINA, in contrast, is in itself a whole toolbox consisting of different components that can be readily combined and interchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition to its modularity, we demonstrated LOOMINA’s robust functionality in a variety of settings, from reporter assays, to the control of endogenous genes, to spatial transcriptional regulation via a custom photomask. While related studies on Cas9-based optogenetic transcriptional activators have focused almost exclusively on HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, we have thoroughly characterized LOOMINA in various cell lines including HeLa, HepG2, U2OS and N2a.</p><p id="P24">The dynamic range of LOOMINA can be dramatically altered by varying the DBD:TAD vector mass ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Providing the vector encoding the much larger Cas9 transgene in excess has been proven beneficial in all settings. Unlike most two-hybrid systems that operate in a 1:1 stoichiometry, LOOMINA incorporates three <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domains, each of which can bind one Zdk-TAD protein. Mechanistically, the concatenation of more than one LOV2 domain is a straightforward way to improve the performance of an optogenetic switch. While we are not aware of any other reports using this strategy, it may be easily transferable to other LOV2-based dimerization systems, such as iLID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Finally, LOOMINA fills a gap in the optogenetic arsenal for transcriptional control by enabling researchers to turn off gene expression with blue light in a highly customizable manner. This mechanism of action further broadens the applicability of optogenetic transcriptional regulators and will be particularly important if transcriptional induction is to be reversed at a given time point in an experiment. With transcriptional induction being its default state in the dark, LOOMINA’s mode of action aligns well with various experimental setups and will enable researchers to reduce the required illumination time in many cases. In this sense, LOOMINA may even be a well-suited candidate for future optogenetic investigations <italic>in vivo</italic>, where continuous illumination tends to be more challenging and its duration is thus limited.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, LOOMINA represents a powerful toolkit for CRISPR-mediated light off-operated transcriptional control that can be used in various configurations and experimental setups and will be a valuable addition to the existing set of optogenetic strategies for gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Construct design and cloning</title><p id="P27">All plasmids generated and used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.
