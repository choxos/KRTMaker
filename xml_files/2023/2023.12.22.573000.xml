The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I detects viral RNAs and endogenous polymerase III transcripts carrying a 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp) or 5′-diphosphate (5′-pp) moiety, triggering an IFN immune response. While many viral RNAs initiate with 5′-ppp-adenosine (5′-pppA) and most endogenous Pol III transcripts in higher eukaryotes start with 5′-ppp-guanosine (5′-pppG), no apparent reason for this bias has been identified so far. Here we demonstrate that RNAs initiating with 5′-pppA trigger a much stronger RIG-I/IFN response than those starting with 5′-pppG. The structures of the matching RNA pairs have been confirmed to be similar, suggesting that functional differences in RIG-I/IFN pathway stimulation cannot be primarily explained by an altered conformation. We show that several GTP-binding proteins interact with 5′-pppG RNAs creating a steric hindrance and protecting these RNAs from activating RIG-I. Our findings suggest that 5′-pppG RNAs may allow some RNA viruses and Pol III transcripts to evade detection by cellular immune sensors. These results provide a new insight into the mechanism of sequence-dependent RIG-I/IFN pathway activation and have significant implications for understanding the antiviral response to RNA viruses and the contribution of Pol III-derived RNAs to autoimmune disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RIG-I</kwd><kwd>IFN type 1</kwd><kwd>5′-triphosphate RNA guanosine (5′-pppG)</kwd><kwd>5′-triphosphate RNA adenosine (5′-pppA)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The innate immune system of higher eukaryotes is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, including viruses.

This collection revealed that some RNA viruses (such as influenza A virus - IAV) start predominantly from 5′-pppA, whereas other pathogenic viruses (including H5N1 IAV, Ebola, Lassa, and HCV) can start from 5′-pppG or other nucleosides. Moreover, most Pol III transcripts, including non-coding tRNA, Y RNA, vault RNA, and 5S RNA, initiate from 5′-pppG.

We provide evidence that several GTPases and GTP-binding proteins exhibit a specific binding affinity for 5′-pppG RNAs. This leads to a steric hindrance that shields 5′-pppG RNAs from RIG-I-mediated activation of the IFN response.

To test this hypothesis, we employed two RNAs: IAV-derived short RNA and Pol III-derived Y5 RNA. The short viral RNA is a derivative of 3p-hpRNA (InvivoGen), a commonly used RIG-I ligand representing the first 87 nt of the positive strand of segment 8<sup>th</sup> of the IAV PR8 strain genome. By truncating 11 nucleotides from the 3′ end, we created a 76 nt RNA that contains a blunt end panhandle structure, which is known to be an optimal RIG-I agonist and which we called short viral RNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> To see how the change of the 5′ terminal nucleotide affects Pol III transcripts, we have chosen Y5 RNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

To investigate the role of the terminal nucleotide, we replaced the initial 5′-pppA with 5′-pppG in both short viral and Y5 RNAs, while maintaining the base pairing between the 5′ and 3′-ends by creating Watson-Crick base pairs (A:U and G:C) for the initial 5′-pppA or 5′-pppG (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>).

The induction of type I Interferon was found to be dependent on the concentration of RNA. Epithelial lung A549 cells exhibited greater sensitivity to RNA compared to epithelial kidney HEK293 cells. In A549 cells, the type I Interferon response was detectable upon transfection with the 5′-pppA variants of the viral RNA starting from a concentration as low as 0.3 ng/ml, whereas in HEK293 cells, it was only registered when the RNA concentration reached 1 ng/ml. For the 5′-pppG variant of the viral RNAs type I Interferon response induction was detected starting from 30 ng/ml in both cell lines. At higher RNA concentrations (1 µg/ml), no significant difference was observed between the 5′-pppA and 5′-pppG variants.

Thus, we hypothesized that the activity of some of the identified proteins could lead to dephosphorylation of 5′-pppG RNAs making them unable to stimulate RIG-I/IFN pathway or creating RNAs vulnerable to RNA degradation processes. To examine whether proteins enriched in the 5′-pppG RNAs pull-downs could act on them as GTPases, we investigated the phosphorylation state of RNAs after transfection. Total RNA isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with 5′-pppA or 5′-pppG short viral RNAs was treated with the 5′-3′ exoribonuclease 1 (XRN-1) enzyme, known for its specificity in degrading monophosphorylated RNAs (5′-p). To assess the effectiveness of the XRN-1 enzyme, we applied a positive control treatment, in which XRN-1 treatment was combined with the RNA 5′-Pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) enzyme, which transforms all triphosphorylated (5′-ppp) RNAs into the monophosphorylated (5′-p) RNAs. Using qRT-PCR, we observed no significant difference in RNA abundance between both 5′-pppA and 5′-pppG variants, either in control condition or upon XRN-1 treatment. This indicates that the transfected 5′-pppA or 5′-pppG RNAs remain in the triphosphorylated state in the cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

This approach aimed to occupy the GTP binding pockets, thereby impeding the GTP binding proteins interaction with 5′-pppG RNAs. Indeed, supplementation with GTP analogs led to a complete blockade of NUDT16, RAN, RANBP1, and EEF1A2 binding to RNAs. In contrast, the binding of reference proteins DHX9 and TRIM25 to RNAs remained unaffected, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

Upon guanosine supplementation, both 5′-pppG short viral RNA and the 5′-pppG-containing control 3p-hpRNA significantly enhanced IFN production compared to the control or adenosine treatment (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, the stimulation of IFN production by 5′-pppA short viral RNA was largely unaffected by the supplementation of nucleosides.
