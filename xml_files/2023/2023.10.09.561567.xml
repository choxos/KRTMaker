Here, we find that the <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> genome contains 3 HpARI family members, and that these have different effects on IL-33-dependent responses in vitro and in vivo, with HpARI1+2 suppressing, and HpARI3 amplifying these responses. All HpARIs have sub-nanomolar affinity for mouse IL-33, however HpARI3 does not block IL-33-ST2 interactions. Instead, HpARI3 stabilises IL-33, increasing the half-life of the cytokine and amplifying responses to it in vivo.

The relationship between parasites and their hosts reflects co-evolutìonary adaptation to host protective immune mechanisms which results in parasites’ long persistence in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Excretory-secretory (ES) products released from helminths contain a wide range of molecules which can modulate the host immune system, suppressing anti-parasitic immune responses and hence promote parasite survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The murine intestinal parasite <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic> (<italic>Hpb</italic>) is a prime example of this host-parasite dynamic. <italic>Hpb</italic> secretions contain the Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) and Binds Alarmin Receptor and Inhibits (HpBARI), both of which block the IL-33 pathway and suppress type 2 immune responses in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). <italic>Hpb</italic> infects mice when larvae are ingested. These larvae rapidly penetrate the epithelium of the duodenum, and develop to adults which emerge into the gut lumen at around day 10 of infection, living for weeks as sexually mature adults in the small intestine. The early phases of infection are associated with damage to the intestinal epithelium as it is penetrated by migrating infective larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">IL-33 is an IL-1 family alarmin cytokine which is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells, where it is stored in cellular nuclei and released under conditions of damage and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Upon release, the active mature cytokine is rapidly oxidised, rendering it unable to bind to its receptor ST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), limiting its ST2-dependent activity in vivo to the local milieu and to a short period of time after release. IL-33 acts as an initiator of allergic diseases, especially asthma where both IL-33 and ST2 are genetically linked to asthma heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and are targets for new biologic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). IL-33 also plays a significant role in parasite expulsion, with deficiency or blockade of the IL-33 pathway resulting in increased parasite burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In our previous work we identified HpARI, showing that it binds IL-33 and blocks type 2 immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and used structural studies to demonstrate how this IL-33-ST2 inhibition is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Here, we show that the <italic>Hpb</italic> genome encodes a family of three HpARI proteins: HpARI1, HpARI2 and HpARI3, with the original HpARI now renamed as HpARI2. We expressed and tested these proteins for their activity in vitro and in vivo, and unexpectedly found that HpARI3 enhances rather than suppresses IL-33 responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p id="P5">The excretory/secretory products of <italic>Hpb</italic> (HES) was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and a 2 μg sample was used for mass spectrometry analysis. Triethylammonium bicarbonate (Sigma) and dithiothreitol (Merck Millipore) were added to final concentrations of 100 mM and 10 mM, respectively, and sample incubated at 70°C for 10 min. Alkylation was carried out by addition of 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Sample was incubated overnight in the presence of 50 mM dithiothreitol and 200 ng trypsin was added, and incubated overnight at 37°C. Trifluoracetic acid (Fisher Scientific) at 10% sample volume was added, C18 clean-up was carried out using an Empore-C18 (Agilent) solid phase extraction cartridge, and dried samples resuspended in 1% Formic acid (Fisher Chemical).</p><p id="P6">Analysis of peptide readout was performed on a Q Exactive™ plus Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific). Liquid chromatography buffers used were: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v). An equivalent of 1.0 μg of peptides from each sample were loaded at 10 μL/min onto a μPAC trapping C18 column (Pharmafluidics). The trapping column was washed for 6 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA and then switched in-line with a Pharma Fluidics, 200 cm, μPAC nanoLC C18 column. The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 300 nl/min for 30 min. The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient from 2% buffer B to 5.0% buffer B in 5 min, from 5.0% B to 35% buffer B in 125 min, and from 35% to 98% in 2 minutes. The column was then washed at 98% buffer B for 20 min and then washed at 2% buffer B for 20 minutes. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant temperature of 50°C.</p><p id="P7">Q-exactive plus was operated positive ionization mode using an easy spray source. The source voltage was set to 2.90 kV and the capillary temperature was 275°C.

All SPR experiments were carried out using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) using a CAP chip (Biotin CAPture kit (Cytìva)) in an SPR buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 0.05% Tween-20. Purified mIL-33 was equilibrated in the SPR buffer using a PD-5 column prior to the experiment. The sensor surface was first coated with oligonucleotide coupled streptavidin following manufacturer’s instructions. Individual biotinylated HpARI variants were captured on different flow cells followed by individual injections of 2-fold concentraYon series of mIL-33 (50 nM to 0.195 nM for HpARI1 and HpARI2 and 200 nM to 0.781 nM for HpARI3) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, with 400 s association time and 1000 s dissociation time. After each injection, the sensor chip surface was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 6M guanidium-HCl and 1M NaOH pH 11.0 mixed in a 4:1 ratio.

Homology searching of published <italic>Hpb</italic> transcriptomic and genomic data via Wormbase ParaSite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) identified a family of 3 HpARI genes from <italic>Hpb,</italic> all of which have the same characteristic domain organisation of a secretory signal peptide followed by 3 Complement Control Protein (CCP) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Proteomic analysis of <italic>Hpb</italic> excretory/secretory products (HES) showed that the most abundant HpARI family member was HPOL_0002204701 (Intensity = 9x10<sup>9</sup>), and so was named HpARI1, while the previously-identified “HpARI” protein, HPBE_0000813301 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), was renamed as HpARI2 (Intensity = 1x10<sup>9</sup>), and the final homologue with lowest intensity in HES, HPBE_0002531401, was renamed HpARI3 (Intensity = 4x10<sup>7</sup>). Further analysis of a recent transcriptomic study of <italic>Hpb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) showed that while HpARI1 and HpARI3 are expressed at a fairly consistent level throughout the lifecycle (albeit with HpARI3 at a far lower level compared to HpARI1), the expression of HpARI2 peaks early in infection (during the tissue-dwelling phase), with similar trends in males and females for each HpARI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The 3 HpARI family members show a high level of sequence similarity (69-81% identity between the 3 HpARIs), however the HpARI3 sequence contains a notable 3 amino acid deletion (at E94_R96 in HpARI2 sequence) at the N-terminal end of CCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), a region which contains an HpARI2-IL-33 interaction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The HpARI family members all bind IL-33 with sub-nanomolar affinities</title><p id="P18">The 3 HpARI family members were expressed in mammalian cells and purified for further tesYng.

In this assay, all 3 proteins could suppress the IL-33 signal in a dose dependent manner, indicating that they compete for IL-33 binding with the ELISA antibodies used for detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). HpARI3 required an approximately 8-fold higher concentration for IL-33 suppression (IC50 of HpARI1 and HpARI2 ~8x10<sup>-10</sup> M, HpARI3 ~6x10<sup>-9</sup> M). When binding affinity for IL-33 was tested by surface plasmon resonance, HpARI3 was likewise shown to have a lower affinity for IL-33, albeit still with a subnanomolar K<sub>D</sub>: HpARI1/2 have K<sub>D</sub> around 4x10<sup>-11</sup> M, while HpARI3 has a K<sub>D</sub> of 4x10<sup>-10</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>HpARI family show differing effects on IL-33-dependent responses in vivo</title><p id="P19">To test how each HpARI affected IL-33-dependent responses, we coadministered them intranasally to BALB/c mice with Alternaria allergen (a highly IL-33-dependent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)), and assessed type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) and eosinophil responses 24 h later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). HpARI2 potently suppressed BAL and lung eosinophilia, ILC2 responses and IL-5 release, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), while HpARI1 had a similar, albeit slightly blunted, suppressive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-G</xref>). Surprisingly, HpARI3 had the opposite effect, amplifying responses in this model, with significantly increased lung eosinophilia and ILC2 activation (CD25 upregulation and increased cell size measured by FSC) as well as total IL-5 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-G</xref>). These increased responses in the presence of HpARI3 are remarkably similar to that seen with a truncation of HpARI2 lacking the CCP3 domain (HpARI_CCP1/2), which also amplifies IL-33 responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).

We first confirmed the formation of a complex of ST2 and IL-33 as the two proteins comigrated as a higher molecular weight complex when compared with individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) the elution profile of ST2 was unaltered in presence of HpARI2:mIL33 complex, showing that HpARI2 prevents IL-33 from binding to ST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, HpARI3 did not prevent IL-33 from binding to ST2 as indicated by elution peak shift in which ST2, IL-33 and HpARI3 co-elute, showing the formation of a complex containing all three components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to HpARI2, HpARI3 interacts with IL-33 in a manner which does not prevent IL-33-ST2 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>HpARI3 stabilises IL-33</title><p id="P21">As HpARI3 cannot block IL-33-ST2 interactions, and instead amplified responses in an IL-33-dependent model, we hypothesised that HpARI3 binding to IL-33 may stabilise the cytokine, extending its half-life. To test this, we used an in vitro IL-33 release and inactivation assay which we developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In this assay, CMT-64 cells are freeze-thawed to induce necrosis, and released IL-33 is incubated at 37°C for between 15 min and 48 h after release, to allow inactivation of the cytokine. Supernatants are subsequently applied to naïve IL-13eGFP murine bone marrow cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7 to support ILC2 differentiation, and ILC2 activation was assessed by flow cytometry for activation markers (IL-13eGFP and CD25 upregulation) and ELISA for secretion of IL-5 and IL-13. In medium control wells, CMT-64 freeze-thaw supernatants could only induce significant IL-5 and IL-13 production when applied within 6 h of thaw, indicating inactivation of IL-33 at later points of this timecourse, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Conversely, CMT-64 cells freeze-thawed in the presence of HpARI2 could not induce any ILC2 activation, due to blockade of released IL-33. In the presence of HpARI3 however, IL-33 in supernatants was able to stimulate high levels of IL-5 and IL-13 release and ILC2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-E</xref>), indicating strong IL-33 responses which were not inactivated even after incubation of IL-33-containing CMT-64 supernatants for 48 h at 37°C.</p><p id="P22">Finally, to determine whether the effects of HpARI2 and HpARI3 could compete in combination, we added each HpARI at 1, 10 or 100 ng/ml to the assay described above, and measured released IL-5. While sole HpARI3 treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in IL-5 release, HpARI2 caused a decrease, as expected. In combination, equivalent concentrations of each HpARI showed no significant change compared to medium-only control, while an excess of HpARI2 significantly suppressed responses, and an excess of HpARI3 significantly enhanced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Therefore, the suppression or enhancement of IL-33 responses in vivo by HpARI2 or HpARI3 will depend on the predominance of each molecule in the local milieu.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we describe a family of 3 HpARI proteins, with high sequence similarity but differing effects on responses to IL-33. While HpARI1 and HpARI2 suppress responses to IL-33, HpARI3 lacked the ability prevent IL-33 from binding to ST2 and instead stabilised this highly labile cytokine in its active form, resulting in amplification of responses to IL-33 in in vivo and in vitro models.</p><p id="P24">The IL-33 activity-amplifying ability of HpARI3 was unexpected, and would seem counterintuitive as total ST2-deficient mice are more susceptible to <italic>Hpb</italic> infecYon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), implying the IL-33 pathway is largely helminth-toxic. However, additionally to the well-described type 2 immunity-inducing effects of IL-33, recent publicaYons have described a range of effects of IL-33 which can suppress type 2 immunity. IL-33 can activate and expand Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), and in helminth infection deletion of IL-33 in myeloid cells results in a defective regulatory T cell response, increased type 2 immunity, and accelerated helminth ejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Furthermore, IL-33 can activate natural killer cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), Th1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and CD8+ T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) IFN-g production, potentially suppressing type 2 immunity. As both Th1/CD8+ IFN-g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) responses have been demonstrated to control type 2 immunity in <italic>Hpb</italic> infecYon, either of these pathways could be the target of HpARI3 responses.</p><p id="P25">Although HpARI3 expression was maintained at a lower level than that of HpARI1 or HpARI2, all 3 HpARI proteins were detectable in HES. As HpARI2 and HpARI3 can compete in in vitro cultures, we hypothesise that differential timing or localisaYon of HpARI protein release could determine the local HpARI2 / HpARI3 ratio, and therefore the resulting response to IL-33 during infection. IL-33’s inflammatory versus immunosuppressive effects are partially controlled by context of release: when IL-33 was deleted in epithelial cells, type 2 immunity and parasite ejection was deficient, while when IL-33 was deleted in myeloid cells, regulatory T cell responses were reduced, resulting in increased type 2 immunity and acerated parasite ejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). It would therefore be most advantageous for the parasite to block IL-33 in the local environment of the parasite during the early tissue-dwelling phase of infection (where necrotic damage to the epithelium is most likely), while IL-33 enhancement in the draining lymph node could amplify Th2-suppressive IFN-g and regulatory T cell responses. Further work is required to investigate the roles of this family of immunomodulatory proteins during active infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by awards to HJM from LONGFONDS|Accelerate as part of the AWWA project, the Medical Research Council (MR/S000593/1) and Wellcome 221914/Z/20/Z.
