To examine the potential for ivermectin to be repurposed as an antiviral agent, we therefore undertook a series of preclinical studies. Consistent with early reports, ivermectin decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in <italic>in vitro</italic> models at low micromolar concentrations, five- to ten-fold higher than the reported toxic clinical concentration. At similar concentrations, ivermectin also decreased cell viability and increased biomarkers of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic and profiling studies revealed that ivermectin nonspecifically perturbs membrane bilayers at the same concentrations where it decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, resulting in nonspecific modulation of membrane-based targets such as G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. These results suggest that a primary molecular mechanism for the <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity of ivermectin may be nonspecific membrane perturbation, indicating that ivermectin is unlikely to be translatable into a safe and effective antiviral agent. These results and experimental workflow provide a useful paradigm for performing preclinical studies on (pandemic-related) drug repurposing candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS190147-f006"/></fig>

Importantly, IVM does not appear to cross the plasma membrane and binds to these classical targets at <italic>low nanomolar</italic> concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> IVM also alters the function of other transmembrane targets including the farnesoid X receptor, the human <italic>ether-`a-go-go-related</italic> gene (“hERG”) potassium channel, and G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">It is important to consider the natural history of IVM as a reported antiviral agent. IVM was originally proposed as an antiviral agent based on a biochemical (cell-free) AlphaScreen to identify small-molecule nuclear import inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> In that report, the target was the HIV integrase (a nuclear localization signal, NLS) and mouse importin α-β1 protein-protein interaction. Years later, in the early phases of the Covid-19 pandemic, IVM was reported to have antiviral activity at low micromolar concentrations by decreasing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Vero/hSLAM cells without any reported cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Follow-up biophysical studies at high micromolar concentrations (~25 to 100 μM) demonstrated that IVM could disrupt its purported antiviral target, the host importin α/β1 heterodimer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> These results, however, should be interpreted in the context that the estimated comatose/fatal plasma concentration of IVM (total drug) is about 100 nM and that the solubility limit for IVM is 1 to 2 μM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Moreover, in <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> muscle cells, IVM is primarily localized to the <italic>outer</italic> leaflet of the plasma membrane and is not found in organellar membranes, suggesting it has relatively low intracellular concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Along with its effect on SARS-CoV-2, IVM was reported to have antiviral activity against numerous related and unrelated viruses generally at low micromolar concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">We evaluated the reported SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of IVM in preclinical studies including live-virus assays, cellular health profiling, counter-screens for assay interferences, and target selectivity. Whereas IVM showed antiviral activity at low micromolar concentrations, in agreement with original reports, this activity closely paralleled multiple biomarkers of cellular injury. IVM was likewise found to perturb membrane bilayers at low micromolar concentrations, where it can nonspecifically modulate membrane-based targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These data provide a molecular mechanism to explain the observed lack of translatability of IVM as a SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic and provide important caveats regarding drug repurposing.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P6">IVM was tested for antiviral activity in a live-virus assay in A549-ACE2 cells using SARS-CoV-2 labelled with an FLuc reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Three independent samples of IVM (<bold>1a</bold>-<bold>c</bold>) showed similar antiviral activity after 48 h compound treatment in this FLuc-based viral assay (mean half-maximal effective concentration, or IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.8 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the reported low micromolar aqueous solubility of IVM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, all IVM concentrations reported in this study are nominal concentrations (total added amount per volume). This activity occurred at similar IVM concentrations in a toxicity counter-screen measuring host cellular ATP content (CellTiter-Glo; mean half-maximal cytotoxic concentration, or CC<sub>50</sub> = 10.8 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Remdesivir (<bold>16</bold>), an FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor used as a positive control, decreased viral burden without gross decreases in cellular viability (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.3 μM, CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The low micromolar antiviral potency and the lack of accompanying cytotoxicity of remdesivir is generally consistent with previous reports in Vero E6 cells and A549-ACE2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, though other reports have also shown higher nanomolar potencies, which may be attributable to differences in cell lines, SARS-CoV-2 strains, and/or assay formats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">A collection of commercially available IVM analogs was also assessed for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity using the aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 FLuc assay and CTG counter-screen, to search for an interpretable structure-activity relationship (SAR). The presence of strong SAR is generally supportive of specific compound-target interactions, and of a compound being readily optimizable by medicinal chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> The IVM analogs <bold>2</bold>-<bold>15</bold> compromised aglycone and monosaccharide forms, isomers, epimers, and analogs with minor structural modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analogs <bold>2</bold>-<bold>15</bold> decreased viral content at a similar low micromolar concentration range as the parent compound IVM, demonstrating a flat SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to the antiviral assay, IVM and analogs displayed SAR spanning approximately three orders of magnitude in a quantitative HTS <italic>C. elegans</italic> assay for nematode viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C, 1D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Like IVM, the antiviral activity of analogs <bold>2</bold>-<bold>15</bold> occurred at the same concentrations where A549-ACE2 cellular viability was reduced in the CTG counter-screen, again with a relatively flat SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Of note, there is extensive SAR spanning multiple orders of magnitude for the antiparasitic activity of IVM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). The flat SAR pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> would argue against the antiviral and related host cell cytotoxic activities being readily optimizable by medicinal chemistry.</p><p id="P8">IVM was also tested for antiviral activity in an orthogonal high-content assay quantifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells. Similar to the SARS-CoV-2 FLuc assay, IVM (<bold>1a</bold>) showed antiviral activity at low micromolar concentrations after 48 h compound treatment, though IVM did not decrease in the number of detected nuclei (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.4 μM, CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Nuclear counts, however, may not reflect cellular viability, as Hoechst 33342 and other nuclear staining reagents are capable of binding DNA in both viable and dying/dead cells when cells are fixed and permeabilized. The positive control remdesivir decreased viral burden with little effect on cellular viability (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.8 μM, CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that IVM can reliably decrease SARS-CoV-2 content at low micromolar concentrations, though the concentration-response curve for its antiviral activity overlaps with that for cellular injury, meaning that the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 content may be a consequence of events induced from cell trauma.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cellular health profiling</title><p id="P9">IVM was profiled in multiple assays at multiple time points across a broad range of concentrations for its effects on cellular viability under conditions mimicking the primary SARS-CoV-2 FLuc viral assay in A549-ACE2 cells. IVM decreased cellular viability at low micromolar concentrations, as measured by ATP content (CC<sub>50</sub> = 7.7 μM), cellular reducing capacity with a resazurin substrate (CC<sub>50</sub> = 8.4 μM), and cellular reducing capacity with a luciferase pro-substrate (CC<sub>50</sub> = 5.1 μM) after 24 h compound treatment. These decreases in cellular viability by IVM were time- and concentration-dependent, with significant cellular injury occurring between 24 and 72 h, as observed with all three methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Cellular viability readouts can decrease due to decreases in cellular health and/or decreases in cellular proliferation rates, the cytotoxicity of IVM therefore was also profiled in A549-ACE2 cells, where IVM induced significant (i.e., &gt; 3 SD above baseline) cytotoxicity at low micromolar concentrations (7.8 μM), as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and an orthogonal membrane-impermeable nuclear-binding dye method (CellTox Green). The observed cytotoxicity of IVM was again time- and concentration-dependent, with significant cytotoxicity being observed as early as 6 h, and was similar with both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The cytotoxic (non-apoptotic) readout generally peaked before 48 h treatment, with decreased readouts at 72 h, likely due to decreased cellular content.</p><p id="P11">IVM was similarly profiled for pro-apoptotic effects in A549-ACE2 cells. Treatment with IVM produces massive (&gt; 3 SD above baseline) activation of caspase 3/7 beginning at low micromolar concentrations (7.8 μM) within 6 h. Treatment with IVM also produced significant (&gt; 3 SD above baseline) increases in annexin V binding, an orthogonal pro-apoptotic biomarker, beginning at low micromolar concentrations (7.8 μM) within 12 h. These pro-apoptotic effects were also time- and concentration-dependent and similar with both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared to cytotoxicity, the apoptotic biomarkers generally peaked within 24 h treatment; the decreased readouts at later time points likely are due to decreased cellular content.</p><p id="P12">The IVM concentrations associated with decreased cellular viability, induction of cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis biomarkers closely approximate antiviral efficacy in both the SARS-CoV-2 FLuc assay and the high-content SARS-CoV-2 assay. Staurosporine, a nonspecific kinase inhibitor used as a positive cytotoxic control, was grossly toxic at low nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, remdesivir was grossly toxic only at high micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, select membrane bilayer-modifying control compounds also decreased A549-ACE2 viability at micromolar concentrations similar to those where they exert their bilayer-modifying effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations showing a correlation between membrane bilayer-modifying properties and cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup></p><p id="P13">The effect of IVM on cellular health was also examined using publicly available datasets. IVM decreased cell counts after 72 h compound treatment in the Broad PRISM viability screen, a multiplexed cell proliferation assay using 480 different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, IVM caused cell death and inhibited cell growth at low micromolar concentrations after 48 h in the NCI60 tumor panel using 60 different cell lines tested in parallel (logLC50 = -4.5 ± 0.3, logGI50 = - 5.6 ± 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In neither dataset were these effects lineage-dependent. Furthermore, the IVM analogs eprinomectin and selamectin decreased cell counts in the Broad PRISM assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), and the IVM analogs abamectin, doramectin, emamectin, and selamectin inhibited cell growth in the NCI60 tumor panel at low micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). These previous results with IVM analogs are consistent with the cell viability counter-screens in A549-ACE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The consistent adverse effects on cellular health by IVM in multiple cell lines suggest these findings are likely applicable to other cell lines including those used in previous reports with IVM in antiviral assays (e.g., Vero cells). The similar findings with IVM analogs also suggest that the observed adverse effects are common to the IVM chemotype.</p><p id="P14">The composition of complete culture media on A549-ACE2 cell viability in the presence of IVM was also evaluated. Notably, most live virus assays use 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to enhance viral infection, whereas most cell lines are continually propagated using 5-10% FBS. The effect of IVM on cell viability was dependent on the media FBS concentration, with nearly a log-fold difference in cell viability between media containing 0% FBS and 20% FBS even after only 24 h IVM treatment (CC<sub>50</sub>, 24 h = 3.3 and 35 μM, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). This effect was observed with neither remdesivir nor staurosporine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). It is known that IVM binds avidly to plasma proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> In contrast to FBS, additional bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0 to 1 mM final BSA concentration) in culture media containing 2% FBS (v/v; estimated 7.5 μM final albumin concentration) did not have appreciable effects on A549-ACE2 cell viability for IVM, remdesivir, and staurosporine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that BSA does not function as an additional sequestering agent for IVM. These data show that the composition of complete culture media, specifically the FBS concentration, can have a significant effect on the cytotoxicity of IVM and should be considered when comparing and interpreting cellular health and antiviral effects, and is illustrative of the more widely appreciated impact of cell culture conditions phenotypic outputs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> While not investigated further, these results could be explained by growth-dependent effects (i.e., cells proliferate slower at lower FBS concentrations) and/or free-drug scavenging by lipids and proteins contained within the added FBS.</p><p id="P15">Together, these data demonstrate that IVM decreases cellular viability, induces cytotoxicity, and increases biochemical markers of apoptosis at the low micromolar concentrations, and at time points, used in SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing assays.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Assay interference counter-screens</title><p id="P16">A significant issue in drug discovery are nuisance compounds which can produce artifactual bioactivity by interference with assay technologies and/or true bioactivity by undesirable yet poorly translatable mechanisms of action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> To gain mechanistic understanding of the <italic>in vitro</italic> IVM antiviral activity, we therefore evaluated IVM using a panel of assay interference counter-screens.</p><p id="P17">The original study reporting ivermectin as an NLS-importin inhibitor used the AlphaScreen homogenous proximity assay technology against a small subset of the LOPAC collection (~400 compounds total) at a single compound concentration (10 μM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> AlphaScreen technology generates an assay signal by laser excitation of a donor bead to generate singlet oxygen, which can subsequently diffuse to a proximal acceptor bead to undergo a further series of chemical reactions that results in light emission at a lower wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> While reviewing the results of NCATS COVID-19 OpenData portal, we observed that IVM and analogs were active in both an AlphaLISA qHTS for inhibitors of the ACE2-Spike protein (unrelated to the purported NLS-importin target) and an AlphaLISA TruHits interference counter-screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> Notably, these assays did not have detergent in the assay buffer, which in Alpha-based assays, can attenuate signal quenching effects by poorly soluble compounds that form aggregates.</p><p id="P18">A series of counter-screens therefore were performed to characterize the potential for IVM to interfere with the AlphaScreen technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> At micromolar concentrations, the UV-Vis absorbance of ivermectin in PBS was inversely proportional to wavelength, a pattern consistent with limited solubility that results in light scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Substituting the importin-NLS target with a biotinylated-His6 tag in a counter-screen designed to mimic the original AlphaScreen conditions that identified IVM as an apparent inhibitor of the NLS-importin complex effectively reproduced the original concentration-response curve (CRC) of ivermectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The overlap between the concentrations at which drugs have pleiotropic effects and nonspecifically regulate structurally and functionally diverse membrane proteins and concentrations at which they alter the lipid bilayer properties suggests a common mechanism for off-target effects that is mediated by the lipid bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup></p><p id="P36">Our results are consistent with more physiologic models of coronavirus infection, which also showed a lack of efficacy in a human-airway-derived cell model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> In general, there have been mixed results in animal models assessing IVM as an anti-coronaviral agent.

Biophysical assays can also produce positive readouts at supraphysiologic concentrations, including by nonspecific protein binding. We also note that cell-based readouts can result from desirable as well as undesirable mechanisms of action (e.g., is the reduction of viral load a direct action of IVM or a consequences of poor cell health?), and are susceptible to confirmation bias when using high compound concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> The data presented here suggest that the cellular assay nuclear importin readouts may be confounded by pleiotropic effects due to off-target effects from IVM.</p><p id="P38">Our results are also consistent with emerging clinical data. Recent reports have shown a lack of clinical efficacy of IVM for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in high-quality clinical trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). There are multiple hypotheses for a lack of observed efficacy, including pharmacokinetics such as insufficient dosing or suboptimal timing in relation to disease occurrence or viral exposure. There have been proposals for alternate strategies such as IVM analogs, alternative formulations (e.g., aerosolized IVM), and alternative dosing regimens. Based on this work and the cumulative evidence to date, however, it is likely that such strategies would be ineffective and perhaps cause harm. It is possible, however, that IVM may be helpful in populations with a high incidence of helminthic diseases, where IVM in effect could decrease the incidence of comorbidities.</p><p id="P39">The use of the gramicidin assay as a surrogate for nonspecific membrane bilayer modification could become a robust frontline assay for evaluating both repurposed drugs as well as cell-active compounds identified through conventional real and virtual screening campaigns.

Fortunately, many of the preclinical tools and workflows used to evaluate IVM as an antiviral are public knowledge. Pertinent to the case of IVM, the NCATS <italic>Assay Guidance Manual</italic> contains several chapters devoted to cellular health assays, and homogenous proximity assay interferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> Unfortunately, it appears these tools are not being used to their full potential. This work underscores the need to revisit research carried out at the height of the pandemic and therefore, with a great sense of urgency but perhaps done not as rigorously as required.

It may in this context be important that the bilayer-modifying potency of a drug might be minimized without affecting its desired effects, though the flat SAR for IVM observed in the SARS-CoV-2 FLuc and CTG assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) are not encouraging for such efforts.</p><p id="P41">There are important caveats to this preclinical evaluation. First, it remains possible that under certain experimental conditions, the antiviral effect of IVM may occur at lower concentrations than it induces cellular injury. An unforgiving dependence on conditions, however, bodes poorly for translatability. Second, it is possible that IVM may disrupt the NLS-importin function as originally proposed. However, it is again unlikely to be translatable because IVM does not appear to cross plasma membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, it is not found in organellar membranes, and any disruption of NLS-importin function would likely occur at high micromolar concentrations of IVM, which would be highly unlikely to be achieved without serious toxicity and without invoking localized intracellular accumulation.</p><p id="P42">This study provides a preclinical framework for evaluating drug repurposing candidates that ideally should be performed prior to animal studies and clinical trials, or during times of urgency such as pandemics, concurrently with existing clinical trials.

Many of these studies can be accomplished in parallel by small teams in a matter of months with sufficient funding, free access to collaborators, and outsourcing to CROs.

Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) using a P-1000 puller (Sutter Instruments). Pipettes had a tip resistance of 1.5-2.5 MΩ when filled with following pipette solution (in mM): 120 CsF, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 10 TEACl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.3 (with CsOH), and 310 mOsm/kg H<sub>2</sub>O (with sucrose). Access resistance was further decreased using 70-80% series resistance compensation. Liquid-junction potentials were not corrected; capacitative current transients were electronically cancelled with the internal amplifier circuitry. A stock solution of IVM was prepared in DMSO and further diluted to the final working concentration with external bath solution prior to the experiment. Control solutions had the same amount of DMSO as the drug solutions (&lt; 0.1%). Cells were superfused using a pressurized perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments) with a 200 μm-diameter perfusion pipette positioned in close proximity of the cell. The holding potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>h</sub>) was –80 mV unless otherwise stated. Voltage-dependent inhibition of peak inward Na<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>) was determined using a 10 ms test pulse to 0 mV preceded by a 300 ms prepulse alternating between either –130 mV (V0) or the voltage of half-maximal inactivation (V<sub>½</sub> = –69 ± 3 mV) applied every 5 s. <italic>V</italic><sub>½</sub> was determined for each individual cell using the double-pulse protocol for steady-state inactivation described below. Steady-state fast inactivation (<italic>h</italic><sub>∞</sub>) was measured using a double-pulse protocol with 300 ms prepulses ranging from –130 to –30 mV in 10 mV steps, followed by 10 ms test pulses to 0 mV. Peak currents during the test pulse were normalized to the maximal current (<italic>I</italic>/<italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>, where <italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximal current that is elicited at the test potential), and plotted vs. the prepulse potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>), and fitted with a Boltzmann function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>: <disp-formula id="FD5"><mml:math id="M9"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>max</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>Z</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where z<sub>½</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>½</sub> denote the apparent gating valence and potential for half-maximal inactivation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p id="P77">No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size.

Data are mean ± SD of four intra-plate technical replicates; stippled horizontal lines at 100% denote no effect relative to DMSO control; stippled horizontal lines at 0% denotes lack of cell viability relative to digitonin control. (B) Top: IVM causes A549-ACE2 cytotoxicity at low micromolar concentrations. Cytotoxicity was assayed by two orthogonal formats: LDH release and CellTox Green. Bottom: IVM increases biochemical markers of apoptosis in A549-ACE2 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Apoptosis was assayed by caspase 3/7 activation and annexin V binding. Data are mean ± SD of four intra-plate technical replicates; LDH % release calculated relative to digitonin control at time of assay measurment; fold changes calculated realtive to DMSO control for CellToxGreen, caspase 3/7, and annexin V assays.

Left: stoppedflow fluorescence quench traces of normalized fluorescence decay over 1 s with light dots representing individual replicates (n = 9 technical replicates) and dark dots representing replicate mean. Right: representative time courses of the initial 100 ms with dots denoting individual time points and solid lines denoting exponential fits (2–100 ms). (B) GFA concentration-response curves demonstrate IVM significantly perturbs membrane bilayers at low micromolar concentrations. 5% EtOH, positive control. Data are mean ± SD for three biological replicates (independent LUV batches). (C) IVM induces changes in gramicidin A (gA) function. Left: representative single-channel traces recorded in a planar bilayer doped with the right-handed AgA(15) and the left-handed gA<sup>–</sup>(13) analogs, which form channels of different lengths and helix sense. Note that 3 μM IVM produces increases in channel lifetimes and a decrease in channel appearance rate. Right: representative single-channel survivor plots for gA<sup>–</sup>(13) channels (top) and AgA(15) channels (bottom) with single-exponential fits to the survivor distributions. IVM produced concentration-dependent increases in the average single-channel lifetimes (τ). Data are from one of seven independent experiments each with at least three separate measurements.

Time-course of drug wash-in showing inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium channels in neuroblastoma ND7/23 cells using an alternating two-pulse protocol. Left: representative Na<sup>+</sup> current traces from an alternating two-pulse protocol. A test pulse to 0 mV to elicit peak Na<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>) was preceded by a 300 ms prepulse to holding potentials of either V0 (-130 mV, solid lines) or V½ (dashed lines, see insert; V<sub>½</sub> = –69 ± 3 mV). Black lines, DMSO control; red lines, 10 μM IVM. IVM significantly reduced peak I<sub>Na</sub> to 0.91 ± 0.01 mV (prepulse to V0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and peak I<sub>Na</sub> to 0.78 ± 0.02 mV (prepulse to V<sub>½</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
