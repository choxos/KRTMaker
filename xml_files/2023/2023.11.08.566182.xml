Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed and demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The minor recombinant region, spanning spike (S), shows 96.5% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus NA/09. Infection has rapidly spread, infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears very frequent and sequence identities of samples from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A near cat-specific deletion in the domain 0 of S is present in &gt;90% of FIP cats. It is unclear as yet whether this deletion is directly associated with disease development and may be linked to a biotype switch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The domain 0 deletion and several amino acid changes in S, particularly the receptor binding domain, indicate potential changes to receptor binding and cell tropism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Following two epidemics, SARS-CoV (2002-4) and MERS-CoV (2012-ongoing), and a pandemic of previously unseen proportions, SARS-CoV-2 (2019 onwards), coronaviruses no longer need lengthy introductions of importance and scale. They are not only present in the human population but also in wildlife<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, companion animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and livestock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and in all species these viruses have major impacts. The innate ability of coronaviruses to recombine with other coronaviruses continues to fuel their species-switching ability. It is therefore not surprising that both human and animal coronaviruses are linked in complex transmission and evolution cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">FCoV is found across the globe. The virus exists in two biotypes with the main biotype, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), showing low virulence, and clinical signs are typically limited to mild enteritis. The second biotype of FCoV, proposed to originate each time from a mutation in an FECV-infected cat (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>), is known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a fatal disease if left untreated. Clinical signs include an abdomen swollen due to peritoneal fluid, fever, weight loss, lethargy, anorexia, dyspnea, ocular abnormalities and neurological signs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Mutations in S or the accessory genes 3abc and 7ab of FCoV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> are thought to result in changes to the virus’s tropism from cells in the enteric tract to macrophages, resulting in the different disease presentation seen with the two biotypes. This change in primary tropism also impacts the virus’s ability to transmit from cat to cat, with the main transmission pathway of FECV being fecal-oral and FIPV typically having relatively poor transmission potential. Antivirals, including remdesivir and GS-441524 have recently been successfully used to treat cats with FIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">FCoV and CCoV both belong to the <italic>Alphacoronavirus 1</italic> species alongside the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and, probably, the never fully sequenced rabbit enteric coronavirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Both FCoV and CCoV have evolved two different serotypes through complex recombination events between the two viruses with a suspected gradual evolution from CCoV-II to TGEV and the later S deletion to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Whilst recombination events between CCoV and FCoV have significantly contributed to the serotype evolution and have been frequently described, so far, none of them led to enhanced transmissibility of FIP beyond closest contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, recombination events have been reported between CCoV and TGEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, the latter has been found to recombine with the pedacoronavirus (alphacoronavirus genus) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These observations are particularly important in view of the <italic>Alphacoronavirus 1</italic>-related human infections recently observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In 2023, we alerted the veterinary field to an outbreak of FIP in Cyprus, where there had been a concerning increase in cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Cases were recorded as FIP only if they had compatible clinicopathological signs and a positive RT-qPCR for FCoV in one of the following samples; peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, fine needle aspiration biopsies, or tissue biopsies from granulomatous lesions or positive FCoV immunohistochemistry (IHC) of granulomatous lesions (IHC). RT-qPCR confirmed FIP cases had increased from three and four in 2021 and 2022, respectively, to 215 cases (186 thereof in 2023) from January 2023 to June 2024, representing more than a 50-fold increase. The outbreak emerged in January 2023 in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. By February the area of Nicosia recorded the peak number of cases in any district (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A &amp; B</xref>). The next highest number of cases was observed in Famagusta, which peaked in March, and by then the outbreak had spread to all districts of the Republic of Cyprus. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables S1-6</xref>). In June and July there was a decline in RT-qPCR confirmed cases, which coincided with a large media awareness campaign to alert veterinarians to the spread of FIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This fall in cases was likely due to most veterinarians diagnosing cases based on clinicopathological findings without performing PCR testing due to the additional financial cost. On August 3<sup>rd</sup>, the Republic of Cyprus minister’s cabinet approved the use of human coronavirus medication stocks in cats with FIP. For veterinarians to have access to this medication, amongst others, a PCR confirmation was required, reflecting the increased cases recorded during August 2023 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A &amp; B</xref>). The number of unreported cases in Cyprus remains very high, not least due to the high number of feral cats. Estimates from the Pancyprian Veterinary Association indicate approximately 10,000 cases were presented in the veterinary clinics from January 2023 until July 2023 due to clinical signs of FIP. Furthermore, in October 2023, a first imported case of FIP was confirmed in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The most common clinical form of FIP was effusive (63.72%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), followed by neurological FIP (26.05%) and the non-effusive (dry) form (10.23%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary table S3</xref>). Whilst the initial wave of infections appeared to slow down in August 2023, a second wave can be observed September 2023-March 2024 with the beginning of a third wave indicated from June 2024. The only distinctive feature of the second and third waves is a higher proportion of non-effusive forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary tables S3-S5</xref>). Possible explanations for this include: an altered immune response from the host following initial seroconversion and re-infection; that the non-effusive form takes longer to develop; or that cats presenting with the non-effusive form in the early stages of the outbreaks were not diagnosed due to their less common clinical signs.</p><p id="P7">Where peritoneal or pleural fluid was assessed by cytology, non-degenerative neutrophils admixed with macrophages and small lymphocytes were seen in a protein rich background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). 17 cases were assessed by histopathology, including intestinal mass (n=8), lymph node (n=5), and kidney (n=4). All showed similar histological features, with multifocal to coalescing, pyogranulomatous to necrotizing and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The angiocentric nature can be seen in some areas, whilst in others there is total effacement of the tissue. Immunohistology for FCoV antigen demonstrated a heavy viral load within intralesional macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">RNA samples were obtained from 163 confirmed FIP cases between 2021 and November 2023, representing a mixture of geographic origin, sex, and clinical presentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables S7-S12</xref>). There are inherent problems with obtaining sufficient read-depth with Illumina sequencing on FIPV RNA samples. Therefore, we opted for cDNA/PCR-amplification-based Nanopore sequencing to better understand the Cypriot outbreak and to determine if cat-to-cat transmission is occurring. An initial crude approach based on alignments of reposited FCoV-1 and FCoV-2 sequences yielded a mixed consensus sequence for the Cypriot outbreak strain, FCoV-23. The consensus was used to design a new primer scheme for targeted amplification of FCoV-23 for Oxford Nanopore-based sequencing. This yielded a total of 19 full-length genomes, 45 partial sequences spanning a section of orf1b (~1,000 bp), 63 spanning the first part of S (~2,250 bp), and 42 spanning ORFs 3c/E(4)/M(5) (~1,000 bp). These include samples from two cats presenting with FIP following recent import from Cyprus to the UK. Other samples were degraded or contained too few viral copies. None of the seven samples from before 2023 amplified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables S13-S18</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The partial S region sequence of the Cypriot/UK FCoV samples produced two distinct versions of the S sequence. BLAST was used to identify close relatives of these S sequences. The first S sequence is most closely related to an FCoV-1 (MT444152) with 79% similarity, which occurred in one Cypriot and one UK-import sample. The others are almost entirely CCoV-2 S, flanked by FCoV-1 sequence. The CCoV-2 sequence is most closely related to the NA/09 strain (JF682842), a hypervirulent pantropic canine coronavirus (pCCoV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, at 96.5% sequence identity. As shown by maximum likelihood analysis the S sequence is also closely related to other pCCoV S sequences with only partial S sequences available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1-S2</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of samples contained a deletion at the N-terminus of S, which is analyzed in more detail below. Except for the two samples highlighted above, all samples, including one UK-import case, align most closely with a pCCoV S. This is likely a defining feature of the virus circulating in the outbreak in Cyprus. In contrast, maximum likelihood trees of regions of ORF1b and ORF3c/E/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S3-S4</xref>) show clustering of all sequences with FCoV-1. Whilst there appears to be more diversity in ORF1b, one must also consider the scale of the different trees.</p><p id="P10">A recombination analysis was carried out comparing the FCoV-23 genome using representative full-length sequence 2-C11 Re 10276 with FCoV-1, FCoV-2 and CCoV-2 strain CB/05, since NA/09 is not available as a complete genome. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> visualizes the Bootscan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> analysis, the RDP5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> analysis and the pairwise distances between the sequences. Significant p-values supporting the recombination were reported by multiple methods as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S19</xref>. The MaxChi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> breakpoint matrix is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>. The recombination is very clear and includes a small region of the ORF1b gene and the majority of S with breakpoints around location 18,420 and 23,880. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the historical break points between FCoV-1 and CCoV-2 that created FCoV-2 alongside the recombination identified in FCoV-23.</p><p id="P11"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> furthermore shows a neighbor joining tree for FCoV-23 along with other members of <italic>Alphacoronavirus 1</italic> and a distantly related Canine Respiratory Coronavirus as an outgroup. The assembled genome clusters with representatives of FCoV-1, similar to the clustering of the amplicons outside of S.</p><p id="P12">The main determinant in disease development and transmission of FCoV-23 appears to be the S recombination. One of the main suggested determinants of biotype changes, the furin cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/S2 interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> is absent in FCoV-2 and also FCoV-23. An interesting observation, however, is that the majority of samples (&gt;90%) show a deletion in domain 0 (ΔD0), strongly resembling the deletion observed in TGEV and PRCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, whilst the rest of the genome of FCoV-23 is highly conserved, the domain 0 deletion appears to be almost cat-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This indicates that this mutation occurs in host rather than being transmitted. However, the only two fecal samples (also affected by sampling bias; &lt;6% of our samples are feces-derived) where sequences could be obtained show ΔD0. An in-host mutation further begs the question of whether ΔD0 is associated with disease development. Unfortunately, all our samples so far are from symptomatic, confirmed FIPV cases and further investigation is required to answer this question.</p><p id="P13">In other coronaviruses, including TGEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and CCoV-HuPn-2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, domain 0 was shown to bind sialosides. Modelling the structure of S against the closely related, experimentally confirmed CCoV-HuPn-2018 S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> shows a much more compact conformation for ΔD0 S and similarity to a structural prediction based on a “swung-out” or a “proximal” confirmation template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). A number of amino acid changes were observed between “classical” FECV-2 and FIPV-2 S. In particular domains A, B, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) show a number of class-changing amino acid changes distinct from FCoV-2 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Modelling the RBD changes against the structure highlights changes at positions 546 and 595, as well as 556, 603, and 636 as being potentially strongly influential to receptor binding properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Previously indicated key proteins for biotype switch S, Orf3abc and 7b were compared to the recently published computational analysis of mutations observed in FECV versus FIPV by Zehr <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The suggested key determinant of FIPV in the FCoV-2 S, position 1404, shows a new amino acid, leucine instead of valine, in FCoV-23. However, this section of spike is derived from FCoV-1. It is therefore unclear how this recombination may impact overall functionality in the context of the rest of S being FCoV-2-like. Other positions in S show a mixture of FIPV versus FECV tendencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S23</xref>). Whilst a new mutation was identified in Orf3a and b, no specific indications of pathogenesis could be determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S24</xref>). Similarly, in Orf7b, two new mutations but no indication of pathogenesis could be identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S25</xref>).</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Recombination within the <italic>Alphacoronavirus 1</italic> species has been frequently observed previously and has even given rise to the FCoV-2 serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) in cats. Even complex recombination between FCoV-1 and CCoV has previously been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, in this work, we have identified a new subtype of FCoV that has recombined with a hypervirulent strain of pCCoV. The recombinant, which we propose naming FCoV-23, shows clearly distinct properties from previously observed FCoV infections. The sequence similarity found between FCoV-23 and CCoVII is higher than would be expected without an additional, recent recombination event.</p><p id="P15">Our data suggest that there is direct transmission of FCoV-23 between cats based on high sequence identity (&gt;99.17% genome-scale including varying S-deletion length, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figures S9 &amp; S10</xref>), high viral loads (RT-qPCR only) in feces, as well as the wave-like movement of disease across the island. However, it is unclear whether this virus still needs a biotype change to result in FIP. A potential reason for differences in pathogenicity may be the acquiring of a deletion of S domain 0. This is observed in &gt;90% of FIP cases studied here and in a near host-specific pattern. More work is needed to assess the properties of ΔD0 S, as well as investigation into asymptomatic carriers. Whilst alphacoronaviruses show great cross-neutralizing activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, the onset of FIP appears rapid and shows little discrimination in age of the infected cats highlighting that FCoV-23 is able to circumnavigate preexisting immunity. If a biotype change is required, it clearly happens far more frequently in FCoV-23 than any of the previously observed FCoV infections. We therefore must study FCoV-23 to gain further understanding of the FECV/FIPV change. The scale of this FIP outbreak has not been observed previously. Concerningly, Cyprus has a high population of unowned cats that are frequently relocated to other parts of Europe, and the wider world. The risk of spreading this outbreak is significant as evidenced by the first confirmed UK case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">CCoV infections in dogs are typically self-limiting, producing mild enteritis or presenting asymptomatically. Previous work on the FCoV-23 close relative strain, CCoV NA/09 and CB/05, found that the virus was hypervirulent and infected a range of organs in canine hosts. CCoV typically infects cells of the enteric tract, but pCCoVs were shown to spread to a range of internal organs, including intestine, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, brain, and even T and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. CB/05 has also been identified as responsible for small outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">The clinical signs of FCoV-23 are similar to those observed in classical FIP cases. However, FIP infection itself already shows a strong pantropism, affecting many organs in infected cats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. What is remarkable is the high number of FCoV-23 positive cells observed in immunohistochemistry samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is indicative of high viral loads, but must be validated through quantification. Furthermore, a relatively high percent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) of confirmed cases in Cyprus was presented with neurological signs (26%), which is almost double of what would be expected with classical FIP (14%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This may be due to increased awareness of presentation or be inherent to FCoV-23 neurotropism; however, further investigation is required.</p><p id="P18">Significant changes to the S protein in FCoV-23 may provide some clues as to the enhanced pathogenicity of this virus. FCoV-23, like other FCoV-2s and CCoV-2, does not contain an FCS at the S1/S2, and the related virus CCoV-HuPn-2018 was experimentally found to be uncleaved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Uncleaved S has been shown to be more stable than cleaved and could enhance fecal shedding and stability in the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Conversely, the cleavage at S1/S2 may facilitate the movement of the N-terminal domains and allow the RBD to adopt the receptor-binding-competent form. However, the deletion of domain 0 may compensate for the increased rigidity. Whilst a similar deletion between TGEV and PRCV was initially indicated as the determinant between a primarily enteric and primarily respiratory tropism, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, a recent study shows a different result <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Sialoside binding is an important feature of coronavirus infections and may contribute to intracellular spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. It is then all the more surprising that FCoV-23 loses the sialoside-binding domain 0. However, whilst binding to sialosides can enhance virus attachment and entry into host cells, binding to sugars can lead to increased retention of virus on producer cells. Whilst some viruses, like influenza, solve this issue by encoding their own sugar-cleaving enzyme, neuraminidase, coronaviruses must find a balance through modifying glycoprotein binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Losing domain 0 could therefore be a trade-off to enhance virus release. This may be compensated by the earlier discussed enhanced flexibility of S and increased binding efficiency at the RBD through mutation. These are manifold in the FCoV-23 pCCoV recombinant and in particular mutations at position 546 (already possibly associated with FIP) and 595 are likely to have a strong impact on aminopeptidase N receptor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Recombination between FCoV-1 and pCCoVs is not surprising in that i) such recombinations have been observed before, and ii) pCCoVs have evolved in Greece and south eastern Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, the emergence of pCCoV in Greece happened over 1 years ago so the question as to why this happened now is unclear. One possible explanation is the “right mutation, right time, right place” theory. Recombination between feline and canine coronaviruses happen frequently but as previous reports show, they rarely spread. Introduction of a more successful, spreading variant to a dense population, like the cats in Cyprus, may be sufficient to allow this virus to cause an outbreak. However, the acquisition of a likely in-host deletion adds a further level of concern to coronavirus evolution. These viruses already show a mutation rate, similar to influenza viruses (despite proofreading)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, high prevalence for recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, and here we could show that they are able to acquire significant in-host INDELs that may completely change their cell binding properties and tropism.</p><p id="P20">This paper reports the emergence of a new <italic>alphacoronavirus 1</italic> feline/canine coronavirus that shows high spreading potential with the associated pathology of lethal FIP if left untreated. Further investigations into the properties of this new virus are now essential. Whilst antivirals, including GS-441524 and molnupiravir were successfully used to treat many cats affected by FCoV-23, early treatment is essential but associated costs can be prohibitive. Prevention of spread and the development of new vaccines are important to stop this epizootic virus from spreading beyond Cyprus.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Enrolment of FIP cases in Cyprus</title><p id="P21">The electronic records of Vet Dia Gnosis Ltd in Limassol, Cyprus (at present, the only Veterinary diagnostics lab on the island), were searched for any positive FCoV RT-PCR or IHC cases from September 2021 up to June 2024.

FCoVs are thought to have recombined with CCoV-2 to form FCoV-2. FCoV-2/CCoV-2 recombinations have shown to have different recombination points as highlighted by the different colorations (reviewed in 23). The Cypriot FCoV strain, termed FCoV-23, is a recombinant between an FCoV-1 strain and a S recombination with a pantropic CCoV-2, pCCoV.

Significant amino acid changes as identified in A) are highlighted with side-chains in blue for variations to FCoVIIs distant from the RBD, red for variations close to the RBD, orange for the variation at aa546 similar to FIPV-2, and olive for the variation differing both from FCoVII and pCCoV. A comparison showing a confidence model of the FCoV-23 RBD structure prediction paired with the CCoV-HuPN-2018-canine aminopeptidase N (APN) is shown for orientation and binding visualization in the top right corner.
