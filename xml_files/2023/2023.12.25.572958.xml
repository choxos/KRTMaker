It also offers a divergent eukaryote model to understand the evolution of sex. Through a panel of genetic screens, where each sex of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> was mutagenised separately with barcoded vectors, we identify 401 sex and transmission-related gene functions and define roles for hundreds of unstudied fertility genes as putative targets for transmission blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis and the axoneme. We identify a protein complex of a SUN domain protein, SUN1, and a moonlighting putative allantoicase, ALLC1, that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organising centre to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data point to an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in fertility. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission but also highlight ancestral aspects of sex that have evolved close to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic> fertility</kwd><kwd>genome-scale knockout screen</kwd><kwd>microgamete</kwd><kwd>microgamete motility</kwd><kwd>male fertility</kwd><kwd>SUN domain protein</kwd><kwd>ultra-structure expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>spermiogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The ancestral eukaryote introduced a significant innovation in genetic recombination through sexual reproduction. Sex evolved in the context of a life cycle alternating between haploid and diploid phases, in which flagellated haploid cells differentiate into gametes, which subsequently fuse to create a diploid zygote undergoing meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing sexual reproduction primarily stems from research in model organisms. For instance, the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reproduces asexually as diploids but can undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes under stress. Genetic screens in this organism have identified the genes essential for meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In multicellular model species where sexual reproduction is obligatory, studying fertility encounters challenges, especially when sterile mutants are difficult to propagate. Consequently, limited genome-scale fertility studies are available for such organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While saturated collections of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutants have enabled the identification of mutants affecting sexual processes, intricate and labour-intensive screens are necessary to distinguish between fertilisation and gametophyte developmental phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a collection of sterile mutants has been utilised to explore meiosis and gamete development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, these studies are limited to a small portion of the eukaryotic tree of life, specifically the Opisthokonta and Chloroplastida clades, accounting for only a fraction of eukaryotic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, malaria parasites, belonging to the alveolates, represent a divergent clade that, along with stramenopiles and Rhizaria, comprises nearly half of all eukaryotic species diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Systematic exploration of sexual processes within this diverse clade is crucial for uncovering conserved molecular mechanisms of sexual reproduction that trace back to the ancestral eukaryote. One such example is the conserved gamete fusion protein hapless-2 (hap2), whose function in eukaryotic gamete fusion was elucidated through comparative studies in malaria parasites, plants, and green algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this protein has been found to share a common origin with certain viral fusogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Understanding sex in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is of particular importance because malaria remains a global health concern. An estimated 608,000 people died from the disease in 2022, most of them children under the age of five (WHO World malaria report, 2023). Haploid parasites reproducing asexually inside erythrocytes are alone responsible for causing disease, but sexual reproduction is essential for the parasite to infect the mosquitoes that serve as obligatory vectors. Polygenomic (multi-strain) infections are common in high transmission areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, where meiotic recombination between strains generates and maintains genetic diversity in populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Sex contributes to the spread of drug resistance alleles, the evolution of virulence mechanisms and the diversification of a large repertoire of surface antigens that is key to immune evasion and has to date prevented the development of vaccines against the pathogenic blood stage of any <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.</p><p id="P5">During each asexual round of replication, a subpopulation of intraerythrocytic blood stages leaves the asexual cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and transitions to male or female gametocytes that become infectious to mosquitoes when fully mature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Once taken up into the mosquito midgut, these sexual precursors respond immediately to environmental triggers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, egress from their host cells, and differentiate into gametes, which fuse to form a zygote. The time-limiting factor in gamete formation is the threefold replication of the male genome and the cytosolic assembly of axonemes that precede the endomitotic formation of eight flagellated microgametes in a rapid process termed exflagellation which is completed within around 20 minutes. After fertilisation and nuclear envelope fusion, a premeiotic genome replication is followed by two rounds of meiosis. Without undergoing cytokinesis, the zygote transforms into a motile ookinete, which invades the midgut epithelium and forms a cyst. Meiosis produces four haploid genomes. These probably all persist within the same nuclear envelope, since the growing cyst expresses the genes inherited from both parents as it replicates by closed mitosis. Functionally, the ookinete and oocyst therefore behave like diploid cells. Their individual genomes only segregate during sporozoite formation approximately one to two weeks later. Haploid sporozoites egress from the cyst and invade the salivary glands of the mosquito, who delivers them into the skin of the next host. They make their way to the liver where they resume asexual replication, completing their life cycle.</p><p id="P6">Current antimalarials were developed to target the asexually replicating blood and liver stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, but for the local elimination and global eradication of malaria, reducing parasite transmission by mosquitoes is now considered essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Among the candidates for transmission blocking targets are hundreds of genes and proteins whose abundance increases strongly during sexual development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Few sex-specific genes have experimentally assigned functions, including leading antigens for transmission blocking vaccine development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and a validated target for small molecules that block transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">The cell biology of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametes and zygotes remains a major knowledge gap. We therefore set out here to identify <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sterility genes systematically, making use of the <italic>Plasmo</italic>GEM resource of barcoded gene knock-out (KO) vectors that allows the targeted disruption of more than two thirds of all protein-coding genes in the core genome of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, a parasite infecting rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We first report the results of two signature-tagged mutagenesis screens designed to identify separately the sterile mutants in the male and female developmental lineages. We then stratify male sterility mutants further in a motility screen, and we integrate phenotype data with structure predictions and gene expression information to delineate the biological processes essential for the sexual development of a malaria parasite. We identify a new protein interaction between a moonlighting allantoicase and a conserved nuclear envelope protein that is important to couple the microtubule organising centre to the nucleus during microgamete formation. We present evidence suggesting the complex could be conserved in human testis, illustrating the potential of a global functional analysis in a divergent eukaryote to identify broadly conserved features of sexual development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genome-scale screens identify hundreds of new fertility genes</title><p id="P8">To screen for sterile <italic>Plasmodium</italic> mutants, we transfected pools of barcoded <italic>Plasmo</italic>GEM KO vectors separately into two mutant lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), each capable of producing gametocytes of only the male or female sex. Mice were infected with pools of mutagenised parasites, and a complementary line was spiked in to donate wild type (WT) gametocytes of the missing sex. Fertility of the mutagenised sex was then assayed by allowing <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes to feed. After 13 to 14 days, mosquito midguts with oocysts were dissected and barcodes were counted by DNA sequencing to quantify transmission success of mutants from either the male or the female parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Included in the screens were all genes with <italic>Plasmo</italic>GEM vectors and which were non-essential in asexual blood stages (growth rate of &gt;0.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>). The population bottleneck during transmission made it necessary to study mutants in batches of 50-200 and combine data from hundreds of experiments and &gt;3000 individually dissected midguts to assess 1302 genes for sex specific roles in parasite transmission.</p><p id="P9">At the chosen significance level, female fertility was reduced in 220 mutants and male fertility in 181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) relative to a set of control mutants in each pool. Most phenotypes were limited to one sex, but 54 mutations affected both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). 130 hits were only known as “conserved <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins” but searching protein structure databases with AlphaFold predictions provided further functional annotation for 63 of these (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>). The screens increased by almost 10-fold the number of <italic>P. berghei</italic> genes for which sex-specific phenotypes are known from crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). 89% of published phenotypes were reproduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S1</xref>), discrepancies being mostly borderline cases, where variance was high or biological effects small.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Few genes affect fertility of both sexes</title><p id="P10">Having evolved from an isogamous alveolate ancestor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, malaria parasites have become markedly anisogamous. <italic>P. berghei</italic> sexes therefore do not share many biological systems beyond general cell maintenance.

Data also point to roles for protein ubiquitination and to regulation of translation through diphthamide modification, which typically is targeted to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S2</xref>), and which may contribute to enhance translation when gametocyte activation triggers the de-repression of stored mRNAs through an unknown mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Another shared system likely enables gametocytes to recognise the known triggers that signal arrival in the mosquito midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, which may include an elusive receptor for the mosquito catabolite xanthurenic acid known to serve as signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and downstream transduction proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Many female fertility genes reflect changes in carbon metabolism</title><p id="P11">When mapped onto the co-expression clusters of the <italic>P. berghei</italic> single-cell transcriptomic atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), female phenotypes were less enriched for genes with female-specific transcripts of clusters 13 and 14 than for the more ubiquitously transcribed genes in expression cluster 4. The latter account for a marked enrichment of a subset of mitochondrial metabolic pathways among all female fertility genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> mitochondrion is an essential organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and validated drug target of asexual blood stages, which the zygote inherits exclusively from the female gamete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the uniparental inheritance mode that is common among eukaryotes and one of the hallmarks of sex. Female fertility genes now provide a detailed view of the metabolic reprogramming that accompanies transition to the vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Although the core of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC), from the initial electron acceptor coenzyme Q with its biosynthetic pathway to the proton-pumping complexes III and IV, cannot be disrupted in asexual blood stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S2</xref>), its main function is not in energy production since parasites in the glucose-rich environment of the blood rely largely on cytosolic glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Central carbon metabolism is remodelled in mosquito stages, where an intact tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> must be inherited from the female gamete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). The validated antimalarial target dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which also functions in pyrimidine biosynthesis, is the only blood-stage essential electron donor to coenzyme Q, but three other single-subunit dehydrogenases, as well as complex II of the electron transport chain, become individually essential for female fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>), although all are expressed throughout the life cycle, and some have been pursued as drug targets in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p id="P13">Since the main task of mitochondrial electron transport is not in energy production, subunits of the F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase complex, which couples the proton-motive force generated by proton pumping to ATP production, contribute little to <italic>P. berghei</italic> asexual erythrocytic growth, but only become essential for female fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>).

The ploidy transition at fertilisation has so far posed an insurmountable challenge for the systematic identification of essential genes uniquely involved in both these processes. By mutagenising each sex separately with a library of barcoded gene targeting vectors, we have here overcome a major roadblock to revealing the biology of sex and transmission in a rodent malaria species. Through genome-scale genetic screens we have identified more than 400 fertility functions among targetable genes, increasing by more than an order of magnitude the number of transmission genes whose functions have been assayed for each sex individually in genetic crosses. We used the advantage of barcoded <italic>Plasmo</italic>GEM vectors of making bespoke vector pools to stratify male sterility genes further in secondary screens for egress and motility scores. Benchmarking our results against published phenotypes, we observe a good degree of consistency. We also find the new data recapitulate a smaller number of hits from previous screens for gametocyte development, which captured only one aspect of fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. There are limitations to this work. First, the <italic>Plasmo</italic>GEM project could generate barcoded targeting vectors for only 65% of the core genome, so the screens are blind to the remaining genes. Second, genes previously found essential for growth of asexual blood stages (&gt;40% of genes) were excluded from the current experiments to give maximal space to those mutants expected to add to the gametocyte pool, and 388 slow growing mutants were tested separately, resulting in around 1300 genes that were tractable by our approach.</p><p id="P28">Aided by AlphaFold structure-based annotations, the new phenotype data provide deep insights into the biology underpinning both, malaria transmission and sexual reproduction in a divergent eukaryote. The data identify new genes involved in metabolic reprogramming of mitochondria, whose increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation renders transmission particularly sensitive to drugs such as atovaquone. Among the most essential fertility genes, we found druggable enzymes of unknown function, such as a putative second lactate dehydrogenase essential specifically for male fertility (PBANKA_1340400) and a putative peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerase (PBANKA_1143200), essential for fertility in both sexes, which does not affect expression of gametocyte reporter genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> but where males have a low egress score, indicating a role late in gametocyte development. Our functional data can now also guide the discovery of essential surface-exposed proteins as new targets for transmission blocking vaccines, exemplified by the male gamete fusion protein <italic>hap2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, which may have a female counterpart.</p><p id="P29">In malaria parasites, some hallmarks of eukaryotic cells are uniquely important for reproduction and transmission. Starting are revealed for future studies elucidating such biological systems, including stage-specific metabolism and meiosis, a better understanding of which in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> will shed light on the evolution of an important aspect of eukaryotic biology. Similarly, our understanding of axoneme ultrastructure and function in apicomplexan parasites is rudimentary. Guided by structure homology and a phenotypic assay that tests a correlate of flagellar motility, we describe more than a dozen putative axoneme components with homologues among conserved eukaryotic flagellar proteins. Many of these were revealed only recently, through structural studies in human sperm or model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> and some have not been studied experimentally in any species.

We propose that <italic>P. berghei</italic> can provide a genetically tractable model to study biomechanical aspects of ciliary motility and to develop ways to use such knowledge to block malaria transmission.</p><p id="P30">Studying conserved <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes with fertility functions can reveal new insights into potentially ancient aspects of sexual biology. This is illustrated by our analysis of the nuclear envelope protein SUN1, which we show to be required for the MTOC to execute its nuclear functions during microgamete formation. The single bipartite MTOC, which in non-activated male gametocytes is already associated with the nuclear envelope, is composed of a cytosolic part marked by centrin, and an intranuclear body (INB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Upon activation, the cytosolic part of the MTOC gives rise to two ‘layered’ tetrads of centrioles, each of which assemble an axoneme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Through three rounds of closed mitosis, MTOCs are then sequentially split up and moved by unknown forces into opposition along the nuclear envelope, with mitotic spindles emanating from their nuclear compartments. We find that SUN1 is not required for the cytosolic MTOC compartment to nucleate eight axonemes, which extend to a normal length and become motile. However, MTOCs in a <italic>sun1</italic> mutant do not divide, and axonemes remain connected through a single MTOC, which resides in the cytoplasm, distant from the nuclear envelope, and no mitotic spindles form. Individual microgametes can probably break away from the MTOC when their axonemes start beating, but consistent with the failure of the MTOC to insert into the nuclear envelope and the lack of spindles, free microgametes are mostly anucleate.</p><p id="P31">We propose that the recruitment or insertion of the microgametocyte’s MTOC into the nuclear envelope either rely directly on SUN1, or that SUN1 is required for the formation of mitotic spindles, which may in turn keep the MTOC anchored indirectly in the nuclear envelope. Either way, SUN1 is critical for linking the male genome to the gamete’s axoneme. In contrast, neither the rapid threefold replication of the MTOCs upon gametocyte activation, nor the replication of the genome rely on SUN1 and therefore on an intact mitotic machinery, underlining the paucity of cell cycle checkpoints in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The anucleate microgametes of the <italic>sun1</italic> mutant are only superficially similar to a mutant lacking the microtubule end binding protein EB1, which in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has a non-canonical function of binding laterally to microtubules, thereby linking kinetochores to spindle microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Both <italic>eb1</italic> and <italic>sun1</italic> mutants have anucleate microgametes, but for different reasons -- while in the <italic>eb1</italic> KO mitotic spindles fail to take along chromosomes, in the <italic>sun1</italic> KO, axonemes and MTOCs are dissociated from nuclei, and spindles do not form.</p><p id="P32">When combined with evidence from model eukaryotes, our data support an ancient role of a SUN domain protein in the formation of flagellated gametes: (1) In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which also perform a closed mitosis, the SUN protein Sad1 localises to the functional equivalent of intranuclear body of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> MTOC, the spindle pole body (SPB), where it is needed for mitotic spindles to form and possibly for embedding the SPB in the nuclear envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.

(3) Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatids, a Spag4 homologue is a fertility factor that anchors the basal body to the spermatid nucleus through a mechanism which, like in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, does not appear to involve a canonical LINC complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">We find that <italic>P. berghei</italic> SUN1 forms a complex with another male fertility protein, ALLC1. The interaction is well supported by reciprocal immunoprecipitation, co-expression, similar phenotypes in our fertility and motility screens and localisation to pore-like structures surrounding the base of the intranuclear body of the MTOC at the nuclear envelope. Structural modelling supports a direct interaction between an ALLC1 trimer and the N-terminal part of a SUN1 trimer, where canonical SUN proteins would interact with lamins in the nucleoplasmic periphery. In the interacting region of SUN1, serine 43 is dephosphosphorylated upon gametocyte activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, which may be significant because in <italic>C. elegans</italic> SUN1 the homologous residue, S273, is required for a non-lamin interactor to localise centrosomes to the nuclear envelope during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. SUN domain proteins typically reside in the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, and if their typical topology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> is conserved in a SUN1-ALLC1 complex lining the nuclear pore, both the N-terminus of SUN1 and the ALLC1 subunits of the complex would be positioned to interact with spindle microtubules, possibly through the kinesin-15 homolog that co-precipitates exclusively with ALLC1. <italic>P. berghei</italic> has a second putative allantoicase, PBANKA_0213200, which forms part of the kinetochore complex in the microgametocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, intriguingly placing two different allantoicase at each end of the mitotic spindle.</p><p id="P34">ALLC1 is unlikely to function in purine degradation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> since current models of metabolism do not suggest this pathway exists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Similarly, vertebrates lack allantoicase activity, although homologous genes are present. Intriguingly, mouse allantoicase transcript abundance is highest in testis, and the protein has been suggested a male contraceptive target until shown to be dispensable for male fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Our data thus not only provide concrete evidence for an alternative function of an allantoicase, but also raise the intriguing possibility that such a function may be conserved in eukaryotes where SUN1 domain proteins perform mitotic or fertility functions outside of the canonical LINC complex. Altogether, our data provide a broad and unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission but also highlight ancestral aspects of sex that have evolved close to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.

Barcodes were counted by sequencing amplicons from the genomic DNA extracted from 50 midguts per replicate, each infected with hundreds of oocysts. Despite the high transmission efficiency of <italic>P. berghei</italic>, only 25,000-50,000 oocysts can be produced from an infected mouse, which sets a limit for the complexity of pools that can be sampled in a representative manner. In preliminary experiments we determined that pools of 100-200 mutants were optimal for measuring male phenotypes, but that to quantify female phenotypes with the same statistical power, only around 50 mutants could be transmitted together. Throughout the screens, we assessed biological variance by transmitting each pool at least twice from different infected mice. We further monitored sampling errors by subsampling each transmission experiment in two batches of mosquitoes and by amplifying and counting barcodes twice from each DNA sample. Data from all types of replicates were entered into the final analysis and used to determine independently for each sex the confidence with which a mutant’s transmission rate was determined. Each transmitted pool included the mutants with normal asexual blood-stage growth and fertility to serve as references against which the fertility of all other mutants was calculated, allowing data from nearly two hundred transmission experiments and &gt;3000 individually dissected midguts to be combined into two datasets for male and female fertility.</p><p id="P42">The maximal pool sizes and required number of replicates were determined by monitoring the reproducibility and variance in a pilot screen of 58 vectors pooled for duplicate transfections into WT, female and male lines. In subsequent experiments, 43-202 and 193-204 vectors were prepared for duplicate transfections into female and male lines respectively. Smaller pools were made to improve representation of mutants in the female line, which appeared to have a lower intrinsic transfection efficiency. Vectors to generate reference mutants (approximately 100 ng per vector per transfection) were added to the pool DNA (approximately 10 µg per transfection), and the combined vectors were digested overnight with <italic>Not</italic>I to release the gene-targeting vectors from the vector backbones. Mutants with known dispensable phenotypes served as WT controls for normalising mutant barcode counts in each pool. Digested DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in nuclease-free water (7 µl per transfection). WT, female and male line schizonts from rats were harvested from 20-22 hour cultures with MACS Cell Separation Columns (Miltenyi Biotec). For each transfection, 4 µl of isolated schizonts was added to 7 µl of DNA and 18 µl of P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector solution (Lonza), of which 26 µl was added to a well in a 4D-Nucleofector 16-well strip (Lonza) and electroporated with the FI-115 program. Transfected schizonts were intravenously injected into the tail of naive mice and selected by adding pyrimethamine to the drinking water (0.07 mg/ml) from day one post-transfection. Residual liquid was collected from each well to determine the composition of the transfected vector pool.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Transmission of mutant parasite pools</title><p id="P43">On day three after transfection, naive mice were infected with both single-sex lines, and on day seven, blood from all infected mice was collected. To enable transmission, each blood containing a mutagenised sex was mixed with blood containing wild type parasites producing the complementary sex at a one-to-one ratio based on parasitaemia. Three naive mice were infected with each mixture for each of two duplicate transmission experiments. Infected mice were anaesthetised and used to feed approximately 400 female mosquitoes. For each transmission experiment, blood from each of the three mice was collected and pooled for the blood input sample. On day 13 or 14 post-mosquito infection, approximately 50 infected midguts were collected in duplicate from the same cage of mosquitoes for two oocyst output samples per mosquito feed.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>DNA extraction and Illumina sequencing</title><p id="P44">KO vector pool DNA was extracted from the well input samples in PBS by incubating at 95 °C for 5 minutes.
