However, engraftment arrhythmias are a predictable life-threatening complication and represent a major hurdle for clinical translation. Catheter-based electrophysiological analysis suggested that the ventricular arrhythmias were caused by an automaticity of the transplanted cells, but whether impulse generation by transplanted cardiomyocytes can propagate to the host myocardium and override the recipient rhythm has not been directly assessed experimentally. We used optogenetics to specifically activate engrafted cardiomyocytes, which resulted in impulse generation in the engrafted cardiomyocytes and stimulated the recipient heart (4/9 hearts). Thus, our study shows that transplanted cardiomyocytes can electrically couple to the host myocardium and stimulate the recipient heart, providing experimental evidence that cardiomyocyte automaticity can serve as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is a regenerative therapeutic strategy that holds great promise for patients with heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. First clinical trials have started, and several others are currently in the planning stage. However, ventricular arrhythmias after cardiomyocyte transplantation (so-called engraftment arrhythmias) are the main hurdle for clinical translation. Engraftment arrhythmia is a common, potentially life-threatening complication that mainly occurs within the first three weeks after the transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Catheter-based electrophysiological studies in primates and pigs have provided evidence that it is caused by automaticity of the immature transplanted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Here, we wanted to investigate whether impulse generation in the engrafted cells can propagate to the injured heart and override the recipient heart rhythm. We used optogenetics to specifically activate engrafted cardiomyocytes and show that impulse generation in the engrafted cardiomyocytes can stimulate the recipient injured heart. Hence, we provide evidence that cardiomyocyte automaticity can serve as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p id="P5">We transplanted induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes which expressed the optogenetic actuator BiPOLES (that can be used to activate cardiomyocytes with blue and red light)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This experimental set-up allowed us to specifically activate the engrafted cardiomyocytes with pulsed photostimulation. BiPOLES-iPSCs were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (average troponin T positivity: 93±4%) that were then injected transepicardially in a guinea pig injury model (30x10<sup>6</sup> cardiomyocytes per animal, n=9). 56-days post-transplantation, the hearts showed transmural scarring (scar area was 27±3% of the left-ventricle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Engrafted human cardiomyocytes (graft size: 17±7% of the scar, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A and B</xref>) reached into the host myocardium and formed direct graft-host interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Whereas connexin 43 was circumferentially localized, indicating that the engrafted cardiomyocytes were not fully matured, N-cadherin showed signs of polarization and formed intercalated-disc like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Cardiomyocytes demonstrated advanced sarcomere structure and mainly expressed the ventricular (mature) isoform of the myosin light chain (93±2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). A beginning switch from the fetal slow skeletal to the cardiac troponin I isoform (cardiac troponin I expression: 28±2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) further indicated maturation. Cell cycle activity was still ongoing (8±2% Ki67 positive cardiomyocyte nuclei, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Ex-vivo Langendorff-perfusion was used to assess electrical coupling. For this, the aorta was cannulated. A balloon catheter was used to measure left ventricular isovolumetric pressure and two ECG electrodes were placed on the surface of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Pulsed photostimulation (blue [470 nm] or red [635 nm] light, pulse duration 40-100 milliseconds) was applied to the site of injury at the anterior wall of spontaneously beating hearts (average beating frequency 181±15 bpm). The initial photostimulation frequency was adjusted to be higher than the spontaneous beating frequency (spontaneous beating frequency +0.25 to 1 Hz). Pulsed photostimulation resulted in ectopic pacemaking in 4 out of 9 recipient hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 B -D</xref>). We then performed a stepwise increase in stimulation frequency. All hearts that showed electrical coupling could be paced up to 5 Hz, and the maximum pacing frequency was 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). There was no difference between red and blue light photostimulation with respect to capture or maximum pacing frequency (which is in line with the in vitro characterization of BiPOLES in cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). Adenosine (0.3 mg) was applied to inhibit atrio-ventricular conduction and to induce transient ventricular asystole. Photostimulation was initiated after the onset of ventricular asystole. Again, pulsed photostimulation resulted in optogenetic impulse generation that initiated a ventricular rhythm in 4 out of 9 hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Comparing electrophysiological results to histological analysis revealed that cardiomyocytes were not engrafted in 4 of the 5 hearts that failed to respond to photostimulation. Consequently, 4 of the 5 hearts with engrafted cardiomyocytes exhibited ectopic pacemaking with pulsed photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). While there is evidence that impulse propagation can also occur via fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> histology revealed structural coupling between engrafted cardiomyocytes and host myocardium in our study.</p><p id="P7">Previous studies with genetically encoded calcium and voltage indicators provided evidence that engrafted cardiomyocytes can be stimulated by the recipient myocardium and beat in synchrony with host myocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We used a contrary approach and stimulated the engrafted cardiomyocytes. By employing optogenetics, our study provides evidence that i) transplanted human cardiomyocytes electrically couple to the host myocardium and that ii) impulse initiation in the engrafted cardiomyocytes can stimulate the injured recipient heart. Thus, it supports the hypothesis that automaticity of the engrafted cardiomyocytes can trigger ventricular arrhythmias.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Human iPSC culture and cardiac differentiation</title><p id="P8">Generation of the BiPOLES iPSC line was recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. iPSCs were cultured in FTDA medium on Geltrex-coated cell culture vessels.
