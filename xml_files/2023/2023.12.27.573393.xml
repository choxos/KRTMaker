Aggregates of TDP-43 are present in the brains and spinal cords of &gt;97% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in brains of ~50% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. While mutations in the TDP-43 gene (<italic>TARDBP</italic>) are usually associated with ALS, many clinical reports have linked these mutations to cognitive impairments and/or FTD, but also to other neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinsonism (PD) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved RNA-binding protein that is involved in many cellular processes, mainly RNA metabolism. To investigate systemic pathological mechanisms in TDP-43 proteinopathies, aiming to capture the pleiotropic effects of TDP-43 mutations, we have further characterised a mouse model carrying a point mutation (M323K) within the endogenous <italic>Tardbp</italic> gene. Homozygous mutant mice developed cognitive and behavioural deficits as early as 3 months of age. This was coupled with significant brain structural abnormalities, mainly in the cortex, hippocampus, and white matter fibres, together with progressive cortical interneuron degeneration and neuroinflammation. At the motor level, progressive phenotypes appeared around 6 months of age. Thus, cognitive phenotypes appeared to be of a developmental origin with a mild associated progressive neurodegeneration, while the motor and neuromuscular phenotypes seemed neurodegenerative, underlined by a progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons as well as distal denervation. This is accompanied by progressive elevated TDP-43 protein and mRNA levels in cortex and spinal cord of homozygous mutant mice from 3 months of age, together with increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalisation in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and spinal cord at 12 months of age. In conclusion, we find that <italic>Tardbp</italic> M323K homozygous mutant mice model many aspects of human TDP-43 proteinopathies, evidencing a dual role for TDP-43 in brain morphogenesis as well as in the maintenance of the motor system, making them an ideal <italic>in vivo</italic> model system to study the complex biology of TDP-43.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TDP-43</kwd><kwd>Cognitive alterations</kwd><kwd>Motor disturbances</kwd><kwd>ALS-FTD</kwd><kwd>TDP-43 Proteinopathies</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The transactivation response element DNA-binding protein of 43 KDa (TDP-43) is a 414-residue heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that in normal conditions is highly enriched in the nucleus, although it can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The <italic>TARDBP</italic> gene encodes this highly conserved protein, which consists of two RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal glycine-rich domain, with nuclear localisation and export signals that are critical for its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. In the nucleus, TDP-43 is found in different nuclear bodies with an important function in modulating RNA processing, particularly alternative splicing through direct mRNA binding to hundreds of transcripts. The roles of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm are less clear; it can shuttle to the cytoplasm in response to different stresses, colocalizing with stress granules, although TDP-43 clearly has other physiological functions outside the nucleus, such as in myogenesis in which cytoplasmic TDP-43 granules are required for correct muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Vogler et al., 2018</xref>) and in the regulation of synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">S. Ling, 2018</xref>). However, in TDP-43 pathology, the normally nuclear TDP-43 protein is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it can subsequently form poly-phosphorylated and polyubiquitinated insoluble inclusions, leading to the loss of nuclear functions such as in splicing regulation, as well as potential gain of cytoplasmic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buratti &amp; Baralle, 2008</xref>). Despite the recent advancement in the knowledge of the role of TDP-43 in RNA regulation in neurons and glia, there are still many unknowns about its normal roles in the broader neuronal system of healthy ageing and in the multiple associated diseases.</p><p id="P5">TDP-43 proteinopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases that share the pathological presence of mislocalization and aggregation of the protein TDP-43, among other proteins and molecules, in different cellular populations and regions of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">de Boer et al., 2021</xref>). Pathogenic deposits of TDP-43 have been identified in postmortem samples in different brain regions and spinal cord of an increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders, including the great majority of ALS cases, around 50% of all FTD cases, and all LATE cases (limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>), a new dementia entity that overlaps with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and occurs particularly in old age. Moreover, secondary TDP-43 pathology has been found in other disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), Parkinsonism or Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chanson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Josephs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kabashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schwab et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sreedharan et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, TDP-43 proteinopathy also occurs in the brain of healthy and cognitively normal aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Uchino et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, the wide variety of TDP-43 proteinopathies shows that TDP-43 has a broad role in the CNS beyond the maintenance of the motor system, particularly in cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kawakami et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, understanding the multiple roles of TDP-43 in the different brain and spinal cord areas, and in different stages of life, is essential to help explain the heterogeneous clinical outcomes and associated neurodegenerative diseases that present as TDP-43 proteinopathies.</p><p id="P6">Although the great majority of TDP-43 proteinopathies are sporadic cases, or caused by mutations in other genes (e.g., in the <italic>C9Orf72</italic> and <italic>GRN</italic> genes), some cases are caused by mutations in <italic>TARDBP</italic> itself. To date, most mutations have been found in ALS patients, although mutations haven also been described in FTD, ALS with FTD, as well as Parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cannas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Caroppo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kovacs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tiloca et al., 2022</xref>). The mechanisms by which TDP-43 mutations lead to the death of specific neuronal pools remains unknown. Almost all causative mutations in TDP-43 lie within its C-terminal glycine-rich region, where changes to the prion-like domain can affect its aggregation potential. Although the majority of mutations are dominant, there are also reports of homozygous <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations leading to ALS, FTD and also other disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borghero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). At the molecular level, we and others have shown that different C-terminal TDP-43 mutations, such as Q331K and M323K, can lead to a splicing gain of function when expressed at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fratta et al., 2018</xref>). However, in TDP-43 pathology, TDP-43 exits the nucleus, leading to the loss of nuclear function including in splicing regulation and the appearance of pathological events such as cryptic exons that seem to define at least the end-stage of TDP-43 proteinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">J. P. Ling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ma et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">TDP-43 pathology has been found in different cellular types and in different clinical outcomes and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kawakami et al., 2019</xref>). As there are a variety of disorders with TDP-43 pathology encompassing different brain and spinal cord regions, this suggests that TDP-43 has a broader role in the CNS, beyond the maintenance of the motor system. Different patterns of TDP-43 pathology have been associated with different clinical entities. For example, TDP-43 deposits in ALS are in the spinal cord and areas of the frontal and temporal lobes. In FTD, TDP-43 is found more in the orbitofrontal cortex, also in the temporal and frontal cortex, visual and cerebellum, in addition to progressing to the motor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kawakami et al., 2019</xref>). In LATE, the pathology is located in the hippocampus and amygdala. Therefore, diverse TDP-43 pathology exists, variably affecting multiple areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jo et al., 2020</xref>), while the functions of TDP-43 across different cell types of the central and peripheral nervous system is poorly understood and requires further investigation.</p><p id="P8">RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43 are exquisitely dosage-sensitive, with an auto-regulatory pathway controlling their tight regulation through a mechanism involving TDP-43 protein binding to the 3’UTR of its own transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, overexpression or downregulation of TDP-43 leads to toxicity in a variety of model systems. Therefore, to accurately study TDP-43 biology and its central role in the related proteinopathies, it is critical to work with models that maintain physiological control of gene expression. Over the past few years, we and others have been working with knock-in (KI) lines carrying point mutations within the mouse <italic>Tardbp</italic> gene, including the ENU-induced M323K mutation, which in homozygosity develops progressive motor neuron degeneration underlined with a splicing gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fratta et al., 2018</xref>). While this mutation has not been identified in human patients, it resides within the prion-like domain where various human ALS-causing mutations have been found.</p><p id="P9">Here, we further characterise the pleiotropic effects of the M323K point mutation longitudinally to study the implications of expressing the mutant protein physiologically, along the entire lifespan of the mouse and its effects in different systems. This offers the unique opportunity of evaluating the progressive nature of some of the observed phenotypes, uncovering novel functions for TDP-43 in brain morphogenesis and maintenance whilst illuminating its role in disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><sec id="S4"><title>Housing conditions and licensing</title><p id="P10">Mice were kept in auto-ventilated cages and fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (Rat and Mouse Breeding 3 (RM3), Special Diet Services) with free access to water.

The ‘Colocalization Threshold’ macro in the Fiji software was used to calculate the percentage of colocalization. This protocol was used to analyse TDP-43 colocalization versus Dapi. For this, the images to be analysed were selected in red and green colours, the macro was selected, and the default options were used. The TM1 and TM2 values refer to how much of one protein colocalizes with the other and vice versa. Finally, to analyse the total number of particles, we selected the area of interest or the total area and selected “analyse particles” that have refined the data close to the value of a pixel.

In agreement with the EMG data, we found a progressive deficit in neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) innervation in <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup><italic>M323K/M323K</italic></sup> female mice when compared to their wild-type littermates, with a significant increase in partially innervated by 12 months of age, which worsened by 24 months of age, but was not present at 3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P54">Finally, we examined whether those progressive motor alterations might be initiated in the primary motor cortex in parallel with the observed interneuron neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-F</xref>).

Interestingly, we found a significant deficit in UMN in <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup><italic>M323K/M323K</italic></sup> already present at 1 year of age, which progressively worsened by 2 years of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P55">Altogether, these results show that homozygous M323K mice show truly progressive motor abnormalities that seem to affect the motor cortex and the distal muscles earlier than the lower motor neuron somas.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><label>6</label><title>TDP-43 functional splicing alterations</title><p id="P56">From our previous study, we found a gain of splicing function due to the M323K mutation when expressed at endogenous levels, leading to an increase in TDP-43 splicing function in cassette exons known to be modulated by TDP-43, as well as the appearance of pathological splicing events, defined as <italic>skiptic</italic> exons, leading to the exclusion of normally constitutively included exons due to an enhanced TDP-43 repression function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fratta et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we evaluated whether different splicing alterations in skiptics as well as cassette exons known to be modulated by TDP-43 were present in cortex and spinal cord of M323K homozygous mice at different ages. Percentage of exon inclusion (PSI) assessments in a panel of gene exons corroborated previous findings and further showed that splicing function of mutant TDP-43 protein was enhanced in all regions and ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S34"><label>7</label><title>M323K mutation led to an increase in TDP-43 protein and mRNA expression accompanied by an increased cytoplasmic mislocalization</title><p id="P57">Finally, we studied the impact of the TDP-43-M323K point mutation on the expression levels and location of the protein and mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, which might explain both the developmental and the progressive alterations observed in homozygous mice.</p><p id="P58">The M323K mutation is located within the low complexity domain of the TDP-43 protein, known to be important for protein-protein interactions, such as those with other hnRNPs that control TDP-43 splicing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Buratti et al., 2005</xref>) or with chaperones in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Concretely, M323 is located at the N-terminus of the first α-helix of the prion-like region, and the M323 to K mutation changes the polarity of the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Indeed, we and others have shown that the M323K mutation influences TDP-43 aggregation, showing a higher propensity to form fibrils than wild-type TDP-43, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carrasco et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fratta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P59">We have previously shown that the M323K mutation leads to increased <italic>Tardbp</italic> expression, at least at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fratta et al., 2018</xref>). We confirmed this finding in this new cohort at different timepoints, measuring <italic>Tardbp</italic> gene expression levels by qPCR, observing an increased mRNA expression in mutant mice when compared to wild-type littermates in the frontal cortex from 3 months of age, with levels progressively increasing with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P60">We next looked at the total protein level in different tissues: frontal cortex, spinal cord, skeletal muscle and liver. The total protein levels of TDP-43 were increased in the CNS (frontal cortex and spinal cord) of <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup><italic>M323K/M323K</italic></sup> mice when compared to littermate controls, with a progressive increase associated with older age in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>, Supplementary Figure A, B). These changes were not observed in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P61">To assess if TDP-43 subcellular location was affected by the mutation, we performed subcellular fractionation to separate the nucleus and cytoplasm from brain and spinal cord of wild-type and homozygous mice and found more TDP-43 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction in mutants when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>), an increase that was also progressive with age. To corroborate these findings, we performed immunostaining of the brain and spinal cord of the wild-type and homozygous mice using different TDP-43 antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (only showing C-terminal results) in different areas of the CNS. We found similar mislocalization of the TDP-43 protein in the different analysed brain areas, including the frontal cortex and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>), as well as, hippocampus and hypothalamus (data not shown). The amount of TDP-43 in the nucleus (measured by the level of colocalization of TDP-43 protein with the nuclear stain DAPI) was reduced by around 20% in <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup>M323K/M323K</sup> mice compared to their wild-type littermates at 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>), confirming that there was more cytoplasmic TDP-43 in the mutant mice. Interestingly, those changes were not present at 3 months of age, supporting a progressive accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 in M323K mutants.</p><p id="P62">In summary, these data show a general dysregulation of the TDP-43-M323K protein in the CNS, leading to progressively increased protein levels and cytoplasmic mislocalization that might underlie the progressive phenotypes observed in <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup>M323K/M323K</sup> mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S35" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P63">TDP-43 is of fundamental importance to ALS/FTD, not only because more than 95% of ALS and around 50% of FTD patients present with TDP-43 proteinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>), but also because familial ALS and FTD cases can harbour <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations. The development of sequencing techniques and increasingly accessible screening in the clinic has identified rare <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations also in clinical neurodegenerative pathologies other than ALS and FTD, such as semantic primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Caroppo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gelpi et al., 2014</xref>), flair arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>), classical Parkinson’s disease and atypical Parkinsonism (progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tiloca et al., 2022</xref>) and autosomal dominant myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zibold et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, despite the low prevalence of <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations, there are a few reported cases of ALS patients carrying homozygous mutations (p.A382T and p.G294V) that do not seem to lead to overtly severe phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borghero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cannas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Corrado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lombardi et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, patients carrying different <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations have heterogeneous clinical phenotypes that, at least in the case of ALS, seem to be more often associated with upper motor neuron dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lombardi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P64">Our thorough characterization of M323K homozygous mice has uncovered a myriad of phenotypic alterations including a variety of cognitive as well as motor abnormalities that might model the pyramidal as well as extrapyramidal features seen in the broad clinical outcomes of <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutant carriers. All these imply that TDP-43 also has essential roles outside the motor system, highlighting the importance of studying the wider roles of brain TDP-43 in different model systems.</p><p id="P65">In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for TDP-43 in brain morphogenesis as evidenced by MRI analysis, showing general and regional brain structural alterations in homozygous mutant mice from an early age. This is in accordance with a previous finding from TDP-43 Q331K KI mice, although the abnormalities found here in M323K mutant mice are more severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, this suggests an essential role for TDP-43 in the correct development and maintenance of the central nervous system, as in the case for other hnRNP family proteins, such as FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ali et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, MRI analysis of mutant <italic>TARDBP</italic> ALS patients have shown that TDP-43 mutations can lead to distinct cortical alterations as well as white matter abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Spinelli et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, alterations in myelin and oligodendrocytes have been previously reported in other TDP-43 and FUS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Guzman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Heo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Ho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), and ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), with premorbid white matter abnormalities recently found in ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Thompson et al., 2023</xref>). Crucially, this is modelled in M323K mice, as this study supports a role for TDP-43 in the development and/or maintenance of white matter, hinting towards alterations in the myelination process that could contribute towards explaining specific cognitive and functional alterations in mutant mice.</p><p id="P66">Early developmental brain structural abnormalities might underline some of the early deficits that we have found in homozygous animals in phenotypic tests, including nesting behaviour, marble burying, or novel object recognition. However, in other tests such as fear conditioning or light-dark box, deficits do not appear until 12 months of age. For some tests, there is a clear decline with age, for example in numbers of marbles buried, suggesting that at least some cognitive alterations might be underlined by progressive abnormalities that are not developmental. This is indeed also the case at the histological level, as we uncovered a progressive degeneration of parvalbumin and cholinergic interneurons in the cortex, as well as the appearance of astrogliosis after 3 months of age. Some of these progressive changes have also been previously described in transgenic mice overexpressing TDP-43 where a progressive age-associated loss of GABAergic parvalbumin interneurons was reportedly associated with the appearance of TDP-43 inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tsuiji et al., 2017</xref>). Here, in agreement with previous reports on other Tardbp KI strains, we found that interneuron degeneration can occur without TDP-43 inclusions.</p><p id="P67">This progressiveness is also seen at the motor level, with homozygous mutant mice only showing any deficits after 6 months of age. Critically, these motor abnormalities are underlined by a progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, the cardinal pathological hallmarks of ALS. Interestingly, the progressive loss of upper motor neurons appears earlier than that of lower motor neurons, modelling the more pronounced upper motor neuron involvement seen in patients carrying <italic>TARDBP</italic> mutations, as well as in other TDP-43 mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Reale et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, different contributors might explain the appearance and progression of motor phenotypes. They could be associated to the progressive loss of upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, but also might be related to both, the loss of other parvalbumin GABA interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">White et al., 2018</xref>) as well as the loss of striatal cholinergic interneurons and their corticostriatal projections to the primary cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Maltese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Poppi et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that the motor alterations seen in the homozygous mutant mice could be initiated at the primary cortex. Also, distal events initiated at the neuromuscular junction leading to functional muscle alterations at the EMG level are also likely to play a pivotal role. As <italic>Tardbp</italic> Q331K KI mutant mice had reported alterations in the number of parvalbumin interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">White et al., 2018</xref>) but not underlying lower motor neuron degeneration, possibly other factors might be a play in M323K mutant mice.</p><p id="P68">TDP-43 levels increase with the normal ageing process in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Koike et al., 2021</xref>), and although TDP-43 pathology has also been reported in many healthy aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Uchino et al., 2015</xref>), the proportion of people with TDP-43 proteinopathy has been reported to be higher in patients with a neurodegenerative condition. Thus, the progressive nature of some cognitive and all motor phenotypes in M323K mutant mice prompted us to look for underlying abnormalities at TDP-43 expression levels, its function and subcellular distribution in brain and spinal cord at different ages. Indeed, we found an age-related increase in TDP-43 levels in neuronal tissues of aged wild-type mice, and a more pronounced increase in M323K mutant mice. This was accompanied with an increase in TDP-43 cytoplasmic (mis)localization in mutants that was more remarkable in the frontal cortex, which could partly explain some of the progressive behavioural phenotypes in the <italic>Tardbp</italic><sup>M323K/M323K</sup> mice. Interestingly, this increase in TDP-43 protein levels and cytoplasmic mislocalization did not correlate with any changes in its splicing function in cortex.</p><p id="P69">Overall, in this study we take advantage of the M323K mutation, characterizing its wider phenotypes in detail at different levels, identifying different roles for TDP-43 in different regions, and importantly, in different stages of life, emphasizing the need to develop good models to study the complex biology of TDP-43. This is essential to understand TDP-43 pathological mechanisms and their contribution to the heterogeneous clinical alterations in different TDP-43 proteinopathies. The more we understand about the implications of TDP-43 alteration in different clinical disorders throughout the ageing process, the better chances we have to intervene in the different pathological processes with the final aim of providing effective and personalised treatments.</p><sec id="S36"><title>Inclusion and diversity</title><p id="P70">We support inclusive, diverse, and equitable conduct of research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS193148-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d99aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the animal care staff in Hospital Clínico San Carlos (Madrid), and the Mary Lyon Centre at the MRC Harwell Institute (Oxfordshire).
