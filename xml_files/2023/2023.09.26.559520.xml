There are hundreds of predicted effectors in the genomes of plant pathogenic fungi that are usually identified by their secretion signal and other characteristic features such as cysteine enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Some effectors are of particular interest since they constitute avirulence (AVR) factors that are detected by plant immune systems and render crops resistant to severe diseases. Fungal effectors usually show no amino-acid sequence homology to known proteins or protein domains, and consequently their biological function cannot be inferred from systematic <italic>in silico</italic> analysis (such as domain searches) but must be elucidated on a case-by-case basis. As a huge and growing number of putative effectors is being discovered, deciphering the functions and adaptive evolution of fungal effectors requires robust predictive tools for analyzing protein sequences and prioritizing candidates.</p><p id="P4">Recently, a combination of primary sequence pattern searches and structural modeling resulted in a major breakthrough in effector biology by revealing that fungal effector repertoires are actually dominated by a limited number of families sharing common structures despite extensive sequence variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. One such family are the MAX (<italic>Magnaporthe</italic> AVRs and ToxB-like) effectors we identified in <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic> (synonym: <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>), the causal agent of blast disease in rice, wheat, and other cereals or grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. This pathogenic fungus is both a major threat to global food security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and a prime experimental model in plant pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. By solving the solution structure of two <italic>P. oryzae</italic> effectors, AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia, we discovered strong structural similarities between these sequence-unrelated effectors as well as with the ToxB effector from the wheat infecting fungus <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P5">MAX effectors are specific to plant pathogenic ascomycete fungi, and they have undergone a major expansion in <italic>P. oryzae</italic>. Analysis of 120 isolates of <italic>P. oryzae</italic> identified ~7800 putative MAX effectors that were grouped in 94 groups of orthologs (OGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Individual isolates have 58 to 78 MAX effectors, corresponding to 5 to 10% of their effector repertoire. This high number suggests that MAX effectors have a critical role in the virulence of the blast fungus. This idea is further supported by the fact that MAX effectors are massively and specifically expressed during the early stages of plant infection and targeted by the plant immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Indeed, nearly half of the cloned AVR genes of <italic>P. oryzae</italic> correspond to MAX effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Analysis of the recognition of the MAX effectors AVR-Pia, AVR1-CO39, and AVR-Pik by the rice immune receptors RGA5 and Pik-1 suggests that they target small heavy metal-associated domain proteins (sHMAs), which show similarity to copper chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Another MAX effector, AvrPiz-t, targets four different host proteins involved in different cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In comparison with other secreted proteins, MAX effectors show high presence/absence polymorphism and important sequence variability that is maintained by balancing selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Analysis of the MAX effectors AVR1-CO39, AVR-Pia and AVR-Pik indicates that non-synonymous polymorphisms frequently co-localize with residues interacting with immune receptors and, presumably, also with their host target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P6">To better understand the function and evolution of <italic>P. oryzae</italic> MAX effectors, a systematic and robust analysis of their three-dimensional structure, especially outside the MAX core domain, is still needed. Indeed, in addition to the core, many MAX effectors possess N- and C-terminal extensions that could have critical roles, for instance, by establishing specific protein-protein interactions. Examining in more details these extensions, as well as other non-conserved structural features, may thus provide insights into the mechanism by which MAX effectors acquire new virulence capabilities, and allow a more comprehensive classification within the MAX family.</p><p id="P7">In the present study, we combined experimental and computational approaches to characterize finely the structural diversity of MAX effectors. We undertook structural studies of several MAX candidates and solved four new structures by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Comparison of these new experimental MAX structures with corresponding 3D models generated by template-based or <italic>ab initio</italic> approaches revealed the reliability of the MAX predictions. The highest accuracy was achieved with AlphaFold2 (AF2), which predicted the structure of MAX effectors, including non-conserved side-chains in terminal extensions that were not previously observed. We therefore revisited with the use of AF2 the structural landscape of <italic>P. oryzae</italic> MAX effectors, and validated the presence of a MAX core in 77 of the 94 previously defined MAX OGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Structural alignment of the AF2 models allowed us to refine the structural consensus and to explore the variability within the MAX family, including deviations from the canonical fold, disulfide bond pattern variations, additional secondary structures within N- and C-terminal extensions as well as variations in surface properties, such as stickiness and electrostatics of the core domain.</p><p id="P8">This work represents the most extensive structural analysis of a fungal effector family of a plant pathogen to date. It also provides valuable knowledge for analyses aimed at elucidating the function of MAX effectors, notably through the prediction of interaction sites within the MAX fold that could contribute to targeting host proteins during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The structure of MoToxB presents the canonical MAX fold</title><p id="P9">The MAX effector orthogroup OG33 of <italic>P. oryzae</italic> has high protein sequence similarity with the effector ToxB from <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> suggesting that the corresponding genes are orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We determined the structure of its representative in the Br58 isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2 Table</xref>) by X-ray crystallography using molecular replacement at 1.38Å resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">Supplementary Materials and Methods</xref>). The structure confirmed high structural similarity with ToxB from <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> and therefore this MAX effector was renamed MoToxB. The structure was also similar to the experimentally determined structures of five other <italic>P. oryzae</italic> MAX effectors that share less than 13% sequence identity with MoToxB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). Like other MAX effectors, MoToxB is structured as a 6-stranded ß-sandwich (ß1 to ß6) of two triple-stranded antiparallel ß-sheets with a ß6ß1ß2-ß3ß4ß5 topology. A disulfide bond that is conserved in almost all other MAX effectors forms a bridge between ß1 and the loop connecting ß4 and ß5. The two cysteines forming this bond are the only residues that are highly conserved in MAX effectors. In MoToxB a second disulfide bond connects ß2 and ß6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NMR structures validate template-based modeling of MAX effectors</title><p id="P10">In our previous analysis of the MAX effector repertoire in <italic>P. oryzae</italic>, we used a combination of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) pattern searches and hybrid multiple Template Modeling (TM) for predicting the 3D structure of the conserved MAX core of each representative sequences of the 94 MAX effector OGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2 Table</xref>) defined in that study (OGs are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The reliability of the 3D models (referred as TM-pred models) was evaluated by the TM-pred score, which is an estimate of the T<sc>M</sc>-score that would be observed in a structural alignment of the TM-pred model with the corresponding experimentally resolved structure using TM-align. For these analyses eight experimental structures of MAX effectors were used as templates for homology modeling, and as a training data set for the TM-pred scoring function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Almost 90% of the OG proteins were modeled at high confidence as MAX structures (TM-pred score &gt; 0.6). Only three TM-pred models, those of OG22, OG77 and OG85, had a TM-pred score below 0.5 and were suspected to be no MAX effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). All 94 TM-pred models and associated TM-pred scores can be downloaded from the online table <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pat.cbs.cnrs.fr/magmax/model/">https://pat.cbs.cnrs.fr/magmax/model/</ext-link> (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To deepen insight into MAX effectors and to assess the validity of the predictions, we attempted to resolve the experimental structures of 10 new MAX effector candidates with high expression during the biotrophic stage of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Using NMR spectroscopy, we successfully determined the structure of four of them (OG28, OG47, OG60 and OG67), and confirmed that they all have a MAX core fold (referred to as “MAX” instead of “OG clusters” from hereon). The 20 best-refined conformers obtained for each of these effectors were superimposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), and the high quality of the NMR structures was supported by the low root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d). The complete structural statistics are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">S4 Table</xref>.</p><p id="P12">MAX28, MAX47 and MAX67 displayed the characteristic MAX ß-sandwich fold stapled through the conserved disulfide bridge linking ß1 and the ß4-ß5 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The two cysteines forming this bond are the only residues that are highly conserved in MAX effectors. A particular feature of MAX67 was the exceptional length of the ß1 and ß2 strands (10 a.a.), which were longer than those in all other determined MAX effector structures. MAX60 diverged from the canonical MAX fold by the replacement of the ß5 strand by a helical turn, preventing the corresponding residues from forming a regular ß-sheet with ß4 and ß3.</p><p id="P13">In addition to the central MAX core, MAX28, MAX47 and MAX60 possess remarkable N- and/or C-terminal extensions. For MAX47, the 23 residue-long sequence extending before the ß1 strand was enriched in serine residues and was not resolved in the NMR structure. The ß1 strand started with two consecutive cysteine residues, which formed disulfide bonds that were well defined in the NMR structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). The first cysteine made a disulfide bond with the last C-terminal cysteine residue (C42-C108). The second cysteine formed the disulfide bond with the cysteine in the ß4-ß5 loop (C43-C79), which is present, as already mentioned, in nearly all canonical MAX effectors, and named SS “1” disulfide bond in the following.</p><p id="P14">MAX60 has a C-terminal extension, which forms a well-defined α-helix that is attached to the structural core by hydrophobic contacts established by the aromatic rings of two tyrosine residues (Y91 and Y94). Nuclear Overhauser Effects (NOEs) in the NMR experiments revealed close contacts between tyrosine Y91 and residues D28 to T33 and H50, and between tyrosine Y94 and residues T33, I35, V48 and M89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The resonances of the 42 residue-long C-terminal extension of MAX28 that contains lysine-repeated motifs (KxxxK) were not assigned in the NMR spectra. This is consistent with the prediction of this part of the protein as being unstructured.</p><p id="P16">The four new NMR structures of MAX effectors were superimposed using TM-align with the corresponding TM-pred models that we previously generated by template homology modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). The quality of the models was evaluated by the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d) calculated between the observed and predicted structures and the TM-scores given by TM-align (a value of 1 meaning a perfect match). Comparison of the superimposed backbones showed that the overall MAX fold as well as the relative orientation of the two ß-sheets forming the central ß-sandwich were all well predicted. The prediction was particularly good for MAX28 whose MAX domain of the TM-pred model precisely matched the experimental structure (r.m.s.d.=2.11 Å), even for the loops joining the ß-strands. MAX28 was also the effector with the highest estimated TM-pred score (0.75), in remarkably good agreement with the true TM-score (0.74) of the TM-pred model aligned to the NMR structure. Structural predictions of the MAX core were also very good for MAX67, except for the long strands ß1 and ß2 in the NMR structure that could not be accurately modeled. This deviation explains the rather low TM-pred value for TM-pred_MAX67. The models of MAX47 and MAX60 showed also poor definition of certain ß-strands and exhibited strong divergence in connecting loops when compared to the NMR structures. For MAX47, the limited reliability of the TM-pred model was reflected by the low TM-pred score (0.63).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AlphaFold2 reliably predicts MAX effectors core and extensions</title><p id="P17">The recent release of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based protein structure modeling methods have demonstrated the high accuracy with which deep-learning softwares such as AlphaFold2 (AF2) can predict the 3D structure of most structured proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. To determine the accuracy of AF2 for the prediction of MAX effector structures, we used it to model MAX28, MAX47, MAX60 and MAX67 before the release of their NMR structures in the PDB. We used three different implementations of AF2 to generate the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from which protein 3D models are predicted: the MMseqs2 and Jackhmmer implementations, which use MSAs generated automatically online or locally and that can include PDB templates, as well as the <italic>Custom</italic> MSA implementation that uses MSAs provided by the user and that was parameterized to not use PDB templates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">Materials and Methods</xref>). For each sequence query, the three MSAs were independently submitted to AF2, and the predictive quality of the top-ranked models was assessed thanks to the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The pLDDT score, scaling from 0 to 100, is a residue-level accuracy score computed by AF2 that provides an estimate of the confidence of each residue’s predicted position in the protein structure. We considered the average pLDDT score for the overall protein, or only for residues within the predicted MAX core domain, hereafter, called the MAX pLDDT score. The MAX pLDDT score allows better filtering of the AF models, since it provides a quantitative measure of prediction quality focusing on the MAX core domain. For each MAX effector, the AF2 model having the highest MAX pLDDT score was selected and referred as its AF_MAX model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The MAX core domain was predicted with high confidence in AF_MAX47, AF_MAX60 and AF_MAX67 according to their high MAX pLDDT scores, close to or exceeding 90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S5 Table</xref>). The best models were obtained in all three cases from the Jackhmmer AF2 implementation. A lower confidence score (74.1) was retrieved for the best AF2 model of MAX28, generated with the <italic>Custom</italic> MSA implementation. Nevertheless, AF_MAX28 was very close to the experimental structure of MAX28 according to the average r.m.s.d. value (1.42 Å) calculated from superimposing the MAX core backbone atoms of the NMR conformers. Indeed, for all four MAX effectors, the MAX domain of the best AF2 model displayed side-chain rotamers almost identical to those in the experimental structures and that were within the uncertainty of the NMR approach, i.e. density of NMR-derived constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">AlphaFold2 modeling also succeeded in predicting details within the core domains. The cysteine residue side-chains forming the conserved SS1 disulfide bond were well defined in all four AF_MAX effector models. The same was true for those forming the additional disulfide bond, bridging the ß1 and the C-terminal extension, in the structure of MAX47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Another example of consistency between experimental structures and AF2 models was the remarkably well defined position and orientation of the C-terminal helix of MAX60, including the two tyrosine residues whose aromatic side chains stacked over the ß1-ß2-ß6 ß-sheet of the MAX core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). For MAX28, both AF2 model and NMR structure were consistent in predicting unstructured N- and C-terminal extensions. Moderate deviations from the experimental structure were only observed for residues in the C-terminus of MAX67 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>AlphaFold2 validates 77 out of 94 MAX OGs</title><p id="P20">Given the high quality of the AF2-generated models of MAX effectors, we applied the same AF modeling strategy to all other <italic>P. oryzae</italic> MAX OG representatives. The models were visualized to check the presence of the characteristic MAX core by inspecting the ß-strand topology and the presence of the conserved SS “1” disulfide bond (Pymol. v.1.6; Delano 2002). OG proteins showing significant topological deviations from this canonical MAX fold were discarded. The presence of the short ß5 strand was not used as a filtering criterion. Among the 80 AF2 models that matched the canonical MAX structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">S5 Table</xref>), 57 had MAX pLDDT scores greater than 80 and 20 had MAX pLDDT scores ranging from 60 to 80. Only three OG proteins, OG26, OG73 and OG94, exhibiting a central core compatible with a MAX fold had a MAX pLDDT score below 60 and were not kept in our final selection of 77 validated MAX structures. About 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the selected models was generated with the AF2 implementation using a <italic>Custom</italic> MSA constraining the alignment of the predicted ß1-ß4 strands and of the conserved cysteine residues in the SS “1” disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">S6 Table</xref>).

Other OG proteins such as OG51 and OG54 that exhibited a TM-pred score above 0.6 compatible with a MAX structure displayed significant distortions from the canonical MAX fold when modeled by AlphaFold2. For OG51, two models computed with MMseqs2 and the AF2 Jackhmmer implementation gave very similar models (backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.77Å) with pLDDT overall scores of 52.6 and 61.9, respectively. However, the C-terminal ß-strand of OG51 had a parallel orientation relative to the first ß1 strand that was not compatible with the MAX topology. The best OG54 model had a pLDDT score of 59.4 but deviated from the MAX topology by the absence of the C-terminal ß6 strand, which was not accurately modeled.</p><p id="P22">The 14 OG clusters that gave inconclusive AF2 models were submitted to two other protein structure prediction web-servers, RaptorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and RosettaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. None of the computed models displayed the canonical MAX fold, with consistently low prediction scores, confirming the challenging nature of modeling these OG cluster sequences that may deviate from the MAX topology.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Variations around the canonical MAX fold</title><p id="P23">From the analysis of the 77 AF models we could define more precisely the consensus structural elements that constitute the conserved MAX core. The average size of the ß strands and the connecting loops forming the canonical MAX fold given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S7 Table</xref> showed that ß1 and ß2 were usually of similar size and associated together with ß6 to form the longest anti-parallel ß sheet, while ß3 and ß4 strands were generally shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S7 Table</xref>). Most variation occurred at the short, 2 to 8 residues long ß5 strand, which is preceded by a loop with variable length that can count up to 25 residues (MAX29). The ß5 strand can be associated with a short helix (MAX15, MAX60), totally absent (MAX78 and MAX83) or replaced by a helix (MAX20).</p><p id="P24">The number of disulfide bonds stabilizing the MAX protein can also greatly vary, from none in MAX61 and MAX62 (AVR-Pib) up to three in MAX46 or four in MAX52 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S7 Table</xref>). A unique member of the MAX family was MAX52, whose AF model consisted of two MAX core domains arranged in tandem and designated MAX52A and MAX52B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S7 Table</xref>, each having two disulfide bonds. Besides the conserved disulfide bond (SS “1”), which is a hallmark of the MAX domain, three types of additional disulfide bonds (SS “2”, “3” and “4”) were found in the experimental and AF2 MAX structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A and B</xref>). SS “4”, joining the N-terminus of ß1 to a C-terminal cysteine, is well defined in both MAX47 and MAX92.

C-terminal extensions were also more numerous and usually longer than N-terminal extensions. They were often modeled by AF2 with well-defined secondary structures, such as additional ß strands extending the ß2ß1ß6 sheet by one or two strands (e.g. MAX08, MAX12, MAX25), or a terminal helix as observed in the model and solution structure of MAX60. In many cases, terminal extensions appeared as unstructured regions that could not be modeled with high confidence by AF2. Long intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of more than 30 a.a.

When analyzed independently, the structural alignment trees retrieved from these two clustering approaches did not reveal clear sub-families of MAX structures, as shown by the lack of long internal branches in both trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>).

Together, these 20 groups comprised about two-thirds of the 77 MAX effectors. Groups A to G gather MAX models possessing major structured elements in addition to the canonical MAX core: groups A and B contain models with 2 extra strands, groups C and D contain models with 1 extra strand, and groups E to G contain models with C-terminal helical extensions after ß6. Group H consists of the MAX52 tandem domains connected by a structured linker. In contrast, groups I to O correspond to plain MAX structures, without other decoration but presenting variations of the MAX fold specific to each group.

For this subset of MAX domains, we computed S<sc>URFMAP</sc> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] 2D projections of their molecular envelop, and compared the distribution of the following surface features: exposed secondary structures, electrostatic potential, stickiness and amino-acid polymorphism within the OG cluster to which belongs each representative MAX model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The electrostatic potential maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S2 files</xref>) revealed that MAX domain surfaces were more often positively charged than negatively charged or neutral, and that the molecular surfaces can appear entirely positive (e.g. MAX06/AvrPiz-t, MAX23, MAX34, MAX47) or negative (e.g. MAX10, MAX38, MAX78, MAX86/AVR1-CO39), or present intense electrostatic patches (e.g. MAX02/AVR-Pik, MAX58, MAX62/AVR-Pib, MAX80). It is well established that positively charged regions in proteins are important for interaction with negatively charged macromolecules, such as nucleic acids and lipopolysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], whereas negatively charged protein surfaces can be involved in membrane attachment or DNA mimicking functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. In MAX47, we noticed that its unstructured N-terminal extension is rich in aspartic residues, suggesting that it could make transient interactions with the positively charged MAX core in the absence of its cellular target. In MAX62 (AVR-Pib), a surface loop region formed a strong positive patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>), which has been shown to be essential for the avirulence function of AVR-Pib and its nuclear localization in host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, a similar positive patch was visible on the surface of its structural homolog MAX61 belonging to the same structural group, as well as in MAX05 and MAX72 belonging to group O (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>), suggesting that these effectors may also rely on this positive surface loop for their function. Similarly, AvrPiz-t displayed a positively charged surface mostly formed by lysine residues that are required for AvrPiz-t avirulence and virulence functions in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Inversely, while the surface of MAX86 (AVR1-CO39) is strongly negative, that of MAX93 (AVR-Pia) is neutral, yet both AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia interact similarly through their ß2 strand with the HMA domain of the rice immune receptors RGA5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], respectively.</p><p id="P31">Wide divergence was also observed in the surface stickiness of the MAX domains. Surface stickiness is mostly related to surface hydrophobicity and reflects the propensity of amino acids to be involved in molecular interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. For AVR-Pia, the HMA binding site correlated well with the presence of a large hydrophobic surface patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref> and panel C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5 Fig</xref>) and a very sticky ß2 strand, also present in MAX31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>). This was however not the case for AVR1-CO39 whose surface hydrophobicity was limited except in strand ß5. This strand is particularly variable in length and surface properties, exhibiting high stickiness in only a few MAX effectors (e.g. MAX10, MAX11 and MAX38) where it could contribute to the binding site of host target proteins. For the AVR-Pik group (MAX01, MAX02 and MAX03) surface stickiness was high in ß1 and sticky patches were also observed in strands ß3, ß4 and ß6. In all these effectors, the ß3 stickiness could serve in an interaction with strand ß4 of HMA domains, as observed in complexes of different MAX02 effectors with the HMA domain from Pikp-1 or from the rice protein OsHIPP19 targeted by AVR-PikF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Other MAX effectors (e.g. MAX67, MAX72 and MAX78) possessed a highly sticky ß3 strand that could also associate with the ß-strand of an HMA domain or other type of protein domain. In the crystal structures of the AVR-Pik effectors, the anti-parallel ß1-ß6 strands of the MAX core make hydrophobic contacts with residues in their N-terminal extension which adopts a conserved extended conformation and considerably expands the binding interface with the HMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5 Fig</xref>). In MAX structural groups A to D (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, not included in the present subset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>), a sticky ß6 strand was often associated with an anti-parallel ß7 extending the MAX core ß-sheet.

On the other hand, sequence conservation was high inside each OG cluster with average conservation scores in strands and loops close to the maximum conservation score of 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">S7c Table</xref>). Only three clusters displayed low conservation scores in ß2, ß3 and ß6 strands for MAX47, in ß2 and the loop joining ß4 to ß5 for MAX63, and in strands ß4 and ß5 for MAX70, which resulted in all cases in increased polymorphism on their surfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S2 Files</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S13"><title>AF2 outcompetes other strategies for the prediction of MAX effector structures</title><p id="P33">In this study, we combined experimental structure determination and <italic>in silico</italic> modeling to elucidate the commonalities and variability of the three-dimensional structures in the MAX effector family of <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>.

This extended reference set, enabled us to evaluate the accuracy with which different modeling techniques can predict the structure of MAX effectors. In a previous work we had used a combination HMM pattern searches and hybrid multiple template modeling to predict the core of MAX effector structures and selecting best models according to their T<sc>M</sc>-pred score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. For the selected TM-pred models of MAX28, MAX47, MAX60 and MAX67 the overall structures of the MAX domain were properly modeled, and the observed deviations with their experimentally determined counterparts (T<sc>M</sc> score) were well predicted by the T<sc>M</sc>-pred scoring function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). However, the TM-pred models, although limited to the conserved MAX core, deviated substantially from the NMR structures (r.m.s.d ranging from 2.1 to 5.3 Å), highlighting the limits of template-based homology modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and the need of alternative strategies for the reliable modeling of MAX effectors.</p><p id="P34">Contrary to this, AF2 predicted with very high accuracy the new experimental structures.

Side chain rotamers and disulfide bond conformations were nearly identical, and interactions between secondary structure elements were predicted with high precision. Interestingly, this was true even in the case of MAX28 whose AF2 model had a MAX pLDDT score of only 74. These findings highlighted that AF2 predicts MAX effector structures in a highly reliable and precise manner even at relatively low pLDDT scores. Similar observations were made in other recent studies where experimentally resolved structures of fungal effectors were compared with AF2 predictions, as for example in the case of LARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], FOLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and RALPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] effectors.

Major distinctive features are additional structured regions in the C-terminus characteristic of certain subfamilies. Groups A to D have one or two additional strands and groups E to G possess helical extensions. These regions presumably act in protein-protein interactions or contribute to overall functionality of the effectors. Notably, our study uncovered a domain duplication event within one of the MAX effector clusters (group H).

The MMseqs2 MSA was obtained from the MMseqs2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>] web server as implemented in the ColabFold version of AlphaFold 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. We also used the version of AlphaFold 2.2.0 that builds MSAs by Jackhmmer on uniclust, mgnify and uniref90 databases. These two implementations use PDB templates. Finally, a <italic>Custom</italic> MSA was build from Muscle_v3.8.31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>] by inserting (-profile option) the query sequence on top of a previously computed MSA, termed ß1ß4_MSA. The ß1ß4_MSA was build from a Muscle alignment of the OG sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S1 Table</xref>) by filtering out those having the two flanking cysteine residues in the ß1 and in the loop between ß4 and ß5 strands not correctly aligned to the 8 3D template sequences. The ß1ß4_MSA was further processed by truncating the sequences by eliminating residues (-2 included) before and (+2 included) after the first and last aligned cysteine residues, respectively, and filtering out for redundant sequences by C<sc>D-HIT</sc>, giving a total size of 247 aligned sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">S6 Table</xref>). For each query, the consistency of the <italic>Custom</italic> MSA was determined by checking the correct alignment of the cysteine residues in the query and in the appended ß1ß4_MSA.

For models having the MAX topology, a MAX pLDDT score that was an average score of residues in the MAX core domain (including residues from ß1 to ß6) was calculated. For each query, the best AF2 MAX model was selected when the MAX pLDDT score was above 60.

summary</title></caption><p>MAX effectors are a family of virulence proteins from the plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Pyricularia (syn. Magnaporthe) oryzae</italic> that share a similar 3D structure despite very low amino-acid sequence identity. Characterizing the function and evolution of these proteins requires a detailed understanding of their structural diversity. With this in mind, we have determined the NMR structures of four new MAX effectors and shown a near-perfect match with the corresponding AlphaFold2 (AF2) models. We then applied a prediction pipeline based on similarity searches with structural modeling using the AF2 software to predict MAX effectors in a collection of 120 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> genomes. The resulting models and experimental structures revealed that the MAX core while preserved is highly permissive to secondary structure variations and may coexists with extensive structural diversity in terms of structured N- or C-terminal extensions permitting their classification. For a subset of AF2 models, we have also analyzed the physico-chemical properties of the core domain surfaces, adding another, more functional perspective, notably surface electrostatics and stickiness. This work constitutes a major step in understanding the relationships among MAX effectors by analyzing their structural landscape and cataloguing specific physico-chemical properties. It also provides valuable insights for guiding research into the putative targets of these effectors in infected plant hosts.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Structure of the M. oryzae ToxB (MoToxB) MAX effector</title><p>Primary and secondary structure of MoToxB showing the triple-stranded beta-sandwich forming the conserved MAX core with the two beta-sheets labeled by A and B, strands indicated by arrows and two disulfide bonds in yellow dotted lines.

C) 2D maps of exposed ß-strands, electrostatic potential and stickiness of the molecular surfaces calculated by SURFMAP for MAX domains extracted from AF2 models of MAX effectors with known structure. N- and C-terminal extensions were discarded and the MAX core 3D models were all superimposed to AF_MAX33 (MoToxB) giving a reference frame for the Sanson-Flamsteed 2D projection computed surfaces. The ß-strand maps use the color code given in panel B. The ß1-exposed surface is mostly discontinuous around the ß2 surface that is located at the northern pole of the projection. The continuous ß3 surface lies below the ß2 surface and the discontinuous ß4 surface is found at the bottom of the projection. The ß6 surfaces are found to the west and east of the ß1-ß2 surface areas whereas ß5 surfaces are found on the most eastern areas. The electrostatic potential maps are scaled in the indicated kT/e units and the stickiness (related to hydrophobicity) scale is that defined by Levy E. D., 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].

Stickiness values were summed for residues forming each of the 6 ß-strands of the MAX core domains and normalized by the highest value calculated for each strand in the subset of 49 MAX core

The groups with major structural variations (addition of secondary structures) are listed in the left-hand panels, including the MAX domain duplication of MAX52. The remaining groups, from I to O that do not have additional secondary structural elements but displayed specific structural variations of the MAX core domain itself are shown in the right-hand panels. To complete the overview, the five groups of well-established MAX effectors (AVR-Pia, AVR-Pib, AVR-PikC, AvrPiz-t and MoToxB) are shown at the bottom and highlighted in grey color. The MAX Id column gives the AF model identifiers of the MAX effector list reported in the present study (representative MAX model indicated in bold) and the corresponding MAX effectors reported by Seong &amp; Krasileva, 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]; Seong and Krasileva, 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]; Yan and Talbot, 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] in the P. oryzae strain 70-15 are referred to by their MGG identifier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">S8 Table</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="TFN2"><label>*</label><p id="P57">Type of disulfide bond as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref></p></fn><fn id="TFN3"><label>**</label><p id="P58">from crystallographic structures of complexes</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
