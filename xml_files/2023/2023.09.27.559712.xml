Furthermore, this delivery strategy can be combined with the sustained release of nanoparticles to enhance the therapeutic potential in a wide variety of pathological scenarios. Among the different types of nanoparticles that can be included in microneedle formulations, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) of tuneable pore sizes constitute a promising tool as drug delivery systems for cargos of a wide range of molecular weights. However, the development of efficient methods to produce DMAP containing large amounts of MSNs of different pore sizes has not been reported. In this work, DMAP containing MSNs with varying pore sizes was prepared and characterized. After synthesizing and characterizing MSNs, the pore size of the nanoparticles (in the range of 3 to 13 nm for S-MSN and XL-MSN, respectively) was observed to influence the loading and release of both small and large molecules, using fluorescein and ovalbumin (OVA) as model cargos. Moreover, a new preparation method was developed to produce DMAP containing large amounts of these MSNs located mainly in the microneedle tips. The successful insertion of these DMAPs was confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> (using Parafilm), <italic>ex vivo</italic> (using excised neonatal porcine skin) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (in the back of mice) models. The dissolution of the microneedles and deposition of the nanoparticles inside the skin were also confirmed both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using fluorescent nanoparticles, with complete microneedle dissolution after 2 h of insertion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Through histological studies, the microneedle-delivered MSNs were found to end up inside antigen presenting cells in the skin tissue (either F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages or CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells). For this reason, the uptake and biological effect of the MSNs was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> in dendritic cells, showing that while smaller pore MSNs were taken up by cells more efficiently (with over 80 % of S-MSN uptake compared to <italic>ca</italic>. 55 % for XL-MSNs), the dendritic cells treated with OVA-loaded XL-MSNs underwent the largest degree of activation (inducing over 25 % of CD40 expression compared to less than 2 % for OVA-loaded S- MSNs). Finally, the immune response to OVA-loaded XL-MSNs in mice was evaluated after repeated administration either subcutaneously or through DMAP. The results of this experiment showed comparable levels of anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulin generation through both routes of administration (with significant production of OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies), highlighting the good potential of this delivery platform for vaccination or immunotherapy applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dissolving microneedle array patches (DMAPs) are arrays of needle-like structures with microscale diameters and lengths up to 1 mm mainly made using polymers that dissolve with the interstitial fluid after their insertion into the skin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Given their small size, when they are inserted in the skin, while they enable the deposition of drugs inside the upper layers of the skin (and across the external barrier of <italic>the stratum corneum</italic>), they do not reach blood vessels or pain receptors, not producing any bleeding or pain. For this reason, they are often proposed as an alternative drug administration option without the need for conventional injections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. DMAPs have been proposed for a wide variety of therapeutic applications, such as vaccines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], cancer treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], migraines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], fungal infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], psoriasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] or malaria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], among many others. Within the polymer matrix that makes up the microneedles, different micro- or nano-particle based formulations can be included to improve the therapeutic performance of the formulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. For example, if nanoparticles with sustained drug release are administered through DMAP, their deposition inside the skin creates a reservoir of the drug at the site of administration, which is slowly released from the nanoparticles, reducing the need for continuous re-administration of the treatment. Based on this concept, DMAP has been prepared containing many types of nanoparticles, such as liposomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], cubosomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], polymeric nanoparticles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], metallic nanoparticles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Among these different types of nanoparticles, MSNs with tunable pore sizes (generally in the range of 2-20 nm in diameter[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]) constitute a particularly promising tool as drug delivery systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], as they present a large loading capacity for cargos of a wide range of molecular weights[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. MSNs have been proven to be safe and to undergo dissolution in physiological environments, giving rise to nontoxic degradation products such as silicic acid, which can be safely excreted in urine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Several microneedle arrays (either dissolving or nondissolving) containing MSNs have been previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, the amount of MSNs contained in these previously reported formulations was relatively low and would likely not be enough to deliver a therapeutically relevant dose of drug for most potential applications. Furthermore, the possibility of preparing DMAP with MSNs of different pore sizes has not previously been reported to the best of our knowledge. The development of an efficient method to prepare DMAP containing large quantities of MSNs of different pore sizes would provide a tunable platform that could be adapted for many different therapeutic applications, as the pore size of the nanoparticles could be tailored for the desired drug[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], and might even allow for combination therapies in which a mixture of different MSN formulations (each optimized for a different drug) could be codelivered through a single DMAP. In this work we report for the first time a simple method to obtain DMAP containing large amounts of MSNs of tuneable mesopore sizes. Different nanoparticle-containing DMAP formulations were prepared and characterized, and their therapeutic potential was assessed through a variety of <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> methods. The modular platform presented here could be adapted to deliver sustained release formulations of therapeutic molecules over a wide range of molecular weights, either as monotherapies or as combination therapies with multiple drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="P3">The following reagents were purchased from Merck (Sigma−Aldrich, Spain) and were used without further purification: tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), cyclohexane, triethanolamine, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), ammonium nitrate, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC), aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), fluorescein sodium salt, ovalbumin (OVA), phosphate buffered saline (PBS) tablets, polyvinyl alcohol 9-10 kDa (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 30 (PVP, 40 kDa), agarose, Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 culture medium, fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol.

The aqueous phase was composed of a mixture of 24 mL of a commercial aqueous solution of CTAC (25% w/v)), 0.18 g of triethanolamine and 36 mL of deionized water. The organic phase consisted of 20 mL of a mixture of cyclohexane with TEOS. The concentration of TEOS depended on the material to be prepared: 40% for S-MSNs, 20% for M-MSNs, 10% for L-MSNs and 5% for XL-MSNs. The synthesis reaction was carried out at 50°C for 24 h. Then, the surfactant was extracted by ion exchange with an ethanolic solution of ammonium nitrate (10 mg/mL) at reflux for 1 h, followed by a second reflux for 2 h in an ethanolic solution of 12 mM HCl. Finally, the material was washed with ethanol 3 times to obtain the desired materials, which were dried and stored at room temperature until further use.

Five- to six-week-old BALB/c mice (both male and female, n=3 mice per group) from Janvier Lab (Saint-Berthevin Cedex, France) were used. For DMAP administration, back hair was first removed from the mice by using a hair-removal cream under intraperitoneal anaesthesia (xylazine + ketamine mixture). After washing the skin with saline solution to remove the cream and gently drying it with paper, the DMAP was inserted on the back skin by applying appropriate pressure for 30 seconds with the mice still under anaesthesia, and then adhesive tape was used to fix the DMAP in the same position. After 2 h, the baseplates were removed, and excess polymer on the skin surface (not inserted) was removed with PBS. After different time points, nanoparticle fluorescence in the mice was examined using an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging system. At the endpoint (3 days after DMAP administration), the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under anaesthesia, and the skin was observed by fluorescence microscopy.

The nanoparticle surface charge was negative for all the prepared MSNs, as would be expected by the presence of silanol groups on the external surface of silica nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The round morphology and porosity of the MSNs could also be observed in the TEM micrographs of the prepared nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The textural properties of the prepared MSNs were further confirmed by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All the materials presented large surface areas (in the range of 300-700 m<sup>2</sup>/g), typical of mesoporous silica materials. The pore diameters obtained by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption confirm the successful preparation of MSNs with 4 different pore sizes, in the range of 3 to 12 nm (S-MSN&lt;M- MSN&lt;L-MSN&lt;XL-MSN). These results were in good agreement with the characteristics of MSNs prepared by other authors using the same method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P16">The effect of pore size on cargo loading and release was evaluated using fluorescein sodium salt as a model for small molecule drugs and OVA as a model for therapeutic proteins and macromolecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The loading of OVA was maximum for extralarge pore particles (XL-MSN) and decreased as pore size was reduced. This result was in good agreement with previous reports that have also shown that MSNs with extralarge pore sizes presented increased OVA loading compared to particles with smaller pores[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. On the other hand, fluorescein sodium salt loading was maximum for particles with small or medium pores (S-MSN and M-MSN) and drastically decreased for particles with larger pores. These data indicate that to obtain optimal cargo loading in MSNs, the pores should be large enough to accommodate the cargo, but if the pore size is too large, the loading efficiency decreases. Thus, the pore size should be tuned depending on the molecular weight of the cargo, requiring smaller pores for small molecules and larger pores for macromolecules such as proteins. Despite this, when cargo release experiments were carried out, larger pore particles presented faster release kinetics for both model cargos, as the larger pores provide easier accessibility to the solvent, which drives release. This result is also in good agreement with previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, taking these results into account, a combination therapy scheme could be envisioned where drugs of different molecular weights can be coadministered in a cocktail of MSNs of varying pore sizes, each one of which is optimized for one of the drugs in the combination.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>3.2</label><title>Preparation and characterization of MSN-loaded DMAP</title><p id="P17">Then, DMAP-containing MSNs of different pore sizes were prepared using PVP and PVA (2 water-soluble polymers).

When larger percentages of MSNs were included in the polymer mixture, its viscosity was too high to properly fill the mold used to obtain DMAP. As our aim was to prepare DMAP with a large amount of MSNs located in the microneedle tips, we developed an alternative method by first filling the mold with MSNs in powder form and later adding the polymers in solution. After following this process, the stereomicroscopy images of the obtained DMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) confirm the successful preparation of the desired arrays presenting well-defined microneedles of the expected length (<italic>ca</italic>. 750 μm) and with intact tips. No morphological differences were found between the blank DMAP (without nanoparticles) and those containing the different types of MSNs. Furthermore, the SEM micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3P-Y</xref>) confirm the presence of MSNs, which make up most of the microneedle tips, as seen in the higher magnification micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3U-Y</xref>). These results confirm the preparation of DMAP in which the majority of the microneedle tips are composed of MSNs, in contrast with previous reports, where the amount of MSNs included in DMAP formulations was relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, as only the microneedle tips will be inserted inside the skin upon DMAP application, the MSNs should be selectively located in the microneedle tips to avoid unnecessary wastage of drug-loaded particles in future therapeutic applications of these formulations. To confirm the location of the MSNs within the patches, FITC-labelled M-MSNs were prepared and used to obtain DMAP. The stereomicroscopy and two-photon fluorescence microscopy images obtained from these formulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) confirm the presence of the MSNs only in the microneedle tips.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><label>3.3</label><title>
<italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> evaluation of MSN-loaded DMAP</title><p id="P18">The mechanical properties of the prepared DMAP and whether they allow for their insertion in skin were first evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> using a previously reported Parafilm M® model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. DMAP insertion was evaluated either using a Texture Analyser applying 32 N for 30 seconds or by manually applying thumb pressure for 30 seconds. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) show that the insertion of all the prepared DMAP was similar when inserted in the same way, regardless of whether the DMAP contained any kind of MSN. Furthermore, the DMAPs were inserted more efficiently by manual application (successfully piercing through the 3<sup>rd</sup> Parafilm M® layer, with a depth of 378 μm) compared to the ones inserted using the Texture Analyser equipment (which only reached the 2<sup>nd</sup> layer, at a depth of 252 μm). These results are in good agreement with previous reports of microneedle patches that show similar insertion in the Parafilm M® model, as well as deeper insertion upon manual force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Finally, the mechanical properties of the prepared DMAP were also proven to be adequate for further evaluation, as there was no significant change (p&gt;0.54) in microneedle length after insertion in the Parafilm M® model, neither by manual nor Texture Analyser application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> dissolution of the different DMAP formulations in aqueous media was also confirmed by immersing them in PBS. Three minutes after immersion, the microneedles of all DMAP were fully dissolved, as observed by stereomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). By dissolving in PBS DMAP containing FITC-labelled M-MSNs and then measuring the fluorescence of the resulting suspensions, the amount of nanoparticles loaded in each DMAP could be estimated to be 2.33 ± 0.04 mg M-MSNs/DMAP.</p><p id="P19">The next step was to evaluate the insertion and dissolution of DMAP in neonatal porcine skin, which will provide more relevant information towards the potential use of these formulations in humans. After manual <italic>ex vivo</italic> application in porcine skin, the OCT images confirm the successful insertion of the microneedles inside the porcine skin, with an average insertion length of 472 ± 26.7 μm (62.9 ± 3.5% of the total microneedle length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the successful dissolution of the microneedles inserted in the skin was also observed, with partial dissolution taking place in DMAP inserted for 30 min at 37°C and reaching almost complete dissolution at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). At this time (60 min), the amount of FITC-labelled M-MSNs that had been deposited in the skin was 0.75 ± 0.02 mg, which was 20.9 ± 7.26% of the total amount present in the DMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">As seen in the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, cargo loading and release in MSNs is strongly affected by the interaction between cargo molecular weight and the pore size of the nanoparticles. For this reason, we postulate the potential use of combinations of MSNs of various pore sizes for combined drug codelivery, where each type of MSN is optimized for one drug in the mix. With this goal in mind, the next step was to evaluate whether the method developed to prepare DMAP would enable patches with combinations of different MSNs to be obtained. To evaluate this, we selected MSNs that presented optimal loading for each of the model molecules previously used: M-MSNs (which presented the largest fluorescein sodium salt loading capacity) and XL-MSNs (which presented the largest OVA loading capacity). To visualize each type of particle independently, we prepared and used differently labelled MSNs: FITC-labelled M-MSNs and RITC-labelled XL-MSNs. After mixing (in suspension) both types of MSNs in a 1:1 weight ratio and drying the combination, the MSN mix was used to prepare DMAP following the same method as previously described. The characterization of these new DMAPs confirms the successful preparation of DMAPs containing a combination of MSNs of different pore sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3, Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, DMAP containing a combination of FITC-labelled M-MSNs and RITC-labelled XL-MSNs presented analogous insertion and nanoparticle deposition in neonatal porcine skin as those previously evaluated containing only one MSN type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4, Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In a potential future application of these DMAPs, after insertion and microneedle dissolution, drug-loaded MSNs will be deposited inside the skin. The fate of both MSNs and their cargo after deposition in the skin should therefore also be evaluated to determine the potential of these formulations. To evaluate the diffusion of both the nanoparticles and their cargo, DMAP with 2 different nanoparticle systems was prepared: FITC-labelled M-MSNs (to analyse the fate of the nanoparticles) and fluorescein sodium salt-loaded M-MSNs (to analyse the fate of the fluorescent cargo as a model for a drug being released from the nanoparticles). In the first experiment, an agarose gel was used as a model for skin tissue. After insertion of DMAP, the microneedles dissolve and leave the MSNs inside the agarose gel. One hour later, sections of the gel were cut and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) show that while the MSNs remain in the site of deposition, the cargo (fluorescein sodium salt) diffuses out of the nanoparticles and into the gel. This would indicate that the nanoparticles would remain in the site of insertion, acting as a depot system and providing a sustained release of the drug to the surrounding skin tissue. To confirm these results, a second experiment was carried out in a Franz cell setup. The same DMAP as those from the previous experiment (plus an additional control DMAP with nonencapsulated fluorescein sodium salt) were inserted in neonatal porcine skin that acted as the membrane separating the donor and receptor compartments. At different time points, samples were taken from the receptor compartment, and the amount of FITC-labelled M-MSNs or free fluorescein sodium salt was evaluated by fluorimetry. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) confirm those from the previous experiment, showing that MSNs are not capable of diffusing through the skin tissue, as no nanoparticle fluorescence was detected in the receptor compartment. On the other hand, fluorescein sodium salt crosses through the skin tissue after being deposited with DMAP. Importantly, encapsulation of the dye inside M-MSNs provided sustained release compared to the use of DMAP with a nonencapsulated fluorophore. Taken together, these results indicate that the MSNs deposited in the skin through DMAP remain at the site of insertion and act as a drug reservoir. Then, the sustained release of the drug would provide a continuous flow of the drug towards both the surrounding tissue or even systemic circulation (depending on the release kinetics and dose of the drug or nanoparticles included in the patches).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3.4</label><title>
<italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation of MSN-loaded DMAP</title><p id="P22">Once the characteristics and performance of MSN-loaded DMAP had been evaluated through the different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments described above, a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> tests were carried out using a mouse model to examine the therapeutic potential of the developed platform. First, the <italic>in vivo</italic> insertion, microneedle dissolution and nanoparticle deposition were evaluated by a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescence and <italic>ex vivo</italic> fluorescence stereomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The results confirm the successful insertion, microneedle dissolution and nanoparticle deposition, as nanoparticle fluorescence is clearly visible in both the <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescence imaging and the <italic>ex vivo</italic> fluorescence stereomicroscopy images 3 days after DMAP administration to the mice. The insertion of the DMAP was successful in both male and female mice, requiring 2 hours of insertion for almost complete microneedle dissolution in the skin (with only partial dissolution after 1 h). In the <italic>ex vivo</italic> fluorescence stereomicroscopy images, the microneedle pattern is clearly visible in the green fluorescence, confirming successful nanoparticle deposition in DMAP- treated mice (both male and female), while no fluorescence was observed in the skin of control animals. The quantification of the total amount of deposited FITC-labelled M-MSNs (carried out using the same method as described for the <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments in neonatal porcine skin) provided an estimation of 134.2 ± 79.3 μg of MSNs deposited inside the mouse skin per DMAP application.</p><p id="P23">Using the DMAP-inserted skin samples from the previous experiment, the fate of the deposited nanoparticles was also evaluated by confocal microscopy using immunofluorescent labelling. In previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments, we observed that deposited MSNs remain in the site of insertion without significant diffusion into the surrounding skin tissue. However, these experiments were performed in the absence of living cells in the skin tissue that might engulf the nanoparticles and determine their final fate and biological performance. Two different types of fluorescent labels were used: F4/80 staining (a traditional marker for macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]) and CD11c staining (a traditional marker for dendritic cells)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]). In agreement with previous reports, we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>) that the majority of the dermal cells in mouse skin express F4/80, while a much smaller percentage express CD11c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In any case, most of the dermal cells are antigen-presenting cells, either F4/80<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup>. Green fluorescence from the nanoparticles was found in all tissue sections around cell nuclei (stained with DAPI), indicating that the nanoparticles are taken up by dermal cells after deposition in the skin from DMAP. Nanoparticle fluorescence was observed inside antigen-presenting cells (which were also positive for either F4/80 or CD11c, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9E, F, K, L</xref>). As the MSNs deposited in the skin through DMAP were then taken up by antigen presenting cells, a potential application of these systems would be in vaccination or immunotherapy as carriers of different antigens to the target immune cells in the skin. To evaluate the biological effect of antigen-loaded MSNs in antigen-presenting cells, an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment was first carried out using a mouse cell line commonly employed as a model for dendritic cells (DC2.4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]). The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">results (Figure S6)</xref> show that DC2.4 cells efficiently uptake MSNs, with a clear pore size effect, as XL-MSNs presented a lower uptake % compared to all other types of MSNs. When the activation of DC2.4 cells was evaluated (by quantifying the % of cells expressing CD40 by flow cytometry), the results showed that OVA-loaded XL-MSNs induced the largest degree of dendritic cell activation, decreasing the % of CD40<sup>+</sup> cells as the nanoparticle pore size decreased. Furthermore, treatment with free OVA in the absence of a nanocarrier, even at high concentrations (up to 4 μg/mL), did not induce significant cell activation. These results are in good agreement with previous reports that showed that MSN pore size regulates their antigen delivery efficiency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], with extralarge pore MSNs loaded with OVA (similar to the ones prepared in this work) being the optimal antigen delivery system.</p><p id="P24">In previous reports, the good potential of XL-MSNs as antigen delivery systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] was evaluated by subcutaneous injection in mice. While subcutaneous injection is known to produce a strong immune response, the need for trained personnel and the pain associated with the injection could be improved with a needle-free administration system such as the one proposed here. In some applications, there are also safety concerns associated with subcutaneous administration, such as in allergy immunotherapy, in which an undesired allergic reaction to the treatment can be triggered in subcutaneous immunotherapy (with some reports indicating an improved safety profile of microneedle-assisted allergy immunotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]). To evaluate the prospects of MSN-loaded DMAP for immunization, OVA-loaded XL-MSNs were administered 3 times (weekly) in BALB/c mice either subcutaneously or in DMAP (equivalent nanoparticle dose in both types of administration). OVA-loaded XL-MSNs were used since despite presenting a lower uptake %, their capacity to activate DC2.4 cells was higher. One week after the last administration, blood was obtained, and OVA-specific antibodies were evaluated in sera by ELISA. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>) show comparable humoral responses between subcutaneous and DMAP-mediated administration of OVA-loaded XL-MSNs, with significant production of anti-OVA IgG1 and IgG2b compared to nontreated control mice. On the other hand, no significant differences were found between control and nanoparticle-treated mice in the production of specific anti-OVA IgG2a or IgE. These results highlight the promising nature of the developed platform for vaccination or immunotherapy through needle-free administration. Future work will explore the combination of MSNs carrying an immunomodulatory adjuvant with antigen-carrying MSNs for different therapeutic applications, as this work has demonstrated the possibility of preparing DMAP with combinations of different types of MSNs tailored for various therapeutic molecules of a wide range of molecular weights.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P25">In this work, dissolving microneedle array patches containing large amounts of mesoporous silica nanoparticles of different pore sizes were prepared and characterized. The developed method also enabled the preparation of microneedle array patches containing a combination of different mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which could be useful for the development of combination therapies codelivering different therapeutic cargos. The successful insertion, dissolution and nanoparticle deposition from the microneedles was confirmed through a series of <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. As the microneedle-delivered mesoporous silica nanoparticles were found to end up inside antigen presenting cells in the skin tissue, a particularly promising application of these systems would be in vaccination or immunotherapy applications. To confirm this potential application, the immune response to ovalbumin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles in mice was evaluated, showing comparable levels of specific antibody generation after subcutaneous or microneedle-mediated delivery. Based on the promising results presented here, future work will further evaluate the therapeutic potential of this platform for immunotherapy in different disease scenarios, by developing microneedle codelivery systems containing antigenic and adjuvant molecules encapsulated in optimized mesoporous silica nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS188901-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Institute of Health “Carlos III” (ISCIII) (PI21/00346), cofounded by the European Union, and by the project PID2022-142781OA-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/FEDER, UEU.
