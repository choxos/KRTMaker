Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow researchers to predict protein-lipid interaction sites and generate testable models. MD simulations are however computationally expensive and require specialist expertise. In this study, we demonstrate that graph neural networks trained on coarse-grained MD simulation data can predict phosphoinositide lipid interaction sites on Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain structures, a large family of membrane binding domains. The predictions are comparable to the results of simulations and require only seconds to compute. Comparison with experimental data shows that the model can predict known phosphoinositide interaction sites and can be used to form hypotheses for PH domains for which there is no experimental data. This model is a next generation tool for predicting protein-lipid interactions of PH domains and offers a basis for further development of models applicable to other membrane protein classes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The transient association of peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) with the surface of cell and organelle membranes is a vital physiological process, which plays a critical role in cellular signalling, metabolism, transport, defence and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). PMPs are known to bind to membranes through multiple physical mechanisms including non-specific electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions with the membrane core, curvature sensing, cation-π interactions and molecular recognition of particular lipid species from the complex population of lipids present in physiological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Due to their implication in a number of disease processes and their potential for allosteric modulation, drugging the protein-membrane interface of PMPs represents a promising but somewhat under-utilised therapeutic modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A major limitation in peripheral membrane protein research lies in the difficulty in experimentally identifying protein-lipid interaction sites and characterizing these in molecular detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Through structural biology techniques the 3-dimensional atomic structure of PMPs can be determined, but in such structures bound lipids are commonly lost, poorly/partially resolved or do not reveal the lipid identity. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have enabled the resolution of ordered and tightly-bound lipids in some cases, but this is mostly limited to integral rather than peripheral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). A plethora of biophysical techniques allow the measurement of the thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane association and of lipid-binding specificity, but these can be laborious, difficult to perform in a high-throughput fashion and they do not typically reveal all the molecular details of the protein-lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Native mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool for the identification of protein-lipid interaction sites on integral membrane proteins, but to date few studies have applied this technique to peripheral membrane protein-lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Computational methods, particularly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, can partially mitigate these difficulties by enabling researchers to computationally study membrane protein interactions and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Notably, MD simulations allow the de novo identification and detailed molecular characterization of protein-lipid interaction sites. Integration of predictions from MD simulations with experimental approaches has had significant impact on our understanding of protein-lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The computational cost of MD simulations can be reduced by coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD), which enables the simulation of larger systems for longer timescales although at lower resolution than fully-atomistic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Despite the reduced resolution, CGMD simulations have proven capable of correctly identifying crystallographic lipid binding sites on PMPs and have predicted additional interaction sites which are missing in crystal structures (likely too weak/disordered) but consistent with additional experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The reduced simulation time of CGMD simulations and availability of increasing computational capability has allowed high-throughput simulations of protein-lipid interactions in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Despite these successes, MD simulations have the limitations of requiring access to high performance computing infrastructure, computational expertise and substantial computation time (even for CGMD simulations), with associated environmental costs. This prevents widespread use of high throughput MD simulations and limits the accessibility of these techniques to a wider community of researchers. There is therefore a need for alternative computational tools which could provide similar insights into membrane biology as MD simulations, but with reduced computational cost and accessibility requirements. Machine learning presents an attractive avenue to build such next generation tools for computational membrane biology, but requires suitable datasets of protein-lipid interactions to train on.</p><p id="P6">We recently presented a dataset of high-throughput MD simulations of the interactions of 100 pleckstrin homology (PH) domains with a complex plasma membrane model, and demonstrated the capability of the simulations to correctly identify experimentally verified sites of interaction with anionic phosphoinositide lipids, and to provide insights missing from the experimental datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). PH domains are the largest family of membrane binding protein domains present in the Pfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Comprised, on average, of approximately 140 amino acids, PH domains are defined by their conserved structural motif, consisting of a 7-stranded beta-barrel, capped at one end of the barrel with a C-terminal alpha helix. The other, uncapped end of the barrel typically presents a positively polarised interface for membrane interaction. The variable loop regions between the strands are enriched in basic amino acids which facilitate membrane binding through interaction with anionic lipid headgroups, especially phosphoinositides (PIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Several PH domains are known for their high affinity binding to phosphoinositide lipids at a so-called canonical site in the open uncapped end of the barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). The prevalence of specific phosphoinositide binding properties within the family has been difficult to elucidate, but the most recent investigation concluded that at least half of all human PH domain containing proteins bind specifically to phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). The classical view of PH domain membrane binding, based on the early crystallographic evidence, involves membrane binding driven by high affinity one-to-one binding of a phosphoinositide molecule at the canonical site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Developments in recent years have unveiled further complexity, including non-canonical phosphoinositide binding sites, the possibility of multiple lipid binding and coincidence sensing, the role of generic interaction with anionic and zwitterionic lipids, and lipid clustering in the recruitment of PH domains to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study we used our previously published MD simulation dataset to train light-weight neural network models utilising a graph attention mechanism to predict the phosphoinositide interaction sites, and to assess their accuracy and speed compared with the results of MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Here we show that this new tool allows researchers without access to, or expertise in, MD simulations to rapidly obtain predictions of protein-lipid interactions for their PH domain(s) of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Light weight fully-connected graph attention network model to predict phosphoinositide interaction sites on PH domains</title><p id="P8">Due to the general importance for PH domains of interactions with phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids over all other lipids, we have focussed in this work on predicting PIP interacting sites. The training and validation data consists of CGMD simulations of the membrane binding of 100 PH domains to a complex model of the human plasma membrane inner leaflet. From this dataset we have for every residue of each PH domain annotations of the frequency with which it was in contact with the headgroup of a phosphoinositide (PIP<sub>3</sub> or PIP<sub>2</sub>) molecule during the final 200 ns of the simulation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">methods</xref>). As this contact frequency is convolved with the overall membrane binding affinity of the PH domain, it is convenient for comparison between PH domains to normalize this data by the maximum frequency of contacts exhibited by a single residue in the PH domain, as reported in other simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). This gives the normalized contact frequency, a number between 0 and 1, representing the relative probability of contact with a phosphoinositide headgroup; the residue with the value of 1 is the residue with the highest probability of interacting with the lipid. The normalized contact frequency observed in the MD simulations provides the reference ground truth data which we aim to train the model to predict. Rather than training the model to predict the normalized contact frequency directly however, we chose to train the model to predict the contact frequency (not normalized), performed normalization outside of the training loop, and assessed the performance between the normalized predicted frequency of contacts and the normalized ground truth data. This decision was based on early empirical evidence that normalization outside of the training loop provided better performance, but without exhaustively testing many possible alternative training settings or network designs.</p><p id="P9">To predict PH domain/PIP interactions, a graph attention model was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In this model we represent the protein as a fully-connected graph, where each amino acid is a node which is connected to all other aminos acids by an edge for which we include a 4-dimensional feature vector containing the Euclidean distance and the unit vector in the direction α-carbon<sub>A</sub> −&gt; α-carbon<sub>B</sub> determined from the protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). At the node level, each amino acid is represented by a 25-dimensional feature vector processed from the sequence and structure. The node feature vectors consists of the one-hot encoding of amino acid identity (a 20-dimensional categorical representation where the position corresponding to the selected amino acid has the value 1, and all other positions have the value 0), the one-hot encoding of DSSP simplified secondary structure class (3 dimensions, from the Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins algorithm), the Shrake-Rupley solvent accessibility (1 dimension) and the total elementary charge within an 8 Å radius of the amino acid α-carbon (1 dimension). Representing the protein as a fully-connected graph of residues, rather than an alternative more sparse connectivity (selected for example by k-nearest neighbours, radial distance or sequence neighbourhood) allows the model to decide for itself which neighbouring or distant amino acids to pay attention to when predicting a residue’s lipid interactions. Although individual lipid interaction sites will be formed by local clusters of amino acids, the effects of more distant amino acids can also be relevant; for example distant lipid interaction sites may either cooperatively enhance or compete with one another, depending on their geometrical relationship with respect to the each other and whether it is possible for both sites to be in contact with the membrane simultaneously. Neighbouring residues can furthermore be highly irrelevant for lipid interaction if they are for example likely to remain buried within the core of the protein and not surface exposed for membrane interaction. An attention mechanism based on GAT-v2 is used to weigh up the relevance (attention score) to each amino acid of the features of all connected aminos acids, taking into considering the amino acid node features and the geometrical information encoded in the edge features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). This enables the model to take into consideration the influence of both local and distant amino acid properties for predicting the lipid interactions of each amino acid. We use two multi-headed graph attention layers, followed by a fully-connected output layer.</p><p id="P10">The fully-connected graph attention architecture bears resemblance to multi-headed attention transformer models, which have been recently achieving excellent performance in language tasks and other domains. Although transformers and the fully-connected GATv2 model use a different attention mechanism, they are similar in the use of a global attention mechanism over a fully-connected graph, as the sequence inputs of transformers can also be thought of as fully-connected graphs, where the attention mechanism gives weights to the edges. However in contrast to transformers and conventional deep learning architectures we use a much smaller feature and parameter space (akin to classical machine learning methods) to avoid overfitting on the small dataset. By encoding geometrical information, the graph attention mechanism should furthermore allow the model to better account for geometrical relationships between amino acids in a protein compared with a sequence based model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). This approach allows us to balance the benefit from the more complex molecular representation available with graph deep neural network architectures with the better performance on small datasets offered by classical machine learning approaches. Further details of model architectures are provided in the Methods and Materials section.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Model cross-validation</title><p id="P11">Model performance was assessed using an extensive multiple k-fold cross-validation strategy. In k-fold cross-validation the data is partitioned randomly into k different folds/sets of training and validation data, such that every sample in the dataset is used as a validation sample in only one fold, and as a training sample in all of the (k-1) other folds. A model is trained and evaluated for each training and validation dataset pair (i.e. for each fold). K-fold cross-validation allows better evaluation of model performance than a single train-test fit, but at greater computational cost due to the requirement of training multiple models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). The choice of K is an important hyperparameter, with 10-fold cross-validation being the most commonly used; larger K allows more data for training but means the model is evaluated against a smaller validation set. Furthermore repeating K-fold cross-validation with different randomization seeds results in different combinations of training and testing data in each fold. As our light weight graph attention model is not computationally expensive to train, we have performed multiple k-fold cross validation with k = 5, 10 and 20. For each choice of k we further perform cross-validation using two different random seeds to even more thoroughly evaluate model performance across distinct partitionings of the data. The partitioning of the data for cross-validation is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p><p id="P12">Models were assessed on the basis of seven metrics: mean-squared error (MSE), Wasserstein distance (WS distance) and additionally the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1-score (a measure which incorporates both sensitivity and precision) at the task of predicting amino acids with ground truth normalized contacts &gt;= 0.8. MSE calculates the average error per amino acid, and serves also as the training loss function, but does not adequately measure the overall similarity in the shape of the predicted and ground truth distributions, or the capability of the model to identify the top lipid interacting amino acids. The Wasserstein distance provides a measure of overall dissimilarity between the predicted and true distribution (treating these as probability distributions), and can be thought of intuitively as the minimum amount of work (‘earth mover distance’) required to transform the predicted distribution into the ground truth distribution, if the distributions are to be thought of in the Euclidean space as equal mass mounds of dirt. WS distance was selected over other popular distribution metrics such as the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, because unlike KL divergence it is a symmetric metric which is sensitive to locality (i.e. distance in the protein sequence space). Lastly to estimate the capability of the models to detect the most important residues for the protein-lipid interaction, we selected an arbitrary normalized contacts threshold of 0.8 and measured the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1-score in identifying amino acids with normalized contacts &gt;= 0.8, treating this as a binary classification problem. This threshold was selected because we previously found, using the same MD simulation methodology in combination with biophysical experiments to study the peripheral membrane protein PLCγ1, that all amino acids with simulated phosphoinositide normalized contacts &gt;= 0.8 affected the membrane binding affinity of the protein experimentally and that this arbitrary cut-off would also be relevant for PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). These are by no means the only amino acids relevant for membrane binding, but high accuracy and especially sensitivity of predictions at this threshold would make the model a useful tool for identifying phosphoinositide interaction sites. As a baseline, a naive model predicting normalized contacts at random over the whole dataset was empirically found to have MSE = 0.23, mean WS distance = 12, sensitivity = 0.2, precision = 0.06 and F1 score = 0.09.</p><p id="P13">Summarised cross-validation metrics are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 1</xref>, with more detailed evaluation metrics provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>. The low variation in all metrics across extensive cross-validation tests indicates that the light weight graph attention architecture is capable of learning robust models which generalize well to unseen samples in the dataset. MSE error ~0.024 indicates strong overall predictive performance. In comparison with the most closely related work to this study, Wang et. al report an overall test set MSE of 0.048 for predicting generic lipid tail contact frequencies of structurally diverse integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Predicting phosphoinositide interaction sites on PH domains may be an easier task, due to the strong structural conservation of PH domains and the likely existence of sequence motifs predictive of phosphoinositide interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Sensitivity of ~0.74 at predicting normalized contacts at and above the 0.8 threshold shows good performance in identifying these most likely phosphoinositide interacting amino acids. An F1 score of ~0.69 where the positive class is a minority indicates a good balance between sensitivity and precision. False negatives, which are incorrectly predicted below the 0.8 threshold are still predicted on average at high values below the threshold, on average above the top 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of predicted values below 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Further examination of model performance</title><p id="P14">Our model provides excellent predictions for the vast majority of the PH domains that we have examined, but there are some cases in which there are greater limitations to its accuracy. The best performing results from the plcd1, IQSEC1, TBC1D2 and ARAP2 PH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>) exhibit remarkable performance, providing highly comparable predictions as the MD simulation with only small differences discernible by inspection. This can be seen in detail for the plcd1 PH domain visualized on the crystal structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. The model excellently predicts the key phosphoinositide interacting residues around the β1 and β2 strands, the β1-β2 loop and the β3-β4 loop, directly comparable to the MD simulation. The best and worst (on the basis of MSE) validation set predictions for all PH domains are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figures S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8</xref>.</p><p id="P15">Even though the results from the PLEKHA3 and btk PH domains are worst performing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E-F</xref>) both show generally good prediction of the lipid interaction sites but with some inaccuracies, where the model has overestimated the importance of some binding sites while underestimating others. The prediction for the btk PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) performs well for the first half of the sequence containing the main phosphoinositide interacting residues, but the model has inaccuracies in the second half of the sequence – it suggests false interactions in the β5-β6 loop and C-terminal α-helix, and fails to identify moderate interactions contributing to the canonical site by tyrosine, glycine and leucine residues on the β6 and β7 loops. A more detailed comparison of the ML prediction and the reference MD simulation is visualised on the protein structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p id="P16">The second half of the β5-β6 loop contains four lysine and arginine residues, which normally when present in this loop region form a non-canonical binding site as in the Arhgap9 PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). There is additionally a positively charged ridge along the C-terminal α-helix aligned along the same side of the β-barrel as these lysines and arginines in the β5-β6 loop; these are likely the cause for the model’s prediction of moderate interactions at these locations. However, the unusually extended β5-β6 loop of the btk PH domain contains 7 negatively charged glutamic acid and aspartic acid amino acids, which in the simulation neutralises the effect of the basic residues and repels this region away from the membrane, causing this PH domain to adopt a more upright orientation of the β-barrel on membrane rather than the side-on orientation adopted by PH domains such as Arhgap9 and as predicted by the ML model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). The model has in this case slightly erred in understanding how the global electrostatic properties will affect the overall orientation of the PH domain on the membrane. However, when examining the residues with the highest interaction, around the β1, β2, β3 and β4 loops, the model makes good predictions in reference to the MD simulation. Therefore despite being the worst from all the cross-validation datasets in terms of Wasserstein distance, the prediction is still quite meritorious in this regard, and would be useful (despite its deficiencies) to membrane biologists looking to gain computational insights into phosphoinositide interacting residues of the btk PH domain without running MD simulations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Evaluating predictions on out-of-dataset PH domain structures and comparison with experimental observables</title><p id="P17">To further assess the generalisability and practical applicability of the learned graph attention models it is fruitful to make predictions for PH domain structures not contained in the MD simulation dataset and for which structural data is available for the phosphoinositide binding sites. As the MD simulation dataset comprises almost all non-redundant human, rat and mouse PH domain structures published up to 2022, there are few PH domains suitable for this further analysis. Fortunately there is the human Arap3 PH1 domain structure solved in complex with the short-tailed phosphoinositide analogue diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, published in 2023 by Zhang et al., with additional NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Their data demonstrate specific recognition of diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in the canonical site, with key interactions with the headgroup stabilised by K296, R308, K329 and R355 and supplemented by S298, Q306 and Y319. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the predictions of a trained graph attention model for this structure (PDB ID: 7YIS), along with the position of the complexed diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> observed in the structure. Residues predicted by the model to have normalized frequency of contacts &gt;= 0.8 are displayed as blue sticks and labelled. This analysis excellently predicts all basic residues which interact with the crystallised diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in the canonical pocket. Outside the canonical site the model predicts six additional residues (R307, R341, K344, K347, R360 and R382) as additional residues with high probability of phosphoinositide headgroup interaction. The geometrical arrangement of these residues is striking, as they form an electropositive ridge along the top of the putative membrane-binding interface. It is highly plausible that these residues could enhance the overall membrane-binding affinity through additional interactions with phosphoinositides and other anionic lipids at the membrane interface, supplementing primary binding at the canonical site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR experiments indeed show chemical shift perturbation of R307, K347 and R360 above the mean upon addition of soluble diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, with R341 perturbation just below the mean and the residue K344 not resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). These perturbations were attributed to conformational change upon ligand binding to the canonical site, however interactions with diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> could also have this effect. Note that these experiments were performed with soluble phosphoinositide analogues and not with binding to a membrane model; it may be the case that the additional interactions outside of the canonical site could be dependent on the presence of the membrane interface. There was no perturbation at R382. The additional interactions, although plausible, may be false positives; nevertheless the model clearly demonstrates generalisability and practical usefulness by identifying the known locations of phosphoinositide interactions site and suggesting additional plausible sites which warrant further experimental investigations.</p><p id="P18">Similar realistic predictions are obtained for the yeast Slm1 PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), which is not in the training dataset as this is comprised only of mammalian PH domains. Crystal structures of the Slm1 PH domain in complex with inositol-4-phosphate resolve multiple non-canonical sites of phosphoinositol interaction, particularly at a pocket formed between R478 and Y485 as well at sites around the β6-β7 and β3-β4 loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Impressively the model predicts a high frequency of phosphoinositide interactions around all of the crystallographically observed sites. The model additionally proposes the existence of interactions at a more canonical-like site formed at R477. Binding is not observed here in the crystal structure, but mutagenesis studies probing putative lipid binding pockets of Slm1 PH found that the mutation R477A destabilized the membrane association of Slm1 PH at the eisosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). The graph attention model therefore shares the power of MD simulations to predict important phosphoinositide interaction sites which are absent in crystal structures.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Application to PH domains of unknown structure</title><p id="P19">Considering the highly conserved secondary structure pattern of PH domains, with only short disordered regions, AlphaFold predictions of the structures of PH domains may be expected to be quite reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>).

Smith et al. have explored the potential phosphoinositide binding of this PH domain by structural alignment and comparison of the AlphaFold model with known PH domains such as btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). From their alignment they proposed Q264, R272, K274, N303, and L342 as putative phosphoinositide interacting residues. Our model concurs with their analysis, predicting K274 and R272 as strongly interacting residues in the canonical site, alongside H294 and R267. Interestingly the model also highlights seven lysines and arginines oriented along the outward face of the β3 and β4 strands and their connecting loop. This is an usual feature among PH domains and in the absence of competing interactions at this interface (such as protein-protein interactions at the membrane) this highly positively charged face of the PH domain could direct its orientation on the membrane, causing it to adopt a side-on orientation similar to that observed in simulations of the Exoc8 PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P23">These examples demonstrate the practical application of our predictive model to PH domains of unknown structure and newly discovered PH domains. This can enable researchers to quickly get useful predictions of phosphoinositide interacting sites which can inform models of membrane interaction, guide experimental design and provide testable hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Prediction beyond PH domains</title><p id="P24">Despite the fact that the model has been trained using only data for PH domains, we also investigated its generalizability to PMPs which do not belong to the PH domain family. Phox Homology (PX) domains are another structurally conserved family of peripheral membrane protein domains of similar size to PH domains, and which bind to phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To examine the generalizability of the model on a PX domain, we selected the p40 PX domain as it was the first identified PX domain, a crystal structure (PDB ID: 1h6h) in complex with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is available, and there is further additional MD simulation data for the membrane association of p40 PX reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). The crystal structure has a conserved phosphoinositide binding site formed by R58, R60, K92 and R105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). MD simulations have furthermore identified a secondary binding site for phosphoinositide interaction facilitated by K32 and R33 in the β1-β2 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). All of these residues are presented in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure. 6A</xref>. The prediction of the graph attention model is presented for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, where residues predictive to have normalized frequencies of phosphoinositide contacts &gt;= 0.8 are also shown as red sticks. To our immense satisfaction, the model correctly identifies the key residues R58, R60, K92 (but not R105) of the crystallographic binding site, as well as the additional residues K32 and R33 in the β1-β2 region. The model predicts additional residues K46 and K52 as having high frequencies of phosphoinositide interactions but this is not supported by the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). The model is therefore making some surprisingly realistic inferences for this PX domain despite being trained only on PH domain data. We do not recommend using the model to make inferences for non-PH domains, as the generalization capability for such proteins has not been quantitatively and systematically evaluated and has been investigated here only for one protein. The results for p40 phox are however a promising indication that further generalization of the model could be achievable, perhaps by further training with an expanded dataset including other types of peripheral membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The light weight graph attention model allows rapid predictions</title><p id="P26">To estimate the time required for predictions we benchmarked the time for feature processing and inference without GPU acceleration, with a batch size of 1, using a consumer laptop with an 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 6800HS CPU, 16 GB of RAM and running Windows 11. Feature processing and inference were conducted for 100 PH domains. Import of python modules and the saved tensorflow model required ~16 seconds. Feature extraction and inference for the first two PH domains in the dataset required ~10 seconds and ~3 seconds respectively. All subsequent inferences required between 0.3 and 1 second for feature processing and inference. This data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. The slower time for the first two inferences can be attributed to a ‘warming up’ period of Tensorflow, arising from processes such as memory allocation and computation caching. The total time required to obtain inferences from 100 PH domain structures was ~80 seconds. This is incredibly fast performance on consumer grade hardware. For comparison, the underlying CGMD simulation data for each PH domain required 20 x ~23 hour simulations using 24 cores on high performance computing infrastructure to obtain convergence (approximately 46,000 hours of supercomputing time for the full dataset). The graph attention model therefore allows prediction of the normalized frequency of contacts with phosphoinositide headgroups for this dataset more than 6 orders of magnitude faster than the MD simulations and with an overall MSE of approximately ~0.024 relative to the simulations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">We have presented a graph neural network model for fast prediction of phosphoinositide lipid interaction sites on PH domains, which was trained on high throughput CGMD simulation data. The model exhibits excellent and robust performance across an extensive cross-validation assessment, with MSE of ~0.024 relative to the ground truth MD simulations. The model provides comparable predictions of phosphoinositide interacting residues as CGMD simulations but at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Further assessment using out of dataset PH domain structures and experimental data indicates good generalization to other PH domains, and this can be extended through the use of AlphaFold to PH domains of unknown structure.</p><p id="P28">The capability to rapidly predict sites of interactions of specific lipid types with peripheral membrane proteins is highly exciting on two fronts. Firstly, the high compute demand, computational expertise and hardware requirements limit the accessibility of molecular dynamics predictions to the more general community of membrane biology researchers. Our model for PH domains can be run in seconds on standard laptops and PCs, with minimal programming knowledge and software requirements. This makes the useful insights that can be attained by MD simulations easier to achieve and accessible to a wider community. Secondly, the rapid inference speed of our model opens up the possibility for prediction throughput unimaginable using MD simulations (but at reduced accuracy). Considering the importance of peripheral membrane proteins in cellular signalling and disease-linked processes, and the potential for drugging the protein-membrane interface, such a tool could be highly impactful for membrane biology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We note that the goal of this research is not to replace MD simulations (which we consider to be a method of superior accuracy and rigour), but to provide a substantially faster and more accessible tool that can provide similar predictions.</p><p id="P29">Recently, a few pioneering studies have explored the use of machine Learning (ML) for modelling membrane biology. Wang et al. trained a deep convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN), a model previously shown to perform well for secondary structure prediction from sequence, on the MemProtMD database of integral membranes protein simulations with a generic DPPC model bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). It was demonstrated that the DCRNN model could predict the contact probability (probability of coarse-grained particles &lt; 6 Å during the final 800 ns of simulation) between lipid acyl tails and each residue of the protein with a good accuracy (MSE = 0.048 on test set) when trained on 5000 membrane protein sequences from MemProtMD. Furthermore, incorporation of the membrane contact probability prediction was shown to improve integral membrane protein structural modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). In the case of peripheral membrane proteins, Chatzigoulas and Cournia recently assembled from the available experimental literature a dataset of 54 PMPs with known membrane-penetrating amino acids, and trained ensemble based classical machine learning classifiers to predict the membrane-penetrating residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Van Hilten et al. using a convolutional neural network and a dataset of 50000 CGMD simulations, were able to predict the membrane curvature sensing ability of short (7-24 amino acids) peptides with comparable accuracy to the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Nevertheless, the prediction of interaction sites for specific types of lipids found in complex physiological bilayers using machine learning has not yet been explored, likely due to the lack of datasets of such interactions. Despite being larger than other datasets used for modelling peripheral membrane proteins with machine learning, this 100 PH domain dataset is small from the point of view of machine learning, and 50-fold smaller than the dataset of integral membrane protein simulations used in the work of Wang et al.; avoiding overfitting to the small dataset was therefore a major consideration in our model design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Developing deep learning architectures which are effective for small datasets is an on-going problem in the field of deep learning research. We focussed especially on developing a light weight model architecture which can simultaneously harness the power of deep learning for learning complex relationships between amino acids while maintaining a small parameter size to avoid overfitting. We employed graph neural networks as these are well suited for representation of molecular structure, and selected a small feature space representing a small number of properties that we thought would be most relevant for predicting lipid interaction properties. We furthermore kept a small parameter size by using fewer hidden units per layer than normally employed in deep learning. These neural network design choices allowed us to benefit from the power of deep learning without overfitting the small dataset and also result in the astonishing prediction speed.</p><p id="P31">During this work PH domains have been modelled as individual and isolated protein structures, but physiologically they are very often in fact a small domain within the context of a much larger protein sequence, which may contain additional membrane binding domains. The model performance has not been evaluated for predictions on structures in which the PH domain is embedded in a larger protein or complex, and thus is recommended only for use with isolated PH domain structures. This is not a substantial deficiency, as the experimental and computational study of PH domains as isolated structures is a common practice in this research field and has provided great insights into the biochemistry of PH domains and the proteins in which they are embedded.</p><p id="P32">Model performance has been critically evaluated. Although the overall performance is good, in some cases, such as for the btk PH domain, it makes some mistakes with respect to how the overall orientation of the PH domain on the membrane is influenced by global electrostatics. We therefore recommend that the overall PH domain electrostatics be taken into consideration when interpreting model predictions. In some cases the model under- or over-estimates key interaction sites compared with the MD simulation, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1-S8</xref>. Predictions are furthermore very likely to be limited by the same fundamental limitations of the underlying CGMD simulation data. This includes inadequate modelling of specificity between different phosphoinositide species/stereochemistries, limited modelling of protein conformational changes, no insight into the overall membrane binding affinity of the PH domain and the absence of consideration of intermolecular protein-protein interactions or the greater protein context of the PH domains. For further details of the merits and limitations of the underlying training data please refer to the publication of this simulation dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Having considered these limitations, our model provides a practical and accessible tool for obtaining fast insights into putative phosphoinositide interaction sites of pleckstrin homology domains, similar to MD simulations, at substantially reduced computational cost. Considering the difficulties and challenges in experimentally studying membrane and lipid association, our approach presents a method which can help to identify sites of lipid interaction that have been overlooked in the available data and provide hypotheses which can be experimentally tested. Predictions of the model during this study already raise interesting questions, for example about the proposed membrane binding role of the predicted electropositive ridge in the Arap3 PH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Assessment of the generalization capability of the model beyond PH domains showed promising results in the case of the p40 Phox domain.
