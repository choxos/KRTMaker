Engineering a pyrenoid-based CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (pCCM) into C3 crop plants is a promising strategy to enhance yield capacities and resilience to the changing climate. Many pyrenoids are characterized by a sheath of starch plates that is proposed to act as a barrier to limit CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion. Recently, we have reconstituted a phase-separated ‘proto-pyrenoid’ Rubisco matrix in the model C3 plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> using proteins from the alga with the most well studied pyrenoid, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Here we describe the impact of introducing the Chlamydomonas proteins StArch Granules Abnormal 1 (SAGA1) and SAGA2, which are associated with the regulation of pyrenoid starch biogenesis and morphology. We show that SAGA1 localizes to the proto-pyrenoid in engineered Arabidopsis plants, which results in the formation of atypical spherical starch granules enclosed within the proto-pyrenoid condensate and adjacent plate-like granules that partially cover the condensate, but without modifying the total amount of chloroplastic starch accrued. Additional expression of SAGA2 further increases the proportion of starch synthesised as adjacent plate-like granules that fully encircle the proto-pyrenoid. Our findings pave the way to assembling a diffusion barrier as part of a functional pCCM in vascular plants, whilst also advancing our understanding of the roles of SAGA1 and SAGA2 in starch sheath formation and opening novel avenues for engineering starch morphology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>Chlamydomonas</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism</kwd><kwd>EPYC1</kwd><kwd>liquid-liquid phase separation</kwd><kwd>Rubisco</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Almost all life on Earth is fuelled by the carboxylase activity of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco), the primary enzyme used to capture CO<sub>2</sub> for growth and metabolism. Nevertheless, Rubisco has a relatively slow turnover rate and a competitive oxygenase reaction, which can lead to energy and CO<sub>2</sub> losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Most plants (i.e. C3 plants) rely on passive diffusion of ambient CO<sub>2</sub> into the chloroplast where Rubisco catalyses CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. However, Rubisco is typically only half-saturated at CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations inside chloroplasts of C3 plants, which leads to a significant protein investment in the Rubisco pool but still allows for counter-productive oxygenation reactions that can occupy up to a third of the active sites of Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In C3 staple crops, such as wheat and rice, photorespiration causes significant yield losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Several recent lab- and field-based studies have shown that improving the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> capture by Rubisco is a promising strategy to increase crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Such research is important to ameliorate global food insecurity concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), particularly as rising temperatures due to climate change will worsen the impacts of photorespiration despite increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To overcome the limitations of Rubisco, many important lineages of algae and some non-vascular terrestrial plants (hornworts) have evolved a pyrenoid-based CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (pCCM) to elevate the level of CO<sub>2</sub> around Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The pyrenoid is a membrane-less condensate formed by the liquid-liquid phase separation of Rubisco into a matrix that is fed with above ambient concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, which preferentially drives the Rubisco carboxylation reaction and increases its turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Pyrenoids are typically characterised by single or multiple traversing thylakoid membranes that likely supply CO<sub>2</sub> to the Rubisco matrix and a sheath of curved starch plates that surround the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The starch sheath is predicted to act as a diffusion barrier to limit CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion, and could also restrict inward diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> to prevent photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Modelling predicts that reconstituting a functional pCCM into C3 crop plants has the potential to significantly enhance crop yield potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (hereafter Chlamydomonas) has the most well characterised pCCM (for recent reviews see 15–17). In Chlamydomonas, Rubisco condensation in the pyrenoid is facilitated by weak multivalent interactions between the small subunit of Rubisco (RbcS) and the disordered linker protein EPYC1 (Cre10.g436550) via five Rubisco binding motifs (RBMs) on EPYC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). RBMs are thought to play a key role in pyrenoid assembly as they are found in many pyrenoid-localized proteins, including the starch sheath-associated proteins SAGA1 (StArch Granules Abnormal 1, Cre11.g467712) and SAGA2 (Cre09.g394621) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). SAGA1 is a ∼180-kDa protein with two RBMs and a predicted starch-binding domain (Carbohydrate Binding Module 20 - CBM20) located near the C-terminus. SAGA1 localizes to puncta at the periphery of the Rubisco matrix at the interface between the matrix and the starch sheath and is required for normal starch sheath formation and pyrenoid morphology, although the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Cells lacking SAGA1 have thin and elongated pyrenoid starch granules and are characterised by multiple pyrenoids that lack traversing thylakoid membranes. SAGA2 is a ∼190-kDa protein that is 30% identical to SAGA1, and has four RBMs and a CBM20 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Like SAGA1, SAGA2 has a predicted C-terminal starch-binding domain and localizes to the matrix-starch sheath interface, although SAGA2 appears to cover the surface of the matrix more homogeneously than SAGA1. These observations together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) support a model where SAGA1 and SAGA2 mediate adherence of the starch sheath to the matrix.</p><p id="P5">The location and shape of the starch sheath that surrounds the pyrenoid in Chlamydomonas differs from that of the transitory starch granules used for carbohydrate storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In both green algae and plant leaf mesophyll cells, transitory starch granules are discrete and occupy ‘stromal pockets’ between thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Recent work in Arabidopsis has shown that newly initiated starch granules can initially coalesce and then undergo anisotropic growth to form characteristic lenticular granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Several proteins implicated in granule initiation are thylakoid-associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), indicating an important role for the thylakoid membranes in transitory starch biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Given their distinct shape and placement, the components and mechanisms of starch sheath formation around pyrenoids likely differ from those for starch formation in the stroma. For example, SAGA1 and SAGA2 could regulate the sites of starch sheath formation around the pyrenoid via recruitment of starch-forming enzymes from the stroma and/or those associated with the thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Significant progress has been made towards building a functional pCCM in a C3 land plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), including the reconstitution of a phase-separated Rubisco matrix in the model C3 plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter Arabidopsis). Atkinson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) recently demonstrated in Arabidopsis with reduced native Rubisco small subunit (AtRbcS) levels that expression of EPYC1 and a Chlamydomonas RbcS (CrRbcS) was sufficient to condense Rubisco into a single ‘proto-pyrenoid’ in each chloroplast. Modelling of the Chlamydomonas pCCM predicts that the generation of a starch sheath around the condensate will be important for improving the energetic efficiency of the pyrenoid by i) decreasing wasteful CO<sub>2</sub> leakage, and ii) improving Rubisco activity by increasing the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Rubisco matrix up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Here, we examined whether SAGA1 and SAGA2 could recruit starch to the proto-pyrenoid. Remarkably, we observed the formation of atypical spherical starch granules enclosed within the condensate, and the recruitment of up to 71% of total chloroplastic starch within and around the condensate. Subsequent serial block-face scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed the formation of plate-like starch granules that encircled the condensate in plants expressing SAGA1 and SAGA2, indicating that SAGA1 and SAGA2 can regulate the recruitment and shaping of starch around the proto-pyrenoid <italic>in planta</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SAGA1 localizes around the proto-pyrenoid in Arabidopsis</title><p id="P7">To determine the expression pattern of SAGA1 when introduced into Arabidopsis, we stably expressed SAGA1 fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein (SAGA1::mCherry) in the S2<sub>Cr</sub> background. S2<sub>Cr</sub> is a <italic>1a3b</italic> RbcS mutant complemented with CrRbcS2 (Cre02.g120150) that produces a functional hybrid Rubisco (AtRBcL/CrRbcS2) with catalytic properties comparable to WT Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). S2<sub>Cr</sub> lacks the EPYC1 linker protein required for Rubisco condensation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Confocal microscopy imaging of leaves from the resulting transgenic plants (S1) showed that SAGA1::mCherry was located in the chloroplast, demonstrating that the native SAGA1 transit peptide was sufficient to target SAGA1 to the chloroplast in plants despite the SAGA proteins having no homology with any known land plant proteins, according to BLAST analyses. SAGA1::mCherry appeared to form fluorescent puncta within each chloroplast (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of S1 chloroplasts showed no apparent structural differences to those in the S2<sub>Cr</sub> background (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that the SAGA1::mCherry puncta were likely soluble.</p><p id="P8">Next, we stably co-expressed SAGA1::mCherry with EPYC1::GFP in the S2<sub>Cr</sub> background and generated three independent EP1S1 transgenic plant lines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), a single proto-pyrenoid condensate formed within each chloroplast that displaced the thylakoid membranes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The fluorescence signal for SAGA1::mCherry was clearly visible in the vicinity of the condensate, but rather than co-localizing, SAGA1::mCherry preferentially formed a ring around the condensate periphery. This was consistent with the localization pattern observed in Chlamydomonas, where SAGA1 surrounds the pyrenoid presumably forming an interface between the Rubisco matrix and the starch sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Although the ring localization pattern was frequently observed in all three EP1S1 lines, in some chloroplasts SAGA1::mCherry appeared more dispersed throughout the condensate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). TEM imaging of EP1S1 condensates revealed two notable differences compared to those described previously with only EPYC1 (EP1-1) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). First, EP1S1 condensates contained a lighter-staining pattern spread throughout the matrix (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Depending on the cross-section, these patterns were observed as puncta or tubule-like structures within or around the edge of the matrix, and sometimes as concentric rings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Second, we observed round starch granules that appeared to be enclosed within the EP1S1 condensate. In addition, starch granules with an atypical angular shape were often observed adjacent to the condensate, in which the sides of granules in contact with the condensate were characterised by a rounded surface.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EP1S1 condensates retain liquid-like properties and recruit transient starch</title><p id="P9">Chlamydomonas pyrenoids behave as a liquid-like phase-separated compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), a phenomenon that was observed previously for proto-pyrenoid condensates in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). To investigate the impact of the addition of SAGA1, we first isolated condensates from EP1S1 by gentle centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and confirmed that they were enriched in SAGA1, EPYC1, the native large subunit of Rubisco (AtRbcL; AtCg00490) and CrRbcS2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). AtRbcS (the lower band representing AtRbcS1B and AtRbcS2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>)) appeared absent, indicating that the Rubisco matrix in the EP1S1 condensate consisted of hybrid Rubisco. In line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), isolated condensates from S2<sub>Cr</sub> plants expressing only EPYC1 (EP1) showed enrichment of EPYC1 and hybrid Rubisco in the condensate. In contrast, S2<sub>Cr</sub> plants expressing only SAGA1 (S1) showed no enrichment of Rubisco or SAGA1 in the pellet fraction, which was consistent with the observed absence of a condensate in these lines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To investigate the liquid-like behaviour of EP1S1 condensates, we then performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays. The rate of full recovery from photobleaching for EP1S1 condensates was similar to that for EP1 condensates (i.e. ∼20 s) and the half FRAP (<italic>T</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) values were comparable between datasets, indicating that SAGA1 does not affect liquid-like mixing (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next investigated the novel patterning and starch accumulation observed within the EP1S1 condensates by TEM. Periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (PATAg) staining confirmed that the round structures within the condensates were starch granules (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, the lighter-staining patterns were not stained by PATAg, and thus were unlikely to be glucan-based. The patterned structures were also not stained during osmication, indicating that they are likely not comprised of lipid, and therefore not membrane-based (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Immunogold analysis demonstrated an enrichment of SAGA1 around the round starch granules and in the vicinity of the patterned structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E and 2F</xref>), indicating that SAGA1 was directly associated with both features. To compare the turnover of stromal and condensate-associated starch, we then visually tracked the area of starch granules in EP1S1 chloroplasts by TEM over a diel light-dark cycle and a subsequent 4 hr starvation period in the dark (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). As expected, starch levels were highest at 8 and 12 hr during the light period, with 73% of starch located in the stroma, 18% adjacent to the condensate and 10% enclosed by the condensate at the end of a 12 hr day. During the dark period the turnover rates for adjacent and enclosed granules were 3- and 8-fold slower compared to stromal starch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). But interestingly, we observed that the proportional turnover rates for all starch granules were similar, such that both stromal and condensate-associated starch were degraded by the perceived end of the night (24 hr) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Overall, in EP1S1, the adjacent and enclosed starch granules could be turned over in the night, despite their distinctive shape and localisation away from the stromal pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SAGA2 localises to the condensate and around starch granules</title><p id="P11">SAGA2 is a strong candidate for regulating the formation of the starch sheath in Chlamydomonas based on similarities in protein sequence to SAGA1 and comparable localisation to the pyrenoid starch-matrix interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). We first stably expressed SAGA2 fused to mNeon in the Arabidopsis background S2<sub>Cr</sub>. Similar to SAGA1, the native SAGA2 transit peptide could target SAGA2::mNeon to the chloroplast stroma, where it appeared to form rings or curved patterns (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We hypothesised that the predicted starch-binding domain of SAGA2 might be causing localisation to the edges of starch granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). We then expressed EPYC1::GFP in the S2<sub>Cr</sub> background with SAGA2 fused to an mCherry tag to generate the transgenic plant line EP1S2. Unfortunately, we were unable to examine EP1S2 plants past the T1 generation due to apparent silencing of SAGA2 in the T2 generation. Proto-pyrenoid condensates formed as expected in T1 lines, and SAGA2::mCherry co-localised with EPYC1::GFP throughout the condensates, which were characterised by a crescent or concave shape (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). SAGA2 was also observed to localise in circles within and away from the condensate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, white and red arrows), presumably at the edges of starch granules enclosed within the condensate and in the stroma, respectively. When viewed by TEM, starch granules could be observed within the EP1S2 condensates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast to SAGA1, no lighter-staining patterns were found in the condensate when expressing SAGA2. Together, our imaging data suggested that SAGA2 interacts differently with the condensate compared to SAGA1 but is also able to recruit starch to the matrix.</p><p id="P12">We next stably expressed both untagged SAGA1 and SAGA2::mCherry with EPYC1::GFP in the S2<sub>Cr</sub> background to investigate if co-expression might further increase starch granule association with the proto-pyrenoid condensate. Three independent EP1S1S2 lines were generated that expressed all three transgenes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D and E</xref>). Confocal microscopy imaging showed that the condensates in EP1S1S2 lines were distorted, with one or several cavities visible within or at the edges of the condensate, consistent with the presence of starch granules. Notably, in the line with highest SAGA2 expression (EP1S1S2-2), SAGA2::mCherry appeared to form circles around the cavities within the condensates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, white arrows), and circles not associated with the condensate (red arrow), supporting our earlier observation that SAGA2 can also bind starch granules outside the condensate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To better visualise this phenomenon, we used three unique fluorescent tags to generate an additional S2<sub>Cr</sub> line expressing SAGA1::mCherry, SAGA2::BFP and EPYC1:GFP. Consistent with other EP1S1S2 lines, the condensates were distorted, SAGA1::mCherry localised primarily with the condensate, whereas SAGA2::BFP localised to a circle at the edge of the condensate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Subsequent TEM images confirmed that the condensate distortions in the EP1S1S2 lines were due to the presence of one or several large starch granules within or associated with the matrix (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> nd <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">aS5</xref>). The highest expressing SAGA1 line (EP1S1S2-1) was often characterised by a large circular starch granule within the condensate and retained the lighter-staining patterns in the matrix observed in EP1S1 chloroplasts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In EP1S1S2-2 the ratio of SAGA1:SAGA2 expression was decreased compared to EP1S1S2-1, the starch granules associated with the condensate were relatively smaller, and the patterned structures in the matrix were absent. Some chloroplasts in EP1S1S2-2 appeared to contain two condensates, each with enclosed starch granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 and S6A</xref>). EP1S1S2-3 was characterised by high expression levels for EPYC1 but relatively little SAGA1 and SAGA2, and much less starch associated with the condensate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>SAGA2 interacts with the α-helical repeat sequences of EPYC1</title><p id="P13">A previous protein interactome study has suggested that SAGA2 can interact with both EPYC1 and Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Here, we used yeast two-hybrid assays to further understand these putative interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">aFig. S7</xref>). Similar to SAGA1, SAGA2 interacted with both CrRbcS and the Chlamydomonas large subunit of Rubisco (CrRbcL), albeit in the absence of chaperones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). It remains unclear how SAGA1 and SAGA2 might interact with CrRbcL. SAGA2 showed a relatively strong interaction with EPYC1, similar in strength to that observed between EPYC1 and CrRbcS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). To investigate how EPYC1 interacts with SAGA2, we then assayed SAGA2 with an EPYC1 helix KO mutant, wherein the repeated α-helix sequences ‘K/WQELESL’ were each replaced by a string of seven alanine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>). SAGA2 could not interact with the EPYC1 helix KO, indicating that EPYC1 interacts with SAGA2 through the same α-helices sequences required for interaction with CrRbcS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We subsequently screened SAGA2 with a single EPYC1 α-helix repeat sequence with substitutions in residues known to interact with CrRbcS. Replacement of the negatively charged glutamic acid residues E66 (critical for interaction with CrRbcS) and E68 with valine (V) did not reduce the interaction between EPYC1 and SAGA2. However, replacement of the hydrophobic leucine residues L67 and L70 with positively charged arginine (R) abolished the interaction. The impact of substituting either L67 or L70 with R was minor, but replacement of L70 with negatively charged E or histidine (H) abolished or strongly reduced the interaction, respectively. Thus, it appears that the hydrophobic residues in the EPYC1 α-helix are potentially more important for SAGA2 interaction than those that mediate salt-bridge interactions with CrRbcS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To investigate where SAGA2 interacts with EPYC1, the SAGA2 sequence was divided into five regions based on predicted areas of coiled coil domains and disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7F</xref>). Only one region containing several coiled coil domains (region 3) showed an interaction with EPYC1, which was relatively weak compared to the full length SAGA2.

Thus, we measured the starch content in our transgenic lines grown in long days (16 hr light: 8 hr dark) at 1 hr (dawn), 8 hr (noon) and 16 hr (dusk) during the light period (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Despite the starch granules varying greatly in distribution and morphology between the lines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we observed no consistent differences in overall starch content at any time point between lines, although EP1S1-1 samples showed a wide variation in starch content at 8 hr.</p><p id="P15">To further characterise the starch granules recruited to the condensates in different lines, we used TEM to quantify the shape (circularity) and area of visible starch per chloroplast. Circularity was assessed using Fiji (ImageJ), where a value of 1 represents a perfect circle (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The spherical starch granules enclosed by the condensate (defined by having &gt;90% of their perimeter in contact with the condensate) achieved high circularity values of ∼0.9. In contrast, the adjacent granules (defined by having 10-90% of their perimeter in contact with the condensate) had an average circularity value of 0.72, while the typical lenticular shape of stromal starch granules gave an average value of 0.63.</p><p id="P16">Guided by these thresholds, we quantified the area of starch for enclosed, adjacent and stromal granules in different plant lines, as well as the number of starch granules in each category (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6C</xref>). In EP1 plants the majority of starch granules were located in the stroma, with negligible starch adjacent to the condensate. However, expression of SAGA1 or SAGA2 led to a distinct increase in the proportion of condensate-associated starch (either enclosed or adjacent), ranging from 22.4% in our single EP1S2 line to 45% in EP1S1-1. Co-expression of SAGA1 and SAGA2 resulted in up to 71% of total starch associated with the condensate in EP1S1S2-1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). For the latter line, categorisation of ‘adjacent’ or ‘enclosed’ granules was challenging as the granules were often large, obscured the condensate, and made contact with the surrounding thylakoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). Notably, the stromal starch granules in the EP1S1S2 lines were both smaller and less numerous than in other lines. Consistent with starch content measurements (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), the total starch granule number per chloroplast was generally consistent between lines with the exception of EP1S1-1, which had a slightly higher average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6D</xref>). The expression of SAGA1 correlated with the levels of condensate-associated starch in the EP1S1S2 lines despite EP1S1S2-1 and EP1S1S2-2 having similar levels of SAGA2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), suggesting that SAGA1 recruits more starch to the condensate than SAGA2. Both SAGA1 and SAGA2 expression levels were much reduced in EP1S1S2-3, which had similar levels of starch association to the EP1S1 lines.</p><p id="P17">We next used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to image and generate 3D reconstructions of the morphological features of EP1S1-1 and EP1S1S2-1. We first reconstructed the lighter-staining regions observed in condensates in EP1S1 lines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Based on our immunogold analysis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), these regions appear to contain SAGA1 protein, which could be connected via interactions with the Rubisco matrix. Remarkably, we observed that the lighter-staining regions formed an interconnected network within the condensate (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <bold>Fig S8A and S8B</bold>). The network bears some resemblance to the system of thylakoid membranes that traverse the Chlamydomonas pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), although the network did not make contact with the surrounding thylakoids and did not appear to be lipid-based (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that SAGA1 could play an additional role apart from that in starch sheath formation, perhaps as a protein scaffold to guide the traversing thylakoids in Chlamydomonas. Alternatively, it could be a SAGA1 overexpression artifact, as SAGA1 expression was driven by a strong promoter in Arabidopsis and is thus likely at higher levels than that in Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), and SAGA1 was not observed to localize inside pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We also observed enclosed, adjacent and stromal starch granules in EP1S1-1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, <bold>Fig S8<italic>C</italic></bold> and <bold>S8<italic>D</italic></bold>). As expected, the enclosed round starch granules were spherical and contained within the condensate. In contrast, the adjacent granules proved larger than expected and typically extended around the side of the condensate, forming a curved shape similar to the plate-like starch that constitute the pyrenoid starch sheath in Chlamydomonas. In EP1S1S2-1 several adjacent starch granules formed a ring of starch granules that encircled the condensate (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, <bold>Fig. S8<italic>E</italic></bold> and <bold>S8<italic>F</italic></bold>). In both EP1S1-1 and EP1S1S2-1, the stromal starch granules away from the condensate retained their characteristic lenticular shape. Consistent with our TEM data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), condensates in EP1 plants did not associate with starch (<bold>Fig. S8<italic>G</italic></bold> and <bold>S8<italic>H</italic></bold>), and like S1-1 and S2<sub>Cr</sub> plants, produced lenticular starch granules in the stroma (<bold>Fig. S8<italic>I-L</italic></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Expression of SAGA1 and SAGA2 does not impact photosynthesis</title><p id="P18">We analysed the growth and photosynthetic performance of three independent T3 lines for S1, EP1S1 or EP1S1S2.

This is consistent with previous work where no differences in growth were observed between EP1 plants and segregant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, a reduction in growth was observed for the three EP1S1S2 lines (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

This is consistent with previous work showing that Rubisco condensation <italic>in planta</italic> does not appear to impact Rubisco activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), and suggests that the recruitment of starch plate-like granules around the condensate is not impeding CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion in EP1S1S2 lines.</p><p id="P19">We hypothesised that the large condensate-associated starch granules in the EP1S1S2 lines could be metabolised more slowly, which might account for their reduced growth phenotype. To determine this, an additional pre-dawn TEM analysis was carried out on line EP1S1S2-1. Here we observed a greater proportion of condensate-associated starch remained in the pre-dawn assay than at the end of the day (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Thus, the growth phenotype observed in the EP1S1S2 lines could be a result of inefficient starch remobilisation during the dark period, likely due to the size and shape of the large, rounded condensate-associated granules, which would have a reduced surface area relative to lenticular stromal starch granules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">In this study we have taken a crucial step forward in the development of a functional pCCM to enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis in a C3 plant. A starch sheath diffusion barrier is predicted to improve the efficiency of the Chlamydomonas pCCM by increasing the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> around Rubisco by up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This is supported by observations of starch sheath mutants in Chlamydomonas, which show reduced growth in low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). SAGA1 and SAGA2 localise to the pyrenoid and form an interface between the Rubisco matrix and the starch sheath via RBMs and putative CBM20 domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Based on previous work, SAGA1 was an ideal candidate to recruit starch to the proto-pyrenoid condensate in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), with the aim of generating a starch sheath to limit CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion as part an efficient functional pCCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). SAGA2 has remained largely uncharacterised to date, but previous work has suggested it could augment the formation of starch around the proto-pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). We found that SAGA1 did indeed recruit starch to the proto-pyrenoid condensate in Arabidopsis, including extended plate-like starch granules at the edge of the condensate. But SAGA1 alone was not sufficient for the recruitment of multiple adjacent starch granules. Subsequently, we showed that co-expression of SAGA2 led to a further significant increase in condensate-associated starch including the formation of a ring of adjacent starch granules.</p><p id="P21">The different localisation patterns observed for SAGA1 and SAGA2 when expressed heterologously <italic>in planta</italic> suggested that they have distinct roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). SAGA1 is critical for the formation of a single pyrenoid condensate and a proper starch sheath in Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Recent work has suggested that SAGA1 also contributes to the appropriate localisation of pyrenoid-associated CCM components, such as LCIB and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein CAS, which in turn impacts CAS-dependent retrograde regulation of several nuclear encoded pCCM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Notably, we observed that SAGA1 expression resulted in the formation of a scaffold-like structure within the proto-pyrenoid condensate. In contrast, SAGA2 did not produce any patterns in the condensate and appeared to preferentially bind starch, which resulted in localisation to non-condensate starch or even splitting of the condensate likely through binding to multiple starch granules. Our data suggest that the primary role of SAGA2 is as a starch-recruiting scaffold between the Rubisco matrix and starch sheath in Chlamydomonas. This hypothesis is supported by the differing localisation patterns of SAGA1 and SAGA2 in Chlamydomonas; SAGA1 has a punctate localisation around the pyrenoid periphery, whilst the homogeneous expression pattern along the periphery for SAGA2 suggests a more prominent role in the matrix-starch interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). We confirmed that SAGA2 also interacts with EPYC1 through the same alpha-helices that facilitate interaction between EPYC1 and the small subunit of Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The functional significance of being able to interact both with Rubisco and EPYC1 is unclear, but this may help to anchor SAGA2 to the pyrenoid if SAGA2 has a high starch-binding affinity.</p><p id="P22">Starch granules associated with the condensate (enclosed or adjacent) were morphologically distinct from stromal starch granules. Starch granule initiation and growth in Arabidopsis mesophyll chloroplasts occurs in stromal pockets between the thylakoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), thus the morphology of granules can be linked to physical factors, such as correct thylakoid organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In addition to physical factors, biochemical factors like STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4) not only influences the size and number of starch granules, but also regulate the anisotropic growth of granules, leading to their lenticular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). SS4, along with other components that are important for establishing correct granule number, such as MAR1-BINDING FILAMENT PROTEIN 1 (MFP1) and PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH 2 (PTST2), are at least partially associated with thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). We hypothesise that SAGA1 recruited newly initiated starch granules to the proto-pyrenoid condensate. When enclosed within the condensate, the developing granule can grow, presumably due to the ability of starch synthesis proteins to diffuse into the matrix. However, the lack of contact with the thylakoids may allow free isotropic growth without the physical restrictions imposed by the membranes, or could prevent access to SS4 and other thylakoid-bound proteins that are important for granule morphogenesis. Similarly, the curvature of adjacent granules on the surface of the condensate is likely due to a lack of thylakoid contact and physical restrictions imposed by the condensate. SAGA2 led to the further recruitment of granules to the condensate, which grew into the large and irregularly shaped granules observed in EP1S1S2 lines. Future work should focus on clarifying the sites of initiation for condensate-associated starch granules, the contribution of SS4 and other starch synthesis proteins to their shape, as well as identify the proteins involved in their breakdown.</p><p id="P23">The plate-like starch granules surrounding the proto-pyrenoid in EP1S1S2 lines could provide the foundations of a diffusion barrier for an efficient functional pCCM in plants. To improve coverage over the surface of the condensate, additional proteins will need to be employed to help remodel the starch and provide a more complete barrier, and allow more efficient remobilisation of starch so as to not negatively impact on growth. Although fluorescent proteins by themselves do not appear to affect starch metabolism or granule morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), the presence of fluorescent tags on EPYC1, SAGA1 or SAGA2 in our current plant lines may restrict capacity for screening additional components, or the use of fluorophores such as fluorescein for more high-throughput analyses of leaf starch localisation and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Thus, future work will focus on generating fully untagged EP1S1S2 lines to screen proteins of potential interest, including starch re-modelling proteins such as isoamylases or glucanotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), starch branching enzymes SBE3 and SBE4, which surrounds the pyrenoid and interact with Rubisco, respectively, or pyrenoid-peripheral proteins such as LCI9, which is proposed to form a mesh between the starch plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="P24">Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Col-0 background) seeds were sown on compost, stratified for 3 d at 4 °C and grown at 20 °C, ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and 70% relative humidity under 200 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> supplied by cool white LED lights (Percival SE-41AR3cLED, CLF PlantClimatics GmbH, Wertingen, Germany) in 12 h light and 12 h dark, or 16 h light and 8 h dark.

The pellet was re-suspended in 1.5 ml of 80% (v/v) ethanol and boiled for 10 min at 90 °C, then centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The pellet was washed again in 80% (v/v) ethanol and allowed to air-dry, before re-suspending in sterile water to 1 ml. The sample was boiled at 95 °C for 20 min to gelatinise the starch, then 200 μl of each sample was digested for 16 h at 37 °C with α-amyloglucosidase (6 U/ml, Merck), and α-amylase (4 U/ml, Merck) in 200 mM sodium acetate– acetic acid, pH 4.8, before centrifuging at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 20 °C. To determine the glucose concentration, 5 μl sample was mixed with 245 μl assay cocktail (122 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 4.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 μg NAD, 165 μg ATP), 0.3 U hexokinase (Scientific Laboratory Supplies) and 1 U glucose-6-phosphase dehydrogenase (Merck) in triplicate. The absorbance at 340 nm was recorded before and after the reaction, and the concentration of glucose calculated by comparing with a standard curve.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Yeast two-hybrid</title><p id="P35">Yeast two-hybrid was used to detect interactions between proteins of interest as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Briefly, genes were cloned into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors to create fusions with the GAL4-DNA binding domain or activation domain, respectively (see <bold>Table S3</bold> for gene sequences). Competent yeast cells (Y2H Gold, Clontech) were co-transformed with the two vectors using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (100 mM LiAc, 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 40% (v/v) PEG 4000) with 167 μg/ml DNA from salmon sperm. Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, then subjected to a heat shock of 42 °C for 20 min. After 90 mins of recovery in YPDA, cells were plated onto SD-L-W (standard dextrose medium lacking leucine and tryptophan; Anachem). Ten to fifteen of the resulting colonies were pooled, cultured, and plated onto SD-L-W and SD-L-W-H (Anachem) containing different concentrations of the HIS3 inhibitor tri-aminotriazole (3-AT), and incubated for 3 d before assessing for the presence or absence of growth.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P36">Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the significance of the difference between sample groups.
