Motivational interviewing (MI) has been proposed as a communication-based approach to overcome this challenge. Here, we tested how change and sustain talk suggestions, elicited by MI, influenced value-based dietary decision-making and responses of a recently developed neurobiological craving signature (NCS) in female adults. We found that following change talk, compared to sustain talk, participants’ food choices and activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were more driven by the healthiness and less by the tastiness of food. These findings were paralleled by lower NCS responses to tasty food after change compared to sustain talk. Further, following change talk, participants’ body mass indices moderated the NCS decoding of healthy and tasty food choices. These results show that MI can shift value-based decision-making and reduce craving-related brain marker responses to highly palatable food items. The findings contribute to a better understanding of behavioral change interventions toward healthier eating.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>motivational interviewing</kwd><kwd>behavioral change</kwd><kwd>value-based decision making</kwd><kwd>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>neurobiological craving signature</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Modifiable behaviors such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating habits, and harmful alcohol consumption increase the risk of non-communicable diseases and account for a significant percentage of worldwide disability and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In particular, unhealthy eating habits are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and carry a significant economic burden greater than smoking and physical inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, unhealthy eating behavior is rising worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Given the consequences of unhealthy dietary habits, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of interventions designed to promote behavior change. In this study, we investigated the neurocognitive effects of a prominent communication-based approach to behavior change – motivational interviewing (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). MI is a collaborative clinical method, a goal-oriented style of communication focusing on the language of change. It aims to strengthen motivation and commitment to a specific goal. In more detail, MI elicits personal statements for change, called change talk, and deals with reasons against change, i.e., sustain talk, within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Research on the associations between MI and behavioral outcomes showed that a higher proportion of change talk over sustain talk is associated with reduced risk-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Previous work on the neural correlates of MI has focused on substance use disorders such as alcohol and cannabis use. These studies have provided convergent evidence that listening to change talk increased the recruitment of brain regions associated with cognitive regulation in terms of self-control among cannabis users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and dampened the activation of brain areas related to craving and reward when viewing alcohol-related cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These findings suggest that MI might generate a cognitive shift towards self-control and a reduction in craving. However, there is a lack of consensus about the joint behavioral and neural effects when participants mentally transition between change and sustain talk during decision-making. Further, no previous studies have investigated whether MI can alter responses in <italic>a priori</italic> and independently established brain markers of craving, such as the recently developed neurobiological craving signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Self-control propensities have been shown to play a crucial role in advantageous economic choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Models of economic choice propose that the decision process involves two stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). During valuation, various attributes of choice alternatives are integrated into stimulus values, which approximate a decision-maker’s preferences. Stimulus values are then compared during action selection to lead to a preferred choice. Findings from research on the neurobiology of valuation show that value is computed within the brain’s reward and valuation system formed by the vmPFC, ventral striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>)). These value computations can be modulated by self-control, defined by the ability to forgo tasty and liked food in favor of healthier food to improve the quality of eating habits. Such value modulation has been reported to involve the activation of the dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P6">However, sticking to more self-controlled, healthier eating is tricky in everyday life. The vmPFC has also been shown to encode sensitivity to food stimuli and food craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and has strong positive weights in a recently validated neural signature of food and drug craving – the NCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Food cravings relate to eating and weight gain over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Motivational interviewing has been found effective for such situations with prominent cravings, for example, substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, its effectiveness to favour the self-control of dietary decision-making and/or reduce neural decoding of food craving is unknown.</p><p id="P7">Here, we adopted this value-based decision-making framework and used the neurobiological craving signature (NCS) to predict that listening to change versus sustain talk should (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) change food valuation during dietary decision-making by shifting the weights of healthiness and tastiness of food, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) alter how the vmPFC as a central hub of the brain’s valuation system encodes these attributes of food during economic choice formation, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) reduce craving related brain responses as quantified by the NCS to tasty food items.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Behavioral results</title><p id="P8">We first tested whether change compared to sustain talk affected the value assigned to food stimuli, i.e., how much participants wanted to eat the food items. Two analogous linear mixed effects models (LME) of stimulus value were used: LME 1 was fitted to stimulus values assigned to healthy and tasty food. This model revealed that change talk significantly increased food value compared to sustain talk (main effect of change versus sustain talk: β = 0.05, SE = 0.02, 95%CI [0.006 – 0.08], t = 2.3, p =0.02). The model further showed a non-significant main effect of type of attribute (healthiness versus tastiness: β = -0.03, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.09 – 0.027], t = -1.1, p = 0.29) and a significant interaction type of talk by attribute type (β = 0.06, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.03 – 0.09], t = 3.64, p =0.0004) such that after change talk (compared to sustain talk), stimulus value was greater for healthy food items. LME 2 was fitted to stimulus values assigned to unhealthy and untasty food. This model also found a significant interaction talk by attribute type (β = -0.06, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.11 – -0.01], t = -2.5, p = 0.01), but a non-significant main effect of talk (β = -0.04, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.09 – 0.012], t = -1.5, p = 0.14), and a significant main effect of attribute type (β = 0.3, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.20 – 0.34], t = 7.9, p = 1.3e-12). Both models were controlled for BMI.</p><p id="P9">To describe these interactions in more detail, posthoc t-tests and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1a and 1b</xref> show that healthy food was chosen more often (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>)= 4.1, p &lt;.001, paired, two-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = 0.72), and unhealthy food was rejected more often (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) = -2.4, p = 0.02, paired, two-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = -0.42) after change talk than after sustain talk. This difference in stimulus values was non-significant for tasty foods (change versus sustain talk) (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) = -0.6, p = 0.55, paired, two-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = -0.1) nor for untasty foods (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>)= 0.81, p = 0.42, paired, two-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = 0.14).</p><p id="P10">To further test how listening to change versus sustain talk influenced how much healthiness and tastiness information were integrated into stimulus values across all food choice trials, the individual beta values from a general linear model fit to stimulus value ratings were entered into a second-level analysis of variance (<italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Specifically, the ANOVA tested how much first-level interaction terms of interest (i.e., CTxTR, CTxHR, STxTR, and STxHR) differed as a function of the type of talk (change versus sustain talk) and type of attribute (healthiness versus tastiness).</p><p id="P11">In line with food valuation-related analyses, the second-level random effect ANOVA revealed a main effect of attribute type (F(1,124)=22.6, p&lt;0.001, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.14), a small borderline effect of talk (F(1,124)= 4,12, p=0.045, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.02), and a significant interaction talk by attribute (F(1,124) =32.6, p&lt;0.001, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).

The model revealed that overall NCS responses were higher for tasty food choices than healthy food choices (β = -1.9, SE = 0.63, 95% CI [-3.2 – -0.69], t = -3.1, p = 0.0025). The model also indicated a non-significant effect of talk (β = -0.07, SE = 0.32, 95% CI [-0.70 – 0.56], t = -0.21, p = 0.83) and, in line with our prediction, a significant interaction talk by attribute (β = 0.86, SE = 0.32, 95% CI [0.23 – 1.5], t = 2.7, p = 0.008). This interaction effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>) was driven by a significant reduction in NCS responses to tasty food choices in the change, compared to the sustain talk condition (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) = -1.9, p = 0.03, one-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = -0.35). In addition, the NCS tended to respond more to healthy food choices following change talk than following a sustain talk (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) = 1.5, p = 0.07, one-tailed t-test, Cohen’s d = 0.28).</p><p id="P16">Lastly, we explored the role of inter-individual differences in NCS responses to healthy and tasty food choices after change and sustain talk. In the change (but not in the sustain) talk condition, body mass index (BMI) correlated significantly and positively with the NCS responses to healthy food choices (Pearson’s r = 0.46, p = 0.009). On the contrary, it correlated negatively with NCS responses to tasty food choices (r = -0.36, p = 0.04). This suggests that the effects of change talk on the NCS might be especially pronounced in participants with higher body mass.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Motivational interviewing is an evidence-based intervention technique in the context of addiction and behavioral change more broadly. This study aimed to characterize the effects of motivational interviewing on dietary decision-making and craving-related brain responses to food choices. We combined fMRI with behavioral testing of value-based dietary decision-making to contrast in a within-participant design two types of suggestions, i.e., one in favor, the other against the change of eating habits elicited by motivational interviewing.</p><p id="P18">In line with our predictions, change talk led to a greater weighting of the healthiness of food items and a lower weighting of tastiness, an effect that was paralleled by predefined craving-related responses in the neural craving signature (NCS) – a recently established brain marker of food and drug craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Moreover, the participant’s body mass index moderated the NCS responses to tasty and healthy food choices. These findings suggest an interaction between motivational interviewing and body weight on craving-related brain circuits.</p><p id="P19">Previous research has looked at the neural mechanisms of motivational interviewing in the context of alcohol and substance use (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) for examples). Here, we investigated by using univariate and multivariate brain-behavior analyses an aspect that has yet to be reported: food preferences, which were measured by an incentive-compatible value-based decision-making task. Sticking to healthier food choices is difficult, and eating-related conditions such as diabetes are a worldwide problem. Here, we tested in hungry, normal to overweight participants the cognitive effects of shifting between change and sustain talk in the laboratory context. Our findings in normal to overweight to participants are therefore a proof of concept for motivational interviewing to affect the basic mechanisms of value-based dietary decision-making. They further align with an increased focus on prevention and the assumption that motivational interviewing might also be helpful as a prevention strategy instead of an adjunct treatment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Future work should test how the cognitive shifting between change and sustain talk modulates food valuation and valuation-related brain activation in populations struggling with food-addiction-like behavioral habits and obesity.</p><p id="P20">Our behavioral finding of value modulation suggests that change talk might have generated a form of dietary self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Previous studies of dietary decision-making and its self-control have used instructions to incite participants to shift explicitly between strategies, such as distancing from or focusing attention on the healthiness or tastiness of food during incentive compatible dietary decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In line with this past work participants of the current study performed a similar incentive compatible task in the fasted, hungry state, which may have favored more indulgent decision-making under sustain talk conditions, and at the same time may have also enhanced the conflict between short-term taste and long-term health rewards of food under change talk conditions. These two aspects are important ingredients to measure self-control propensities during dietary decision-making. However, the current study also differed from this past work in several, important and novel aspects. Change and sustain talk was not always related to health or taste but to other aspects of food behavior (e.g., environmentally friendly food behavior). These reasons were unique and personal to each participant. Moreover, participants were told to make food choices following their natural preferences and to remember the suggestions they listened to. The instructions also emphasized that both types of suggestions, change and sustain talk, were valid and that they should not favor one type of talk over another. Our findings thus suggest that patients and health professionals do not need to focus on the “health aspect” to elicit behavior change but instead on the personal reasons most relevant to a patient. This is not trivial, as not all patients are health-focused. While it remains an open question to what extent the observed behavioral effects generalize to real-world food choices, the scope of our study was to shed light on the primary cognitive and neural effects of shifting between change and sustain talk during economic food choice in a controlled laboratory setting.</p><p id="P21">The behavioral results were underpinned by the univariate finding that the vmPFC encoded food value during dietary decision-making irrespective of the type of talk. This result is in line with prior evidence that the vmPFC is a hub within the brain’s valuation system that encodes expected and experienced rewards across different economic choice problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). On the behavioral level, the type of talk (i.e., change versus sustain talk) influenced how food preferences were formed, which was approximated by the integration of tastiness and healthiness into food stimulus values (i.e., food choices). In line with this behavioral finding, the value-encoding vmPFC region of interest correlated stronger to the healthiness of food at the time of choice following change talk than following sustain talk. This result aligns with findings from neuroeconomics that showed that the vmPFC computes the value signals that drive economic choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Past work from this stream of research has also found another brain region, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), to play a role in value modulation induced by cognitive regulation such as self-control during dietary decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Here, the univariate brain analysis results were restricted to the vmPFC. We did not find any evidence for the contribution of the dlPFC to dietary decision-making after change and after sustain talk. Different experimental designs, participant samples, and contextual conditions might explain these odds. For example, the dlPFC might be more prominently recruited during economic choice formation when participants face a real-world conflict between change and sustain talk such as struggling with food addiction or obesity. Alternatively, the dlPFC might also be more implicated in contexts where instructions to focus on specific attributes of food are more explicit.</p><p id="P22">Alternatively, our results that change relative to sustain talk affects the integration of healthiness and tastiness into stimulus value might be better explained by the recruitment of craving-related activation in more than one or two brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Current multivariate, statistical approaches in the analysis of fMRI data use machine-learning algorithms to build predictive models – brain signatures to decode behavior from whole brain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Here, we leveraged this approach and used the neurobiological craving signature (NCS). The NCS encompassed value and reward-related brain regions such as the vmPFC and ventral striatum, but also other regions such as the insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, and temporal/parietal association areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It has been cross-validated to predict individual food and drug craving levels across different participant samples of drug and non-drug users to whom both drug and high palatable (i.e., tasty) food cues were presented. We showed that NCS predictions of healthy and tasty food choices were different following change compared to sustain talk. In more detail, similar to the effects of talk type on stimulus value, we found a significant interaction type of talk by attribute on the NCS response. NCS responses to <italic>tasty</italic> food choices were significantly reduced in the change compared to the sustain talk condition. This finding complements the effects of talk on stimulus value ratings, which was driven by a significant difference between change and sustain talk on <italic>healthy</italic> food choices. These differences might be explained by the fact that the NCS was trained to predict cravings for highly palatable food items and might, therefore, be more sensitive to tasty food choice trials in our data.</p><p id="P23">Moreover, the NCS responses to healthy and tasty food choices after change talk varied as a function of BMI. While these correlations should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, they suggest that participants with higher BMI present greater NCS responses to healthy food choices and lower NCS responses to tasty food after change talk. Brain activation, especially within the brain’s value and reward systems, which are a prominent part of the NCS, is influenced by weight status and hormones that signal energy states, such as leptin, which are directly related to body fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Therefore, links between the brain, body composition, and energy-store signaling hormones could explain our correlational findings. Change talk could make craving- and reward-related brain circuits more sensitive to such internal, afferent signals from the periphery. However, while these correlations were non-significant for sustain talk conditions, this might be due to the small sample size.

Here, we report on the influence of client language on dietary decision-making. However, motivational interviewing is more than just eliciting change talk. It comprises two sets of skills: technical and relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The technical skills, composed of open questions and reflections, elicit and strengthen change talk. The relational skills, comprising aspects such as empathy, ensure an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. Both features aim at increasing the frequency and strength of change talk while handling sustain talk reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Magill et al. (2018</xref>) found a non-independence of technical and relational components of motivational interviewing, as the variance of the technical element was partly explained by varying levels of empathy. It has also been found that the relational aspect predicted more reflections of change, which, in turn, predicted more change talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). These findings point to a synergistic effect of both sets of skills. However, the current study design combining value-based decision-making with fMRI did not allow for assessing the impact of change talk in conjunction with these relational components on real-world behavioral change propensities.</p><p id="P25">The scope of our findings is restricted to the basic cognitive mechanisms of decision-making. In the real world, the medical appointment between patient and health professionals and the post-session processes may elicit many effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), which drive behavior change. Additionally, future studies should replicate our findings in other samples. Moreover, other behavior change approaches should be contrasted to motivational interviewing effects by future work to determine the specificity of basic cognitive mechanisms and how they might give rise to real-world behavioral change in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, our findings indicate that MI leads to a shift in dietary decision-making paralleled by changes in specific brain circuits related to value-based decision-making and craving.

This results in one scalar value per contrast image and participant, which can be further analyzed using standard statistical tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189805-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Hilke Plassmann and Nathalie George for their insightful project discussion.

Food items with varying levels of healthiness and tastiness were presented. Each choice trial started with food displayed on the screen, and participants had to rate on a 4-point Likert scale how much they wanted to eat the food for real at the end of the experiment.
