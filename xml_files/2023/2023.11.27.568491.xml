sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria transmission is intense. An increase in inflammatory biomarkers and poor vascularisation are characteristics of placentas infected with malaria. Hofbauer cells (HBCs) – placental villous macrophages of fetal origin – are one of the most abundant immune cells in the placenta. HBCs are thought to have roles in angiogenic processes and have been linked with the pathophysiology of several infections and inflammatory conditions during pregnancy, including malaria (caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>). However, there is limited <italic>in situ</italic> data on the transcriptional, proteomic or morphologic profile of these cells either during or following clearance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. We leveraged placental samples prospectively collected at delivery from 610 Malawian women enduring a high burden of malaria and other infections and nutritional deficiencies. We profiled placentas through spatial transcriptomic and proteomic platforms to discern <italic>in situ</italic> HBC features that could distinguish placentas with or without evidence of past malaria. In this cohort, past placental infection was common and was associated with lower birth weight babies (adjusted effect [95% confidence interval], −80.9 [−165.9, −3.7] g, P= 0.040). However, at term, HBC numbers, abundance, and transcriptional profiles from placentas with evidence of past infection were similar to those of placentas without malaria. HBCs may recover post-infection back to a basal state or may be replaced in the tissue over the course of pregnancy. Placentas with evidence of past malaria did show evidence of reduced fetal vessel development (mean area difference: −22.8% [−37.6, −7.9], P=0.003). Reduced vascular development following infection early in pregnancy may reflect disturbances to the normal vasculogenic and angiogenic processes, of which HBCs are an integral part.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>2</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Despite decades-long control efforts, malaria in pregnancy remains a significant public health problem, particularly in malaria-endemic African countries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts, primarily as the placenta can become a haven for parasite strains - notably <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> – that express novel surface variants towards placental ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Malaria during pregnancy, particularly placental malaria (confirmed histological evidence of parasites in the placenta)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, including severe maternal anemia, stillbirth, and low birth weight <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. A key strategy to reduce malaria in pregnancy, widely applied through international recommendations, is intermittent preventative treatment during pregnancy with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) beginning in the second trimester <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, this regimen misses the critical first trimester, when about 65% of first placental infections occur <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The placenta governs the crosstalk between maternal and foetal tissues and, in doing so, ensures that nutrients, metabolites, immunoglobulins, and oxygen are transferred from the mother; in addition, it removes foetal waste products and ensures that the maternal immune system tolerates the development of the foetal tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. An impaired placenta is often associated with pregnancy complications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In the event of a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection during pregnancy, local inflammatory responses – resulting in an accumulation of maternal immune cells, particularly monocytes and neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> in the intervillous spaces of the placenta – as well as the development of antibodies to specific parasite variant surface antigens that target placental ligands can clear the infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, this often comes at a price, with the placenta showing signs of vascular impairment, potentially as a consequence of the response mounted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Placental infection by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and to a lesser degree, <italic>P. vivax,</italic> leaves residual histologic evidence even after the active infection is cleared <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Placental malaria can be broadly defined as active infection, if parasites are observed in the intervillous (maternal) spaces; or past infection, if the accumulation of the malaria-derived pigment haemozoin is observed within scarred chorionic villi <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, home to the resident villous macrophages, the Hofbauer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (HBCs).</p><p id="P4">HBCs first appear as early as day 10 of pregnancy and remain in close contact with both the maternal and the foetal blood until term <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. They are among the most numerous immune cells in the placenta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and their position in the chorionic villi, the largest area of maternal/foetal transfer, supports the hypothesis that they are key to placental – and consequently foetal – development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Evidence of this is the fact that these macrophages seem equipped to not only deal with infectious threats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, but also to assist with vascular development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and to transport immunoglobins, and possibly nutrients, across the villous stroma to the foetal circulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Recent advances in techniques for isolation of HBCs have allowed for single-cell RNA sequencing, which greatly increased our understanding of their potential roles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, but lack spatial information or cell-cell interaction patterns. What does start to emerge is that HBCs are a diverse population of macrophages, or more likely, mirroring their host organ, a multipurpose population of macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Several studies have investigated the role of HBCs in diabetes, viral infectious (HIV, ZIKA, SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis), bacterial infections (Listeria) and protozoal infections (Malaria) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>; however, these studies have relied on information collected from isolated HBCs (contaminated, to different degrees, with maternal macrophages), or <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured primary HBCs, lacking spatial information including the network of interactions with other placental cell types. When these cells were looked at <italic>in situ</italic> most studies relied on a small number of immunohistochemical markers, or a limited sample size, making it difficult to clarify their activation status and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Previous studies have examined HBC response to placental infection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, but were limited to the scope of profiling possible. However, new opportunities are now available that enable the use of spatial transcriptomic profiling combined with multidimensional immunostaining that allow us to interrogate the tissue at unprecedented resolutions.</p><p id="P5">Since inflammation, and dysregulated angiogenesis are mechanisms proposed to drive poor outcomes during placental malaria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and HBCs are placental macrophages able to secrete inflammatory cytokines and are involved in angiogenic processes, we investigated the hypothesis that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection would modify HBCs within the placental tissue contributing to a continuing pathological process, even after clearance of maternal infection, leading to poor placental and foetal outcomes.</p><p id="P6">We leveraged placental tissue samples collected with corresponding clinical data in Southern Malawi as part of the REVAMP trial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> to interrogate HBCs <italic>in situ</italic> through a combination of spatial transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Our results show that, in this cohort of women receiving IPTp-SP, past malaria infection was associated with lower birth weight babies and reduced vascular development. However, at term, HBC transcriptional and morphological signatures did not differ between placentas with or without malaria infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Clinical trial and placental sample collection</title><p id="P7">REVAMP was an open-label, randomised controlled trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (iron) to treat antenatal anaemia that took place in the Blantyre and Zomba districts of Malawi between November 2018 and March 2021 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.

To evaluate placental malaria status the microscopists reported on the presence/absence of malaria parasites and/or malaria-derived haemozoin in the intervillous spaces of the placenta, as well as in the placental tissues.

Results for each region were pulled and averaged for each placental tissue before the final analysis. Instances where the quality of the staining, the tissue or the annotation did not pass the quality control checking resulted in those tissues being dropped from the analysis.

Analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data consisted of a subset of samples as described above. The association between placental malaria and birth weight was estimated using unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models, with the adjustment set determined a priori and consisting of gravidity, gestational age at delivery, infant sex and trial arm to obtain the direct effect. Similar associations between placental malaria and characteristics of the placenta were explored. No adjustment for multiplicity was used, instead estimates and confidence intervals alongside p-values were reported to support the reader’s interpretation of the findings. Group comparisons were achieved after regression across groups, either unadjusted or adjusted for gravidity, maternal HIV status, maternal anaemia at delivery, maternal iron-deficiency at delivery, gestational age at delivery, infant sex and trial arm. All statistical modelling was performed using Stata/SE 17.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA).

The REVAMP trial enrolled 862 second-trimester pregnant women, from whom 710 placentas were collected. Of those, 610 placentas were from singleton pregnancies and had adequate tissue quality – fixation and paraffin-embedding – that allowed for two independent evaluations of histopathology of current or past malaria. Twenty-nine (4.8%) placental samples showed active infection (20 with both active and past infection – commonly designated as chronic infections – and 9 with active infection only). One hundred and ninety-three (31.6%) placental samples showed past malaria with no evidence of circulating parasites. Placental malaria (past and active) was associated with lower birth weight (mean difference [95% confidence interval], p-value: −119.3 g [−202.5, −36.1], P = 0.005). This was evident in cases exhibiting past placental malaria compared to those without malaria infection, after adjusting the model for gravidity, maternal HIV status, maternal anaemia at delivery, maternal iron-deficiency at delivery, gestational age at delivery, infant sex and trial arm (−80-9 g [−165.9, −3.7], P = 0.040) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Spatial transcriptional profiles of placental tissue with and without malaria infection</title><p id="P19">We hypothesised that HBCs would exhibit a state of inflammation in the tissue that would persist beyond resolution of active infection. Overall comparison of gene expression in <italic>LYVE1</italic>-enriched spots across tissues revealed several gene sets differentially expressed between malaria infected (past or active) and malaria-absent tissue, as seen after analysing the differential expression of the 100 most highly expressed genes across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Interestingly, the two tissues with evidence of past malaria had highly similar transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To try and identify the main cell types contributing to those responses, we mapped the transcript abundance of the top-30 expressed genes onto the 18 clusters identified by Vento-Tormo et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The number of Transcripts per Million (represented as a z-score to facilitate comparisons between genes) of each of the 30 genes was plotted, revealing that our <italic>LYVE1</italic>-enriched spots had genes that were more often associated with syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) and cytotrophoblast (CTB) as well as fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is aligned with the tissue architecture of placental villi. By using stringent cut-offs for identifying differentially expressed genes in the reference data, we curated the gene sets that would better differentiate the most common cell types within the placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). These gene signatures were used for cell type deconvolution of the Visium spots. First, we performed integration of the spatial transcriptomic data from all samples following Seurat’s integration pipeline for scRNA-seq data.

We found that, in Malawian pregnant women receiving malaria prophylaxis from the second trimester onward, and where past malaria infection is associated with lower birth weight babies and reduced fetal vasculature, HBCs in placentas with evidence of past malaria do not significantly differ transcriptionally or proteomically from those where there is no evidence of placental infection.</p><p id="P26">Although both inflammation and parasitemia – resulting from maternal infections with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> during pregnancy – can be cleared, placentas infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have been shown to have pigment deposition, tissue scarring and reduced vascular development (likely as the result of inflammatory processes), even in the presence of IPTp-SP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that the clearance of maternal infection and inflammation would leave unaddressed inflammatory processes within the placenta tissue that would contribute to a perpetuating pathological state. HBCs – chorionic macrophages capable of responding to external stimuli and with a role in angiogenic processes in the placenta – provided a likely candidate that could respond to this tissue insult and perpetuate the pathological process throughout pregnancy, contributing to low birth weight. Our results indicate this is not the case.</p><p id="P27">To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to have successfully applied spatial transcriptomic technology to profile the transcriptional status of HBCs <italic>in situ</italic> in placentas from settings where malaria and other infections are endemic. We used two different transcriptomic approaches to determine the differential expression of genes between HBCs in placentas with or without evidence of malaria infection, and our analyses highlights the opportunities and limitations of these emerging technologies. The 10X Genomics Visium platform identified clear differences in overall gene expression between placentas with or without evidence of malaria infection. A limitation of the platform is the large capture areas – spots are 55μm diameter with 100μm spacing – meaning it could not offer the near single cell resolution we needed for HBC analysis and hence we did not pursue it with a higher number of samples. We developed strategies that can overcome this limitation by leveraging published scRNA-seq data from human placentas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> to generate unique cell-signature markers and deconvolute the data obtained to identify clusters of transcription where HBCs were enriched. Through this approach we identified malaria-infected placentas as having higher HBC and fibroblast transcriptional signatures, as well as lower levels of SCT-related transcription. Despite this limitation, Visium 10X may ultimately offer value as a technique to evaluate the overall transcription profiles of FFPE placental tissue exposed to varied conditions.</p><p id="P28">We took a more targeted approach to directly profile HBC gene expression profiling with the Nanostring GeoMX platform, making use of their Rare Cell profiling tools. We did not observe any significant difference in the transcription of either manually curated gene sets or unbiased overall gene expression between HBCs in placentas with or without evidence of malaria. This finding, using a technique that more reliably targets HBC <italic>in situ</italic> transcription, provides evidence that CD163+ HBCs in placentas with past malaria, at term, do not represent a distinct population of cells to CD163+ HBCs present in placentas without malaria.</p><p id="P29">Isolated primary HBCs can be stimulated to respond to external antigens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, but it is unknown whether these cells are then able to return to a basal state post-stimulation. Another interesting possibility is the ability that HBCs may have to transition to myofibroblasts. The existence of macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition has recently been demonstrated in tissues such as the kidney <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, the retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, and even the chorioamnion in the placenta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Analysis of the data from GeoMX, using the Visium deconvolution gene sets, did not reveal an increased fibroblast signature in placentas with past malaria relative to those without (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). However, the impact of such a transition occurring in the chorionic villi of placentas where inflammation occurs, and the contribution it may make to the ‘disappearance’ of inflammatory Hofbauer cells from the tissues, still needs to be evaluated. What we can say is that, together with the paucity of trophoblastic and foetal endothelial signatures in the GeoMX data, the consistent appearance of a fibroblast signal indicates that HBCs form closer associations with fibroblasts than with any other placental cell type at term.</p><p id="P30"><italic>In</italic> situ proteomic analysis of HBCs in the context of disease has usually been performed on a limited number of tissues, using only one or two colours (thus failing to properly contextualise these cells in the tissue) and often relying on subjective methods of quantification. We overcame these limitations by conducting multiplexed immunostaining on manually selected chorionic villus areas from 126 placental samples, and performing automated algorithm-driven image analysis. Studies have recently evaluated the role that pathogens play in activating HBCs and promoting a proliferative response (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>). We thus looked at the expression levels of the markers Ki67 (proliferation) and HIF1-alpha (activation). Although tissue macrophages are recognised to have self-proliferative capacity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, this feature in HBCs remains uncertain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. A scRNAseq study suggested that HBCs have self-proliferating capability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and studies of ZIKA-infected placentas were able to show some increased HBC proliferation in the tissues marked by the expression of Ki67 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, suggesting an ability to respond to external pathogens. In our cohort of samples, the overall proportion of cells expressing these markers, was very low. The transient, but not sustained, increase in Ki67 expression in HBCs from infected placentas indicate that HBCs may indeed respond to infection with increased proliferation and expression of activation markers but then either return to a basal state, or be replaced in the tissue.</p><p id="P31">As pregnancies progress to term, foetal vessels within chorionic villi expand and occupy a larger proportion of the villus area, to a point where, in terminal villi, little separates the foetal and maternal circulations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Placental malaria infections may disrupt the vascular development, and this is most commonly observed as abnormal levels of proteins on the angiogenic pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> or as actual physical changes to the architecture of the placental tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In line with these observations, placentas in our cohort with evidence of past malaria had a lower proportion of foetal vessel area (measured as CD31+ areas) than placentas where no infection was detected, suggesting a potential effect of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on the development of the foetal vasculature early in pregnancy. This larger area of stroma in placentas with evidence of past malaria resulted in HBCs being positioned further away from foetal vessels, while maintaining a stable position relative to the SCT. As motile cells that navigate the stromal space in chorionic villi between the foetal and maternal vasculature, HBCs are thought to play a role in mediating the transport of nutrients and maternal antibodies across that space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The implication of this spatial repositioning of HBCs in placentas with past malaria needs further work.</p><p id="P32">Taken together, our results suggest that even though there are residual effects from malaria on critical foetal outcomes such as birthweight, any activated HBCs have either been replaced or returned to a basal state. However, we did find evidence that infections early in pregnancy could involve a disruption of the normal vascular development of the placenta. The data we collected on the Visium platform suggests that placentas exposed to past malaria infections have a different transcriptomic profile from those where evidence of malaria infection is absent. As such, future studies should now turn their attention to other chorionic villi compartments – such as the SCT, cytotrophoblasts, fibroblasts or the vascular endothelium – to understand their role as markers and/or mediators of these continuing pathological processes resulting from placental injury after malaria infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS191812-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d147aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The REVAMP trial from which samples derive was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-010612).

(E) Deconvolution strategy employed to try and achieve a higher resolution for the cell-types represented in <italic>LYVE1</italic> Visium spots. The top 10 marker genes for each cell type in the reference data by Vento-Tormo et.al. (F) The spatial transcriptomic data of all samples were integrated and clustered. Gene signature scores were calculated on the integrated data using gene signatures derived from the reference data. HBCs and Fibroblasts were highly represented in cluster 5. The bar plot depicts the proportion of spots expressing the seven main cell types from the reference data in active malaria, no malaria and past malaria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191812-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>NanoString GeoMX™ evaluation of placentas with or without evidence of placental malaria.</title><p>(A) FFPE TMAs were stained for the morphology markers DAPI (cell nuclei), PanCK (SCT), CD31 (fetal vessels), and CD163 (HBCs). After staining, one 700 μm wide ROI was applied to each of the 18 tissues. The Rare Cell Profile approach was used manually select villi – to exclude intervillous areas – and after applying a CD163 mask, segments were generated from which only those DNA oligos bound to HBCs were collected for sequencing. (B) Hallmark HBC genes (in yellow) were highly represented after sequencing. Results are given as counts after Q3-normalization. Genes in blue represent examples of genes associated with the SCT, cytotrophoblasts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. (C) Hypothesis-driven approach to differential gene activation. Genes belonging to 3 distinct pathways (gene tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5</xref>) were analysed for their differential transcription levels between placentas without evidence of malaria (Absent - blue), with past malaria (Past - red) or with an active infection (Active - green). (D) Unbiased approach to differential gene activation. MD plots of the differential transcription of genes between malaria Past and Absent placentas (top) and Active and Absent placentas (bottom) are shown. No genes were found to be either up-regulated or down-regulated after adjustment for false discovery. The top 20 genes, based on logFold change are listed in the adjacent tables. * One-Way Anova adjusted P &lt; 0.05; ** One-Way Anova adjusted P &lt; 0.01; ns – not significant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191812-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Akoya Opal Polaris multiplexed immunostaining of placentas with or without evidence of malaria infection.</title><p>(A) Areas of chorionic villi from placentas in FFPE were selected to build 3xTMAs with 2-mm cores.
