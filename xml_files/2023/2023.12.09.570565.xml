Super-resolution techniques like STED and RESOLFT, together with localization strategies like MINFLUX and MINSTED, rely on accurate and fast displacements of such beams and their zeros. Extending these methods to the third dimension requires axial deflection, which, in contrast to lateral deflection, remains technologically challenging on the microsecond scale. Here, we present a fast general-purpose beam-shaping polarization interferometer that, instead of displacing the entire beam, enables such axial deflections by deforming the beam shape to deflect its zero. Based on this approach, we showcase a four-channel dual-color excitation system for three-dimensional MINFLUX imaging and tracking. We include first demonstrations of improved MINFLUX localizaton schemes that utilize the combination of distinct beam shapes and three-dimensional multi-emitter tracking. We believe that the presented approach will facilitate the broader adoption of three dimensional MINFLUX and provides a versatile basis for future implementations of advanced single-molecule localizaton methods.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Displacing and deforming beams of light in a controlled manner is integral to a wide range of methods such as optical tweezers and microscopes. Super-resolution fluorescence imaging techniques, such as STimulated Emission Depletion (STED)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and REversible Saturable Optical Linear Fluorescence Transitions (RESOLFT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, as well as localization strategies like Maximally INFormative LUminescence eXcitation (MINFLUX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and MINSTED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, require displacing beams that feature zeros of intensity. These zeros—that either constrain regions from which fluorescence can be emitted or generate a spatially variant signature—enable the precise assignment of a fluorophore’s location with respect to a targeted coordinate.</p><p id="P4">MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> stands out as a single-molecule localization strategy, distinguished by its approach of sequentially probing the position of an emitter with different beam shapes. Its high localization efficiency—the number of emitted photons required to reach a given localization precision—has been harvested for stochastic super resolution imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and single-molecule tracking, reaching spatial and temporal resolutions in the nanometer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and sub-millisecond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> scales. MINFLUX localizations in one-, two- and three-dimensions have been achieved through beams shaped by half-moon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, vortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and top-hat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> phase masks. Even Gaussian beams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> are efficient when used appropriately.</p><p id="P5">Irrespective of shape, the beams employed by the above methods require displacement. Available lateral scanning technologies include galvanometric, piezoelectric, electro-, and acousto-optic deflectors, while axial scanning technologies include electro-, acousto-optic, and liquid lenses. MINFLUX implementations have been based on electro-optical lateral deflection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, as it is compact, achromatic, simple to use, and delivers sub-nanometer and sub-microsecond deflection. For axial deflection, previous implementations resorted to an electro-optically tunable lens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>or a deformable mirror<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These devices come at an increased cost and exhibit more complexity than their lateral-deflection counterparts. The tunable lens has a limited focal length of down to one meter and a response in the order of 30 μs, limited by its high capacitance and the current provided by the driving high-voltage amplifier. Deformable mirrors, being micro-electro-mechanical devices, face similar speed constraints.</p><p id="P6">We present an interferometry-based strategy for fast beam shape manipulation where the coherent superposition of specific pairs of beams with different shapes results in displacements or tilts of point-, line- and plane-like zeros of intensity, making it attractive for super-resolution techniques such as STED and RESOLFT, localization techniques like MINFLUX and MINSTED, and optical tweezer applications. To realize this concept we developed and characterized a general-purpose four-channel polarization interferometer compatible with continuous-wave and pulsed beams. It is the key component facilitating 3D and two-color operation for imaging and tracking in the presented MINFLUX system and we believe it will make these features more accessible for future MINFLUX implementations. Furthermore, this technology enabled the first demonstrations of MINFLUX excitation schemes mixing distinct beam shapes for improved precision and concurrent two-emitter MINFLUX tracking in 3D, following the recent introduction of simultaneous two-emitter MINFLUX tracking in 2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These advancements pave the way for multi-emitter MINFLUX tracking as a method for studying the kinetics and conformational states of flexible protein complexes free from range limitations present in single-molecule FRET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and with time resolutions in the sub-millisecond range, surpassing high-speed AFM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Interferometric manipulation of an intensity zero point, line and plane</title><p id="P7">Regions of space where focused beams have no intensity exist as points, lines or planes and can be generated by distinct phase masks at the back focal plane of a lens. Near these locations with no intensity, the spatial dependence of the electric field and its polarization take a variety of forms. It is possible to manipulate the shape and location of these regions by interferometrically combining distinct beams, thus mapping their relative amplitudes and phases to spatial features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> displays various simulated and measured beam combinations that displace and tilt zero-intensity regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods, PSF simulation and measurement</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Several of these combinations are based on matching pairs of beams with linear and uniform electric fields, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. For example, a circularly polarized donut beam, created using a 2<italic>π</italic> vortex mask, features an axial zero line and a linearly dependent electric field across the xy plane that can be laterally displaced when combined with a circularly polarized Gaussian beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). As the donut beam contains all phases of electric field at any given time, there will always be a location where it destructively interferes with the Gaussian beam. That location is dictated by the relative amplitude and phase of the Gaussian beam, mapping them to physical polar coordinates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). A similar phenomenon occurs with a linearly polarized beam shaped by a half-moon phase mask, creating an axial zero plane that shifts laterally when paired with a linearly polarized Gaussian beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). When combining a charge-2 donut beam with a Gaussian beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), the axial zero line at the origin splits into two zero lines, opposite from each other, which are also mapped into polar coordinates by the relative phase and amplitude of the beams (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Furthermore, interferometric combinations that specifically alter the axial distribution within the beams can be engineered. For instance, the central zero point of a bottle beam can be axially shifted by combining it with a Gaussian beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>), as the bottle beam is purely laterally polarized across the z-axis with a linear dependence on z. Other innovative combinations include tilting the axial zero line of a circularly polarized donut beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7,Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>) and tilting the zero plane of a linearly polarized bi-lobed beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>) when combining them with the bottle beam and its linear analogue the bottle-slice beam, respectively. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> for a list of the beam combinations presented.</p><p id="P10">However, beams focused with high numerical aperture contain axial electric fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, leading to a zero degradation if (i) the interferometric combination does not yield a null axial component or, if (ii) it does, but its location does not match the zero of the lateral components (see electric field profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-g</xref> with zero mismatches marked by arrows). Additionally, a mismatch of Gouy phases, as in the case for the bottle beam and the Gaussian, degrades axially shifted zeros (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). Such degradation manifests in scenarios involving large displacements of the zero and depends on the numerical aperture of the system and fill factor of the beams.</p><p id="P11">Despite these circumstances, the interferometric shifting of zeros can imitate whole beam deflection for techniques, such as MINFLUX, where only the parabolic intensity distribution around a zero matters. It offers an enticing alternative to current technologies for implementing axial deflection as discussed in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A four-channel common-path beam-shaping polarization interferometer</title><p id="P12">We present an implementation of our interferometric beam shaping strategy with a system that is compact, modular, scalable, cost-efficient, flexible, and capable of dynamic manipulation.

A common spatial filter for the four paths (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) rejects the zero-th order while the first diffraction order, which carries the patterned beams, passes through. As an added benefit, the use of the first diffraction order in the double-pass configuration filters out the crosstalk between polarization states due to, for example, the imperfect retardation of the QWP, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>. Additionally, we apply an orthogonal grating outside of the selected pupil region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) for suppressing spurious light.</p><p id="P17">The modular geometry described above is replicated to produce four independent paths, each carrying an interferometric mixture of two shaped beams on a single SLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), with only one path active at any given moment. We tailored this system to operate with two paths in the green range (560 nm) and two in the red range (640 nm). After combining both laser sources with a dichroic mirror, an EOM- based path switching selects paths A/B or C/D for red/green. Each path contains its own EOM-based polarization rotator (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) followed by a spatial filter for cleaning up the mode. Paths A/B and C/D are split by dichroic mirrors and reach distinct regions of the SLM labeled as A1/B1/C1/D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The double-pass configuration changes their height and inverts the order of the regions on the second pass to D2/C2/B2/A2. Ultimately, the system can realize any of the beam manipulations previously mentioned in any of the four paths. After interference at the subsequent PBS, all paths are recombined into one and propagate into a MINFLUX confocal microscope, comprised of the commonly required blocks of scanning, detection, and stabilization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods, MINFLUX Microscope</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In conclusion, for each excitation wavelength it is possible to select one of four phase masks e.g., <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>1</sub>, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic>1</sub>,<italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>2</sub>, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic>2</sub> and, combine two pairs of them interferometrically e.g., <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mtext>e</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>e</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mtext>e</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>e</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, where the mixture coefficients <italic>χ<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>χ<sub>C</sub></italic> are dictated by the polarization rotation.

This is because the emitted background <italic>per emitted fluorescence photon</italic> is higher for bottle beams than for donut beams, due to their weaker curvatures, larger size, and axial lobes. One could consider working in low background scenarios, but MINFLUX operates by purposely lowering the signal in exchange for high information content per photon by shrinking <italic>L.</italic> Thus, one should always strive to work in a regime in which background and/or zero quality are not negligible. We therefore implemented the capability of using a mixture of donut and bottle beams within one MINFLUX excitation scheme for lateral localization and axial localization, respectively.

Localization traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> are at 1 ms and 10 ms temporal binning, which correspond to 150 and 1500 average photon counts per localization, respectively. At 1 ms temporal resolution, the standard deviations for the localization precisions are 4.9, 4.7 and 4.1 nm in x, y and z. After further binning, the measured distance between catching sites is 14.9 ± 1.7 nm, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S28">Methods: Data analysis</xref>.</p><p id="P26">The measurement scheme for tracking consisted of a first step where the excitation pattern is actively centered onto the fluorophore via a proportional-integral closed-loop control system that uses the live estimated MINFLUX localization. This feedback loop can flexibly act on the tip-tilt mirror, the EODs, and the interferometric axial scanner simultaneously. We chose the former because it is de-scanned and hence the collection efficiency is optimal after centering. Once centered, the excitation pattern is static over time and probes the molecule until photobleaching. The effectiveness of the centering step is evident in the localization traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, where MINFLUX tracking is initiated within a 10 nm range from the molecule’s actual location.</p><p id="P27">Finally, we utilized the two-color excitation of the presented MINFLUX implementation to simultaneously track two spectrally distinct emitters (ATTO 647N and Janelia Fluor 549 dyes), each transiently binding to two distinct sites on a 2D DNA origami structure of programmable dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The average photon count per localization in the displayed localization traces is 1200 for both emitters, resulting in 20 ms temporal resolution for ATTO 647N and 25 ms for Janelia Fluor 549. The corresponding standard deviations for the xyz-localization precisions are 2.2, 2.3, 1.8 nm for ATTO 647N and 1.8, 1.7, 1.6 nm for Janelia Fluor 549.</p><p id="P28">In this case, the measurement scheme involved a centering step at 640 nm excitation wavelength, converging onto the far-red dye, and defining a volume that encompasses both emitters. Following centering, the two excitation lasers were interleaved in time to probe the emitters with static excitation patterns, each one lasting approximately 250 μs. Notably, the sequence length is not limited by the deflection speed of either the EODs or the axial scanner presented here, but rather by the fluorophore’s emission rate and the need to bin sufficient photon counts to achieve single-digit localization precision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">We presented an interferometric strategy to manipulate a variety of focused beams, including some that are newly described. Our efforts centered on beams with intensity zeros and the manipulation of these regions through displacements and tilts. We proposed the use of three general optical blocks to realize this strategy: a polarization rotator, beam shaper and interferometer. An implementation of these blocks in a four-channel two-color configuration was introduced and employed as the excitation module of a custom MINFLUX microscope. We utilized this microscope for super-resolution imaging as well as single- and multi-molecule tracking with novel MINFLUX excitation schemes and dual-color operation, reaching state-of-the-art localization precision and time resolution.</p><p id="P30">The proposed common-path polarization interferometer is notable for its phase stability without active feedback, its versatility and extendibility. Its implementation is devoid of mechanical parts and manipulates beams at the microsecond time scale even for pulsed lasers. Nevertheless, slower and more economic polarization rotation technologies are also compatible, such as mechanical- or liquid-crystal-based methods. Simplified implementations could achieve similar interferometric effects. For example, a (commercially available) birefringent phase mask could replace the SLM. However, it is limited to a fixed wavelength and lacks the ability to correct aberrations or adjust phases. A single-pass SLM configuration could realize all interferometric combinations involving a Gaussian beam originating from the direct reflection of the modulator’s unaffected polarization. Nevertheless, this approach excludes blazed gratings, which would eliminate zero-order effects arising from the SLM pixelation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, the lack of fine alignment and aberration correction on the directly reflected Gaussian beam leads to zero degradation, non-linear axial calibration and unintended tilts.</p><p id="P31">A wide range of methods might benefit from the presented approach. For instance, the volumetric neuronal imaging technique presented in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>: instead of alternating two axial positions of the employed Bessel-droplet excitation foci via an SLM update, the interferometer could scan them continuously on a much faster time scale—potentially reaching the nanosecond regime when using a resonant EOM— to yield a more homogeneous distribution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>). The same concept applies to optical trapping techniques that confine multiple particles axially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and the axial deformation of the bottle beam might be used as a photophoretic trap capable of loading and unloading a particle similar to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, applying our axial displacement strategy to a STED beam is optimally suited for extending conventional fast STED imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (especially for small volumes) and MINSTED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> into the third dimension.</p><p id="P32">We believe that this work will prove especially valuable for future MINFLUX systems: among MINFLUX’ major strengths is its isotropic localization precision in all three spatial dimensions. Yet, custom systems refrained from 3D implementations, presumably due to their complexity.

It integrates and scales well with other modalities, allowing the use of multiple beam shapes, several wavelengths and pulsed operation compatible with pulsed interleaved MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

For the maleimide + thiol chemistry, 10 nmol of thiol-modified oligonucleotide in 50 μl of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 + 100 mM NaCl were added to 50 μl of 2x TCEP and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark to reduce the disulfide bonds of the oligonucleotides.

The reaction was then quenched by adding DTT to a final concentration of 50 mM. For the NHS ester + amine chemistry, 10 nmol of amine-modified oligos were subjected to one round of ethanol precipitation to remove any residual amine from the synthesis process by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold absolute ethanol, incubating at - 20°C for 30 min, centrifuging at 21000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min, and resuspending the pellet in 190 μl of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 8.3.

In short, a flow chamber was made as described above, and similarly incubated with 90 nm gold nanoparticles. The chamber was then flushed with 20 μl of 1X PBS, then with 20 μl of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20), and then incubated with 20 μl of 1 mg ml-1 BSA-biotin in buffer A for 5 min. The chamber was then flushed with 20 μl of buffer A, and then incubated with 0.5 mg ml-1 of neutravidin in buffer A for 5 min.

The chamber was then flushed with 20 μl of buffer B, and finally filled with 20 μl of the appropriate imaging buffer. For tracking experiments, this consisted of a ROXS buffer containing 1X PCA (1 mM), 1X PCD (10 nM), 1X MV (1 mM), and 1X Trolox (1 mM) in buffer B. For STORM experiments, this consisted of a blinking buffer containing 1X GLOX (0.4 mg ml-1 glucose oxidase, 64 μg ml-1 catalase), and 1-10 mM MEA in buffer B + 10% w/v glucose. The sample was then immediately sealed with Twinsil.

For reporting localization precisions, we first applied a low-pass filter to the binned counts using a rolling window, and then ran a k-means cluster algorithm on the low-pass filtered counts. Subsequently, we computed standard deviations for each cluster and averaged the two resulting numbers for x, y, and z, separately. To report the distance between binding sites in the axial oscillator, we averaged each of the two clustered traces in groups of 20 localizations and then computed standard deviations.
