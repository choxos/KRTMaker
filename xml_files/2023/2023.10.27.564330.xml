Evidence from non-human primates indicates that the dlPFC comprises different cytoarchitectonic layers that play distinct roles in WM subprocesses; yet the functional role of the dlPFC’s laminar circuitry in human WM is not well understood. In this study, participants completed a delayed-match-to-sample WM task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high resolution, which allowed us to examine layer-specific responses of the dlPFC to manipulations in WM load and motor response. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses across all periods of the WM task: encoding, delay and retrieval. First, we observed that superficial layers activate stronger than deep layers to higher WM load during the delay period. This aligns with earlier work showing preferential superficial layer activation to WM manipulation and as such may indicate lamina-specific activation of the frontoparietal network to heightened task demands more generally. Second, we found that superficial layers show higher decoding of WM load differences than deep layers during the retrieval period. In this context, we could show that decoding of WM load in the superficial layer exhibited dynamic changes across the encoding, delay and retrieval period of the task, indicative of separate WM control processes that occur on the WM content. Last, we found that superficial and deep layers are both non-differentially involved in the motor response, contradicting earlier findings of a preferential deep layer activation in humans. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the functional laminar circuitry of the dlPFC during WM and provide further support for a dynamic account of dlPFC coding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>high-resolution fMRI</kwd><kwd>cortical layers</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for a diverse range of higher-level cognitive processes including working memory (WM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Early work on WM focused on the neural instantiation of stimulus-specific WM activity in the PFC of non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), with later studies finding content-specific signals across multiple areas of the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In a parallel line of work, instead of elucidating WM contents, studies examined neural activity related to WM load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) (the number of remembered items) and WM manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), showing a positive relationship between PFC activation and task demand in both WM and other cognitive processes, suggesting that the PFC has a critical role in the multiple-demand system, a frontoparietal network that commonly responds to a particular diverse range of different cognitively challenging tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Despite the PFC’s importance to WM, the role of its laminar circuitry in relation to human cognition remains unclear. Evidence from non-human primates indicates that the PFC has cytoarchitectonic layers that play distinct roles in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Superficial layers have been hypothesized to underlie the maintenance of WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), while deep layers are considered the output layers that send signals away from the PFC towards motor and premotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Recent advances in high spatial resolution functional MRI (fMRI) at ultra-high field strength have enabled the study of lamina-specific responses in human participants in a non-invasive manner with studies predominantly investigating sensory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), and only recently the left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In a double-dissociation, Finn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) found that superficial layers of the dlPFC preferentially activated to the manipulation of verbal WM compared to its maintenance, while deep layers responded to a motor response manipulation.</p><p id="P4">Here, we expand on these human laminar fMRI findings by addressing several open questions about the superficial and deep layers of frontal cortex, while focusing on the aforementioned left dlPFC. First, we manipulate WM load to see whether the superficial layer result from Finn et al. generalizes to other demanding high-level cognitive tasks. Second, we seek to replicate the preferential activation of deep layers to a motor response. Third, we examine the layer-specific multivariate code underlying WM load and investigate the stability of this coding across the entire duration of the trial. Critically, unlike previous studies that have looked at whether the stimulus-specific multivariate activity changes dynamically across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), we examine the multivariate population code underlying WM load conditions. This allows us to investigate whether the coding format changes in a layer-specific manner across three periods of the WM task: encoding, delay, and retrieval.</p><p id="P5">To preview, we found that WM load preferentially activated superficial layers compared to deep layers during the delay period, while the retrieval period showed a more significant multivariate load decoding accuracy in superficial layers compared to deep layers. We did not find a significant difference between deep and superficial layers to the motor response manipulation. Finally, we observed dynamic coding between different periods of the WM task in superficial layers of the left dlPFC when decoding WM load.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">Nine participants were scanned at 7T field strength using a GE-BOLD sequence and used their right hand to complete a WM delayed match-to-sample task, where in two of the four runs we manipulated WM load; participants had to remember either four or one item and had to always respond during the retrieval period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). In the other half of the runs the motor response was manipulated; participants had to always remember four items and during the retrieval period they were asked to respond or abstain from responding to a presented probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Participants accurately remembered the stimulus in both the low load (mean = 95.5% correct, standard deviation (SD) = 6.34%) and high load condition (mean = 74.3% correct, SD = 10.6%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, left panel) with the high load trials having significantly lower accuracy (<italic>p</italic> = 1.31e-05, <italic>t</italic>(8) = 9.44, CI<sup>95</sup> = [16.8, 27.7], two-tailed paired t-test).

To be more sensitive to such patterns we used multivariate decoding analyses (for examples in GE-BOLD see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)) using trial normalization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) that mitigated the effect of differences in mean univariate response between the conditions which might drive the decoding results. This more sensitive analysis allowed us to investigate multivariate activation patterns of different layers to load and motor conditions as well as potential differences in response patterns over the course of the trial. Therefore, unlike in the univariate analysis where we compared responses averaged over delay and motor response periods of the task, here we ran the classification in an exploratory manner across the length of the trial, encompassing the encoding, delay, and retrieval periods.</p><p id="P12">We trained a binary classifier to differentiate between high and low load trials independently for each layer within each ROI and statistically compared decoding results against permutation-derived null distributions as well as between layers. For superficial layers of the left dlPFC, we found two above-chance temporal decoding clusters during the encoding and early delay period (8-12 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0035, one-tailed permutation test) as well as at retrieval (22-24 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0027, one-tailed permutation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, filled dark brown diamonds) while two above-chance timepoints during the late delay failed to reach significance on the temporal cluster-level (16-18 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.077, one-tailed permutation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, hollow dark brown diamonds). For deep layers of the dlPFC, two above-chance timepoints during the encoding and early delay period trended towards temporal cluster significance (8-10 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.058, one-tailed permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, hollow light brown diamonds). For between layer comparison, we found two above-chance timepoints during the encoding and early delay period (10-12 s) where the superficial layer showed stronger WM load decoding than the deep layer, however this time period did not reach significance at a temporal cluster level (<italic>p</italic> = 0.059, two-tailed permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, black hollow diamonds). Interestingly though, we found one cluster that showed a significantly higher decoding of WM load in the superficial compared to the deep layer during the retrieval period (22-24 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023, two-tailed permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, black filled diamonds) even though the bottom-up sensory input at retrieval was completely identical between the two conditions and consisted of a single probed image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, response probe).</p><p id="P13">We ran the same analyses on the left and right control regions and on the right dlPFC.

We also decoded WM load from the encoding and early delay period in the superficial layers and deep layers of the right dlPFC and found a difference between layers with higher superficial layer decoding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2e</xref>). We also decoded load from the right control regions during the encoding and early delay period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Both superficial and deep layers non-preferentially code for motor response in retrieval period</title><p id="P14">To detect patterns associated with the motor effect, we trained a binary classifier to distinguish between response and abstain trials. Since the participants only found out about the type of trial during the presentation of the probe, as expected, there was no significant decoding prior, either in the left dlPFC or left control regions. We found a single above-chance cluster each in the superficial (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0054, one-tailed permutation test) and deep layers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015, one-tailed permutation test) during the response period (24-26 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, dark and light purple diamonds). However, there was no significant difference between the two layers. These results agree with our univariate findings showing no difference between superficial and deep layers during the motor response period. The right dlPFC and right control region showed similar motor decoding results. Motor trial decoding was significant in both layers of the right dlFPC and control regions during the retrieval period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dynamic coding of WM load in superficial layers</title><p id="P15">Both univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that superficial and deep layers differentially activate in response to high and low WM load conditions. Hence, we sought to determine whether the multivariate pattern sustaining load information is stable across time. To do so, we used temporal cross-decoding, as previously done to investigate the stability of WM content in humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We trained on a given time point and tested on all time points in turn.</p><p id="P16">If the trained classifier generalizes to other time points (i.e. high decoding accuracies of the off-diagonal elements of the decoding matrix), the analysis reveals that the multivariate pattern sustaining load information (i.e. “coding”) is stable across time. However, when the diagonal of the matrix, representing training and testing on the same time points, shows higher decoding accuracies than the off-diagonal elements, then the multivariate activity is dynamic and varies across time. We examined the generalization of multivariate patterns in response to load in the superficial and deep layers of the dlPFC.</p><p id="P17">Within the superficial layers of the dlPFC, we identified two above-chance decoding clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, black dashed line). The first decoding cluster spanned both the encoding and delay period (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, one-tailed permutation test), while the second cluster was isolated to the retrieval period (23-25 s; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, one-tailed permutation test). Looking more closely into the first decoding cluster, we observed that the classifier trained on the encoding period (8-10 s) generalized to the middle of the delay period (16 s), and the classifier trained on the delay period (14-18 s) generalized to the late delay period (up to 22 s). Importantly though, the classifier trained on the encoding period did not generalize to the late delay period and vice versa, indicating a differential multivariate pattern sustaining load information in those two periods of the trial. To visualize these results, we plotted the columns from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> as time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, top panel), which depict that the classifier trained on 10 s had high decoding during the encoding and early delay, but the decoding accuracy waned in the second half of the trial. Similarly, the classifier trained on 16 s had the highest decoding during the late delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, middle panel). With respect to the second decoding cluster identified at retrieval, we observe that it only generalizes to its surrounding time points, indicating that the multivariate pattern reflecting load during the retrieval period was distinct from encoding and delay (bottom time course in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Within the deep layers of the dlPFC, a single above-chance cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, black dashed line) was found during the encoding period (8-10 s) which generalized to the delay (18 s). Plotting the column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> as a time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, top panel), we see that the deep layer results follow a similar trend as the superficial layer results: the classifier trained on 10 s had high decoding during the encoding and early delay, but the decoding accuracy waned in the second half of the trial. Similarly, the classifier trained on 16 s had the highest decoding during the late delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, middle panel).</p><p id="P19">To empirically check the lack of generalization between the above-chance clusters, we identified dynamic elements within the cross-decoding matrices. Dynamic elements denote parts of the matrix where, despite there being information about the load condition at two different time points (on the diagonal of the matrix), the code does not generalize from one time point to the other. Three clusters were found in the superficial layers of the dlPFC: two off-diagonal elements at the intersection of the encoding and early delay (train) and retrieval (test) periods, two elements at the intersection of the middle delay (train) and encoding and early delay (test) periods, and four elements at the intersection of encoding and early delay (train) and retrieval (test) periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To summarize, our cross-decoding results showed three differential multivariate response patterns sustaining load in the superficial layers during the encoding, delay, and retrieval periods, indicative of dynamic coding between trial periods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">We scanned participants at ultra-high field strength performing a delayed match-to-sample task where we manipulated WM load and motor response while measuring responses from the superficial and deep layers of the dlPFC.

In order to examine the multivariate response across the length of a trial, we decoded load and motor trial types from the layers of the left dlPFC. We found that superficial layers preferentially code for difference in WM load during the retrieval period. With respect to the motor trials, we found that both superficial and deep layers code for the motor response in the retrieval period but failed to find any significant laminar difference.

Our work also corroborates findings showing higher activation of the lateral PFC to higher task demands, as previously seen in univariate human fMRI work on WM load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and the manipulation of WM information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Greater neural processing associated with working memory load in superficial layers compared to deep throughout the delay and retrieval periods might indicate activity related to more general task demands; these demands increase as a result of higher WM load, possibly by both recruiting new neural populations (e.g. in retrieval) and by increasing univariate activity (e.g. in delay). These WM control processes might correspond to the updating of content during encoding, the monitoring or contents throughout the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), compression or reorganization of WM contents as a result of increased load demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), or an activation of a larger number of content-independent pointers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), that might project to parietal and sensory cortices where the maintained memoranda is thought to be stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Interestingly, there was a preferential univariate response of the superficial compared to deep layers to high load during the delay period, but no laminar difference in decoding. Superficial layers might utilize the same neural population underlying one or several control processes to a higher degree; this would result in higher univariate activity, but lower decodability, since univariate contributions were minimized through trial normalization. Taking into account results from Finn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), preferential response in the superficial layers to both WM manipulation and higher WM load might point towards a lamina-specific (i.e., superficial layer) activation of the frontoparietal multiple demand system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) for heightened task demands more generally. However, it is essential to underscore the necessity for future investigations to systematically examine the layer-specific activation of the frontoparietal network across a diverse spectrum of cognitive tasks with varying demands; as can be accomplished employing novel real-time fMRI approaches utilizing neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We also provide new insights into the mesoscale functional architecture of the dlPFC in response to WM load. Previous studies have established that recurrent connections within superficial layers of the PFC support sensory input-specific gamma-band activity, while deep layer alpha and beta oscillations modulate this superficial layer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In turn, the interaction between deep and superficial layers might act as a gating mechanism for sensory information to enter the PFC and WM storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In our study, both superficial layers and deep layers had above-chance temporal cross-decoding clusters during the encoding of WM information. Deep layer coding for WM load during the encoding period might correspond to the opening of the gate, which allows for the encoding of new WM information within the superficial layers. Based on our results, we can only speculate whether deep layers drive superficial layer activity. It should be noted that deep layer coding was significant in the right dlPFC and only trended towards significance in our temporal cluster analysis of the left dlPFC. This might indicate a lateralization in the WM encoding control process to the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>); however, further studies are needed to corroborate these results and unravel any causal laminar relationships in both hemispheres.</p><p id="P25">For the retrieval period, we found significantly higher superficial compared to deep layer decoding of WM load which might indicate increased demands during the probe’s comparison to the stored memory (1 vs. 4 items) despite the presentation of identical response probes in low and high WM load conditions. The comparison process seems to happen within the superficial layers, which might multiplex both the novel sensory probe stimulus and the remembered memoranda; in order to achieve this at high load, additional neural populations within the superficial layers might be recruited, thus driving the multivariate decoding. Superficial layer decoding relates to previous findings showing ramping gamma-band activity at the end of memory delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), as a consequence of its disinhibition resulting from the drop of alpha/beta power to allow a successful read-out of information from WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Intriguingly, load decoding peaked prior to motor decoding, which might denote the sequence of computations in the dlPFC: a comparison of the probe to the WM set before the initialization of a motor response.</p><p id="P26">The canonical model of the WM suggests that that information coded within the PFC is stable and firing is persistent across the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). However, evidence has emerged that WM is both rhythmical and non-persistent in activation and the format of the coded information dynamically varies across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Studies using temporal cross-decoding have observed a dynamic code between the encoding period and delay activity in the PFC of non-human primates and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), and across the visual hierarchy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We find three non-generalizing sub-clusters within the span of the trial; each sub-cluster corresponding to either the encoding, delay, or retrieval periods. Previous studies argued that dynamic coding indicates a point where transient sensory stimuli are transformed into a more stable representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>); however, since we were decoding load and not the contents of WM, the decoding sub-clusters might underlie separate WM control processes that occur on the WM content within the same layer.</p><p id="P27">In contrast to superficial layers of the PFC, the deep layers are considered to be the output - or top-down - layers of the cortical area and have neurons modulated by D2 dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Finn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) found that a motor modulation only activated the deep layers of the prefrontal cortex, while superficial layers stayed at baseline. We do not find a preferential activation of either superficial or deep layers of the left dlPFC to the motor manipulation either in univariate activity or in multivariate decoding. The discrepancy between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and our results may be related to a difference in paradigm and/or a difference in scanning sequences.</p><p id="P28">Finn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) contrasted trials in which participants either had to respond after the presentation of a probe or had to not respond when a probe was not presented. This resulted in a change of two factors between conditions: the presence or absence of the probe stimulus and the motor response. Our paradigm always included the presentation of the probe and participants were asked to either respond or abstain from responding based on a presented cue. If the deep layer modulates the information that enters the superficial layer of the dlPFC, then that computation could provide an additional deep layer response. Thus, higher activation of the deep layers in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) might not be a result of the output, but rather of the opening of the gate by the deep layers to let in the probe for subsequent comparison in the superficial layers. This probe input signal would have been absent when comparing between conditions in our paradigm. As a consequence and based on our results, we might conclude that the superficial and deep layers are both non-differentially involved in the output of a motor signal. Further research is needed to distinguish between the input and output hypotheses by possibly extending the time between the presentation of the probe and motor initiation.</p><p id="P29">An additional difference between the two studies was the pulse sequence used to measure signals from the layers. We used conventional GE-BOLD, while (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) used both BOLD and cerebral blood volume (CBV), which resulted in an SS-SI-vascular space occupancy (VASO) contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). The BOLD signal has poorer spatial specificity, but higher sensitivity, as a larger part of the signal comes from larger veins present in the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) resulting in a broader point-spread function of the signal in both columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) and layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) compared to more spatially precise scanning sequences. VASO has a smaller contrast-to-noise ratio, but localizes activity to both superficial and deep layers, with less bias from large draining veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). The main concern in GE-BOLD are interdependencies in the signal between different layers of the cortex, as a result of the blood draining from deep layers towards superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The superficial layers might thus contain signals from the deep layers as well. One strategy of mitigating the effects of draining veins is to compare differences of tasks, as in the case of our study (high load compared to low load and response compared to abstain trials) and as done in previous GE-BOLD studies; a subtraction of conditions would theoretically remove a linear draining effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Despite employing this method, both superficial and deep layers activated to the motor manipulation. Thus, the linear detrend might have not completely removed the draining vein signal, thus future work can employ more sophisticated models to account for the superficial layer blurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>); however, preferential deep layer activation has been previously observed in GE-BOLD studies that have not employed these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).</p><p id="P30">In summary, we show that superficial layers of the dlPFC are not only crucial for WM maintenance, but in fact are involved in various WM subprocesses by dynamically adapting to current task demands. In addition, we highlight that deep layers seem to have a more complex role in WM than previously understood. Our findings offer new insights into the neural mechanisms of WM and try to bridge the gap between the human and non-human primate WM literature.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P31">We scanned nine participants (ages 23-36 years, three female) that were recruited from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) subject database.

In two runs we manipulated the task difficulty by changing the WM load (from now on referred to as the load runs). In the other two runs we manipulated the motor response during the retrieval period (from now on referred to as the motor runs). Each trial began with the presentation of the sample for 3.5 s which consisted of a four-square array where each square was equidistant from the center. A fixation cross was presented centrally. In the load runs either one (low load) or four (high load) items were presented within the squares as the to-be-remembered sample. The items consisted of faces (subcategory: male and female) or scenes (subcategory: indoor and outdoor). The face and scene stimuli were retrieved from the Face-Place database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Faces had neutral emotional expressions. The scenes included indoor and outdoor pictures of houses. All stimuli were converted to grayscale. For each trial the category and subcategory of the items within the array were the same (e.g. only female faces). In the case of a low load condition, the remaining three squares consisted of Fourier-scrambled items from the same category, in order to preserve the low-level visual features of the overall sample array. Visual masks consisting of Fourier-scrambled images were presented for 200 ms at the location of the four squares after sample presentation (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Participants had 4.2 s to respond using their index and middle finger of their right hand to indicate whether the presented probe was part of the remembered sample. Motor runs consisted of two trial types: response and abstain trials.
