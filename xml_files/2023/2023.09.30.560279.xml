It supports memory-based cognition, including the capacity to retrieve conceptual and evaluative information from sensory inputs, and to generate meaningful states internally; however, the functional organisation of DMN that can support these distinct modes of retrieval remains unclear. We used fMRI to examine whether activation within subsystems of DMN differed as a function of retrieval demands, or the type of information to be retrieved, or both. In a picture association task, participants retrieved two types of semantic features about contexts and emotions: in the generate phase, these associations were retrieved from a novel picture, while in a switch phase, participants retrieved a new association for the same image. Semantic context and emotion trials were associated with dissociable DMN subnetworks, indicating that a key dimension of DMN organisation relates to the type of information being accessed. The fronto-temporal and medial temporal DMN showed a preference for emotional and contextual associations, respectively. Relative to the generate phase, the switch phase recruited clusters closer to the heteromodal apex of the principal gradient – a cortical hierarchy separating unimodal and heteromodal regions. There were no differences in this effect between association types. Instead, memory switching was associated with a distinct subnetwork associated with controlled internal cognition. These findings delineate <italic>distinct</italic> patterns of DMN recruitment for different kinds of associations yet <italic>common</italic> responses across tasks that reflect retrieval demands.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Semantic</kwd><kwd>Context</kwd><kwd>Emotion</kwd><kwd>Association</kwd><kwd>Switch</kwd><kwd>Default</kwd><kwd>Gradient</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The default mode network (DMN) is a large-scale distributed network which frequently shows task-related deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Raichle, 2015</xref>) yet is also associated with aspects of cognition that are dependent on memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). It is thought to support diverse tasks relating to social cognition, episodic recall, semantic retrieval, and emotion induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mancuso et al., 2022</xref>). In such domains, DMN is thought to support our interpretation of external events and the distillation of diverse features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lanzoni et al., 2020</xref>), as well as the ability to generate cognitive states that are decoupled from the external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). However, the functional organisation of this network remains unclear, since its activation may be modulated according to the type of information being retrieved, and/or the retrieval demands associated with a particular task.</p><p id="P3">DMN regions are thought to be maximally distant from sensory-motor cortex on a cortical hierarchy. This topographical organisation is captured by the principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity, which is the dimension of whole-brain connectivity that explains the most variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). The principal gradient reveals maximal separation of connectivity patterns between unimodal and heteromodal regions and can also explain the order of large-scale networks along the cortical surface, from sensory-motor regions, through attention networks and the frontoparietal control network, to DMN. This separation is thought to allow DMN to support both perceptually-decoupled and abstract thought, since both involve informational states that are at odds with the changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). For example, from picture cues, we may access information about abstract categories that allow us to evaluate and make sense of our experiences and retrieve past events that are no longer taking place (using sensory to DMN pathways). We may also generate sensory-motor features relating to these concepts or past events, even when they do not overlap with features present in the external world (using DMN to sensory pathways).</p><p id="P4">The role DMN plays in these processes may be better understood by investigating how dissociable subnetworks support distinct types of memory-guided cognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna et al. (2014)</xref> reported that in addition to a ‘core’ DMN network focussed on anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus, patterns of intrinsic connectivity reveal a medial temporal (MT) subnetwork (including retrosplenial cortex) and a lateral fronto-temporal (FT) subnetwork<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup> (including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). The MT subnetwork includes aspects of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, implicated in mental scene construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sheldon &amp; Levine, 2016</xref>). The FT subnetwork shows greater connectivity with the anterior temporal lobes (ATL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>), a brain region thought to provide a heteromodal semantic ‘hub’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chiou &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>) which is also associated with processing valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Juran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Spiers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). These subnetworks are consequently associated with different aspects of memory: the MT network is associated with episodic recollections of specific experiences that are typically visuo-spatial in nature, while the FT network is implicated in semantic and social cognition, based on knowledge extracted across many experiences which is typically more abstract in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chiou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gurguryan &amp; Sheldon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sheldon et al., 2019</xref>). Core DMN regions sit at points where the MT and FT subsystems are spatially interdigitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Braga &amp; Buckner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) and might help to draw together spatial, semantic, and valence information to form coherent patterns of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lanzoni et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Despite progress in characterising the functional organisation of DMN, important issues remain unresolved. The first concerns the specific task dimensions that separate MT and FT subsystems. While semantic cognition is often considered to involve abstract categories (e.g., types of emotions), we also have general visuo-spatial knowledge about typical scenes and events, acquired over our lifetime. Contrasts of semantic tasks probing contextual information about generic spatial-temporal associations versus valenced associations can establish whether MT and FT subnetworks support these distinct types of knowledge (scene construction versus evaluative categories). A second unresolved issue concerns how retrieval demands intersect with DMN subnetworks. Irrespective of the type of information being retrieved (e.g., contextual or emotional associations), retrieval tasks can vary in the cognitive resources that they utilise; for example, they might differ in their reliance on immediately available sensory-motor features versus representations from memory. Research to date has shown similar DMN recruitment for tasks based on meaning as opposed to individual perceptual features and for memory-guided 1-back decisions over 0-back trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>). Key DMN regions, including posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, are also implicated in the disambiguation of degraded ambiguous images when they are re-presented and recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">González-García et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting the heteromodal end of the principal gradient supports the processing of more familiar images that have become meaningful. Nevertheless, very little research has investigated whether these kinds of retrieval demands equivalently modulate the response of distinct DMN subsystems. For example, FT might be more coupled to visual cortex (to allow semantic access from vision for novel images) while MT might be more perceptually-decoupled and relevant to patterns of retrieval that rely largely on internal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chiou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, manipulations of perceptual novelty or the task-relevance of visual input might alter DMN recruitment in a way that is orthogonal to the MT/FT distinction. Internal mind-wandering relies on conceptual and evaluative information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Faber &amp; D’Mello, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Smallwood et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the FT subsystem might be implicated in both perceptually-generated and decoupled states.</p><p id="P6">Further debate concerns the relationship between DMN and cognitive control networks. DMN regions can support memory-based cognition when executive demands are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">2019</xref>) and DMN is implicated in goal maintenance during controlled semantic retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). This functional similarity between DMN and heteromodal control networks is captured by the principal gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). Frontotemporal control regions also form alliances that reflect task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Niendam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Spreng et al., 2013</xref>); they are recruited with attention networks to form the multiple demand network (MDN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Duncan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hugdahl et al., 2015</xref>), while a semantic control network (SCN) supports the conceptual retrieval of non-dominant aspects of knowledge relevant to the current task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Noonan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jackson, 2021</xref>). SCN is situated at the intersection of frontoparietal control regions and DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chiou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Davey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and is functionally and spatially distinct from MDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Humphreys et al., 2015</xref>). This dissociation somewhat resembles parcellations of control networks based on intrinsic connectivity: the ‘control A’ subnetwork<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup> couples with the externally-oriented dorsal attention network (DAN), while ‘control B’ couples with DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). However, little is known about how distinctions within control networks relate to MT and FT DMN subdivisions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Vatansever et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterise the contribution of DMN subsystems and control networks to the retrieval of emotional associations and meaning-based contexts from picture cues. While both tasks were reliant on semantic information, they may preferentially activate FT and MT subnetworks, respectively, if these subsystems are sensitive to the <italic>type</italic> of information being retrieved. Associations were made twice for each picture, allowing us to manipulate the relevance of visual input and memory-based processes to retrieval (via the novelty of visual input, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">González-García et al., 2018</xref>). The ‘<italic>generate’</italic> phase required participants to identify an association from a novel picture, while the ‘<italic>switch’</italic> phase required a <italic>new</italic> association from the same picture. We situated responses associated with each phase on the principal gradient, to test whether the switch phase elicited stronger recruitment of heteromodal cortex. We also investigated whether responses in FT and MT DMN were modulated by the differing demands of <italic>generate</italic> versus <italic>switch</italic> phases. Alternatively, this manipulation may be largely independent of association type and instead reflected in control-relevant DMN regions (e.g., control B).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P8">Participants were right-handed, aged 18 to 35, with normal or corrected to normal vision, no history of neurological disorder, and no current psychiatric disorder.

The order of trials within each run was consistent across participants. Run order was counterbalanced across participants such that a given block could appear in any position (first to sixth).</p><p id="P12">The day before the scan, participants completed two practice runs (using stimuli not presented in the main experiment) remotely via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications Inc., 2016). During the first run participants reported their associations verbally, confirming they had correctly comprehended the study instructions. During the second run participants completed the task without verbal responses, to simulate the in-scanner procedure.</p><p id="P13">At the start of each mini-block, participants were presented with a 2s prompt informing them of the current association type (‘SEMANTIC’ or ‘EMOTION’). Each trial was preceded by a fixation cross, for an average of 2s, jittered between 1 and 3s. During the ‘GENERATE’ phase of <italic>semantic context</italic> associations, participants were shown a picture and asked to reflect on the first event-based association this picture brought to mind. Participants were told not to simply reflect on the content of the picture, and not to recall an episodic memory, but to identify a meaningful context from their general knowledge (e.g., for a picture of a street with washing lines, “visiting a city on holiday”). During the ‘SWITCH’ phase, participants were asked to stop reflecting on their initial association, and to reflect on another context associated with this picture (e.g., “using the sun to dry washing”). During the ‘GENERATE’ phase of <italic>emotion</italic> associations, participants were shown a picture and asked to reflect on how it made them feel. Participants were asked to avoid simple descriptive labels, but instead to embody emotions caused by the picture (e.g., for a picture of an empty hospital room, thinking about feeling sad). During the ‘SWITCH’ phase, participants were asked to stop thinking about this emotion, and to switch to another emotional response (e.g., fear). Each <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phase involved seeing a given picture for the first and second time, respectively. <italic>Generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phases were presented for an average of 5s, jittered between 3.5 and 6.5s. After each <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phase, participants indicated how strongly related their self-generated association was to the picture on a scale from 1 (no real relationship) to 7 (very strong relationship). At the end of each trial, participants indicated how difficult they found it to switch from the first to the second association on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 7 (very difficult). Each strength of association and difficulty rating was presented for a period of 3s.</p><p id="P14">Immediately following the scan, participants completed a recall assessment. Pictures were presented in the same order as in the scanner, and participants were asked to type the contexts or emotions they had generated, as well as their confidence in their recall accuracy (from 1-7), for both the <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phases.

Each trial was split into a <italic>generate</italic> phase, thought to tap visual to DMN pathways, and a <italic>switch</italic> phase requiring a different association to be retrieved to the same picture, thereby increasing demands on internally-mediated retrieval processes. Accordingly, clusters identified in the <italic>switch</italic> phase were nearer the heteromodal end of the principal gradient than those in the <italic>generate</italic> phase, suggesting internally-oriented retrieval demands. A functional dissociation within DMN reflected the type of information needed in each task. <italic>Semantic context</italic> associations showed greater reliance on the MT subsystem, associated with scene construction. <italic>Emotion</italic> associations showed greater reliance on the FT subsystem, associated with abstract and evaluative processing. FT and MT subnetworks therefore showed a dissociation within semantic cognition when different meaning-based features were required. This was true regardless of retrieval demands, across the <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phase. Across multiple analyses, we largely found similarities in this <italic>switch</italic> effect across association types, suggesting that this dimension of DMN organisation related to internal retrieval demands is largely orthogonal to the distinction between MT and FT subnetworks.

We found a dissociation between these networks when comparing tasks that tapped the retrieval of different meaning-based features (semantic contexts and emotions). This indicates that this subdivision relates to types of information processing; the MT subsystem supports the retrieval of general knowledge of meaningful contexts acquired over a lifetime. This is supported by studies implicating the MT subnetwork in contextually-specific and perceptually-guided scene construction and the FT subnetwork in abstract and evaluative processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sheldon et al., 2019</xref>).

These results are consistent with the involvement of SCN, which shows considerable overlap with FT DMN in bilateral IFG, left pMTG, and dmPFC, in tasks requiring the regulation of emotional responses. Left IFG and pMTG have both been implicated in emotion reappraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buhle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Messina et al., 2015</xref>), a regulation strategy that relies on controlled processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Braunstein et al., 2017</xref>). The IFG has also been associated with the suppression and substitution of emotional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Benoit &amp; Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Engen &amp; Anderson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>).

These network pairings may partly reflect spatial proximity – auditory and FT networks are adjacent in lateral temporal regions, while core and MT networks occupy adjacent positions in medial parietal cortex. In addition, language responses in the auditory network may be more relevant for emotion associations due to importance of language for abstract cognition.

The construction of rich scenes during <italic>semantic context</italic> associations may rely on this region across phases, while the <italic>switch</italic> phase of <italic>emotion</italic> associations may be abstract enough for decreased reliance. This mirrors the processing of abstract words, which show greater reliance on emotional content due to a relative lack of sensorimotor features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kousta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ponari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rotaru &amp; Vigliocco, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Vigliocco et al., 2014</xref>). Gonzalez-Alam et al. (2018) found a similar region of inferior LOC to show an interaction between task demands and modality in the semantic domain, reflected by larger effects of inhibitory demands for picture- than word-based stimuli. The recruitment of visual object regions in controlled semantic retrieval appears to depend on both the nature of the input (modality) and the task demands (stimulus repetition).</p><p id="P46">In terms of effects of phase, resting-state network control B showed less task-related deactivation in the <italic>switch</italic> phase than the <italic>generate</italic> phase, suggesting it may play a role in the control of internally-oriented cognition. The <italic>switch</italic> effect was strongly overlapping with the control B network and located towards the DMN apex of the principal gradient, at a maximal distance from sensory-motor systems. The implication of transmodal regions in the switch phase is consistent with prior evidence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">González-García et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated that DMN regions towards the heteromodal end of the principal gradient support the representation of ambiguous Mooney images that have been disambiguated by participants upon second viewing. Our findings build on this by demonstrating the contribution of a specific resting-state network falling within DMN (control B), even when the stimuli themselves are not particularly ambiguous in nature (i.e., not actively degraded). Transmodal regions at the top of the principal gradient, and control B in particular, may play a role in reconfiguring representations of stimuli that have been previously encountered, shifting one’s reliance from perceptual properties to memory-guided processes.</p><p id="P47">Supplementary analysis suggested that SCN activation was not higher in the <italic>switch</italic> phase, despite evidence that both SCN and control B are allied to DMN (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Davey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dixon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and contribute to semantic cognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Faber et al., 2019</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that SCN strongly overlaps with control A, with minimal overlap with control B (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Control A is thought to support the control of externally-oriented cognition, as this network couples with dorsal attention regions to respond to external task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). One reason for this distinction between the SCN and control B networks might be that SCN is defined according to activation in externally-presented tasks, while the <italic>switch</italic> phase of our experimental task did not involve the presentation of new stimuli. SCN might therefore support the controlled retrieval of semantic information from perceptual inputs as well as the internal generation of associations, while control B might be more critical for perceptually-decoupled semantic cognition.</p><p id="P48">Importantly, the observed functional dissociation in the FT and MT DMN subsystems in the processing of distinct semantic features was consistent across the <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phases, with varying retrieval demands. Though the MT DMN did show a preference for the <italic>generate</italic> over the <italic>switch</italic> phase, this subnetwork still reliably activated for <italic>semantic context</italic> associations, while reliably deactivating for <italic>emotion</italic> associations. These subnetworks may therefore serve separate functions in a context-invariant manner, rather than themselves being sensitive to retrieval demands. Retrieval demands and task features may be largely orthogonal dimensions of DMN organisation. While showing a preference for the <italic>switch</italic> phase, control B showed no difference in activation between the <italic>semantic context</italic> and <italic>emotion</italic> tasks. Moreover, analysis positioning these task responses on whole-brain gradients capturing key dimensions of cortical organisation showed that clusters implicated in the <italic>switch</italic> phase tended towards the heteromodal apex of the principal gradient, while no effect of association type was observed. This suggests that <italic>semantic context</italic> associations, associated with the MT subnetwork, were not more perceptually-decoupled that <italic>emotion</italic> associations, associated with the FT subnetwork. This was true despite the MT subnetwork being associated with episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna &amp; Grilli, 2021</xref>), even though many episodic memory tasks involve internally-oriented retrieval. Both MT and FT may be able to support access to heteromodal memory representations from visual inputs, as well as sustain more internal pathways to access spatial scenes and abstract, evaluative representations, thought to be supported by these subsystems, respectively.</p><p id="P49">There are limitations to the current study. First, the data do not indicate that the FT subsystem is not involved in the retrieval of semantic information about meaningful contexts; the analysis relies on task contrasts, so we can only conclude that the FT subsystem is less activated by <italic>semantic context</italic> than <italic>emotion</italic> associations. In this way, our data do not contradict the view that anterior and lateral temporal lobe regions act as a ‘semantic hub’, allowing us to integrate the full range of features that we learn about concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Patterson et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the structure of our task does not disentangle the experience of seeing a picture for the first time from the generation of a dominant association. There are likely different levels of controlled processing required for the <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phases, since participants indicated that their associations after the switch tended to be weaker. Future studies are needed to establish whether manipulations of the strength of the association being retrieved have comparable effects on MT and FT subnetworks, in the absence of any differences in the extent to which retrieval is externally- or internally-mediated. Third, while prior studies have implicated the MT DMN in episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna &amp; Grilli, 2021</xref>), here we demonstrate its relevance in contextual semantic associations. We cannot say with certainty whether participants drew on episodic strategies in the retrieval of these associations, although participants were asked to avoid retrieving episodic memories. However, participants in prior work have reported using episodic strategies to generate strong semantic links between words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2022</xref>). Future research on this topic may benefit from asking participants to provide detail on the strategy used to generate associations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Humphreys et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, it is unclear the extent to which participants were generating immersive visuospatial scenes and embodied emotional responses to stimuli. Findings from tasks requiring semantic judgements of valence, as conducted here, cannot be directly applied to experiential affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Itkes &amp; Kron, 2019</xref>). Future research may benefit from explicitly considering the role of semantic control in experiential aspects of semantic retrieval. For example, it is unclear if the same MT/FT dissociation would have occurred if the <italic>emotion</italic> associations had been more experiential in this study, given that the FT is associated with abstract aspects of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P50">We compared the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of both semantic contextual and emotional associations with pictures. Clusters implicated in the retrieval of subordinate-level associations were located towards the heteromodal end of the principal gradient, and showed reduced deactivation in a control network allied to DMN. The generation of contextual and emotional associations showed a dissociation across DMN subnetworks corresponding to scene construction and abstract processing, respectively. This dissociation was consistent across the <italic>generate</italic> and <italic>switch</italic> phases, suggesting that the functions of these networks are consistent despite varying retrieval demands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS189027-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d221aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thank you to Rebecca Lowndes, Richard Aveyard, Holly Brown, and Andre Gouws for their assistance in scanning participants and training investigators as MRI operators.
