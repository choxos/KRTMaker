Arginine metabolism in Dendritic cells (DC) has been shown to reduce T cell activation; however, it is unclear how this immunosuppressive state is induced. To address this issue, we examined the immunomodulatory capacity of various metabolites from arginine metabolism. Through the use of a recently described DC:T cell interaction assay and flow cytometry we demonstrated that spermidine most significantly inhibited DC activation, preventing subsequent interactions with CD4 T cells. DC function could be restored by addition of inhibitors of spermidine metabolism via the eIF5A-hypusine axis, required for expression of some mitochondrial enzymes. We also demonstrated that the spermidine induced-immunosuppressive state protected DC against activation induced loss of mitochondrial capacity for energy generation, which was also hypusination dependent. Taken together this data demonstrates that spermidine is the key immunomodulatory component downstream of arginine metabolism and that it mediates this effect by stimulating hypusination-dependent protection of OXPHOS in DC, which in turn results in a reduced ability of DC to activate and interact with T cells. This pathway may be utilised by the immune system to regulate excessive immune responses but could also be exploited by pathogens as a method of immune evasion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>spermidine</kwd><kwd>immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>eIF5A</kwd><kwd>hypusination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>lntroduction</title><p id="P2">Cellular metabolic pathways such as Glycolysis, Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS), Fatty Acid Oxidation/Synthesis and amino acid metabolism are increasingly implicated in regulating activation and proliferation of immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While a wide range of metabolic changes are required to support the bioenergetic demands of cell activation, many metabolic systems are more closely involved in selectively promoting effector phenotypes underlying immunity and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. For example, Arginine metabolism has been widely studied in macrophage activation, where classically activated (M1 or inflammatory) macrophages upregulate nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and metabolise arginine to produce nitric oxide as an antimicrobial agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

They perform this role by sensing and responding to environmental stimuli such as pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs). These activating stimuli induce metabolic changes in DC that play an important role in supporting the effector role of DC in initiating T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. For example, TLR activation of DC stimulates an increase in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands of T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Later in the response, inflammatory dendritic cells metabolise arginine via nitric oxide production which acts to block mitochondrial respiration requiring a shift toward glycolysis for ATP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, under certain conditions, arginase driven metabolism of arginine results in reduced T cell activation, potentially contributing to immune tolerance or suppression of excessive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The role of the arginase pathway in mediating reduced T cell activation is thought to be through the depletion of L-arginine, which is an essential amino acid required for T cell proliferation and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, more recent studies demonstrate potentially immune modifying activity for downstream products of the arginase pathway, for example, polyamines in modifying mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and <italic>γ</italic>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in driving autophagy for intracellular remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> required to support T cell activation.</p><p id="P4">Here we investigate the immunomodulatory activity of downstream metabolites of the arginase pathway. We demonstrate that exogenously added spermidine had 100 to 1000-fold greater inhibition of the ability of DC to interact with T cells compared with other products of arginase metabolism, which correlated with the ability of spermidine to inhibit DC activation. The inhibitory effects of spermidine on DC activation and T cell interaction were overcome by addition of GC7, demonstrating that the spermidine eIF5A-hypusine axis was responsible for immunomodulation. Together with subsequent metabolic analysis, our data demonstrate that exogenous spermidine stimulates spares activation induced loss of mitochondrial OXPHOS for energy generation, leading to suppression of DC effector functions and reduced T cell responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P5">C57BL/6 female mice (6–10-week-old) were purchased from Envigo (Wyton, United Kingdom).

GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) was found not to influence ConA or pOVA driven DC-T cell interactions at any concentration. In contrast, ornithine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), putrescine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and agmatine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) significantly reduced ConA and pOVA induced DC-T cell interactions with metabolite concentrations between 5mM-50mM and 10mM-50mM (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05). Arginine and ornithine also significantly reduced interactions at lower concentrations with ConA, however this was not a consistent response. Spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) had the greatest impact on DC-T cell interactions, producing a significant dose-dependent reduction at all concentrations (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05).</p><p id="P17">We next performed a series of flow cytometry experiments to determine if the effect of spermidine on DC-T cell interactions was associated with changes in DC activation. Based upon the IC50 calculated from the DC-T interaction assay, we incubated BMDCs with 0.1mM spermidine in the presence of the TLR4 agonist LPS. We demonstrated a significant reduction in the percentage of cells positive for the activation markers CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05) while no effect was observed on the percentage of cells expressing CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and MHCII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Assessment of the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of these markers indicated a similar pattern with significantly reduced expression of CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) whilst MHCII was found to be unaffected (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05).</p><p id="P18">Spermidine is synthesised via the polyamine pathway where it acts a precursor for spermine synthesis and as a substrate for hypusination of eIF5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine how spermidine induces immunosuppression we utilised a number of analogues that interfere with the polyamine pathway. These included DENSPM, which promotes catabolism of spermine and spermidine; GC7 which inhibits synthesis of an eIF5A intermediate and CPX which inhibits eIF5A hypusination. Using the DC-T interaction assay, we incubated BMDCs with these inhibitors in the presence of ConA and 0.1mM spermidine. We found that DENSPM was unable to reverse spermidine induced inhibition of DC-T cell interactions at any concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast CPX was shown to have an effect at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) whilst GC7 was found to have a significant dose-dependent effect at all concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05) producing an EC50 between 0.43 and 2.39μM.</p><p id="P19">To confirm the results from the DC-T interaction assay and show definitively that the immunosuppressive effect of spermidine was mediated by eIF5A hypusination in DC, we performed further flow cytometry experiments where BMDCs were incubated with spermidine and 1μM GC7 in the presence of LPS. These experiments confirmed that GC7 treatment reversed spermidine induced inhibition with a significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing the activation markers CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and MHCII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) compared to spermidine treatment alone (One Way ANOVA, P&lt;0.05).

While spermidine and/or GC7 treatment had a minor effect on OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>) there was no impact on ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). However, on activation of BMDC with LPS, spermidine pretreatment prevented loss of both the OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4K</xref>) and the ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4L</xref>) compared with LPS alone, with GC7 treatment reversing this effect. For OCR, this is most clearly seen at baseline respiration, prior to oligomycin treatment, and at maximal respiration rate seen following addition of the uncoupling agent FCCP.

However, using the deoxyhypusine inhibitor GC7 we have demonstrated definitively that spermidine exerts its effects in DCs by initiating eI5FA hypusination.

Furthermore, blocking hypusination inhibits the metabolic effects of spermidine and concomitantly restores DC function. This suggests that spermidine blocks DC activation by altering DC mitochondrial capacity via hypusination of eI5FA. In line with the observations in our study, others have shown an association between OXPHOS and an anti-inflammatory state in immune cells including macrophages and DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Regulating or mimicking metabolites within specific immune cells is an ongoing area of research that offers a potential strategy for treating autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> but is unclear in DCs whether immunosuppression is induced directly via hypusination or indirectly via increased mitochondrial respiration. Certain RNA viruses, including influenza, directly hypusinate eIF5a in stromal cells to prevent interferon production and thus promote viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This same mechanism may be induced by spermidine to prevent DC activation however it is also possible that hypusination alters mitochondrial capacity and the OXPHOS pathway which itself leads to an immunosuppressive state.
