Ageing results in a loss of intestinal epithelial homeostasis characterised by changes in architecture, cellular composition, and regenerative potential of the stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, immune activation and intestinal permeability / barrier dysfunction increase and there are shifts in the size and taxonomic composition of the commensal microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. These phenotypes are interrelated such that interventions that target one will impact other aspects of intestinal homeostasis. Moreover, preventing a loss of intestinal homeostasis with age delays age-related decline in the organism as a whole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies have established the importance of intestinal homeostasis as a cornerstone of healthy ageing.</p><p id="P5">Alongside these studies of intestinal cell biology, physiology and microbiota we have seen growing evidence of the role of nutrition in maintaining health throughout the life course. The signalling network that regulates metabolism and growth is well accepted to influence lifelong health. This network responds to nutritional cues, and dietary nutrients and feeding patterns can themselves regulate ageing (reviewed in Longo and Anderson, 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>). It is clear from this body of work that interactions between nutritional cues and longevity-associated signalling pathways are complex and context dependent. Genetics, sex, existing health status and age of onset all influence the ability of dietary interventions to extend lifespan and improve health (reviewed in Longo and Anderson, 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>). Despite the challenge posed by this complexity, personalised nutrition has the potential to optimise individual health and longevity.</p><p id="P6">One key outcome of the intensive study of nutritional regulation of ageing is an appreciation that nutritional needs change significantly with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> as does the ability of established nutritional interventions to extend longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Taking this together with our knowledge of age-related intestinal decline it is surprising that few studies have addressed the impact of intestinal decline on nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. In this regard, older animal studies suggest a reduction in transport of a range of nutrients with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. More recently, it has been postulated that age-related defects in membrane trafficking drive loss of intestinal barrier function and might also disrupt nutrient absorption, thus underlying age-related changes in metabolic status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. An assumption that nutrient absorption is reduced with age pervades online sources of nutritional advice, and while these claims are not unfounded it has not yet been established that a loss of nutrient absorption is a general feature of ageing or whether such a loss impacts all nutrient types. More importantly, the mechanisms underlying such a loss, the consequences for intestinal physiology and ageing, and the impact on the effectiveness of nutritional interventions have not been explored.</p><p id="P7">A recent article summarizing the discussions that took place at an NIH workshop on diet and healthspan put forward a list of questions that will need to be considered priorities in future research, among them the question: “Do nutrient transport and uptake change with age?”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, exploring this is challenging because to date, tools enabling deeper investigation of age-related changes in intestinal nutrient management have been limited. We aim to address this in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a short-lived and genetically tractable model system that has been extensively used in studies of the ageing intestine. We present a novel assay that combines a chemically defined diet with metabolic profiling of faecal nutrient content to assess changes in nutrient uptake/excretion balance with age. Using this assay, we demonstrate that amino acid uptake is reduced in aged flies, and this is associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters in the midgut epithelium. Further, a diet mimicking the intestinal amino acid load of aged flies is detrimental to the health of young flies. These data suggest that age-related decline may drive changes in nutrient absorption capacity with further consequences for health. Therefore, our findings have significant implications for the rational design of nutritional interventions that aim to delay age-related decline.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P)</title><p id="P8">To measure changes in nutrient absorption/excretion balance we adopted a strategy of comparing nutritional input and output by combining a chemically defined <italic>Drosophila</italic> media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> with mass spectrometry profiling of faecal nutrient content. We included a non-absorbable food dye in the media to calculate the quantity of food ingested for each faecal sample by measuring its dye content. This enabled direct comparison between nutrient intake and output.</p><p id="P9">First, we needed to establish that the defined diet supported the adult stage of our wild-type Canton-S flies as expected under our laboratory conditions. Given the previously reported developmental delay of flies reared on the defined diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we reared flies on our standard cornmeal diet, transferring them to the defined diet in early adulthood. Diet is an important determinant of lifespan and age-related health and so we assessed the lifespan of our flies on the defined diet compared to our standard cornmeal diet. We found the change in diet did not alter the lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1A</xref>). We also found that flies on the defined diet continued to show an age-related increase in intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1B-D</xref>) as measured by the Smurf assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Finally, we assessed the ability of the defined diet to support lifespan of axenic flies. We found axenic conditions resulted in lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1E</xref>), demonstrating that the nutritional requirements of adult female flies are fully met by the diet alone and do not need to be supplemented by the microbiota. In fact, the presence of the microbiota is detrimental with regards to lifespan in Canton-S females under our laboratory conditions.</p><p id="P10">Having confirmed the defined diet did not impact lifespan we developed a faecal collection protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Inclusion of FD&amp;C blue no. 1 in the media enabled us to score “Smurf” flies that had lost intestinal barrier function and exclude them from the assay as the concentration of dye in the fecal matter is no longer representative of food intake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In the remaining flies the concentration of blue no. 1 in each faecal sample then provides a proxy for food consumed. Normalisation of mass spectroscopy data to dye concentration controls for differences in food intake or the quantity of faecal matter collected.</p><p id="P11">For the purposes of this study, we quantified amino acids only from our final samples (see below); however, we provide details of sample preparation designed to enable measurement of amino acids, sugars and cholesterol from each faecal collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Faecal collection involved washing faecal matter from the sides of the collection vials. Initial tests showed that two water washes were sufficient to collect 80% of amino acids and almost 50% of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 1F</xref>). Given the time required for each wash and the diminishing returns from each additional wash, we used two water washes going forward. An additional wash with DCM:MeOH enabled collection of the remaining cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 1F</xref>), and presumably aids in collection of non-polar molecules more generally. We also found the DCM:MeOH wash to contain some amino acids, including cysteine which was not detected in the water washes. Together our faecal collection and analysis protocols result in samples that can be used to measure a wide range of nutrients and metabolites. This protocol can also be adapted for untargeted metabolomics approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Faecal amino acid levels increase with age</title><p id="P12">Given the importance of dietary protein levels in lifespan determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and previous reports of reduced amino acid transport with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we next applied the D.U.M.P. assay to assess changes in amino acid absorption/excretion balance with age. We found a consistent trend toward increased amino acid concentrations in faecal matter from aged flies, although not every amino acid showed a statistically significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We reasoned the previously reported age-related increases in microbial load in the fly intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> may drive this age-related increase in faecal amino acid concentrations. To test the microbial contribution to age related changes, we repeated the D.U.M.P. assay in a cohort of axenic flies. Given the lifespan extension seen in axenic flies we included a later life faecal collection. To characterise the structure of the data we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the conventional and axenic datasets. Plotting the data in respect to the first and second principal components, which explain the most variance, showed clustering by age in the conventional dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In the axenic dataset there was no separation between the 10 and 40-day faecal samples, indicating a high degree of similarity between these samples. However, the sample collected at 52-days shows separation from the 10 and 40-day samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that the axenic lifespan shows no increase in mortality at the 40-day timepoint, while the conventional lifespan is at 75% survival at 40 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 1E</xref>). The axenic lifespan drops rapidly from 80% to 50% survival between days 50 and 53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting the 52-day timepoint is a closer match to the 40-day conventional sample with regards to biological age. For this reason, the 52-day sample was used for further analysis.</p><p id="P14">To determine the contribution of epithelial ageing to the changing faecal amino acid profile in the absence of the microbiota we compared our axenic samples across the age range. As suggested by our PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), a trend toward increased amino acid concentrations in the faecal matter of aged flies remained in the axenic cohort, although this was statistically significant for fewer amino acids than in the conventional dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The amino acids that showed statistically significant changes upon ageing were different between the conventional and axenic datasets, demonstrating the contribution of the microbiota. Nevertheless, age-related changes in the intestinal epithelium are sufficient to result in changes in the faecal amino acid profile with age and in general contribute to an increased amino acid load in aged fly faeces.</p><p id="P15">Although changes in faecal amino acid profile are observed in axenic flies a detailed analysis of individual amino acid changes reveals important contributions from the microbiota. Overall, the level of each amino acid is lower in axenic fecal matter compared to conventional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). To further assess this, we calculated the amino acid concentration contributed by the microbiota in young (10-day conventional – 10-day axenic) and old (40-day conventional – 52-day axenic) flies. This calculation was performed by comparing every conventional value to every axenic value, for each amino acid. This analysis confirmed that the microbiota is an important contributor to the faecal amino acid profile in both young and old flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>). To visualise age-related changes in microbial contribution we ordered the amino acids by microbial contribution. Several changes in graph position are seen between young (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>) and old (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>) flies, confirming that changes in the microbial population contribute to age-related changes in the faecal amino acid profile. In addition, the order of amino acids in both young and old samples are different from that in the media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 2D</xref>), confirming the overall contribution of the microbiota to the faecal amino acid pool.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Recapitulating aged amino acid load shortens lifespan</title><p id="P16">Given the elevation of amino acid levels in the aged intestinal lumen we next assessed whether these changes altered lifespan. We used the D.U.M.P data to design a diet that mimics the amino acid changes that occur with age in conventionally reared flies. The amino acid concentrations in this diet, called Aged Amino Acid (AA) media, were determined by adding the difference in mean concentration between the 10- and 40-day conventional faecal samples to the concentration in the original defined media. Amino acid concentrations in the Aged AA media ranged from 1.15 to 5.18 times the concentrations in the standard defined diet. The average increase in concentration was 2.15 times that of the standard diet, equivalent to dietary protein levels that have previously been shown to reduce <italic>Drosophila</italic> lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">We found that exposure to the Aged AA media from young adult life significantly and reproducibly reduced lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supp. Fig. 3A</xref>). This result was also observed in a cohort of axenic flies, suggesting it is independent of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Consistent with this observation we found no significant impact of diet on internal bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In addition, a capillary feeding assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, showed no significant difference in food intake between the standard and Aged AA media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These data are consistent with the known lifespan impact of a high protein diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and suggest that increased intestinal amino acid load may contribute to age-related decline.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Expression of intestinal amino acid transporters changes with age</title><p id="P18">We next sought to understand why epithelial ageing results in increased faecal amino acid levels in the absence of the microbiota. We reasoned that this may reflect reduced amino acid transport across the intestinal epithelium with age, as previously reported for several animal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As a proxy measure of transport capacity, we assessed the expression levels of a panel of amino acid transporters in young and old intestinal tissue.</p><p id="P19">First, we generated a list of validated and predicted Drosophila amino acid transporters; this list contained 48 genes, 21 of which were unnamed. To select for genes expressed in the gut, we used the online databases Flygut-<italic>seq</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and FlyAtlas 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Genes which showed homology to human intestinal amino acid transporters were also identified using DIOPT Ortholog Finder and included<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This generated a final list of 18 genes spanning 8 solute carrier families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Table 1</xref>). Of these we were able to validate quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers for 13 transporters, representing six solute carrier (SLC) families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Table 1</xref>). The validated primers were were used to quantify expression in young (10 day) and old (45 day) Canton-S female intestinal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supp. Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We found six transporter genes across 4 SLC families that showed statistically significant changes with age: sbm, Eaat1, dmGlut and slif showed significant downregulation, while CG43693 and path were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). The amino acid substrates for CG43693 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and Sombremesa (sbm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) are unknown, and Pathetic (Path) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) has been suggested to act primarily as a transceptor due to its low transport capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, several amino acid transporters showed decreased expression levels in aged intestines consistent with the D.U.M.P data.</p><p id="P21">Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Eaat1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) transports L-glutamate with highest affinity, although L- and D- aspartate are also substrates, and there is evidence to indicate a functional role in the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. A second glutamate transporter, dietary and metabolic glutamate transporter (dmGlut), also showed reduced expression with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Both glutamate and aspartate show a trend toward increased levels in faecal samples from old conventionally reared and axenic flies. This increase is statistically significant for aspartate in axenic samples, suggesting the underlying cause is independent of the microbiota.</p><p id="P22">Slimfast (slif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>) transports L-arginine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and could be inferred to also transport lysine due to its homology to the cationic amino acid transporter family, although this has not been tested to our knowledge. A statistically significant increase in arginine and lysine levels is seen in faecal samples from old axenic flies and for arginine in faecal samples from old conventionally reared flies.</p><p id="P23">We further confirmed that the changes in expression reported for <italic>path, sbm, Eaat1, dmGlut</italic> and <italic>slif</italic> were retained in axenic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H-K</xref>). CG43693 showed a trend toward increased expression in old axenic flies, but this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, this suggests the recorded changes in transporter expression are independent of the microbiota. Taken together these data support a model whereby age-related changes in the expression levels of amino acid transporters result in reduced transport across aged intestinal epithelia and contribute to increased luminal amino acid levels.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Intestinal slimfast expression level regulates lifespan</title><p id="P24">We next sought to understand the physiological impact of reduced amino acid transporter expression during ageing. We focused on slimfast due to the availability of genetic tools and the significantly increased faecal concentration of its substrates with age.</p><p id="P25">To determine whether the age-related loss of <italic>slif</italic> expression is functionally relevant, we knocked down <italic>slimfast</italic> expression specifically in intestinal tissue from early adulthood. We used the <italic>slif-antisense</italic> line (<italic>slif<sup>anti</sup></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and the TIGS driver, a drug inducible geneswitch Gal4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, enabling us to restrict knockdown to the adult stage. We observed a significant and reproducible lifespan extension in drug induced females compared to vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig 5A</xref>). Given that slimfast has been previously shown to regulate feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and that reduced food intake itself can regulate lifespan we performed a capillary feeding assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We found no observable difference in the volume of food consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Considering that reduced intestinal <italic>slif</italic> may alter luminal nutrient availability, subsequently altering the intestinal microbiota, we measured bacterial load using qPCR of the bacterial 16S gene. Interestingly, we observed reduced bacterial load in old <italic>slif<sup>anti</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), both prior to and following loss of intestinal barrier function. In contrast, overexpression of <italic>slif</italic> in the intestine for the full adult lifespan or during later adult life had no consistent impact on lifespan and did not change intestinal bacterial load (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 5B-F</xref>). These data suggest loss of intestinal <italic>slif</italic> expression in later life may be protective and may confer improved control of the intestinal microbiota in the aged intestine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">In this study we have developed a powerful new assay that enables us to investigate the relationship between intestinal homeostasis and nutrient management in a genetically tractable model system. We have used the D.U.M.P assay to demonstrate an increase in amino acid levels in the faecal matter, and by proxy the intestinal lumen, of aged flies. It is important to note that our targeted mass spectrometry approach measures only free amino acids. Free amino acids in the faeces will include those remaining unabsorbed from the diet, as well as those contributed by secretion from microbial or fly cells, and those released from microbial or fly proteins by digestion. Comparison between the faecal content of conventional and axenically reared flies has demonstrated the significant contribution of the intestinal microbiota to the luminal amino acid pool. It also demonstrates the significant changes in this contribution that result from age-related shifts in the microbial population. How changes to microbial load and taxonomic representation in the aged intestinal microbiota impacts the local nutritional environment and reciprocally how the local nutritional environment impacts the microbiota warrant further investigation.</p><p id="P27">In addition to the microbial contribution, secreted proteins and shed fly cells may contribute to the nutrient pool. Elevated immune responses in the aged intestine could raise both the levels of secreted proteins (including antimicrobial peptides and other immune responsive proteins) and intestinal cell death and shedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Our current data cannot distinguish between amino acids remaining unabsorbed from the diet and those contributed from secreted fly proteins or shed intestinal cells. However, it will be important to address the relative contributions of these amino acid sources in future studies. Reduced expression levels of a subset of amino acid transporters in the aged intestine suggests that reduced amino acid transport into epithelial cells also contributes to elevated luminal levels in aged animals. While past studies have focused on the importance of dietary protein levels to healthy ageing (reviewed in Babygirija and Lamming, 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>), our data highlight additional sources of elevated amino acid exposure in the aged intestine. Could reductions in dietary protein levels be effective in improving health because they counter natural increases in amino acid exposure that result from age-related intestinal decline?</p><p id="P28">As we would expect from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, increasing dietary amino acid levels shortens lifespan. It is important to note that when feeding additional amino acids to young flies we assume an increased uptake of amino acids by the intestine, and therefore elevated amino acid levels in intestinal cells and other tissues. However, reduced transport of some amino acids by the aged intestine would mean that in older individuals elevating dietary amino acid levels may not result in elevated levels of all amino acids in the intestinal cells or other tissues, with potential consequences for metabolic status. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the impacts of distinct amino acid pools, those that remain in the gut lumen and those that undergo transport into the organism. This is evidenced in our data, given that knockdown of <italic>slimfast</italic> can be expected to raise luminal levels of the amino acids that it transports but, contrary to the impact of increased dietary amino acids, extends lifespan.</p><p id="P29">There is some evidence that increased levels of <italic>slimfast</italic> substrates may be beneficial to gut health. Arginine has been shown to improve intestinal immunity phenotypes in mice, through modulation of the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Increasing arginine levels also increases the diversity of murine microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> improving the phenotypes of a colitis model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The benefits can also be passed on through faecal transplantation, whereas antibiotic treatment prevents the improved colitis phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Supplementation of lysine in lambs has also been shown to protect intestinal mucosa and integrity, enhance innate immune responses, and alter microbial composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. It is unknown whether the benefits of supplementing with these amino acids requires their uptake by intestinal cells, or whether elevated levels in the gut lumen is sufficient. The impact of elevated levels of <italic>slimfast</italic> substrates on the microbiota may be reflected in the improved microbial control that we record following <italic>slimfast</italic> knockdown.</p><p id="P30">In addition to impacts on the microbiota, some amino acids may have specific roles in maintaining health of the intestinal epithelium. For example, increased glutamate concentration has been shown to stimulate intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, whether proliferation was impaired or stimulated depended on glutamate concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. L-arginine has also been shown to stimulate ISC expansion in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Elevated activity of the amino acid sensing Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway, an established regulator of longevity, as a result of elevated amino acid levels may also have a role in intestinal decline. Recently, it has been demonstrated that TOR inhibition delays age-related intestinal decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> with genetic interventions targeted to intestinal stem cells sufficient to preserve homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Evidence is also emerging that elevated TOR activation in intestinal cells may be a feature of natural ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. The impact of reduced <italic>slimfast</italic> levels on larval growth is mediated by reduced TOR activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, and we suggest that reduced <italic>slimfast</italic> levels in the gut may protect against elevated luminal amino acid levels via reduced TOR activity.</p><p id="P31">Substrates of <italic>slimfast</italic> also have roles beyond the gut. Reduced levels of arginine and lysine are associated with ageing skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, while arginine and lysine have been shown to have a positive association with lifespan in a study of fibroblasts taken from a range of primate, avian and rodent species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Lysine also decreases with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. and supplementation of arginine or lysine increases the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. High lysine levels have also been linked to longevity in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Despite the evidence for the beneficial effects of arginine in the gut, arginine supplementation has been shown to increase the secretion of IGF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> and growth hormone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, both of which have pro-ageing functions in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. It also stimulates activity of the TOR pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Increased arginine levels have been found in aged Drosophila<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and supplementation of 20mM arginine to the diet of Drosophila leads to a lifespan reduction, and reduced fecundity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. These apparent contradictions again suggest pleiotropic roles for individual amino acids acting in metabolism and as signalling molecules systemically and within individual tissues.</p><p id="P32">Moving forward it will be important to deepen our understanding of the impact of intestinal ageing on the epithelium’s ability to take up nutrients, the resulting changes to the local nutrient environment and the apparent pleiotropic roles of individual nutrients. Such understanding will be critical in the development of rationally designed nutritional therapies. For example, despite the evidence to suggest a detrimental effect of high-protein diets, there are currently calls to increase the daily recommended protein intake for elderly persons to prevent or reduce age-related muscle loss and sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Aged muscle cells are believed to be resistant to stimuli such that elderly individuals must consume higher amounts of protein to stimulate muscle growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. However, our data suggest reduced amino acid uptake by the intestine may be an additional mechanism underlying reduced muscle mass in the elderly. Perhaps higher quantities of protein must be consumed because a lower proportion is absorbed and bioavailable to the muscles. Raising protein levels in the intestinal lumen may counter reduced amino acid transport ability but may also hasten intestinal decline.</p><p id="P33">In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that age-related decline impacts nutrient management by the intestinal epithelium, which profoundly changes the local nutritional environment with consequences for age-related health. While we have focused on one class of nutrient and on the impact of intestinal ageing, the D.U.M.P. assay has much broader applicability. In combination with the genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the tractability of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiota, the D.U.M.P. assay will enable researchers in this field to assess the impact of a wide range of perturbations on the gut nutrient pool. For example, how does nutrient availability change during infection or following a loss of cellular homeostasis and subsequent regeneration? What role does nutritional availability play in these processes? In what ways do specific microbes contribute to the nutrient pool, and how does this change following perturbation of the microbial community? How do changes in the expression of nutrient transporters impact the nutrient pool, in what circumstances beyond aging do these changes occur, and what are the consequences for intestinal physiology, microbial balance and organismal health? Given that the local nutritional environment is not simply determined by the diet, such studies are an essential complement to efforts to understand the impact of the levels of specific nutrients on intestinal homeostasis, metabolic status, and organismal health.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Fly stocks</title><p id="P34">This work used the wild-type Canton-S strain (gift of Linda Partridge), TIGS-2-GeneSwitch driver line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> (gift of David Walker), UAS-slif<sup>anti</sup> (BDSC #52655) and UAS-slif (BDSC #52661).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Fly culture</title><p id="P35">Flies were maintained in either vials or bottles in incubators with 65% humidity and a 12-hour light/dark cycle, at either 18°C or 25°C.

To prepare, defined media was cooked as described above, with the addition of 2.5 % blue food dye #1 after cooking (as in the Smurf assay). As well as preparing 4 mL vials, the food was poured into petri-dishes for the assembly of collection vials. Collection vials are open-ended glass tubes with 2.4 cm external diameter and 9.6 cm high, similar dimensions to standard fly vials. These were provided by the glassblowing workshop within the Durham University chemistry department. Prior to beginning the assay, collection tubes were prepared by using each tube to stamp out a disc of food from the prepared petri-dish.

Once the flies awoke from anaesthesia, they were incubated at 25°C for between 4 and 5 hours to eat and defecate as usual. Standing the vials at a 45° angle results in an improved sample, particularly when collecting samples from aged flies with reduced mobility. Following incubation, the flies were anaesthetised with CO<sub>2</sub>, the parafilm removed and the food disc along with the flies was pushed out from the bottom of the tube. The outside of the vial and the food residue was cleaned with a tissue dampened by milliQ water until the tissue came away clean.</p><p id="P46">The collection vials were all the same weight (26.91g ± 0.41) and fit inside 50mL falcon tubes. Once within the 50 mL tube, the collection vials were thoroughly rinsed with 1.5 mL of water to collect the polar, water-soluble faecal fraction, and spun down. The same 1.5 mL of water was used to rinse each tube. This ensured the sample could be frozen and lyophilised quickly. Two falcon tubes are used, with the collection vials each being washed, then the water sample split between the falcons, to ensure the tubes are balanced for centrifugation. Once all tubes are rinsed, the sample is transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The rinse is repeated a second time to ensure all faecal matter is collected, resulting in two water-wash samples of 1.5 mL.</p><p id="P47">The vials were then rinsed thoroughly with a 1:1 mixture of DCM and methanol to collect non-polar deposits. The rinses were carried out in a small glass beaker to collect the sample. The volume for this wash was not limited, but approximately 5 mL was used for all the tubes.
