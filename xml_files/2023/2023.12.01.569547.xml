Whereas euchromatin has an open structure and is associated with active transcription, facultative heterochromatin is essential to silence developmental genes and forms compact nuclear condensates, called polycomb bodies. Whether the specific chromatin properties of facultative heterochromatin require distinct DSB repair mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we integrate single DSB systems in euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and find that facultative heterochromatic DSBs rapidly move outside polycomb bodies. These DSB movements coincide with a break-proximal reduction in the canonical heterochromatin mark histone H3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). We demonstrate that DSB movement and loss of H3K27me3 at heterochromatic DSBs both depend on the histone demethylase dUtx. Moreover, loss of dUtx specifically disrupts completion of homologous recombination at heterochromatic DSBs. We conclude that DSBs in facultative heterochromatin require dUtx-mediated loss of H3K27me3 to promote DSB movement and repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Eukaryotic cells are continuously exposed to factors that break or chemically alter DNA. One particularly dangerous type of DNA damage is a double-strand break (DSB), in which both strands of the DNA helix are severed. Improper repair of DSBs can directly lead to insertions, deletions and chromosomal rearrangements associated with disease development including cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. To overcome these detrimental outcomes, cells have evolved mechanisms to repair DSBs of which the two main pathways are Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homologous Recombination (HR). During NHEJ, the severed DNA ends undergo limited end processing and are directly ligated, which can result in small insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site and is therefore considered error-prone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. HR, on the other hand, is usually more precise since it relies on a homologous template to repair the DSB. During HR, the broken DNA ends undergo 5’ to 3’ end resection, generating 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs. This overhang invades a homologous sequence on the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome, which serves as a repair template. The choice of DSB repair pathway depends on multiple aspects, including cell cycle phase, the sequence context of the surrounding DNA, as well as the pre-existing chromatin state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The eukaryotic nucleus consists of a variety of chromatin domains each characterized by specific molecular and biophysical properties. Whereas euchromatin has an open chromatin structure with actively transcribed genes, heterochromatin is more condensed and transcriptionally inactive. One type of heterochromatin is facultative heterochromatin, which is essential to silence specific developmental genes. Facultative heterochromatin can cover large genomic distances (e.g. developmental genes such as Hox genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, or regulatory regions (e.g. promoters)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This type of heterochromatin is enriched for Histone H3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and polycomb group (PcG) proteins, and accumulates in nuclear foci, called polycomb bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Polycomb bodies cluster PcG-bound transcriptionally repressed genomic regions to maintain correct silencing of developmental genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Although the DSB response in open, euchromatic regions has been extensively studied, the DSB repair response in facultative heterochromatin remains largely unknown.</p><p id="P4">In the past decade, it has become clear that the pre-existing chromatin state can directly influence the DSB repair response. For example, DSBs in actively transcribed regions are prone to clustering and repair by HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, DSBs in centromeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and constitutive heterochromatin domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> have been found to move outside the respective domains to facilitate repair. Previous evidence suggests that DSB movements can also occur within the inactive X chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which is a specific type of facultative heterochromatin enriched for both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Irradiation of female human fibroblasts resulted in the specific exclusion of DSB repair proteins outside the inactive X chromosome, suggestive of DSB movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, decompaction of the inactive X upon laser irradiation has also been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, live imaging of individual DSBs to precisely monitor their dynamics within facultative heterochromatin has never been performed. More importantly, the response of polycomb bodies to DSBs in a physiological, <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, and whether this chromatin environment facilitates particular movements of DSBs, remains unknown.</p><p id="P5">Various histone modifications have been identified to play a role in DSB repair in euchromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Silencing histone modifications, including H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and H3K9me2/3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> have been described to be deposited at DSBs in euchromatin, resulting in local, transient heterochromatinization and transcriptional silencing. To restart transcription after DSB repair in euchromatin, active removal of H3K27me3 by the mammalian histone demethylase UTX (Ubiquitously transcribed Tetratricopeptide repeat on X chromosome) has been suggested to occur specifically in cancer cells, not healthy fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast to the accumulation of silencing marks at euchromatic DSBs, we previously identified a loss of H3K9me2/3 at DSBs within <italic>Drosophila</italic> constitutive heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that eu- and heterochromatin regions require differential changes in silencing histone modifications to repair their DSBs. Whether specific H3K27-modifying activities are needed to repair DSBs in H3K27me3-enriched facultative heterochromatin domains remains untested.</p><p id="P6">Here, we study the dynamic DSB response in facultative heterochromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> by integrating inducible single DSB systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> in euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin regions in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using high-resolution live imaging, we find that the majority of DSBs in polycomb bodies rapidly move outside these domains. Moreover, we find that facultative heterochromatic DSBs specifically undergo a local decrease in the canonical heterochromatin histone mark H3K27me3, which is mediated by the histone demethylase dUtx. Early steps of HR can occur efficiently within polycomb bodies and are independent of dUtx, while dUtx is required for subsequent DSB movement and completion of HR. Together, our results reveal that DSBs in facultative heterochromatin move outside the compacted polycomb bodies to promote timely repair by HR.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of a single double-strand break system in facultative heterochromatin</title><p id="P7">To study DSB repair in facultative heterochromatin in detail in animal tissue, and directly compare responses to euchromatin, we generated a set of inducible single DSB systems in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We integrated our previously established <italic>in vivo</italic> DR-<italic>white</italic> reporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> into three facultative heterochromatin regions and two euchromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A, B</xref>). Upon expression of I-Scel, DSBs are induced in the upstream <italic>white</italic> gene. DSB repair pathway usage can subsequently be determined by sequencing the resulting repair products; HR with the downstream i<italic>white</italic> sequence will generate an intact upstream <italic>white</italic> gene, while NHEJ will generate small indels at the cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). We performed ChIP-qPCR (chromatin Immuno-Precipitation followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR)) for the canonical facultative heterochromatin histone modification H3K27me3 and confirmed enrichment of H3K27me3 at the three DR-<italic>white</italic> integrations in heterochromatin when compared to the two euchromatic insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). Moreover, internal controls revealed strong specificity of the antibody used for H3K27me3 ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To allow timed DSB induction, we combined our DR-<italic>white</italic> systems with either a heat-shock inducible I-SceI transgene (<italic>hsp70</italic>.I-SceI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>) or an ecDHFR-I-SceI transgene, which depends on the ligand trimethoprim to stabilize the ecDHFR-I-SceI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We first tested the efficiency and inducibility of our DR-<italic>white</italic> systems by performing ChIP-qPCR for phosphorylated H2Av on Serine 137 (γH2Av, γH2AX in mammals), one of the earliest chromatin markers of DSB induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Heat-shock inducible expression of I-SceI resulted in a local increase in γH2Av levels within six hours at both euchromatic and heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F, G</xref>). Moreover, we find the appearance of single γH2Av foci in nuclei of imaginal discs six hours after heat-shock inducible I-SceI expression in larvae containing either a eu- or heterochromatic DR-<italic>white</italic> insertion (16-18% of cells contained a single γH2Av focus compared to 3-5% in control cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1B</xref>). These results suggest efficient DSB induction in both eu- and heterochromatic loci.</p><p id="P9">To directly determine which DSB repair pathways play a role in facultative heterochromatin, we performed Sanger sequencing followed by TIDE analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> on the DR-<italic>white</italic> reporters upon I-SceI expression. Feeding trimethoprim throughout development (3-4 days) to DR-<italic>white</italic> larvae expressing ecDHFR-I-SceI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>) results in the appearance of repair products in both eu- and heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H</xref>). Repair rates vary slightly between integration sites (55-70%), possibly reflecting differential cuffing efficiency or repair timing at the different sites. However, no apparent differences in the number of identified repair products were found between heterochromatin and euchromatin, indicating that both domains undergo efficient DSB induction and repair. More importantly, repair pathway analyses revealed that I-SceI-induced DSBs in both eu- and heterochromatin regions employ HR (17-26%) and NHEJ (74-83%) to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1I</xref>). In line with this, expression of hsp.I-SceI also resulted in the appearance of DSB repair products (7-19%) and similar HR and NHEJ repair percentages in eu- and heterochromatin DR-<italic>white</italic> integrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1C, D</xref>). Our heat-shock inducible system resulted in an overall lower number of repair products when compared to ecDHFR-I-SceI, likely reflecting the shorter duration of I-SceI expression (24 hours in hsp.I-SceI compared to 3-4 days in ecDHFR-I-SceI system). To confirm the role of HR repair at facultative heterochromatic DSBs, we depleted the end resection HR protein CtIP using RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1E</xref>) and analyzed DR-<italic>white</italic> repair products following hsp.I-SceI induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1F, G</xref>). As expected, loss of CtIP resulted in a decrease in HR repair products (3-11% compared to 23-33% in control) in both eu- and heterochromatin, indicating that the identified HR repair products indeed reflect end resection dependent HR repair.</p><p id="P10">Together, these data reveal that our systems efficiently induce DSBs with little variation between euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin regions in repair products, suggesting that both chromatin regions undergo similar DSB repair efficiency and pathway choice. Our inducible single DSB system <italic>in vivo</italic> therefore allows us to perform detailed analyses of DSB repair in facultative heterochromatin, and directly compare it to the DSB response in euchromatin.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DSBs rapidly move outside polycomb bodies</title><p id="P11">Specific DSB spatiotemporal dynamics are associated with a variety of chromatin domains, such as centromeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and constitutive heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These dynamics include the movement of DSBs to the periphery of the respective domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Facultative heterochromatin forms distinct domains in the fly and mammalian nucleus, termed polycomb bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We wished to determine whether the distinct molecular- and biophysical-properties of polycomb bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> could impact DSB dynamics and promote movements similar to those previously identified in other nuclear domains. To this end, we employed our DR-<italic>white</italic> systems to perform <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging of single DSBs in facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>) using fluorescently tagged Mu2 to visualize DSBs, and fluorescently tagged polyhomeotic-proximal (ph-p) to visualize polycomb bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). Mu2 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of mammalian MDC1, and directly binds γH2Av<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, while ph-p is one of the four core subunits of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1) and is enriched in fly polycomb bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). Strikingly, our live imaging analyses revealed that the majority of Mu2 foci (60%) that appear within polycomb bodies move outside the domain within ten minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2A</xref>), while euchromatic DSBs that appear outside polycomb bodies remain outside until their disappearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2B</xref>).Importantly, these movements are not specific for I-SceI-induced DSBs, since inducing DSBs in larval tissue using 5Gy gamma-radiation resulted in similar DSB dynamics in ph-p marked polycomb bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E, F</xref>).The majority of radiation-induced Mu2 foci that appeared within polycomb bodies moved outside this domain within ten minutes after appearance, whereas euchromatic DSBs are resolved outside polycomb bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2C</xref>). Taken together, our live imaging data demonstrate for the first time that DSBs move outside polycomb bodies to continue repair.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reduction in H3K27me3 at facultative heterochromatic DSBs is mediated by the histone demethylase dUtx</title><p id="P12">Considering the compact and silent state of facultative heterochromatin, we hypothesized that local chromatin changes could coincide with the specific DSB movements in polycomb bodies. To this end, we assessed the levels of the canonical facultative heterochromatin histone modification H3K27me3 by ChIP-qPCR at DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We observed a decrease in H3K27me3 (loss of 22-34%) at two of the three heterochromatic DSB sites after I-SceI induction, while H3K27me3 at euchromatic DSB sites remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>). Since 16-18% of cells obtain a single DSB six hours after hsp.I-SceI induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1B</xref>), this decrease in H3K27me3 levels suggests a significant loss of H3K27me3 at individual heterochromatic DSBs. To exclude that the observed reduction in H3K27me3 is due to histone loss at the break site, we performed ChIP-qPCR for histone H3, which did not reveal any significant differences in histone H3 levels at euchromatic and heterochromatic DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3A</xref>). The reduction in H3K27me3 was observed in two of the three heterochromatic integrations, suggesting that not all heterochromatic DSBs induce evident loss of H3K27me3. A possibility is that our ChIP assay may not be sensitive enough to pick up on subtle differences in H3K27me3 levels. Nevertheless, our data reveal that DSBs in facultative heterochromatin are frequently accompanied by a local reduction in H3K27me3.</p><p id="P13">We hypothesized that the reduction in H3K27me3 levels at heterochromatic DSBs could be mediated by a histone demethylase that actively removes the methyl groups from H3K27. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dUtx is the only protein described to demethylate H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. To determine whether dUtx removes the methyl group at heterochromatic DSB, we depleted dUtx using RNAi in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>) and assessed H3K27me3 levels at the DSB sites using ChIP-qPCR. Indeed, dUtx depletion leads to retention of H3K27me3 at DSBs in heterochromatin, whereas the H3K27me3 levels at euchromatic DSBs remain unaffected upon DSB induction in the presence or absence of dUtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>). Loss of dUtx did not alter the levels of the DSB marker γH2Av, indicating that the retention of H3K27me3 at DR-<italic>white</italic> sites upon dUtx depletion is not due to inefficient cuffing by I-SceI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3B</xref>). These data suggest that dUtx mediates the removal of H3K27me3 at DSB sites specifically in facultative heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DSB movement and HR repair in facultative heterochromatin depend on dUtx</title><p id="P14">We next hypothesized that the local loss of H3K27me3 at heterochromatic DSBs could be required to promote DSB movement outside polycomb bodies. To test this, we turned to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells in culture which allow for in-depth visualization of repair processes in combination with RNAi-mediated depletions. We visualized the dynamics of the early HR protein ATR Interacting Protein (ATRIP) within polycomb bodies (ph-p domains) in the presence or absence of dUtx using live imaging of 5Gy gamma-radiated <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). ATRIP binds to RPA-coated ssDNA overhangs, which are produced early in HR during 5’ to 3’ end resection of the DSB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. We find that upon irradiation of control cells, ATRIP foci appear inside polycomb bodies and move outside these domains within ten minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4A</xref>), which recapitulates our findings on Mu2 foci dynamics at heterochromatic DSBs in larval tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C, D, F</xref>).Interestingly, ATRIP gets recruited inside polycomb bodies upon irradiation in the absence of dUtx, suggesting that end resection steps are independent of dUtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4B</xref>). However, dUtx depletion does lead to a delay in the movement of ATRIP-coated DSBs outside polycomb bodies. In control cells, 77% of ATRIP foci move outside the polycomb bodies within 10 minutes, while in dUtx depleted cells only 53% move out within this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C</xref>). In line with this, we find an increased accumulation of ATRIP foci within the ph-p domains (21% in control cells during the course of our imaging experiment, compared to 33% in dUtx-depleted cells) indicative of defects in DSB movement upon dUtx depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the early steps of HR (end resection, ATRIP recruitment) occur efficiently within polycomb bodies and are independent of H3K27me3 demethylation at the DSB site. However, dUtx-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 is required for the subsequent DSB movement outside the polycomb body.</p><p id="P15">To test whether this dUtx-dependent DSB movement is required for later repair steps in facultative heterochromatin, we employed our <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter system, which allows the direct assessment of DSB repair pathway choice (HR/NHEJ) by sequencing repair products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). Strikingly, loss of dUtx in larvae revealed a 39-52% relative reduction in the proportion of HR repair products at two of the three heterochromatic DSB sites, while euchromatic DSB repair products remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4F</xref>). This reduction in HR repair was accompanied by an increase in NHEJ repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4C</xref>). These changes in DSB repair pathway choice are not due to indirect cell-cycle effects, since dUtx depletion did not significantly affect cell cycle progression in the Fly-FUCCI system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Although dUtx depletion did not affect relative HR levels at the <italic>fHet3</italic> integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4F</xref>), we do find that loss of dUtx results in a reduction in the total number of identified repair products at the <italic>fHet3</italic> integration, as well as at the <italic>fHet2</italic> integration site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4F</xref>).

Indeed, brain tissues with high gene expression levels (low H3K27me3) nearby <italic>fHet3</italic> do not show this reduction in repair efficiency upon dUtx depletion.

This suggests that dUtx plays an important role in DSB repair at this integration site and we may not have been able to identify dUtx-mediated loss of H3K27me3 levels at this site due to compensatory histone methylation activities or relatively low sensitivity of our ChIP assay. Altogether, our results reveal that early HR steps in facultative heterochromatin can be performed in the absence of dUtx, and that dUtx is specifically required for DSB movement and completion of repair.</p><p id="P18">To assess the physiological role of dUtx in DSB repair in facultative heterochromatin, we wished to determine whether development of flies mutant for dUtx depends on the presence of intact DNA damage signaling. To do so, we crossed heterozygous dUtx mutant flies with flies that contain a truncation mutation in Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR, mei41). ATR is one of the earliest kinases that rapidly respond to DSB events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Combining dUtx mutant flies with an ATR mutation reduces relative viability by 16%, indeed suggesting that dUtx mutant flies depend on correct DNA damage repair signaling for their development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4H</xref>). This result reveals the physiological role of dUtx and suggests that in the absence of proper facultative heterochromatic DSB repair, flies depend on active DNA damage checkpoint signaling to maintain viability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Chromatin forms dynamic domains in the nucleus, each characterized by specific molecular properties, which can directly influence the DSB response. However, how transcriptionally inactive facultative heterochromatin (i.e. polycomb chromatin) influences DSB repair remains poorly understood. To address this question and understand how eukaryotic cells maintain the integrity of silenced developmental genes, we here integrated inducible single DSB systems in euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin in <italic>Drosophila Melanogaster</italic>. This allowed us to comprehensively study DSB repair in facultative heterochromatin in animal tissue for the first time. We find that DSBs in facultative heterochromatin rapidly move outside polycomb bodies within minutes after their appearance. This movement depends on the H3K27me3 demethylase dUtx. In line with this, we find evidence for dUtx-mediated loss of the silencing mark H3K27me3 near DSBs in facultative heterochromatin. Our data further reveal that early steps of HR (i.e. end resection) can occur efficiently within polycomb bodies and are independent of dUtx, whereas dUtx is required to promote subsequent DSB movement and the completion of HR. Together, we propose a model in which resected DSBs in polycomb bodies are subjected to dUtx-mediated loss of the silencing mark H3K27me3, which in turn promotes DSB movement and timely repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Specific movements of DSBs have been identified to occur in a variety of chromatin compartments including centromeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and pericentromeric constitutive heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Movement of these DSBs has been suggested to promote binding of HR proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, as well as prevent aberrant recombination between repetitive sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we find for the first time that DSBs move outside polycomb bodies <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>). In contrast to centromeres, nucleoli and constitutive heterochromatin, facultative heterochromatin mainly contains unique sequences and is deprived of repetitive sequences. We therefore propose that DSB movement in facultative heterochromatin did not evolve to prevent aberrant recombination, but rather reflects the necessity to create a repair-competent state, facilitating access to the DSB repair machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Our data suggest that the movement of DSBs outside polycomb bodies is directly regulated by the dUtx-mediated removal of H3K27me3 at the break site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). H3K27me3 is required to recruit PcG proteins to enhance compaction and maintain a silenced state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, active removal of H3K27me3 at the DSB site by dUtx could directly lead to a local loss of PcG proteins. This can subsequently lead to changes in the molecular- and biophysical-properties of the DSB locus, creating an environment distinct from the surrounding polycomb body and the active expulsion or passive separation of the DSB from the polycomb body. In line with this hypothesis, we find that in the absence of dUtx, and the subsequent retention of H3K27me3, DSBs remain longer within the polycomb body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). These results reveal analogies with our previous findings at DSBs in constitutive heterochromatin, where we found that loss of the silencing mark H3K9me3 at DSBs by the histone demethylase dKDM4A ensures DSB movement outside the constitutive heterochromatin domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Since we did not observe a complete inhibition of facultative heterochromatic DSB movement upon dUtx depletion, additional processes are likely involved, such as DSB end processing or the recruitment of specific chromatin- or repair-proteins. End resection as well as chromatin proteins, including the cohesin- and SMC5/6-complexes, drive DSB movement in other chromatin domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting that additional components could be driving movements in polycomb bodies.</p><p id="P23">Our findings indicate that dUtx-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 at facultative heterochromatic DSBs is important for repair pathway choice, since dUtx loss shifts the choice towards NHEJ, resulting in decreased HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). Considering that dUtx depletion only affects DSB repair pathway choice in facultative heterochromatin, not euchromatin, these repair pathway changes are unlikely to be driven by indirect general defects in cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4</xref>) or transcriptional regulation of repair genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the HR/NHEJ repair pathway choice at facultative heterochromatin could be directly regulated by dUtx through two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: (1) defects in DSB movement, and (2) direct impact on binding of HR- or NHEJ-proteins at DSB sites.</p><p id="P24">In the first model, dUtx is promoting HR by moving the DSB to a more HR-prone chromatin state depleted of silencing marks. The movement might therefore specifically facilitate the access to ‘late’ HR repair proteins (e.g. Rad51 loading or helicases to resolve D-loops), usually excluded from the compact polycomb state. Moreover, moving an HR-proficient DSB away from the compact facultative heterochromatin might provide the required chromatin mobility necessary to perform homology search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observe that loss of dUtx has no impact on the initial stages of HR, such as end resection and ATRIP loading, in polycomb bodies. However, dUtx loss does impede DSB movement, and subsequent later HR steps as evidenced by the decreased number of HR repair products identified at facultative heterochromatic DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In our second model, we propose that the decreased frequency of HR repair in the absence of dUtx is caused by changes in binding of repair proteins to histone modifications at the break site. It is possible that H3K27me3 is able to directly bind specific NHEJ proteins within the polycomb body. Alternatively, H3K7me1 or unmethylated H3K27 residues, as a result of dUtx-mediated H3K27me3 demethylation, could directly recruit proteins important for HR. In line with this hypothesis, previous work identified that the HR-promoting TONSL-MMS2L complex has a higher affinity for unmodified histones, generated following DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Despite differences in dUtx-dependency for repair pathway choice, we find the frequencies of HR and NHEJ repair pathway usage in facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin to be similar in wild type <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings in which DSBs in H3K27me3-enriched imprinted loci in mice did not differ in repair pathway usage when compared to the corresponding active allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, both HR and NHEJ components are recruited to laser-damaged inactive X chromosomes in female human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, a recent study that used a sequencing-based reporter system in cancer cells to invesUgate the impact of chromatin on CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs did reveal differences in repair pathway usage in H3K27me3-enriched regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The authors found a relative decrease in NHEJ and concurrently an increase in usage of Microhomology-Mediated End-Joining (MMEJ) within H3K27me3-enriched regions. MMEJ is an error-prone mechanism that relies on short-range end resection and uses homologous sequences to align the broken ends. In contrast to our results, these findings suggest that end resection-based repair pathways are preferred at facultative heterochromatic DSBs. These different outcomes could indicate differences in repair pathway usage between species or could be due to differences in the approach used to induce DSB induction (CRISPR-Cas9 versus I-SceI). Moreover, heterochromatin properties <italic>in vivo</italic> may vary from that observed in cultured tumor cells, potentially leading to disparate outcomes.</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, our work demonstrates that DSBs in facultative heterochromatin require specific local chromatin changes and DSB movements for their faithful repair in animal tissue. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding how different chromatin components influence DSB repair pathway choice and maintain genome stability across diverse chromatin domains. Facultative heterochromatin regions are often associated with high mutational loads in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, indicating that these domains are particularly vulnerable to aberrant DNA damage repair. Moreover, the human homolog of dUtx, UTX, is often mutated in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. In the long-term, research into DNA damage repair in heterochromatin will give insights into how misregulation of chromatin proteins, such as UTX, could result in increased genome instability and specific mutational signatures in cancer, ultimately contributing to disease development.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Constructs</title><p id="P28">The DR-<italic>white</italic> construct was created previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. ph-p was N-terminally tagged with mCherry and cloned in a pCasper5 vector for random p-element transformation in flies.
