We used long-read cDNA sequencing to profile transcript diversity in the entorhinal cortex of wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) mice harboring a mutant form of human tau. Whole transcriptome profiling showed that previously reported gene-level expression differences between WT and TG mice reflect changes in the abundance of specific transcripts. Ultradeep targeted long-read cDNA sequencing of genes implicated in AD revealed hundreds of novel isoforms and identified specific transcripts associated with the development of tau pathology. Our results highlight the importance of differential transcript usage, even in the absence of gene-level expression alterations, as a mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the development of neuropathology.

These symptoms result from brain atrophy, synaptic loss and progressive neuropathology involving the extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) proteins in amyloid plaques and the intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into neurofibrillary tangles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Despite recent success in identifying genetic risk factors for AD, the mechanisms driving disease progression remain unclear.</p><p id="P3">Alternative splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that generates multiple RNA isoforms from a single transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor. By dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity from the coding genome, AS represents an important regulator of gene expression. Transcriptional dysregulation, and in particular aberrant splicing, has been shown to play a key role in the development and pathogenesis of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> with isoform expression differences identified in post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and mouse models with AD pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Previous studies investigating AS have been limited by the use of short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches, which cannot span full-length transcripts and unequivocally detect or quantify specific isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We recently demonstrated the power of long-read sequencing for the characterization of transcript diversity and quantification of alternatively-spliced isoforms in the mouse cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we utilize two complementary long-read sequencing approaches – Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) nanopore cDNA sequencing – to examine isoform diversity and AS in a well-characterized transgenic model of tau pathology (rTg4510)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These mice over-express a human mutant (P301L) form of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and are characterized by widespread transcriptional dysregulation paralleling the accumulation of tau pathology in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The spread of tau pathology in rTg4510 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> closely recapitulates the Braak stages in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, with appearance of pre-tangles from as early as 3 months followed by synaptic and neuronal loss by 9 months. First, we performed whole transcriptome long-read sequencing of the entorhinal cortex (EC) – a brain region defined by early neuropathology in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> – profiling tissue from both wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) mice at two time-points (2 and 8 months) that are characterized by early and late stages of tauopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Second, we performed ultra-deep targeted long-read sequencing of transcripts expressed from 20 genes previously implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) using tissue from WT and TG mice at four time-points (2, 4, 6 and 8 months). Finally, we developed a novel informatics tool, <italic>FICLE</italic> (<underline>F</underline>ull Isoform <underline>C</underline>haracterisation from <underline>L</underline>ong-read sequencing <underline>E</underline>xperiments), that facilitates the accurate assessment of AS events and the visualization of isoforms based on splicing patterns, leveraging the high sequencing coverage of targeted long-read transcriptome datasets. Our transcript annotations and data analysis pipeline are available as a resource to the research community (see <bold>Data Availability</bold>). Our results confirm the importance of AS in the mouse cortex and provide evidence of differential transcript usage, even in the absence of gene-level expression alterations, associated with the development of tau pathology in TG mice.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Whole transcriptome long-read sequencing identifies specific transcripts of Gfap associated with the progression of tau pathology</title><p id="P5">We previously used short-read RNA-Seq to identify dramatic changes in EC gene expression associated with the development of tau pathology in TG mice carrying a human mutant form of the MAPT gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In the current study, we used long-read cDNA sequencing to extend these analyses and profile AS and differential transcript expression in the same mice. Our first analyses used PacBio Iso-Seq to generate whole transcriptome long-read sequencing data from a subset of WT and TG mice (total n = 12, 3 WT and 3 TG at ages 2 and 8 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) with raw reads processed using a customized Iso-Seq bioinformatics pipeline (see <bold>Methods</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Across samples, we detected an average of 10,950 (SD = 615) genes and 38,930 (SD = 2,016) transcripts with a mean length of 2.7kb (SD = 1.6kb) and 9.88 exons (SD = 7.56). There were no differences in gene or transcript characteristics between genotype (WT vs TG mice) or age groups (2 vs 8 months) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). As expected, human-specific <italic>MAPT</italic> transcripts were only detected in full-length reads from TG mice, confirming the stable activation of the human <italic>MAPT</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Raw data and annotated transcripts from both WT and TG mice are available as a downloadable resource (see <bold>Data Availability</bold>).</p><p id="P6">Across all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) previously associated with the progression of tau pathology in TG mice, we found a strong overall correlation of effect sizes (corr = 0.60, P = 5.17 × 10<sup>−224</sup>) between short-read RNA-Seq and long-read Iso-Seq reads, with a significant enrichment of consistent direction of effects (binomial test: P = 1.45 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Our short-read RNA-Seq analysis had previously highlighted <italic>Gfap</italic>, encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as the top-ranked DEG associated with the progression of tau pathology in TG mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. <italic>Gfap</italic> is highly expressed in astrocytes and up-regulated in reactive astrocytes in response to brain pathology and neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Gene-level analysis of our Iso-Seq reads confirmed this association using both normalized full-length Iso-Seq read counts as a proxy for transcript abundance (log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log2FC) = 3.37, FDR = 1.99 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) and through a ‘hybrid’ approach involving the alignment of short-read RNA-Seq reads from the full set of samples (n = 30 WT, 29 TG at ages 2, 4, 6 and 8 months) to the transcript annotations derived from our Iso-Seq data (log2FC = 2.76, FDR = 2.51 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We leveraged our full-length Iso-Seq reads to identify a specific differentially expressed transcript (DET) of <italic>Gfap</italic> (LR.Gfap.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) – the most abundantly expressed <italic>Gfap</italic> isoform (Gfap-201, ENSMUST00000067444.9) in the mouse EC – that was the primary driver of overall differential <italic>Gfap</italic> expression in TG mice (log2FC = 3.57, FDR = 1.16 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The upregulation of LR.Gfap.16 was confirmed using the hybrid method incorporating normalized RNA-Seq read counts (log2FC = 1.06, P = 2.1 × 10<sup>−2</sup>), although this approach also identified upregulation of several novel <italic>Gfap</italic>-associated isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Given the near perfect-homology of these novel isoforms to LR.Gfap.16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), however, we suspect these differences might reflect the limited sensitivity of short RNA-Seq reads for differentiating similar isoforms, highlighting a key advantage of directly using long-read sequencing reads to quantify transcript expression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ultradeep targeted long-read cDNA sequencing identifies hundreds of rare novel isoforms</title><p id="P7">The constraints on sample numbers (and sequencing depth) possible using the whole transcriptome Iso-Seq approach meant we had relatively limited sensitivity to detect and quantify rare transcripts and identify novel between-group differences using the direct quantification of full-length reads. To enable a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing and differential transcript usage associated with tau pathology, we therefore performed ultra-deep long-read cDNA sequencing on a targeted panel of 20 genes previously implicated in AD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We targeted genes affected by autosomal dominant mutations associated with neurodegenerative disorders (<italic>App</italic>, <italic>Mapt</italic>, <italic>Snca</italic>, <italic>Fus</italic>, <italic>Tardbp</italic>), genes identified from both AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<italic>Abca1, Abca7, Apoe, Bin1, Cd33, Clu, Picalm, Ptk2b, Sorl1, and Trem2</italic>) and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) (<italic>Ank1, Rhbdf2)</italic>, in addition to several genes implicated in other related neurodegenerative phenotypes (<italic>Fyn, Trpa1, Vgf</italic>). Targeted enrichment was undertaken using custom-designed probes for every known exon across each gene (see <bold>Methods</bold>), followed by sequencing using both ONT nanopore and PacBio Iso-Seq on EC samples from WT and TG mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Our first aim was to characterize the transcriptional landscape for each of the targeted genes in the mouse EC. Raw reads from ONT and Iso-Seq experiments were merged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, see <bold>Methods</bold>) and following stringent quality control, our combined dataset comprised of 5.06 million reads annotated to the 20 genes, with no significant difference in read depth between WT and TG mice (mean number of reads per sample: ONT: WT = 248,117 reads, TG = 277,560 reads, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test: W = 50, P = 0.399; Iso-Seq: WT = 12,235 reads, TG = 12,424 reads, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test: W = 81, P = 0.624). As expected, targeted sequencing yielded significantly more unique transcripts of the targeted genes than were detected using whole transcriptome sequencing across the 12 samples processed using both approaches (unique transcripts in targeted = 815, unique transcripts in whole transcriptome = 15, common transcripts in both datasets = 440; fold-change = 2.76, Fisher’s Exact test: P = 4.07 × 10<sup>134</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We again confirmed expression of human-specific <italic>MAPT</italic> transcripts only from TG mice in the targeted datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The depth of sequencing achieved using our enrichment approach enabled us to detect 81,221 unique transcripts annotated to the 20 target genes, of which the vast majority were both novel (n = 77,837 (95.8%)) but very rare (74,411 (91.6%) of detected transcripts were characterized by &lt; 10 full-length reads across all samples) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We detected an average of ~2,200 rare transcripts for each target gene (range = 38 - 13,415) that individually comprised &lt; 1% of sequencing reads, but collectively constituted a relatively large proportion of total reads. Of note, ~50% of the on-target reads were attributed to five transcripts representing known isoforms of <italic>Apoe, Clu</italic> and <italic>Snca</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The majority of novel transcripts were identified in the ultradeep ONT dataset (n = 78,982 transcripts, 97.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Virtually all transcripts identified in the PacBio Iso-Seq dataset (n = 2,060 isoforms, 92%) were also detected by ONT sequencing, whereas a much smaller proportion of transcripts identified in the ONT dataset (n = 2,060 isoforms, 2.54%) were also detected in the PacBio Iso-Seq dataset, reflecting the much higher number of reads obtained from ONT sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite the large number of novel transcripts identified, most target genes were characterized by a relatively small number of ‘major’ isoforms (mean = 9.4 isoforms, SD = 10.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). A transcript was defined as ‘major’ if its proportion relative to the dominant (most abundant) isoform was &gt; 0.5 (see <bold>Methods</bold>). This corroborates data from existing datasets such as VastDB – the largest resource of AS events in vertebrates – which shows that the majority of genes were characterized by the simultaneous expression of a relatively small number of major isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>FICLE - a novel tool for isoform characterization from long-read sequencing data</title><p id="P10">Existing bioinformatic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> for characterizing AS events using short-read RNA-Seq data fail to capture the connectivity and complexity of transcripts detected from ultra-deep long-read sequencing. Consequently, to comprehensively annotate the full repertoire of transcripts in our data, we developed a novel analysis tool – <italic>FICLE</italic> (see <bold>Methods</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) - which we have made available as a resource to the community (see <bold>Code Availability</bold>). <italic>FICLE</italic> directly compares the splice junctions between long-read-derived and reference transcripts, enabling a gene-level overview of all detected isoforms and splicing patterns. It accurately characterizes multiple AS events for each transcript, identifies novel exons, and enables the visualization of isoforms classified by AS events. <italic>FICLE</italic> can be implemented to provide detailed isoform characterization and aid biological interpretations, with the generation of multiple output summary tables and graphs at the exon and transcript level.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Widespread isoform diversity and alternative splicing events across target genes</title><p id="P11">After stringent filtering of rare transcripts by removing transcripts with &lt; 10 full-length reads across all samples, our final dataset included 7,162 isoforms comprising 1,000 (14%) known isoforms and 6,162 (86%) novel isoforms. The median number of isoforms across each of the 20 genes was 151, although there was considerable heterogeneity in isoform number between genes. <italic>Apoe</italic> was the most isomorphic gene (1,408 isoforms detected of which 13 were known and 1,395 were novel) whilst <italic>Trpa1</italic> was the least isomorphic gene (4 isoforms detected, all previously characterized) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We used <italic>FICLE</italic> to classify <italic>Apoe</italic> isoforms by exonic structure, observing a complex pattern of AS events involving the last exon, which encodes the apolipoprotein domain that binds to lipids, and the 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Supported by short-read RNA-Seq data from an overlapping set of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), the variation in the last exon included usage of alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites and intra-exonic internal skipping, a phenomenon seen in one of the known isoforms (Apoe-202, ENSMUST00000167646.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Of note, despite being highly isomorphic, <italic>Apoe</italic> is the shortest gene in our targeted gene panel (gene length = 3.079 kb) with the fewest number of exons (n = 5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P12">For each of the 20 genes, <italic>FICLE</italic> enabled us to identify widespread AS events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). In line with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, we observed extensive use of alternative 5’ (A5’) and 3’ splice site (A3’) (n = 10,396 events observed in 6,082 (84.9%) isoforms) and exon skipping (ES) (n = 24,315 events observed in 6,031 (84.2%) isoforms) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Although the majority of isoforms were characterized by the skipping of several exons, some genes expressed transcripts that were characterized by highly elevated levels of ES. For example, over 10% of isoforms expressed from <italic>App</italic> (n = 115 isoforms, 10.2%) and <italic>Bin1</italic> (n = 72 isoforms, 11.5%) were characterized by the skipping of &gt; 10 exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, intron retention (IR) events were less frequent (n = 135 events observed in 134 isoforms, 1.87%) and only detected in isoforms expressed from a subset of the target genes (<italic>Abca7, Apoe, Cd33, Clu, Fus, Ptk2b, Snca, Tardbp</italic> and <italic>Trem2</italic>), corroborating our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Only one isoform (a novel <italic>Cd33</italic> isoform) was characterized with more than one IR event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), although the majority of IR events (n = 126 events, 93.3%) spanned two or more exons with <italic>Tardbp</italic>-associated transcripts demonstrating extensive IR spanning up to 11 exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Differential transcript expression associated with the progression of tau pathology in TG mice</title><p id="P13">We focused on our ultradeep ONT sequencing data for the initial identification of specific transcripts associated with the progression of tau pathology in TG mice (see <bold>Methods</bold>), identifying 12 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) expressed from six of the 20 target genes (<italic>Apoe, App, Cd33, Clu, Fyn</italic>, and <italic>Trem2</italic>) at a FDR &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Notably, these transcripts were all up-regulated in TG mice with the progression of tau pathology and five (annotated to <italic>Clu, Fyn</italic>, and <italic>Apoe</italic>) represented novel transcripts not present in existing transcript annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). All 12 of the differentially expressed transcripts were also detected in our PacBio Iso-Seq replication dataset and differentially expressed with the same direction of effect and a strong overall concordance in effect sizes between the two datasets (Log2FC pathology: Spearman’s correlation = 0.643, P = 0.03). Three DETs were confirmed at a Bonferroni-corrected P-value (P &lt; 4.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>) – a known <italic>Trem2</italic> isoform (LR.Trem2.54), a novel <italic>Clu</italic> (LR.Clu.39341) and novel <italic>App</italic> (LR.App.7564) isoform – and eight additional DETs reached nominal significance (P &lt; 0.05) despite the considerably lower depth of the PacBio sequencing and reduced power for differential expression analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We identified an additional 48 DETs expressed from 10 genes (<italic>Abca7, App, Bin1, Cd33, Mapt, Picalm, Ptk2b, Rhbdf2, Snca, Trem2</italic>) associated with genotype (i.e characterized by a significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) difference in expression between WT and TG mice) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). The majority of these DETs (n = 28) were up-regulated in TG mice and a large proportion (n = 14) were annotated to <italic>Trem2</italic> (see below). Of note, the top-ranked up-regulated transcripts in TG mice were mapped to <italic>Mapt (</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>); interestingly, these did not correspond to transcripts derived from the human transgene suggesting the transgene induces concomitant effects on endogenous <italic>Mapt</italic> transcript expression.

First, because the PacBio Iso-Seq protocol does not include 5’-cap selection we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the shorter isoforms identified in our study result from 5’ degradation. By using two long-read sequencing platforms (ONT and PacBio) to characterize isoforms in the mouse cortex, in addition to short-read RNA-seq, we were able to validate a large proportion of our isoform annotations and reduce the number of these artifacts. Of note, many of the novel transcripts identified in this study were rare and excluded from downstream association analyses. Second, our analyses were performed on ‘bulk’ entorhinal cortex tissue, comprising a heterogeneous mix of neurons, oligodendrocytes and other glial cell-types. Despite compelling evidence from recent studies reporting cell-specific transcriptional signatures in disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we were unable to explore these differences in this study. Of note, novel approaches for using long-read sequencing approaches in single cells will enable a more granular approach to exploring transcript diversity in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, while isoform expression was normalized for potential technical cofounders (e.g. library sequencing depth), it was not possible to account for differences in cellular composition between WT and TG mice. Given neuronal loss and astrogliosis are prominent hallmarks of AD pathogenesis, we were unable to discern whether transcript-level variations are a direct consequence of AD-associated transcriptional regulation or reflect changes in cell composition associated with pathology. Finally, we only profiled entorhinal cortex tissue given that this is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected by AD pathology However, tissue-specific differences in splicing and isoform usage of AD-risk genes have been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of long-read sequencing for transcript-level analyses, facilitating the detection of AS events associated with the development of AD pathology.

Other regulatory mechanisms such as alternative transcription initiation (defined by an alternative transcription start site) with the presence of an alternative promoter (AP) and termination (defined by an alternative transcription termination site) with the presence of an alternative terminator (AT), and the presence of novel exons not present in existing transcript annotations, were also evaluated. Open reading frames were predicted using the Coding-Potential Assessment Tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (CPAT) (v3.0.2) with default parameters, and transcripts with coding potential score &gt; 0.44 (recommended threshold for mouse) were predicted as protein-coding. Isoforms were visualized using either the UCSC genome browser or <italic>ggtranscrip</italic>t (v0.99.9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Differential expression and splicing analyses</title><p id="P33">Differential expression analysis was performed using <italic>DESeq2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (v1.26.0) with Iso-Seq and ONT full-length read counts as proxies of gene and transcript expression. Notably, gene expression was aggregated as the summation of full-length read counts from all isoforms associated with target genes, prior to filtering for rare (lowly-expressed) transcripts (minimum 10 reads across any 5 samples). Briefly, DESeq2 normalizes read counts using the median of ratios method, estimates dispersion, and tests for differential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models. Datasets were filtered for lowly expressed isoforms (minimum of 10 reads across all samples). Significant genotype effects between WT and TG mice were identified using the Wald test: ~ genotype. Significant interaction effects to detect progressive changes across age between WT and TG mice (i.e. pathology) were identified using the Wald test to compare the nested regression model: ~ genotype + age + genotype * age. Significance was defined by FDR &lt; 0.05, after adjusting <italic>P values</italic> for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (also known as Benjamini and Hochberg correction).</p><p id="P34">Differential transcript usage analysis was performed using <italic>EdgeR spliceVariant</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (v3.28.1) within <italic>tappAS</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (v1.0.7). Lowly-expressed isoforms were filtered using <italic>minorFoldfilterTappas</italic>, whereby an isoform was only retained if its relative proportion to the major isoform was above a specified fold change (FC) threshold (default FC = 0.5). Adopting <italic>tappAS</italic> DIU analysis and metrics, we were able to quantify the magnitude of redistribution of gene expression across its isoforms between conditions (total change) and detect major isoform switching events (podium change). To illustrate DIU at an isoform and sample level (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), the isoform usage was determined by dividing the normalized read count for each associated isoform by the total normalized read counts of all the associated isoforms. To illustrate DIU at an isoform level only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), the isoform usage was determined by dividing the mean normalized read count for each associated isoform across all the samples by the total normalized read counts of all the associated isoforms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1-11</label><media xlink:href="EMS188419-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1_11.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d85aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 1-4</label><media xlink:href="EMS188419-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1_4.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d85aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS188419-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d85aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS188419-supplement-Supplementary_Table_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d85aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS188419-supplement-Supplementary_Table_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d85aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>S.K.L. was supported by a UK Medical Research Council (MRC) CASE PhD studentship.
