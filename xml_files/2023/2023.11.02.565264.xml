While many cancer cell lines are known to form pseudo-vascular networks, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of these formations. Here, we present a framework for monitoring and characterising the dynamic formation and dissolution of pseudo-vascular networks <italic>in vitro</italic>. The framework combines time-resolved optical microscopy with open-source image analysis for network feature extraction and statistical modelling. The framework is demonstrated by comparing diverse cancer cell lines associated with vasculogenic mimicry, then in detecting response to drug compounds proposed to affect formation of vasculogenic mimics. Dynamic datasets collected were analysed morphometrically and a descriptive statistical analysis model was developed in order to measure stability and dissimilarity characteristics of the pseudo-vascular networks formed. Melanoma cells formed the most stable pseudo-vascular networks and were selected to evaluate the response of their pseudo-vascular networks to treatment with axitinib, brucine and tivantinib. Our framework is shown to enable quantitative analysis of both the capacity for network formation, linked vasculogenic mimicry, as well as dynamic responses to treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vasculogenic mimicry</kwd><kwd>tube formation assay</kwd><kwd>pseudo-vascular networks</kwd><kwd>morphometric analysis</kwd><kwd>descriptive statistical model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, has long been recognised as an important contributor to solid tumour progression, yet therapeutic targeting has often shown limited efficacy and short-term benefit for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Emerging from this surprising outcome is the knowledge that cancer vascularisation proceeds through mechanisms other than angiogenesis, which are genotypically and phenotypically distinct. Among them, yet outside of the endothelial context, vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is characteristic of aggressive cancers, first observed over two decades ago in human melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], with an epidemiologic incidence ranging from 5.25% in melanoma to 65.9% in glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can lead to VM-related epigenetic transition of cancer cells in treated tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and VM-rich tumours are associated with therapeutic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Unlike angiogenic mechanisms, where new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing vessels to compensate oxygen and nutrient deficiency in the growing tumour mass, VM vessels have the unique characteristic that they arise solely from cancer cells that trans-differentiate into an endothelial-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Specifically targeting VM-rich tumours may therefore benefit from a dual anti-vascular and chemotherapeutic approach.</p><p id="P4">The core characteristic typically used to define VM <italic>ex vivo</italic> is the presence of vessels in Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stained sections that lack counter-staining for endothelial markers (e.g. CD31/CD34) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], and ideally contain red blood cells to demonstrate functionality. Cancer cell lines where VM has been identified <italic>ex vivo</italic> have been shown to organise into interconnected polygonal cellular networks <italic>in vitro</italic> akin to those formed by endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Hence the formation of pseudo-vascular networks has further been defined as a core characteristic of VM competence. A range of other VM markers have also been identified, however, these do not exclusively indicate VM; for example, poorer overall tumour oxygenation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] or the expression of VE-cadherin (or CD144) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), among other extracellular matrix factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Although typical core characteristics of VM <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> are becoming more generally accepted, little is known about VM as a pathophysiological vascularisation mechanism or its evolution over time. Most studies are undertaken at a single time point, using protocols that often vary between studies making comparisons between cancer types or cell lines challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Imaging data from <italic>ex vivo</italic> sections or <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures are rarely subjected to quantitative object extraction, meaning readers are left to infer network characteristics from optical micrographs. Furthermore, the pseudo-vascular networks formed are often compared visually to those formed by non-cancerous endothelial cell lines, which is inappropriate as mechanistically these exhibit angiogenic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The high degree of variation between studies, along with inconsistency among different reports, has led to controversy in the field of VM, particularly for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In addition, different morphologies have been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] that are not well distinguished <italic>in vivo</italic>, heightening the debate. Taken together, improved implementation and quantification of <italic>in vitro</italic> VM assays is now important to advance the field and increase reproducibility of research.</p><p id="P6">To more thoroughly describe the <italic>in vitro</italic> VM phenotype, we applied an experimental framework based on an endothelial tube assay, where cultures are monitored dynamically as they form and dissolve pseudo-vascular networks. Combining optical microscopy data with open-source Fiji software, we analysed morphometrically the spatiotemporal dynamics of the networks formed by a range of different cell lines representing brain, breast, head and neck, and skin cancer types, that have been previously reported to demonstrate VM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. A descriptive statistical model was implemented to compare the morphology and stability of the pseudo-vascular networks before applying a range of concentrations of therapeutics that have been reported to have VM-related mechanisms of action. We identify relevant features of the networks that can be used to compare different cell lines and drug responses, demonstrating the potential of our methodology to evaluate VM-competence <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Cultures</title><p id="P7">U87MG (HTB-14™, ATCC, UK) cells were used to represent human high-grade brain cancer.

A layer of basement membrane extract (BME, Cultrex, UK), of Type R1 (reduced growth factor, RGF BME) and protein content greater than 9, was first coated in a 24-well plate and allowed to solidify for 1hr. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in endothelial cell growth basal medium-2 (EBM-2, Lonza, Switzerland).

Incucyte software (v.2022A, Sartorius, Germany) was used to export all phase contrast images and videos. A manual quality check was applied on the acquired images to disregard medium condensation and/ or out of focus images. For each well, measurements in the four quadrants were defined as technical replicates. For each of the cell lines under study, a time window was defined for analysis based on the overall pseudo-vascular network evolution, including prior timepoints examined in the literature for the same cell line.</p><p id="P16">All technical replicates were segmented using the open-source Fiji image analysis software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. To avoid artifacts from the meniscus of the BME, each of the technical replicate images was cropped for a central area of 1000x1000 pixels. Each pixel was set at 2.82 μm x 2.82μm based on the Incucyte acquisition parameters. Contrast enhancement of ‘Enhance Contrast’ function (0.35 saturated) was applied to clearly segment the tube formations. Images were then transformed to RGB 8-bit format and inputted into the Fiji plugin Angiogenesis Analyzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The pseudo-vascular network images were skeletonized by the plugin to be transformed into mesh networks, which allowed their parameterisation using a total of 20 vectorial objects (network features, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) defined by the plugin.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P17">For the growth curves of each cell line, linear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 (GraphPad, USA) using the quantification of phase contrast images from the Incucyte software (v.2022A, Sartorius, Germany) accounting for cell confluence. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to measure the level of dependence between physiological variables of the different cell lines, such as doubling time to tube formation time window, and the time window of pseudo-vascular network formation. To analyse the tubular network formations, several analyses were performed.</p><p id="P18">First, for each cell line, the average of the four technical replicates within the well was calculated for each of the 20 vectorial objects identified by the Angiogenesis Analyzer software. To examine the dynamics of the tubular networks in each well (<italic>i</italic>), the relationship between the object average (<italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>) and time (<italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic>) was then modelled by the following third-degree polynomial model: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where the <italic>β</italic> are fit parameters and <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> denotes the error term.

Pseudo-vascular tubular network formation has generally been considered at only a single timepoint in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Contrary to the pseudo-vascular networks arising from endothelial cells that are stable, characterised by a meshed 3D architecture with stable features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], the cancer cells interrogated here are highly dynamic.</p><p id="P24">Our findings indicate that pseudo-vascular network formation is transient, forming prior to and disappearing after the singular timepoint typically reported, however, the time window during which such a network can be observed is different for each cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, the more proliferative cell lines show a shorter time window for network formation, but also a more transient network formation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The pseudo-vascular networks formed by the slower growing U87MG and MDA-MB-231 cell lines qualitatively demonstrate a more consistent morphology across the time course. The cell line doubling time and the time window of pseudo-vascular network formation show a strong dependence level (Spearman’s rho = 0.84).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Quantitative morphological analysis of the pseudo-vascular networks shows spatiotemporal diversity between different cancer cell lines</title><p id="P25">The BME scaffold provided in each well triggers the cells to undergo processes that are related to elongation, migration, adhesion, aggregation and division, forming pseudo-vascular networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] provided they have this intrinsic capacity. To gain a quantitative understanding of the structural variety observed in the evolution of the pseudo-vascular networks formed by the different cell lines, we applied the simple and precise Angiogenesis Analyzer tool designed to characterize meshed and/or branched structures of endothelial networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Before applying such quantitative analysis to these data, it is necessary to account for the effect of the meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). When seeded in BME-coated wells, the cells tend not to colonize the boundaries of the curved meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>); the phenomenon has previously been characterized as a result of the heterogeneous viscoelastic substrate properties at the edges of the well that prohibit the cell elongation, interrupting tube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]; lower cellularity is also observed at the periphery. We therefore segmented out regions from our images to exclude the meniscus prior to analysis. It is also necessary to consider potential artefacts that could bias the readout from some vectorial objects. For example, isolated structures could potentially be formed from cells that remained unattached to the pseudo-vascular network or even non-cellular components, such as macromolecules of the ECM, giving artefactual results from automated analysis. Two objects are sensitive to these isolated structures, “number of isolated segments” and “number of pieces” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and were found to display high variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) with output outliers. Given the observed variance in these data compared to other objects, they were excluded from further analysis.</p><p id="P27">We initially examined the full set of 20 vectorial objects output from Angiogenesis Analyzer as an average across the time course. While some cell lines show comparatively similar values for many objects over the time course (e.g. U87MG and MDA-MB-231, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a, b</xref>), others highly dynamic and distinct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c-g</xref>). We can start to learn about the overall structure and stability of the pseudo-vascular networks using these parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). For example, the higher the number of extremities within the analysed area, the more disconnected the cells are, resulting in fewer tubular structures. The number of extremities is very high at the start and end of the time course for all cell lines, which helps to define the estimated time window for the persistence of the network. The number of the branches is rather stable for the U87MG, MDA-MB-231, 4T1, 4T1-T and B16-F10 cell lines, but not for MOC1 and MOC2, indicating a more dynamic network for the latter two.</p><p id="P28">Interestingly, the average size of the meshes formed from all networks is similar independent of the timepoint; this can also be observed in the respective values of mesh index and mean mesh size, where only subtle differences can be observed between cell lines. Unlike the size of the meshes formed, the total mesh area, in line with the number of the meshes, confirms that MDA-MB-231, B16-F10, 4T1-T and U87MG have most cells organized into mesh components for most of the time that the networks develop, unlike the MOC1, MOC2 and 4T1 cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Vectorial objects enable a quantitative comparison of pseudo-vascular network dynamics across different cell lines</title><p id="P29">The capability of cell lines to engage in VM is typically assessed by their ability to form a pseudo-vascular network <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], however, the time windows and the range of outcome values for each vectorial object of the different cell lines studied vary widely. To examine to what extent the different morphological descriptors can discriminate the pseudo-vascular networks formed by the different cell lines, we defined dissimilarity scores for each vectorial object based on the discrepancy between the dynamic fits of all pairs of cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The objects related to the mean size of the meshes and mesh index showed the least dissimilarity (i.e. highest similarity) between cell line fits (low value score). Conversely, the number of the meshes and the total mesh area, as well as the various length objects, were more effective at discriminating the networks.</p><p id="P31">Correlations between the objects according to their dissimilarity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) measures association between objects according to their relationship with cell lines and indicates the presence of 3 to 4 groups of highly correlated objects. Interestingly, the clustering of vectorial objects does not differ between the dissimilarity and correlation analyses, indicating that vectorial objects that show high dissimilarity scores and are correlated can serve as good morphological discriminators for pseudo-vascular networks. Based on these principles, we can narrow down the vectorial objects that are considered, avoiding redundancy. Based on these findings, we selected a subset of vectorial objects in each dissimilarity score group, 3 high (total network length, total mesh area and number of meshes), 2 average (number of branches and number of extremities) and 1 low (mesh index) discriminators, to demonstrate pseudo-vascular network dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Our modelling approach enabled the descriptive comparison of vectorial objects of the pseudo-vascular networks formed by the different cell lines over time.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Pseudo-vascular networks exist over a range of time windows with varying levels of stability</title><p id="P32">In line with the qualitative estimation, the objects identified by quantitative morphological analysis are highly dynamic and diverse in their values across cell lines. The vectorial objects demonstrate nicely the structural variety of the pseudo-vascular networks formed by different cell lines. For example, for the 4T1-T cell line, total network length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) decreases over time, the number of the branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) are relatively stable while the number of meshes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), total mesh area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) also decrease over time; conversely the mesh index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) increases to a peak before decreasing.</p><p id="P33">One might consider the total network length to be a good indicator of network stability, as similar general trends can be found over time across all cell lines tested, with a broad decrease over time in all cell lines, whereas other parameters show more divergent behaviour. Cell lines like MOC1 or MOC2, however, form pseudo-vascular networks that become smaller over time, possibly due to aggregation of the cells, which gives a false impression of their stability using the network length parameter. To examine stability of the networks, we therefore defined a stability score as the sum of the spread scores of all objects given time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Across all cell lines examined, the B16-F10 melanoma cell line appears most stable. U87MG glioblastoma cells are similar but show a larger spread in some parameters, namely the number of isolated segments and total isolated branches length. While the qualitative examination of MDA-MB-231 appears relatively stable, quantitative analysis shows that their network is actually relatively unstable. The poor stability performance of the MDA-MB-231 pseudo-vascular networks primarily derives from the mesh index and mean mesh size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). Notably, although the aforementioned vectorial objects were not found to be good discriminators between cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), MDA-MB-231, along with the other unstable cell line MOC2, have remarkably large mean mesh size compared to the other cell lines, which may indicate a different underlying mechanism of network development.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Pseudo-vascular networks are differentially affected by the presence of drug treatment</title><p id="P35">We hypothesized that cell lines that exhibit a stable pseudo-vascular network phenotype would have stronger competence for VM. We next introduced perturbations to disrupt the networks. For the most stable of the cell lines studied, B16-F10, pseudo-vascular network evolution was examined under the presence of three FDA-approved agents previously reported to influence pseudo-vascular network formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]: multi-kinase inhibitor axitinib, the alkaloid brucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and the mesenchymal-epithelial transcription factor inhibitor tivantinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] were tested against the DMSO solvent control.</p><p id="P36">We noted in initial testing that 0.1% DMSO affects the pseudo-vascular network evolution of all cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), likely due to its effect on cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion as DMSO can trigger cell aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Pseudo-vascular network inhibition has been reported before in endothelial cells for DMSO concentrations above 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], however, the descriptive spatiotemporal analysis of this study shows that DMSO impacts cells even in lower concentrations and therefore, the tube assay protocol was optimized for 0.01% DMSO, that served as the control condition.</p><p id="P37">Pseudo-vascular network formation was impacted differentially by the presence of each of the drugs under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). The effect of each drug on the mesh structures was then examined across a range of concentrations, as previously determined by the 2D drug screening assay, for the same timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Both the mean values of the vectorial objects and the variance were affected as compared to the control condition by all drugs tested. Tivantinib inhibits the formation of the meshes, even in dose an order of magnitude less than the two other agents, confirming prior studies that show this compound could be of interest in the context of VM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">To demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of pseudo-vascular network formation and thus improve reproducibility of VM research, we report here a method of extracting pseudo-vascular network features <italic>in vitro</italic> that can be used to quantitatively compare findings from different studies. Representative cell lines from brain, breast, head and neck, and skin cancer types, that have been previously reported to express the VM phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], were studied to compare their intrinsic VM competence. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these pseudo-vascular networks to different therapeutic compounds was studied to compare their effect on network formation and stability.</p><p id="P39">It is well known that endothelial cells are conditionally able to form a structured physiologic-like network that remains stable over time <italic>in vitro</italic>, but to understand the spectrum of VM capabilities across cancer cell lines, our findings demonstrate that it is important to follow their network dynamics rather than making measurements at a single time point. Repurposing Angiogenesis Analyser, an open-source toolkit that is designed to describe endothelial morphologies, we extracted pseudo-vascular vectorial object descriptors to create a statistical framework to compare VM in cancer cell lines over time, normalized to account for proliferation differences. The comparative study performed led to a complete framework to: i) estimate the VM competence of different cell lines; ii) describe the <italic>in vitro</italic> morphology of the pseudo-vascular VM networks, irrespective of spatiotemporal differences; and iii) enable the identification of potential anti-VM chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p id="P40">Between the seven cell lines used for the purposes of this study, the pseudo-vascular networks formed were spatiotemporally distinct. For all cell types, objects related to the number of the meshes formed and the total mesh area, but not the mean mesh size, were able to discriminate the different pseudo-vascular networks over time. Meshes are a combination of the nodes and the connected branches in the pseudo-vascular networks, a formation that has been reported in both the tubular and the patterned matrix type VM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. B16-F10 and U87MG cell lines depict the lowest variance among all the network descriptors examined here, unlike the MDA-MB-231, which persist for a longer time window. Although B16-F10 and 4T1-T are highly proliferative cell lines, the stability of their VM pseudo-vascular networks is high, which suggests that VM competence is independent of the proliferative capacity of the cells. Additionally, our methodology was successful in showing subtle differences between 4T1 and 4T1-T derivative cell line related to their VM competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P41">Having established relevant vectorial objects and measures to discriminate between cell lines, the most stable line (B16-F10) was then subjected to a screening of three anti-vascular agents that are mechanistically-related to VM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Although none of the drugs tested appeared to be cytostatic or cytotoxic for the B16-F10 cell line, as no change in the confluence was observed between treatment and control conditions, all of them were able to lead to irreversible pseudo-vascular network disruption in very low concentration. Furthermore, vectorial objects related to the mesh structures were sufficient to estimate the impact of the inhibition of the drugs to the pseudo-vascular network architecture. Our method could be applied in future to screen chemotherapeutic regimens exhibiting a dual anti-vascular and cytotoxic effect in VM-competent cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P42">We have demonstrated potential for dynamic imaging to inform on the diversity of VM-competence between cancer cells that form pseudo-vascular networks <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, there remain several limitations to our approach that should be addressed in future. First, cancer cells form tubes in the xy plane of the BME-coated wells used here and fail to form 3D structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. VM tubular structures are often formed by one layer of cancer cells that may or may not be a functional tubule and this process is cell line-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The application of more advanced cell culture protocols with confocal microscopy may enable 3D tubular structures to be studied using a similar approach. In addition, the BME-coated wells lead to a meniscus effect, which required some data pre-processing and excluded some of the potential vectorial objects from being applied due to imaging artefacts. Improved preparation to minimise the meniscus could be developed.</p><p id="P43">A second limitation is that we examined the intrinsic capacity of the cancer cells to form tubular structures in the absence of any supportive cells of the tumour stroma or the host. Thus, the homology to real vascular networks is low and cannot substitute the complexity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour vasculature, focusing instead on the elementary VM structures. Nonetheless, the same experimental framework, adjusted for optimal cell seeding density and monitoring time, could also be used in co-culture settings and/or pre-conditioned medium in order to further study the molecular basis of the VM biological phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P44">A final limitation concerns the Angiogenesis Analyser Fiji plugin. The plugin has been used for the analysis of networks other than those formed by HUVEC endothelial cells, such as the mouse retina vascular network captured in fluorescent microscopy images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], depicting its wide applicability in other forms of networks and imaging data. However, the skeletonization process that is applied by the Angiogenesis Analyzer is not able to characterize wider tubular formations as those expected in a patterned VM type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], which may require further algorithm developments to enable the full range of VM phenotypes to be characterized.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P45">In this study, we presented a framework for the <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of VM that includes a generic tube formation assay that allows the longitudinal monitoring of the pseudo-vascular VM networks and the application of an open-source software plugin for the quantitative morphometric description of the networks. We apply this workflow to a relative comparison of reported VM-competent cell lines and evaluate the effect of three clinically-applicable anti-vascular drugs on network formation. Our findings indicate that the meshed structures of the pseudo-vascular networks can serve as a potential VM <italic>in vitro</italic> marker irrespective of the cancer type. The proposed methodology can be further applied accounting for more cell lines and/or the anti-VM efficacy of therapeutic schemes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary video 1 U87MG</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_1_U87MG.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary video 2 MDA-MB</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_2_MDA_MB.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary video 3 4T1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_3_4T1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary video 4 4T1-T</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_4_4T1_T.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary video 5 MOC1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_5_MOC1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary video 6 MOC2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_6_MOC2.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary video 7 B16-F10</label><media xlink:href="EMS190617-supplement-Supplementary_video_7_B16_F10.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdFiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank CRUK-CI Core Facilities for their support and especially Manuela Natoli from RICS.
