DBI is highly and specifically expressed in satellite glia cells (SGCs) of mice, rat and human, but not in sensory neurons or other DRG-resident cells. Knockdown of DBI results in a robust mechanical hypersensitivity without significant effects on other sensory modalities. <italic>In vivo</italic> overexpression of DBI in SGCs reduces sensitivity to mechanical stimulation and alleviates mechanical allodynia in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models. We further show that DBI acts as a partial agonist and positive allosteric modulator at the neuronal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, particularly strongly effecting those with a high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site. Such receptors are selectively expressed by a subpopulation of mechanosensitive DRG neurons and these are also more enwrapped with DBI-expressing glia, as compared to other DRG neurons, suggesting a mechanism for specific effect of DBI on mechanosensation. These findings identified a new, peripheral neuron-glia communication mechanism modulating pain signalling, which can be targeted therapeutically.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">Recent decades have seen a remarkable progress in our understanding of the fundamental biology of pain, yet, current therapies, especially for chronic pain, are often inadequate and the development of decisive improvements has been slower than desired. Furthermore, many current pain medications produce debilitating side-effects within the central nervous system (CNS). Hence, there is an increasing focus on the peripheral nociceptive pathways: peripheral nerves and ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). One line of enquiry illuminates peripheral somatosensory ganglia, such as the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as an early gate within the somatosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Due to the pseudounipolar morphology of the DRG neurons, the action potentials, traveling from the peripheral nerve terminals to the spinal cord need to pass through the axonal bifurcation points (t-junctions) at the DRG, where there is an increasing risk of the propagation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that such failure does occur physiologically, moreover, it can be dynamically regulated, manifesting as filtering of the throughput firing frequency at the DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Although fundamentals of such filtering are only beginning to emerge, one revealed mechanism utilises the ganglion’s intrinsic inhibitory GABAergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Indeed peripheral sensory neurons abundantly express GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)) and some of them are capable of producing and releasing GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Accordingly, direct ganglionic injections of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) or GABA reuptake inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) provide strong relief of pain (both acute and chronic), while GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists, delivered in a similar manner, exacerbate peripherally-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Direct electrophysiological measurements of spike propagation through the DRG revealed that GABA applied to DRG induces spike filtering in the nociceptive fibers, while administration of GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists reduce such filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). These reports point to the existence of an inhibitory GABAergic tone at the DRG; this tone contributes to the ganglionic spike filtering and it can be scaled up or down (and so is the filtering). Yet, it is still unclear how trans-neuronal communication within the DRG is organised, especially given the fact that DRG neuron somata are individually wrapped by satellite glia cells (SGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here we report that SGCs abundantly produce and release a peptide called the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), also known as acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP). Within the DRG, DBI acts as an endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> modulator peptide (‘endozepine’). We further report that DBI (both endogenous and exogenous), acting within the DRG, strongly antagonises nociception induced by mechanical stimulation of the skin <italic>in vivo.</italic> Moreover, genetic overexpression of DBI antagonises mechanical allodynia in the models of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Our data suggest that DBI acts as a partial agonist and positive allosteric modulator at endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the mechanosensitive neurons, at their somatic/perisomatic sites within the ganglion. Such action enhances peripheral ‘gating’ of the nociceptive input to the CNS at the DRG. Our findings revealed a new component in the somatosensory system’s peripheral gate machinery and may point towards new types of analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>DBI is specifically expressed in mouse, rat and human satellite glia cells</title><p id="P8">DBI is an 86-amino-acid peptide that was discovered in search for endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> modulators; it competed with [<sup>3</sup>H]diazepam for binding to crude synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). It is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the brain, especially in the olfactory bulb (OB), hypothalamus and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>); moreover, in CNS astrocytes DBI is one of the most transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). DRG-resident SGCs share many features of CNS’s astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>); expression of DBI in SGCs was also reported inter alia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that DBI acts as an endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> modulator (therefore dubbed ‘endozepine’), binding to the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to allosterically modulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Neuronal action of DBI is still under investigation but both positive (PAM) and negative (NAM) allosteric modulation on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Given the emerging strong role of GABA system in the control of the peripheral nociceptive signaling, we therefore investigated the potential role of DBI in nociception.</p><p id="P9">In addition to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, DBI also binds to other targets, including Acyl-CoA and another receptor, mitochondrial ‘translocator protein’, TSPO (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)); the action of DRG-resident DBI on these other potential targets has also been considered.</p><p id="P10">First, we tested the expression of DBI within the DRG (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Presence of the DBI transcript was detected in both mouse and human DRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Immunostaining with anti-DBI antibody identified strong abundance of DBI protein in structures enwrapping human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, upper panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1B, C</xref>), mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, lower panel) and rat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1H</xref>) sensory neuron somata. DBI immunoreactivity did not overlap with neuronal markers, β-tubulin (mouse: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; human: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1C</xref>), NF200 or peripherin (rat: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1H</xref>), as well as with the macrophage marker, IBA-1 (mouse: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, strong co-localization with SGC markers, FABP7 (mouse: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, E <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig 1D</xref>), glutathione synthase (mouse: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1E</xref>) and S100B (rat: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1F</xref>) was observed in DRG sections. Purified rat SGCs in culture also displayed strong DBI immunofluorescence and co-labelling with S100B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. G</xref>). DBI immunofluorescence co-localised well with DBI transcript signal (FISH) in an SGC-like pattern, supporting the specificity of our antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Importantly, analysis of human single-nuclei transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) revealed co-clustering of DBI with FABP7 a validated marker of human SGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, DBI displays a highly SGC-specific expression pattern in mouse, rat and human DRG. We also used iDISCO clearance of the entire rat DRG in combination with light-sheet imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) to visualise the SGC-like 3D pattern of DBI expression in the ganglion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Glial DBI modulates sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli</title><p id="P11">Next, we asked what the physiological role the SGC-derived DBI might play. We used several approaches to manipulate the expression levels of DBI in the DRG <italic>in vivo.</italic> Acute knockdown (KD) of DBI in the DRG using an intrathecal siRNA in mice revealed a striking phenotype: strong increase in sensitivity to punctate and noxious mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 2A-C, F, G</xref>), without a change in thermal sensitivity (either heat or cold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) or sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus, the punctate mechanical withdrawal threshold (von Frey) was more than halved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), responses to noxious pinprick were more than doubled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 2D, H</xref>), and the latency to response in the alligator clip test dropped more than fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 2I</xref>). Similar effects were recorded in male and female mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). Sensorimotor coordination (rotarod and tape test) was not affected by DBI KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 2E</xref>; not shown). Importantly, mechanical hypersensitivity induced by DBI KD was completely rescued by the intrathecal delivery of purified DBI (10 ng/site; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To produce sustained downregulation of DBI expression in the mouse DRG we performed intra-L4-DRG injections of anti-DBI shRNA construct incorporated into adeno-associated virions (AAV9-shDBI), which also contained EGFP. Two weeks after injection, the EGFP fluorescence was readily detectable in the DRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>) and DBI transcript levels in the whole DRG were reduced by ~50% (as compared to the animals receiving control, EGFP-only containing virions; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Strikingly, AAV9-shDBI (but not AAV9-Control) induced strong mechanical hypersensitivity, manifested in dramatic sensitization to the mechanical, but not thermal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H, I</xref>), which became significant at 14 days after viral infection and persisted for the duration of the experiment (42 days after injection). The hypersensitivity was partially alleviated by DRG delivery of recombinant DBI via the implanted minipump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, J, K</xref>). Of note, ~2-week delay is expected for AAV viral transduction to take place <italic>in vivo</italic> (<italic>33</italic>). There was also no change to noxious mechanical sensitivity in the contralateral paw (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 3C, D</xref>). Sensitivity to innocuous mechanical stimulation (cotton swab test; not shown) was unchanged.</p><p id="P13">Viral constructs used in the above experiments used general U6 promoter to drive shRNA expression; this would not target SGC specifically. Hence, in the next experiments, we constructed AAV5 virions with DBI expression under control of the astroglial GFAP promotor (gfaABC1d), which has successfully been used for viral overexpression of genes in SGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In the first experiment we asked if SGC-specific DBI overexpression would reduce sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimulation. To this end, we injected AAV5-gfaABC1d-DBI (or EGFP control) into L4 DRG of mice. This resulted in strong overexpression of DBI in the DRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>) and reduced mechanical sensitivity on the ipsilateral side (significant from day 21 after viral injection; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) with no contralateral effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thermal sensitivity was minimally affected on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, F</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we tested if DBI overexpression would alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity in models of chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain. We injected AAV5-gfaABC1d-DBI (or EGFP control) into L4 DRG of mice 40 days prior to the partial sciatic nerve ligation (SNI, a neuropathic pain model; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, G, H</xref>) or hind-paw injection of the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA, an inflammatory pain model; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, I, J</xref>). Behavioural tests were performed before and after the procedure. Consistent with previous experiments, SGC-specific overexpression of DBI markedly decreased background mechanical sensitivity with no significant effect on the background heat sensitivity. Importantly, mechanical hypersensitivity induced in both, SNI and CFA models was significantly attenuated for the duration of either of the experiments (14 days after the procedure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G, I</xref>). Moreover, in the case of SNI, there was a marked recovery of mechanical hypersensitivity, not seen in the control (AAV5-gfaABC1d-EGFP) animals by day 14 after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Interestingly, in both models, there was a slight but significant attenuation of heat hypersensitivity at the initial stages of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, J</xref>). No significant effects were observed in either model on the contralateral paw (not shown).</p><p id="P15">Taken together, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> reveal that manipulations with DBI abundance in SGCs produce a specific effect on animal sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, while other sensory modalities remain minimally affected: reduction in DBI expression results in hypersensitivity while overexpression of DBI (or exogenous DBI delivery) reduces mechanical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SGCs release DBI</title><p id="P16">DBI lacks a conventional signal peptide and, thus, is not known to be packaged and released via ‘classic’ vesicular secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Yet, astrocytes readily release DBI into the extracellular media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Furthermore, release from astrocytes of DBI cleavage product, octadecaneuropeptide DBI<sub>33-50</sub> (and likely DBI itself) can be strongly induced by depolarization with extracellular potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Thus, <italic>i)</italic> astroglia can releases DBI and <italic>ii)</italic> such release can potentially be activity-dependent. Next, we investigated if SGCs can also release DBI. We first tested if DBI can be detected in the extracellular media of cultured DRG cells by ELISA. Indeed, DBI was readily detectable in the conditioned medium of both, mixed DRG cultures (containing all cell types dissociated from the ganglia) or purified SGC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Additionally, in both cell preparations, DBI release was significantly induced by depolarization with 150 mM extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, which was consistent with earlier astrocyte experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We hypothesized that DBI released from SGCs could act upon neuronal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors within the DRG to modulate mechanical sensitivity. With this hypothesis in mind, the next series of experiments was designed to test if SGCs can modulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in a paracrine fashion. To this end, we co-cultured purified SGCs with a ‘reporter’ HEK293 cells overexpressing α1/β2/γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits together with the halide-sensitive EYFP mutant (H148Q/I152L; EYFP-QL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The fluorescence of EYFP-QL is quenched by halide ions, such as iodide. Since GABA<sub>A</sub> channels are permeable to iodide, EYFP-QL fluorescence quenching by the influx of I<sup>-</sup> added to the extracellular solution, can be used to monitor GABA<sub>A</sub> channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). We reasoned that if SGC can release a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ligand or modulator, we would be able to register it as an EYFP-QL fluorescence quenching when purified SGCs are co-cultured with the reporter HEK cells. Live fluorescence recordings were performed in SGC/Reporter HEK co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-D</xref>), an extracellular solution containing 5 mM NaI was introduced into the perfusion chamber and perfusion was stopped for 5 min to allow release of glial factors to take place; at the end of the experiment perfusion was recommenced and GABA (5 mM) was applied as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). EYFP-QL fluorescence quenching over the 5-min stop-flow period was quantified and the experiment was repeated in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker, bicuculline (50 μM) or the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (8 μM). The EYFP-QL fluorescence quenching was significantly higher in the presence of SGCs, as compared to reporter HEK cell monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). Interestingly, this SGC-induced quenching increment was blocked by flumazenil (antagonizes benzodiazepine but not GABA binding; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>) but not by bicuculline (antagonises GABA but not benzodiazepine binding; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that SGCs release a substance activating or positively modulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at the benzodiazepine binding site.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DBI acts as partial agonist and a PAM at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p id="P18">We next asked if purified recombinant DBI can modulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. First, we transfected HEK293 cells with several combinations of α, β and γ GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits and tested if these can be activated by recombinant DBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>) using patch clamp recording. In all combinations tested (αlβ2γl, αlβ2γ2, αlβ2γ3, αlβ3γ2 and α3β2γ2), DBI induced measurable inward currents kinetically similar to the responses to GABA. Responses to 200 nM DBI ranged from ~10% to ~50% of the 200 μM GABA response amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) and were somewhat higher for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing α1 and γ3 or γ2 subunits, as compared to those containing α3 or γ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). There are multiple benzodiazepine binding sites within GABA<sub>A</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), however the ‘classical’ high-affinity binding site is formed at the interface between α1 and γ2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). A histidine at the position 101 in α1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and phenylalanine at the position 77 in γ2 were shown to be critical for high-affinity benzodiazepine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Introduction of these mutations in the αlβ2γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> channels significantly reduced DBI-induced current amplitudes with only negligible current recorded from the αl(H101R)β2γ2(F77I) channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

The amplitudes of the DBI-induced currents were in the range of 20-25% of GABA responses; 67% of mouse and 43% of rat GABA-responsive DRG neurons also responded to DBI, while no GABA-negative neurons responded to DBI in either species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, H</xref>). We then tested if DBI can modulate GABA responses of rat DRG neurons. To gain a better understanding of the sensory modality of recorded neurons we utilised an approach described by St. John Smith and Lewin, whereby C-type nociceptors can be electrophysiologically identified by wide action potential with an inflection on the repolarization phase (manifesting as an additional minimum in the first derivative of the spike (dV/dt)), while larger-diameter (presumed Aβ) mechanosensitive neurons have narrower spikes with only one minimum in the first derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We also used sensitivity to 1 μM capsaicin to identify nociceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, B, G, H</xref>). Interestingly, in larger, presumed mechanosensitive neurons (one minimum, capsaicin-negative; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-F</xref>) DBI (500 nM) produced strong potentiation of GABA responses at all concentrations, a significant increase of the Hill coefficient and a trend towards increased affinity (EC<sub>50-control</sub>=67.6±14.7 μM; EC<sub>50-DBI</sub>=41.2±9.0 μM; p=0.0684). On the other hand, DBI had no significant effects on either concentration-dependency or maximal response to GABA in presumed small nociceptors (two minima, capsaicin-positive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G-L</xref>). These data suggested that DBI acts as a PAM at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in presumed larger-diameter neurons responsive to mechanical stimuli but not in TRPV1-positive nociceptors. This unexpected result hinted towards a potential explanation for why manipulations with DBI expression or abundance at the DRG affected mechanical but not thermal sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Specificity of DBI signaling towards mechanosensitive fibers</title><p id="P20">The majority of sensory neurons expresses functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, H</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>)), thus, the question arises – why PAM action of DBI is specific to mechanosensitive neurons? Sensitivity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to benzodiazepines strongly depends on the subunit composition of the channel complex and it is strongest for the channels containing α1 and γ2 subunits (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>)). Bioinformatic analysis of the RNAseq data of mouse DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) revealed that transcripts of these subunits (and particularly α1) are mostly found in A-type, Piezo2-expressing neurons and not in C-type, TRPV1-expressing ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>).

Isoguvacine is a peripherally-restricted agonist that was shown to target peripheral DRG neurons when given systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), hence, its efficacy to recover DBI-KD-induced mechanical hypersensitivity reinforces the notion that DBI acts via the GABA system. Next, we tested if anti-algesic effect of DBI can be perturbed by disabling Acyl-CoA binding site of DBI. To this end, weo repeated chronic pain experiments, in which either SNI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

In these experiments DBI alleviated mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity in both SNI and CFA models, as did the DBI(K33A) mutant; this mutation dramatically reduces DBI’s affinity to Acyl-CoA, which, in turn, is necessary for mitochondrial effects of DBI binding to TSPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). These data lend further support that the primary mechanism of DBI action within the DRG is indeed via the GABA system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">We present here a case for the somatic SGC-to-neuron communication within the dorsal root ganglia by the glial endozepine peptide, DBI. The peptide is produced and released exclusively by the glial cells; upon release, DBI binds to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on the sensory neurons, presumably at the somatic/perisomatic areas, and potentiates GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this action manifests as reduction in sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimulation. Both global and SGC-specific DBI knockdown in the DRG results in marked mechanical hypersensitivity. This hypersensitivity can be alleviated by an intrathecal injection of purified recombinant DBI. On the other hand, DBI overexpression (or minipump delivery into the DRG) results in reduction in basal mechanical sensitivity and alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury or chronic inflammation.</p><p id="P25">Remarkably, whilst effective at modulating mechanical sensitivity in the noxious range, DBI mostly spares other sensory modalities. Thus sensitivity to cold, heat or innocuous mechanical stimulation was largely unaffected by either knockdown, overexpression or exogenous applications of DBI in our experiments (some minor effects on heat sensitivity were observed in some settings). In search for an explanation for this unexpected specificity, we discovered that Piezo2-positive mechanosensitive DRG neurons are much more likely to express a combination of α1 and γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits necessary for the assembly of high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), than any other type of DRG neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Additionally, immunohistochemical and RNA labelling revealed that satellite glia surrounding these Piezo2-positive, presumed mechanosensitive neurons express much higher amounts of DBI, as compared to smaller-diameter neurons, such as TRPV1-positive nociceptors. Thus, there is a twofold mechanism ensuring specific targeting of neurons responsive to mechanical stimuli by DBI.</p><p id="P26">On the cellular level, DBI acts as a partial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist and, in addition, as a PAM at those receptors containing the high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site (i.e. these containing α1 and γ2 subunits). Thus, in both, heterologous expression system, and in native DRG neurons, DBI (in the hundred nM range) induces GABA-like currents of approximately ¼ of the maximal GABA current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which is abolished by mutations within the high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, DBI strongly potentiates the responses of high-affinity GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Behavioural experiments suggest that neither TSPO nor Acyl-CoA contribute significantly to the sensory manifestations of the DBI action within the DRG (Fig. 8). Finally, mechanical hypersensitivity produced by the DBI knockdown can be mimicked by the knockdown of α1 or γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits in the DRG and alleviated by a peripherally-restricted GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist, isoguvacine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref>). All this evidence strongly suggests that it is indeed the benzodiazepine-like activity of DBI that is necessary for its anti-algesic action.</p><p id="P27">Recent findings suggest that the intrinsic GABAergic system present within the DRG acts as a ‘peripheral gate’ within the somatosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Importantly, direct DRG application of GABA reuptake inhibitor produces strong analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) while DRG injections of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists exacerbated peripherally-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and reduced tonic spike filtering at the DRG <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). These experiments imply the presence of GABA tone within the DRG. Hence, the most straightforward mechanistic explanation for the anti-algesic effect of DBI is in the benzodiazepine- like amplification of GABA tone for those neurons expressing the high-benzodiazepine-affinity GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, such as Piezo2-positive mechanosensitive neurons. One potential issue with this hypothesis is that according to our recent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), it is C-type, not the A-type fibers that are the most sensitive to the GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition. One proposed explanation for the experimentally observed difference was that C-fibers have a particularly short stem axon (over 3-fold shorter than in A-fibers), which ensures good electrotonic coupling between the soma and t-junction in C-fibers (vs. much poorer coupling in A-type fibers). Hence, somatically-released GABA would have higher influence over t-junctional spike filtering in C-type, as compared to A-type fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). How then could DBI target mechanosensitive, mostly A-type, fibers? One hypothesis is in that PAM action of DBI on the mechanosensitive A-type neurons may bring them within the range of susceptibility to the GABA tone. Additional mechanisms could involve the actions of DBI at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at or around of the mechanoreceptive fiber t-junctions, making stem length less relevant. There could be additional biophysical or other reasons, which are yet to be understood.</p><p id="P28">The mechanism(s) of DBI release by astroglial (or other) cells is poorly understood. DBI (and its precursor peptide) lacks classical signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), and apparently it is not packaged into secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Yet, astroglia actively release both DBI and its cleavage product, ODN, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Possible mechanisms for DBI release/secretion currently being tested include efflux through the membrane pores, ATP-dependent excretion through the ABC transporters, or release via autophagy-associated vesicles (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)). We can readily detect DBI by ELISA in the extracellular media from the full DRG cultures, as well as from the purified SGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Additionally, release by SGCs of a factor acting on the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was detected by our ‘sniffing’ imaging approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-G</xref>). Importantly, as in the case of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), DBI release from the SGCs can be induced by high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The latter finding suggests that DBI release from glia can be stimulated during periods of high firing rates of the DRG neurons, when these actively extrude K<sup>+</sup> ions via repolarising voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. This could provide an anti-algesic dampening mechanism for pain induced by noxious mechanical stimulation.</p><p id="P29">Finally, our data reveal that overexpression or exogenous delivery of DBI to the DRG can alleviate mechanical allodynia in both neuropathic and inflammatory pain models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, 8).

Briefly, a midline incision was made at the L3 –L5 spinal level of adult male mouse (C57BL/6; 20 –25 g), and the L4 was identified at the midpoint of a link between both sides of the iliac crest. A 0.8 mm hole (about 1 mm off the inferior edge of the transverse process) was drilled through the transverse process over the L4 DRG. Approach of a ganglion was verified by the twitch of the paw. A hooked stainless steel blunt-tip cannula (inner diameter, 0.64 mm; length, 4 mm) was forced into the hole and connected to a polypropylene tube (inner diameter, 0.41 mm; length, 4.5 mm). The incision was closed with sutures, and the cannula was firmly fixed in place with dental cement. Intramuscular injection of benzylpenicillin (19 mg/0.1 ml) was given immediately after surgery. Postoperatively, mice were housed individually in plastic cages with sawdust flooring and supplied with water and food ad libitum.

Before the implantation, the infusion assembly with attached osmotic pump was incubated in sterile saline (0.9%) at 37 °C for 6 h. This pump model releases approximately 0.5 μl/h for 14 days. All surgical procedures were performed under deep anaesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (40–60 mg/kg) in accordance with the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Hebei Medical University (Shijiazhuang, China) under the International Association for the Study of Pain guidelines for animal use.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Viral injections</title><p id="P47">AAV9-U6-shDBI-CAG-EGFP, AAV5-gfaABC1D-DBI-EGFP and AAV5/9-null-EGFP virions were obtained from Genechem Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). AAV virions were injected into the right-side L4 DRG of C57BL/6 male mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Briefly, under deep anaesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 40-60 mg/kg; i.p.), L4 DRGs of adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed by removal of both spinous and transverse processes of the vertebra bone. The microinjector (Hamilton Company) was inserted into the ganglion to a depth of ~300 μm from the exposed surface. The virion solution (1.1 - 1.2x10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml; 2 μl) was injected slowly and the needle was removed 5 min after the injection was complete. The muscles overlying the spinal cord were loosely sutured together and the wound was closed.
