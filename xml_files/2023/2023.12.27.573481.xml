Studies have shown for instance that responses of our immune system to comorbid conditions could be more complex than the union of immune responses to each disease occurring separately, but a data-driven quantification of this complexity is lacking. In this study, we present a systematic methodology to quantify the interaction effect of two diseases on marker variables of interest (using a chronic inflammatory disease diabetes and parasitic infection helminth as illustrative disease pairs to identify cytokines or other immune markers that respond distinctively under a comorbid condition). To perform this systematic comorbidity analysis, we (i) collected and preprocessed data measurements from multiple single- and double-disease cohorts, (ii) extended differential expression analysis of such data to identify disease-disease interaction (DDI) markers (such as cytokines that respond antagonistically or synergistically to the double-disease condition relative to single-disease states), and (iii) interpreted the resulting DDI markers in the context of prior cytokine/immune-cell knowledgebases.</p><p id="P3">We applied this three-step DDI methodology to multiple cohorts of helminth and diabetes (specifically, helminth-infected and helminth-treated individuals in diabetic and non-diabetic conditions, and non-disease control individuals), and identified cytokines such as IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IL-2 to be DDI markers acting at the interface of both diseases in data collected prior to helminth treatment. Validating our expectations, for these cytokines and other T helper Th-2 cytokines like IL-13 and IL-4, their DDI statuses were lost after treatment for helminth infection. For instance, the relative contribution of the DDI term in explaining the individual-to-individual variation of IFN-<italic>γ</italic> and TNF-<italic>α</italic> cytokines were 67.68% and 48.88% respectively before anthelmintics treatment and dropped to 6.09% and 14.56% respectively after treatment. Furthermore, signaling pathways like IL-10 and IL-4/IL-13 were found to be significantly enriched for genes targeted by certain DDI markers, thereby suggesting mechanistic hypotheses on how these DDI markers influence both diseases. Our results quantified the extent of helminth-diabetes DDI exhibited by various tested cytokine markers, and thereby delineated their role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. These results are promising and encourage the application of our DDI methodology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BIRDSgroup/DDI">https://github.com/BIRDSgroup/DDI</ext-link>) to dissect the interaction between any two diseases, provided multi-cohort measurements of markers are available.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Comorbidity refers to the condition when more than one disease affects an individual at the same time. For instance, an acute infectious disease can afflict an individual suffering from a chronic disease (such as diabetes), and such comorbid conditions can lead to an interesting effect on the various immune/inflammatory molecules released by the host system. For instance, the effect on immune molecules when two diseases interact within an individual could be quite different (synergistic or antagonistic say, rather than simply being additive) compared to when each disease affects the individual in isolation. Quantifying the distinctive double-disease effect on molecules of interest can yield insights into the dynamics of disease progression under comorbid conditions and help reveal the biological pathways affected by these molecules. Genes in such biological pathways can be experimentally validated for their links to the two diseases, and subsequently targeted to design novel comorbidity therapies. Note that a comorbidity therapy may offer advantages that go beyond a simple combination of the individual treatments for each disease.</p><p id="P5">Since studying the pathophysiology of any disease in isolation is challenging in and of itself, it is even more challenging to dissect the pathophysiology of a comorbid condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Some of the challenges in identifying key players involved in comorbid conditions include the lack of carefully planned cohorts comprising single- vs. double-disease cases and appropriate controls, low sample sizes of such multi-cohort datasets even if available, and statistical challenges like multiple testing burden and correction for confounding covariates. While certain studies have identified comorbidity molecules from multi-cohort datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], a rigorous computational approach to quantify the double-disease effect on such molecules and interpreting them biologically is still lacking. In this study, we take a systematic approach to quantify the interaction effect of two diseases on marker variables or molecules of interest (using diabetes and helminth as illustrative disease pairs to identify cytokines or other immune markers that respond distinctively under a comorbid condition). More specifically, we propose a three-step computational pipeline wherein the single and double disease contributions to each marker variable are estimated (using a linear regression model with main and interaction effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which extends a standard case vs. controls differential expression analysis), to identify markers that exhibit statistically significant disease-disease interaction (DDI) effect, and interpret the resulting DDI markers in the context of prior immune-cell or cytokine knowledge-bases.</p><p id="P6">The application of our DDI pipeline to the two diseases, diabetes (which refers to type 2 diabetes mellitus in this work) and helminth (specifically parasite <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> or <italic>Ss</italic> infection), is motivated by epidemiological and laboratory studies that have shown helminth infections to be associated with a decreased prevalence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. This inverse helminth-diabetes association is one aspect of the hygiene hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], and can be understood as follows.</p><p id="P7">(disease-1 response): Diabetes is a well-known metabolic disease associated with a wide range of inflammatory immune responses involving T-helper cells Th1 and Th17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Particularly inflammatory cells like neutrophils and lymphocytes are said to produce high levels of chemical molecules, causing high inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P8">(disease-2 response): Helminth infection is characterized by profound secretion of Th2 cytokine responses and regulatory cytokines which may contribute to the overall protective response to these infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P9">(interaction response): Therefore, in the presence of helminth infections, the immune system is in an anti-inflammatory mode deemed disadvantageous to diabetes progression. Berbudi et al. in their work illustrate a possible mechanism of an inverse relationship between helminth infections and diabetes by saying that type-2 immune response and its associated cell types like alternatively activated macrophages are activated by helminth infections thereby protecting against diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In their research, Camaya et al. speculate that the inverse link between helminth infections and diabetes may be due to a potential cross-talk between the macrophages activated by helminth infection and <italic>β</italic>-cells of the pancreas. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Differential analysis of samples with diabetes and with/without the helminth infection, carried out by Rajamanickam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], showed that compared to uninfected individuals, infected individuals have significantly diminished levels of insulin, glucagon, adiponectin, adipsin, Th17, and Th1 cytokines, and these levels reversed following anthelmintic therapy.</p><p id="P10">While some information as indicated above is known about the mechanisms of interaction between the two diseases, what is lacking is a quantitative scoring and systematic screening of immune cells and inflammatory molecules that behave distinctively under the comorbid helminth-diabetes condition.</p><p id="P11">In this study, we apply our proposed DDI pipeline to perform interaction analysis of immune or inflammatory markers measured in four groups of individuals: control, disease-1, disease-2, and comorbid individuals. We apply it to investigate cellular/molecular markers at the interface of diabetes and helminth infection. More specifically, this pipeline allowed us to estimate the per-disease main effects and DDI (interaction) effect on each measured marker. Thus, we could identify and interpret statistically significant DDI markers (cytokines) such as IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IL-2 and the loss of their DDI statuses after anthelmintic treatment. For instance, the relative contribution of the helminth, diabetes, and interaction terms to explaining the variance of the DDI marker IFN-<italic>γ</italic> are 32.1%, 0.2%, and 67.7% in the before-treatment cohorts, and shift to 21.6%, 72.3%, and 6.1% in the after-treatment cohorts. Various pathways like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13 signaling are seen to be enriched for genes that are targeted by the DDI markers, suggesting mechanisms through which the two diseases interact. Our study has promising applications beyond helminth and diabetes as well since our DDI methodology applied on single- and double-disease cohorts data can reveal the impact of comorbidity on any measured marker for any disease pair of interest, thereby allowing screening for molecules that lie at the interface of the two diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Our Multi-cohort Disease-Disease Interaction (DDI) Analysis Overview</title><p id="P12">For any two diseases of interest, a biochemical variable (such as a cytokine’s concentration level or immune celltype’s frequency) is referred to as a Disease-Disease Interaction (DDI) marker if the change in this variable in a group of comorbid individuals relative to the controls group is significantly different from the cumulative changes in the single-disease groups (i.e., the sum of changes of this variable in disease 1 vs. controls and disease 2 vs. controls). Our DDI pipeline identifies such DDI markers by performing linear regression-based interaction analysis of variables measured in a carefully curated set of single-disease, double-disease, and control groups/cohorts of individuals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>); and provides additional interpretations of the identified DDI markers by querying them in prior information sources (e.g., cytokine-gene knowledgebases). This overall structured pipeline, comprising the three steps of preprocessing of cohorts, differential expression analysis involving main (per-disease) and interaction (DDI) effect terms, and downstream interpretation of the identified markers in the context of prior biological knowledge, is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref> and described in detail in Methods.</p><p id="P13">In the application of our DDI pipeline to study helminth-diabetes comorbidity, we used published multi-cohort data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] gathered from 118 diabetes mellitus individuals, including 60 helminth-infected people (<monospace>DM+</monospace> Pre-treatment) and 58 people who had no infection (<monospace>DM+</monospace> Control). Data without diabetes was gathered from 120 people, including 60 without helminth infection (<monospace>DM–</monospace> Control) and 60 with helminth infection (<monospace>DM–</monospace> Pre-Treatment). In both datasets, anthelmintic treatment was administered to all infected individuals (<monospace>DM+</monospace> Post-treatment, <monospace>DM–</monospace> Post-treatment), and measurements were repeated six months later (except for a subset of individuals who couldn’t be followed up for measurements in <monospace>DM–</monospace> Post-treatment; see Methods). That is, demographic and blood-based measurements were taken from individuals in both pre- and post-helminth treatment time points (referred to as pre-treatment/PreT and post-treatment/PostT respectively; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). All the measured variables’ names, and abbreviations if any, are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Clustering supports grouping of individuals by disease status and markers by category</title><p id="P14">The concatenated data of all six cohorts’ data (which are <monospace>DM–</monospace> Control, <monospace>DM–</monospace> PreT, <monospace>DM–</monospace> PostT, <monospace>DM+</monospace> Control, <monospace>DM+</monospace> PreT, and <monospace>DM+</monospace> PostT) was clustered in an unsupervised fashion (i.e., after removing the cohort label to which each individual belongs). This cluster analysis revealed cohort-specific patterns/signatures of markers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) and thereby recovered the grouping of individuals by cohort. That is, almost all individuals clustered based on their disease status, except the <monospace>DM+</monospace> Infected individuals. This cluster analysis was done using data before covariate adjustment (see Methods); repeating this analysis on data after covariate adjustment resulted in a similar trend (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>, we see that the post-treatment samples clustered together with (i.e., exhibited similar marker signatures as) the control samples, especially in the non-diabetic <monospace>DM–</monospace> backgrounds; this observation is consistent with the effect of the helminth treatment. These observations increased confidence in the quality of the data and allowed us to proceed with further analyses. Clustering of the measured variables (rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) showed that variables that are related to each other by their measurement category are indeed clustered together. For instance, most red blood cell related measurements like Hgb, MCV, MCH, and MCHC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D1</xref> for full names) are grouped closer in the row dendrogram.</p><p id="P15">To better understand the relationship between different variables, besides clustering, we also tried out Bayesian network reconstruction to visualize the measured variables as a network (a set of edges connecting the variables). Network reconstruction was done using data from the before-treatment cohort (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>) or the after-treatment cohort (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 Fig</xref>). In the Bayesian networks, markers that are related by the same measurement category (e.g., most variables in the biochemical parameter category concerning red blood cell and other related measurements like RDW, MCV, Hgb, HCT and PLT) were closer to each other (specifically, lie along a path) in both before and after-treatment cohort Bayesian networks. Also, some of the Th cytokines like IL-17A, IL-2, and IL-1<italic>β</italic> occur together (i.e., lie along a path) in both networks. As a confirmatory check, we inspected the neighbors of the additional disease indicator nodes (called diabetes and helminth status to indicate diabetes and helminth infection respectively). In both the Bayesian networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 and S3 Figs</xref>), these disease indicator nodes were indeed connected directly (or via one hop) to the known biomarkers of the disease that were used to define the disease status in our cohorts (biomarker IgG for helminth infection, and biomarkers HbA1c and RBG (random blood glucose) for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]). These network-related checks confirmed certain basic expectations about the dataset, and together with the clustering-related observations, encouraged us to proceed to further analyses with confidence. The Bayesian networks can also reveal factors at the interface between the two diseases - for instance, when we looked for a node whose removal would disconnect the helminth and diabetes disease status nodes in the network, we found cytokine GM-CSF in the before-treatment network (and Age in the after-treatment network). While this observation is interesting, we need to view it with caution due to the moderate sample sizes underlying the Bayesian networks. So, a statistical analysis and pipeline that would be valid for our moderate sample size setting is preferable to identify and quantify double-disease markers.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of DDI markers and their treatment specificity</title><p id="P16">To identify markers at the interface of helminth infection and diabetes, we applied our DDI pipeline to the helminth-diabetes before- and after-treatment datasets. Our pipeline revealed several DDI markers, each of whose per-disease main and disease-disease interaction effects were significant at the FDR 5% cutoff (see Methods). The results of our DDI analysis are presented as ternary plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>, and as statistics corresponding to the main and interaction effects’ tests (p-values and relative proportion of variance of a tested marker explained by single-disease and DDI terms) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2 and Suppl File D3</xref>. These results lead to the following findings about the DDI behavior before and after treatment for helminth.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Behaviour of DDI markers in before-treatment condition</title><p id="P17">Our DDI pipeline applied to the before-treatment data revealed 23 DDI markers (at FDR 5%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref>), with IL-17A, Visfatin, and IFN-<italic>γ</italic> being the top 3 DDI markers based on the relative contribution of the interaction (DDI) term to explaining the individual-to-individual variation in these cytokines (also referred to simply as the term contribution hereafter; see Methods). The identified DDI markers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref>) included certain DDI markers like IL-4 and IL-8 that are not affected by diabetes in isolation (diabetes term contribution of less than 5%), but are highly influenced by diabetes during helminth comorbidity (DDI interaction term contribution of more than 40%); these cytokines also have a high helminth term contribution of more than 50% consistent with earlier studies (e.g., IL-4 discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]). Viewing an interaction conversely, we found several Th2 cytokines known to be highly expressed during helminth infection such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 to also be influenced by concomitant diabetes (i.e., they had high DDI interaction term contributions of 42.79%, 36.51%, and 55.52% respectively).</p><p id="P18">Since inflammation-related cytokines associated with diabetes are known to be downregulated during helminth infection, we checked their DDI statuses and indeed found the DDI term contributions of inflammatory cytokines IFN-<italic>γ</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), TNF-<italic>α</italic>, IL-2, and IL-17A to be high (67.68%, 48.88%, 54.13%, and 79.57% respectively). This downregulation could be due to the opposite effect of Th2 cytokines associated with helminth response on the pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines (IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IL-2) and Th17 cytokine IL-17A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Taken together, these results on the relative contribution of single- and double-disease influences on different types of DDI markers offer a data-driven quantitative view of helminth-diabetes comorbidity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Majority of the DDI markers resolve in after-treatment condition</title><p id="P19">Our pipeline applied on the after-treatment data revealed 8 DDI markers at FDR 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Compared to the 23 DDI markers discovered under the before-treatment condition, this shows that the DDI effect of many variables was lost due to the anthelmintic treatment. While this is to be expected, our analysis provides a quantitative estimate of the DDI loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D3 Table</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref>). For instance, focusing on the same sets of cytokines discussed above, the respective DDI term contribution of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 decreased to 0.05%, 0.19%, and 8.46%; and that of Th1 cytokines IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and Th17 cytokine IL-17A decreased to 6.09%, 14.56% and 5.96% respectively in the after-treatment condition. These results offer a quantitative view of the observations made in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]; and is also consistent with the treatment-driven decrease in the levels of Th2 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Replication of DDI signals in independent cohorts</title><p id="P20">Having identified DDI markers in the four-cohort (before-treatment) discovery dataset, we would like to test if the interaction patterns replicated in a validation dataset obtained from different cohorts. The validation dataset had all but one of the four cohorts required to do DDI analysis (the <monospace>Hel+DM–</monospace> group was missing); so we had to improvise and test for replication only the DDI signatures that are visible in the three available validation cohorts. First, we note that a majority of the DDI makers identifed in the discovery dataset and discussed in the text above (specifically the Th1, Th2, Th17, and top-3 DDI term contribution cytokines) show largely similar expression patterns between the discovery vs. validation datasets on a visual inspection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To quantify this visual inspection of replication of expression patterns of DDI markers, we performed three differential expression (DE) analyses comparing two of the three available cohorts at a time (see Methods). Each DE analysis yielded hits that are DE markers called at a specific adjusted DE p-value threshold of 0.0001 in the discovery dataset, and non-hits that are the remaining tested variables (see Methods). We can now inspect whether hits have higher DE signal in the validation dataset compared to non-hits, and we do find that to be the case for two of the three DE analyses (according to robust t-test p-value cutoff of 0.1; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). This trend for hits defined using an adjusted DE p-value cutoff of 0.0001 in the discovery dataset also held when this cutoff was changed to 0.01 and 0.05 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8 Fig; Suppl File D4</xref> lists the hits and non-hits for the different cutoffs used). These results taken together support that the cohort-specific expression and DE-related patterns of DDI/other markers in the discovery dataset do replicate in the validation dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Interpreting celltype-specific DDI markers</title><p id="P22">Most of our DDI markers are cytokines that play the role of mediators between different immune celltypes. We would like to query external databases on cytokine-celltype and biological pathways to hypothesize which immune celltypes and biological processes in these celltypes are associated with the DDI cytokines. Note that a particular cytokine may be produced/secreted by a source celltype to elicit a response from other target immune cells (of the same or different celltype).</p><p id="P23">To determine the likely source cells of DDI cytokines, we query the corresponding DDI genes in a gene signature matrix called LM22, which contains the expression of 547 genes across 22 immune celltypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref> shows the expression patterns of seven of our DDI genes that overlap with the 547 LM22 genes. High expression of DDI marker genes GM-CSF and IL-5 in memory-activated CD4 and mast cells suggests that these may be the source immune celltypes of these cytokines. We can observe the same for pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-<italic>γ</italic> and TNF-<italic>α</italic>. In contrast, the expression of these cytokines in CD4 naive cells is low.</p><p id="P24">Having predicted the likely source cells of DDI markers, we would like to next predict their effect on target cells, focusing on the genes and pathways targeted by these DDI cytokines. Towards this, we employ web-based tools CytoSig and WebGestalt to identify which biological pathways (Reactome pathways) are enriched for genes targeted by each DDI marker of interest (specifically focusing only on the Th-related DDI cytokines; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). Two of the key findings from this analysis follows. First, pathways mediated by Th2 cytokines like IL-10 Signaling and IL-4/IL-13 Signaling were enriched for genes affected by the DDI markers. Further, IL-4/IL-13 cytokines are essential for the proliferation of immune cells like macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] (see Discussion for details). Second, pathways related to GPCR ligand binding and Class A/1 (Rhodopsin-like receptors) were also enriched for genes responding to the DDI markers IL-1, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and GM-CSF. These receptors are responsible for cell differentiation and chemotaxis of immune cells like monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Therefore, these findings on DDI Th cytokines reveal not only their target pathways, but also their (above-mentioned) target immune celltypes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><sec id="S11"><title>Summary of our findings</title><p id="P25">In this work, we propose a three-step pipeline for understanding the interface between any two diseases for which multi-cohort measurements are available. We apply this pipeline to perform a systematic quantitative analysis of the interaction between diabetes and helminth. We identified DDI markers through main and interaction analysis and quantitated the relative contribution of the per-disease statuses (helminth and diabetes terms) and disease-disease interaction (DDI) terms to explain the individual-to-individual variation of the measured variables (adipocytokines, Th1, Th2, Th17 cytokines, other cytokines, pancreatic hormones, biochemical parameters, cell count frequencies, and anthropometric parameters). The identified DDI markers such as IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IL-2 at the interface of both diseases show similar signatures of interaction in multiple cohorts of discovery and validation data, thereby increasing confidence in our findings. We also interpret certain DDI cytokine markers in terms of the source immune celltypes that likely secrete them and target pathways like IL-10 and IL-13/4 signaling that likely respond to these cytokines.</p><p id="P26">There have been human and animal studies that have analyzed diabetes and helminth infection separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], and also a few that have analyzed the co-occurrence of these two diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] – our study’s key contribution is in providing a quantitative framework/pipeline for identifying and interpreting DDI markers. To elaborate, cross-sectional epidemiological studies and experiments in animal models support the potential protective effects of helminth infections on the development of type-2 diabetes. These beneficial effects seem to stem from the helminth-induced downregulation of inflammatory pathways involved in the development of insulin resistance or diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. This double-disease downregulation is largely consistent with the DDI term contribution percentages that we estimate for inflammatory cytokines like IFN-<italic>γ</italic> and TNF-<italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref>). Furthermore, our pipeline also revealed other DDI markers like IL-6 and IL-10, which are known risk factors for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]; and TNF-<italic>α</italic>, IL-12, IL-2, and G-CSF, which are shown to have physiological effects on diabetic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Besides quantifying double-disease interaction effects, our study also quantifies per-disease effects such as the helminth infection’s relative contribution to the plasma levels of different markers. The high-to-moderate helminth term contribution (expressed as percentages in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref>) of certain biomarkers related to Th2 responses, like IL-4 (56.94%), IL-5 (50.08%) and IL-10 (12.40%), are consistent with earlier observations of elevated plasma levels of these markers during helminth infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The drop in helminth term contributions of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 to less than 5% in after-treatment data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D3</xref>) is also concordant with our earlier observations on the downregulation of these markers after anthelmintic treatment of helminth-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Regarding the effect of anthelmintic treatment, we provide a comprehensive across-all-markers view of the shift (decrease) in their interaction effects from the before- to the after-treatment ternary plots. For instance, the DDI term contribution of pro-inflammatory markers like IFN-<italic>γ</italic>, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IL-17A decrease after treatment. We observed that these cytokines show a marginal increase in expression in the post-treatment individuals, but they do not revert to their original control levels. The reasons for this memory of helminth infection in the body would be interesting to explore in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Additional biological information on the DDI markers</title><p id="P29">Our Reactome pathway enrichment analysis revealed IL-10 and IL-4/13 signaling pathways to be targeted by multiple DDI cytokines. We now provide literature support to clarify the activation of these signaling pathways in immune cells like macrophages under helminth infection. Turner et al. have demonstrated in mouse models that exposure to IL-4/IL-13 cytokines fosters the proliferation of macrophages (M0) to alternatively-activated macrophages (AAM/M2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. AAM/M2 macrophages, which differentiate from monocytes and macrophages upon activation of IL-4/13 signaling pathways, are required to fight against helminth infection in the target tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. In their work, Berbudi et al. suggest a potential mechanism for how IL-4/13 signaling pathways activate AAM/M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. These AAM/M2 macrophages are also known to produce high levels of IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], which in turn can activate IL-10 signaling in macrophages. Hence macrophages can serve both as the source immune celltype for IL-10 and as the target celltype where IL-4/13 signaling and subsequently IL-10 signaling are activated when exposed to the relevant DDI cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Caveats, Merits and Future directions</title><p id="P30">There are some caveats to our analysis. While we’ve adjusted our data for known confounding factors to mitigate bias in our identified DDI markers, unknown confounding factors cannot be ruled out; so our DDI methodology should be viewed as generating hypotheses (DDI markers) that need to be further experimentally validated. Our current study focuses on each variable separately to test if it is a DDI marker to simplify analysis and interpretation. However many markers are correlated and therefore a per-marker analysis cannot capture correlated trends. In the future, we could build a combined model that takes multiple markers as input to predict the disease status as output and use the feature importance scores derived from this model to quantify the aggregate DDI effect of a set/module of measured variables. Another caveat concerns the replication testing of observations from our four-cohort discovery dataset using only a three-cohort validation dataset. Although we could not perform an identical interaction analysis on the validation dataset (due to the non-availability of one of the four cohorts in the validation dataset), the aggregate interaction signatures (based on pairwise differential expression analyses of hits) in the discovery dataset did replicate in the validation dataset. One more limitation of the interpretation step in our DDI pipeline is the inability to predict rare cell types as sources of the DDI cytokines. We did not focus on rare cell types, because we wanted to employ an established signature matrix called LM22 from a popular method CIBERSORT [ref] to predict the source cells. Whereas LM22 contains the gene expression of 22 major immune cell types only, if other signature matrices involving rare cell types become available and established in the future, we can also expand our source predictions to rare cells in the future.</p><p id="P31">One of the merits of our work is that provided there are four sets of cohorts (two single-disease, double-disease, and control cohorts), our DDI pipeline and associated analyses could be carried out to understand biochemical variables at the interface of any pair of two diseases of interest. The results from the Helminth-Diabetes interaction show a concrete application of our DDI methodology to uncover cytokine and related markers that play a role in the interface of these two diseases. The DDI markers are the molecules (in our case, mostly cytokines) that are affected in a different way (synergistic or antagonistic way) in the comorbid condition relative to the individual disease conditions. As such, the DDI markers and the biological pathways that they are linked to could be targeted for novel comorbid disease therapy. Given that the DDI markers are found through associations, it is possible that they cause the disease or are a response to it. In the former case, the novel treatment could focus on curing the causes of the diseases, whereas in the latter, the treatment could focus on alleviating the symptoms of the comorbid condition.</p><p id="P32">In the future, our DDI methodology could be applied to analyze any two diseases and any set of variables (such as flow cytometry-based measurements of cell surface markers or gene expression levels in transcriptomics datasets). For instance, it could be applied to the multi-cohort gene expression data available for the disease pair, diabetes and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]; gene expression and blood-based measurement data available for diabetes and tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], or metagenomic and the associated species abundance data available for samples affected with combinations of two parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Application of our pipeline on these datasets will help to understand the markers at the interface of the two co-occurring diseases, and suggest targets for new treatment strategies that address double-disease conditions differently than simply prescribing treatments developed separately for each disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Our DDI Methodology/Pipeline (DDI-P)</title><p id="P33">As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, our DDI pipeline comprises three different steps explained in detail in this section. Briefly, the first step is preprocessing and exploratory visualization/analysis of our multi-cohort data pertaining to two diseases. After that, the DDI markers are identified using a main and interaction effect analysis in the second step; and interpreted using prior biological knowledge (such as stored in cytokine knowledge bases) in the final third step of the pipeline.</p><p id="P34">To ensure that the detected DDI markers are relevant for the two diseases under consideration, we recommend that the four groups (control, disease 1 only, disease 2 only, and comorbid group) be matched on possible confounding factors and covariates. For instance, it is preferable that all four groups have similar age distribution, sample sizes, etc., and that the three disease groups have similar disease severity levels. However, it may be hard to get access to such cohorts, and any differences in the sample size or covariate distributions can be corrected/adjusted in the data using linear regression models.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>DDI-P (i): Dataset preprocessing and visualization</title><p id="P35">Given data from control, single-disease (disease 1 and disease 2, such as diabetes and helminth infection), and double-disease cohorts, this step concatenates data on the same set of demographic/biochemical variables measured across these four cohorts. We also add disease status variables D1 and D2. For an individual, D1 is a binary indicator variable of disease 1, i.e., we set D1=1 if the individual has disease 1, and D1=0 otherwise. D2 is similarly a binary indicator variable of disease 2. For individuals who suffer from both diseases, their D1=1 and D2=1. The concatenated data from the four cohorts can be normalized later depending on the analysis done. For the cohorts mentioned in this paper, normalization (standardization, i.e., centering and scaling) for all the variables across the cohorts was carried out only to plot the heatmap. Heatmap visualization of the concatenated normalized data can reveal the expression patterns of all variables across the four cohorts, and help us understand the data-driven grouping of individuals (and variables) in the dataset into clusters with similar patterns.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>DDI-P (ii): Main and interaction effect analysis</title><p id="P36">To gain better insight into markers at the double-disease interface and to specifically identify DDI markers, we performed main effect (per-disease contributions) analysis, followed by interaction effect (double-disease contributions) analysis on the concatenated data from the four cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Linear regression models</title><p id="P37">In the main effect analysis, a linear regression model of the dependent variable (e.g., cytokine) is fit using only the independent variables/features: D1, D2, and all covariates.

Furthermore, non-additive effects (e.g., sum of individual effects of two diseases differing from the joint comorbid effect of both diseases) can be naturally modeled using interaction terms in linear models.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical tests to identify a DDI marker</title><p id="P40">The main effect analysis was performed by comparing the two nested linear models, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq 2</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq 1</xref> above, using a F-statistics based test (implemented in anova.lm function in R); and adjusting/correcting the resulting p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure (implemented in p.adjust function in R). Using an adjusted p-value cutoff of less than 0.05 (i.e., at FDR 5%), the variables that show the main effect were selected. The same procedure was repeated on the selected main effect variables alone to perform interaction analysis in order to obtain the interaction effect p-values (also known as DDI p-values) and variables, but here the compared nested linear models are <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">Eq 3</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq 2</xref> instead (and multiple testing correction is done only over the tested main effect variables). A marker that gets selected as main effect and interaction effect variable in the statistical tests above, each at FDR 5%, is called a disease-disease interaction (DDI) marker. Note that this two-step strategy, viz., identifying variables that exhibit a main effect followed by testing only the main effect variables for interaction effects, is a standard way to reduce multiple testing burden when detecting interaction effects.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Ternary plot</title><p id="P41">The results from interaction analysis are visually represented through a ternary plot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].

The black dots in a ternary plot are all variables considered/tested in the study, and a green/red circle around a black dot indicates that the variable is also a main effect variable.

To predict such pathways, we first collect known target genes (TGs) of the cytokine from the CytoSig database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and then test different pathways for enrichment of these query TGs using the WebGestalt tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. In a bit more detail, for a DDI cytokine of interest (such as a Th-cytokine DDI marker), we used CytoSig to retrieve the top 100 entries (search results) of TGs for the cytokine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D5</xref> for TGs of some DDI cytokines) and used WebGestalt ORA (Over-Representation Analysis) to test enrichment of this query set of TGs in each pathway from the Reactome database. WebGestalt function from the R Package WebGestaltR (version 0.4.6) was employed here, with its key function arguments set as follows: ”pathway_REACTOME” for enrichDatabase, ”genome” as referenceSet, and ”genesymbol” as interestGeneType. WebGestalt can adjust the enrichment p-values of a cytokine for multiple testing (across all tested Reactome pathways), and apply a cutoff of 0.05 on the adjusted p-values to obtain the Reactome pathways significantly enriched for the cytokine’s TGs at FDR 5%; these pathways enriched at FDR 5% are referred to as the target pathways of the tested cytokine.</p><p id="P43">To visualize the above pathway enrichment results as a heatmap, we take the union of target pathways of all tested cytokines, and retrieve their enrichment p-values to assemble an enrichment signal matrix.

To assemble this matrix, we need to retrieve the enrichment p-values of not just the significantly enriched pathways of a tested cytokine, but also other pathways; so we reran the same WebGestalt function above, but this time, not with a FDR cutoff of 0.05, but with the following arguments: 1 as minNum, 2000 as maxNum, 10000 as topThr, ”top” as sigMethod, and 40 as reportNum.

R package bnlearn (version 4.6) was used to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of the networks from the above-mentioned datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We used boot.strength() to estimate the strength of the learnt arcs in the networks. In this process, we generate several bootstrap resamples of the data, and learn separate DAG-structured networks from each such bootstrap-resampled dataset (using the Min-Max Hill Climbing (MMHC) hybrid structure learning algorithm). Across all bootstrap-resampling-based networks, we can now count how often each arc gets repeated and express it as a fraction from 0 to 1, and then obtain a consensus network with arcs that appear often using averaged.network() (all of these functions were run with the default input arguments). The final BN is the averaged consensus network (dropping direction of arcs in the graph since it is a consensus network) containing only arcs whose strength is above a particular threshold value (0.5). The BN reconstructed from before-treatment data is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref> (and after-treatment data is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 Fig</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Helminth-Diabetes cohorts: Interaction analysis</title><p id="P51">To have a better insight into the variables involved in the double-disease interface both before and after treatment for helminth, main and interaction analyses were performed on the before-treatment and the after-treatment cohorts. Towards this, <monospace>DM–</monospace> Control, <monospace>DM–</monospace> Pre-treatment, <monospace>DM+</monospace> Control, and <monospace>DM+</monospace> Pre-treatment samples were considered for the before-treatment interaction analysis. <monospace>DM–</monospace> Control, <monospace>DM–</monospace> Post-treatment, <monospace>DM+</monospace> Control, and <monospace>DM+</monospace> Post-treatment samples were considered for the after-treatment analysis.</p><p id="P52">The main/interaction effect analysis mentioned in the DDI pipeline was applied once on the before-treatment data and another time on the after-treatment data for each tested marker. The same seven covariates used in cluster analysis of covariate-adjusted data mentioned above (i.e., Age, Sex, Year, BMI, Creatinine, AST, and ALT) was also used as covariates in the DDI pipeline analysis. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2</xref> lists the parameters of the linear models estimated during the main and interaction effect analyses of the before-treatment data (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D3</xref> presents similar estimates for the after-treatment data). The DDI (or other) term contributions of the before- vs. after-treatment data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl File D2 vs. Suppl File D3</xref>) can then be compared to understand the effect of helminth treatment on the DDI status of markers. Note that the DDI term contribution of a marker is the relative contribution of the DDI term to the explained variance of the marker; still it is valid to compare these relative contributions after and before treatment for the following reason. For a majority of the markers, the fraction of the marker’s variance that is unexplained is not very different between after- and before-treatment data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Helminth-Diabetes cohorts: Interpretation of DDI markers</title><p id="P53">The downstream analyses (target pathway enrichment analysis using CytoSig/WebGestalt and source celltype prediction using LM22 matrix) for interpreting DDI markers, was also performed on the identified helminth-diabetes DDI markers. Only the DDI markers G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1<italic>β</italic>, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-22, TNF-<italic>α</italic>, and IFN-<italic>γ</italic> (rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>) were considered for the target pathway enrichment analysis, since CytoSig did not have any information on the rest of the helminth-diabetes DDI markers. Further, only 8 of these markers (columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>) overlapped with the genes in the LM22 matrix, and hence the source celltype analysis was also performed only for these 8 helminth-diabetes DDI markers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Replication analysis</title><sec id="S31"><title>Validation cohorts overview</title><p id="P54">The replication analysis was carried out using validation cohorts pertaining to a different study at NIRT. The validation dataset consisted of measurements from 31 non-diabetic, non-helminth-infected individuals as controls (denoted <monospace>DM–</monospace> Control, or <monospace>DM–Hel–</monospace>), 43 diabetic non-helminth-infected individuals (denoted <monospace>DM+</monospace> Control, or <monospace>DM+Hel–</monospace>), and 41 diabetic helminth-infected individuals (denoted <monospace>DM+</monospace> Pre-treatment, or <monospace>DM+Hel+</monospace>). The validation study had a different design, and so didn’t have non-diabetic helminth-infected individuals and also didn’t have post-helminth-treatment data. Of the 50 markers measured in the discovery cohorts, 42 were also profiled in the validation cohorts, and we focused on these common markers for conducting the replication tests.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Replication testing based on DE analyses</title><p id="P55">Interaction analysis to discover DDI markers requires data from four groups of individuals (the two single-disease, one double-disease, and one control groups). If a validation study has fewer groups, like three instead of four in our case as described above, we can still validate/verify certain interaction signatures of the markers as follows. We performed 3 different pairwise comparisons of the 3 groups as described below, using the discovery dataset first and the validation dataset next.</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P56"><monospace>DM–</monospace> Control vs. <monospace>DM+</monospace> Pre-treatment (<monospace>Hel–DM–</monospace> vs. <monospace>Hel+DM+</monospace>).

The DE analysis is essentially a main effect analysis where the dependent variable (marker expression) is regressed over the covariates, diabetes term, and helminth term, and the main effect or DE p-values calculated using a F-statistic based test (cf. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq 2</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq 1</xref> statistical test discussed above). The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing across all markers using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Hits are markers/variables whose adjusted DE p-value is at most a stringent cutoff of 0.0001; and non-hits are the rest of the tested markers (other relaxed cutoffs of 0.01 and 0.05 were also tried and resulted in similar trends).</p><p id="P60">Having identified the hits and non-hits using the discovery cohorts’ data, we would now like to test it for replication in the validation cohorts. Towards this, we inspect the DE signal (–<italic>log</italic><sub>10</sub> (DE p-value)) of hits vs. non-hits in pairwise comparisons of the validation cohorts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). If this DE signal of the hits are better than that of non-hits (as tested using Yuen’s robust t-test, implemented in the yuen function from the WRS2 package in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]), we consider the DE signals of hits detected in the discovery dataset as replicated in the validation dataset. Yuen’s variant of the t-test was chosen due to its robustness against outliers.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS193138-supplement-Supplemental_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of our BIRDS (Bioinformatics and Integrative Data Science) research group, and members of IBSE (Center for Integrative Biology and Systems Medicine) for their valuable input during the presentations of this work.
