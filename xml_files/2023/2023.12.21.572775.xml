Invaders must sidestep a combination of intrinsic host defences as well as overcome colonisation resistance by the native gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Accordingly, bacterial pathogens have evolved many unique strategies to effectively compete with the microbiota and cause infection within a favourable host-niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This includes a combination of pathogen specific virulence mechanisms and metabolic adaptations that increase within-host fitness. Importantly, virulence and fitness factor regulation often coincide and are dynamically controlled in response to the host environment to maximise competitiveness therein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Enterohaemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe diarrhoeal illness in humans and, in extreme cases, renal failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. EHEC is a member of the attaching and effacing (A/E) family of pathogens, which intimately colonise the colonic epithelium forming characteristic pedestal-like lesions on the surface of host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. A/E pathogenesis is defined by the activity of a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) encoded on a ~35 kb horizontally acquired island known as the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This T3SS translocates more than 30 effector proteins - encoded on the LEE and several additional horizontally acquired elements, termed O-islands (OIs) - that collectively subvert host cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The murine pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> also encodes the LEE and has been adopted as the relevant surrogate model to study EHEC pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> due to its dependency on the T3SS, comparable pathology and lack of requirement to pre-treat mice with antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The LEE-encoded T3SS is essential for overcoming microbiota-dependent colonisation resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Epithelial attachment does not depend on a tissue receptor interaction. Instead, the LEE is uniquely controlled in response to a multitude of host and microbiota derived signals such as sugars, amino acids, short- and long-chain fatty acids and hormones that are integrated into a regulatory network ensuring correct spatial deployment of the T3SS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For example, <sc>D</sc>-glucose represses the LEE whereas gluconeogenic substrates encountered at the epithelial surface (such as succinate) enhance its expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; <sc>L</sc>-arginine found in abundance in the gut is directly sensed to activate the LEE, whereas the amino acid <sc>D</sc>-serine, abundant in the urinary tract, represses the LEE thus restricting EHEC to the gut niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. A/E pathogenesis therefore hinges on nutrient availability, by promoting competition with the commensal microbiota as well as regulating essential virulence factors.</p><p id="P5"><italic>E. coli</italic> as a species relies on cross-feeding of microbiota liberated mono- and disaccharide sugars as it cannot degrade complex dietary polysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, EHEC has evolved to utilise a unique hierarchy of sugars compared to commensal <italic>E. coli,</italic> therefore implying a strategy to limit competition with similar members of the microbiota for critical resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. <sc>L</sc>-arabinose is one such resource and highly abundant in nature as a major constituent of plant cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> transports <sc>L</sc>-arabinose into the cell via the H<sup>+</sup> symporter AraE and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter AraFGH. The transcription factor AraC then senses cytosolic <sc>L</sc>-arabinose and upregulates both transporters as well as the AraBAD enzymes essential for its metabolism, a mechanism enhanced by the presence of cyclic AMP that increases during <sc>D</sc>-glucose depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we show that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation is exploited by A/E pathogens during infection. Surprisingly, this occurs independently of its role as a source of nutrition. Instead, this advantage is achieved via a mechanism that links metabolism and virulence regulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose upregulates expression of the LEE-encoded T3SS. Importantly, this relies on the uptake and breakdown of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose in the cell, acting as regulatory trigger as opposed to supporting pathogen growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we also describe the identification of a novel <sc>L</sc>-arabinose uptake system that is widely encoded by T3SS-encoding EHEC strains in nature. We hypothesise that this system gives EHEC an enhanced capacity to scavenge <sc>L</sc>-arabinose in the gut, which therefore provides a fitness advantage via the convergence of virulence regulation and metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A novel accessory <sc>L</sc>-arabinose uptake system is widely encoded by EHEC isolates in nature</title><p id="P6">While analysing our previously determined <italic>C. rodentium in vivo</italic> transcriptome, we noticed that genes related to monosaccharide uptake and metabolism were some of the most highly upregulated during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Among these was ROD_24811, an uncharacterised gene displaying ~20-fold induction in the colon and predicted to encode a periplasmic binding protein of a simple sugar ABC transporter. A search for homologues in EHEC did not find an exact match but instead identified a similar uncharacterised 4.4Kb ABC-transporter locus (&gt;60 % nucleotide identity) that appeared to be EHEC-specific, displaying a unique genetic context, being located on OI-island 17. We therefore focused our efforts on the role of this system given its relevance to EHEC and potentially human infection. This locus was predicted to encode a periplasmic binding protein (Z0415), an ATPase (Z0416-7) and two permease subunits comprised of α-helices (Z0418/Z0419), characteristic of Type II ABC transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>In silico</italic> modelling of Z0415-9 using AlphaFold2 supported this, by displaying the expected modular structure of an inner membrane ABC transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). InterPro analysis of the associated amino acid sequences identified domain signatures related to pentose monosaccharide substrate specificity and comparison with known <italic>E. coli</italic> systems supported that Z0415 clustered closely with monosaccharide ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Presence/absence analysis of Z0415-9 carriage amongst 949 representative <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes revealed that the locus is not completely conserved across the species phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). For instance, Z0415-19 is carried predominantly amongst isolates from phylogroups B1 and E (397/445 strains), comprised largely of EHEC strains, whereas phylogroups A and B2 (largely commensal and extraintestinal isolates, respectively) largely lack this system. Strikingly, there was a significant correlation between Z0415-9 and LEE carriage (Odds ratio = 35.9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), with the converse scenario (LEE positive, Z0415-9 negative) being an incredibly rare event (8/948 strains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This suggests that there may be conflating evolutionary pressures for LEE-encoding EHEC strains to acquire Z0415-9, implicating its associated function in pentose sugar scavenging as being potentially beneficial for EHEC infection.</p><p id="P7">To assess the function of Z0415-9, we generated a transcriptional reporter (EHEC transformed with pMK1<italic>lux</italic>-P<sub><italic>Z0415-9</italic></sub>) and cultured this in MEM-HEPES supplemented with either <sc>D</sc>-xylose, <sc>D</sc>-ribose or <sc>L</sc>-arabinose. Z0415-9 promoter activity was induced in a concentration-dependent manner exclusively in response to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose and we validated this result using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a/b</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed that Z0415-9 induction occurs exclusively in response to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose and not <sc>D</sc>-arabinose, the less common form of this sugar found in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). We next hypothesised that Z0415-9 might be regulated similarly to the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose machinery. Activity of pMK1<italic>lux</italic>-P<sub><italic>Z0415-9</italic></sub> in a Δ<italic>araC</italic> background was completely abolished during growth with <sc>L</sc>-arabinose. Importantly this could be complemented by expressing <italic>araC in trans</italic>, suggesting that this horizontally acquired system is co-regulated with the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We therefore named this locus Aau, for <underline>a</underline>ccessory <sc>L</sc>-arabinose <underline>u</underline>ptake system.</p><p id="P8">Deletion of Aau did not result in a significant growth defect during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth on <sc>L</sc>-arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that it may play a more important role in the host-context during nutrient competition. To test this, we orally inoculated streptomycin treated BALB/c mice with a 1:1 mixture of wild type EHEC and Δ<italic>aau</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

This result implies that Aau provides a fitness benefit to EHEC within the complex and dynamic gut niche.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><sc>L</sc>-arabinose alters the EHEC transcriptome and enhances expression of the LEE-encoded T3SS</title><p id="P9">Our discovery of Aau prompted us to investigate the effects of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation on EHEC. Nutrients often act as signals that modulate virulence gene expression. We therefore hypothesised that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose may affect the expression of key EHEC virulence genes, as well as being able to act as a source of nutrition. To test this, we performed RNA-seq on EHEC cultured in MEM-HEPES with and without 1 mg/ml <sc>L</sc>-arabinose to late exponential phase. Strikingly, we identified 1187 significant (&gt;1.5 fold-change; FDR <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). As expected, the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation genes (<italic>araBAD, araE, araFGH</italic>), as well as genes encoding Aau, were among the most strongly upregulated displaying increased expression of up to 42-fold (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Functional network analyses identified that the large abundance of DEGs unrelated to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose clustered into diverse biological pathways including metabolism, quorum sensing, signalling and regulation of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a/b</xref>). While we anticipated shifts in expression of genes related to metabolism, we also noticed that several genes belonging to the LEE pathogenicity island were significantly upregulated in response to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The LEE is essential for EHEC pathogenicity and is responsive to gut-associated cues. We therefore reasoned that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose may provide a fitness advantage through regulating T3SS activity either in concert to, or independent from a role in host-associated nutritional competition. To assess the dynamics of LEE induction by L-arabinose, we engineered a transcriptional reporter of the T3SS (EHEC transformed with pMK1<italic>lux</italic>-P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub>). Culture of this strain in MEM-HEPES (LEE-inducing conditions) supplemented with various concentrations of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose resulted in no increase in growth rate but a significant and prolonged increase in LEE promoter activity from late exponential phase onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). RT-qPCR also confirmed a significant increase in transcription across all five LEE operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). We detected an increase in LEE expression in the presence of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose at concentrations as low as 50 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>), within range of the amount quantified from the luminal content and faeces of mice maintained on a conventional diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). We next observed an increased accumulation of T3SS associated effector proteins in the cytosol and cell-free supernatant by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To test if this increase in T3SS expression and function resulted in enhanced host-cell interaction, we quantified adhesion of EHEC to cultured epithelial cells by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Pre-exposing EHEC to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose before infection of epithelial cells significantly increased the number of attached EHEC and associated A/E lesions (identified as foci of actin accumulation) per infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). This was in parallel with an &gt;10% increase in the number of individually infected cells in the presence of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose. These results collectively show that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose enhances the expression and function of the LEE-encoded T3SS, resulting in a greater capacity to cause A/E lesions on the host epithelial surface.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Metabolism of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose is essential to enhance T3SS expression</title><p id="P11">Nutrient sensing typically occurs either from the environmental (via two-component systems) or via a cognate transcription factor in the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Due to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation occurring at three levels (uptake via multiple transporters, sensing by a dedicated transcription factor and metabolism via AraBAD), this left the mechanism of T3SS regulation by <sc>L</sc>-arabinose unclear, as in principle it could occur at any of these three stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We therefore generated mutants in each component, first validating their roles in <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>), allowing compartmentalisation of each stage to explore the mechanism of T3SS enhancement. We first measured LEE activity in Δ<italic>araC</italic> and observed a complete reversal of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose enhanced T3SS expression. This was complemented <italic>in trans</italic> suggesting that sensing via AraC may directly regulate LEE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we measured LEE activity in the Δ<italic>araBAD,</italic> Δ<italic>araFGH</italic> and Δ<italic>araE</italic> backgrounds. This revealed that enhanced LEE expression was also abolished in Δ<italic>araBAD</italic>, but not in the Δ<italic>araFGH</italic> background and only partially in Δ<italic>araE,</italic> likely since there are multiple routes for <sc>L</sc>-arabinose uptake and in line with the major dependence on AraE for growth on this sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). To narrow down the mechanism further, we measured LEE expression in Δ<italic>araC</italic> transformed with plasmids constitutively expressing either <italic>araBAD</italic> and <italic>araE</italic> in parallel (pSU-<italic>araBAD/E</italic>) or <italic>araE</italic> alone (pSU-<italic>araE</italic>), allowing functional differentiation between uptake and downstream metabolism in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). The logic behind this experiment was that <italic>araBAD</italic> and <italic>araE</italic> expression (and therefore uptake and metabolism) is completely dependent upon AraC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, bypassing the role of AraC using constitutively expressed <italic>araBAD/araE</italic> allowed us to conclusively determine whether <sc>L</sc>-arabinose sensing by AraC, uptake or metabolism caused enhanced LEE expression. Complementation of Δ<italic>araC</italic> with pSU-<italic>araBAD/E</italic> resulted in complete restoration of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose enhanced LEE expression above wild type levels, whereas constitutive expression of AraE alone (pSU-<italic>araE</italic>) had no restorative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Taken together, these data comprehensively show that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism (via AraBAD) in the cytosol is essential to enhance T3SS expression in response to this sugar.</p><p id="P12">To understand the ecological context of these results, we measured the temporal dynamics of <italic>araBAD</italic> transcription compared to the LEE, showing that induction of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism under these conditions significantly correlates (R = 0.92; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with LEE expression dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). MEM-HEPES contains <sc>D</sc>-glucose, which suppresses <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation genes by catabolite repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Glycolytic growth is also known to reduce maximal LEE expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that the temporal dynamics of our mechanism likely represented the switch to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose catabolism as <sc>D</sc>-glucose became depleted from the medium. Using thin layer chromatography, we measured the relative abundance of monosaccharides in cell-free supernatant of EHEC cultured in MEM-HEPES alone or supplemented with <sc>L</sc>-arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). The data confirmed that <sc>D</sc>-glucose depletion coincided with activation of AraBAD (and as such, the LEE). This offered a logical explanation as to why enhanced LEE expression in response to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism was observed only at this stage of growth, when the repressive effects of <sc>D</sc>-glucose on <italic>araBAD</italic> and the LEE would no longer be a factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). This suggests that dynamic changes in nutrient availability that likely occur within the complex host environment could have important downstream effects on the mechanisms of virulence factor regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An intrinsic, generalised mechanism of T3SS regulation via pentose sugar metabolism</title><p id="P13"><sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism, like other aldopentose sugars such as <sc>D</sc>-ribose and <sc>D</sc>-xylose, can generate cellular energy via the pentose phosphate shunt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. While each sugar can support <italic>E. coli</italic> growth using dedicated genes, their metabolism converges at the generation of <sc>D</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate, which enters the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and ultimately produces pyruvate to generate cellular energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). It has been previously shown that exogenous pyruvate can enhance LEE expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that the observed effect of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose on expression of the T3SS could be due to excess pyruvate generation and hypothesised that <sc>D</sc>-ribose or <sc>D</sc>-xylose may have a similar effect, given their common cellular fate. Strikingly, enhanced LEE expression dynamics were also observed when EHEC was cultured in the presence of either sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, deletion of the <sc>D</sc>-ribose utilisation genes (Δ<italic>rbsDACBKR</italic>) eliminated the ability to grow on this sugar as a sole carbon source and, as predicted, abolished the observed increase in T3SS expression, suggesting that the common features of cellular pentose sugar metabolism determine the regulatory effect on the LEE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This is in line with our finding that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose must be metabolised to exert its T3SS regulatory effect. Finally, we confirmed that addition of pyruvate to the medium enhanced LEE expression and demonstrated that growth in the presence of both exogenous pyruvate and <sc>L</sc>-arabinose displayed an additive effect, further enhancing T3SS expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This suggests that the common cellular fate of pentose sugar metabolism and generation of key downstream metabolites is a generalised mechanism by which A/E pathogens can regulate virulence gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism is required for maximal fitness during enteric infection</title><p id="P14">While <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism has been reported to provide a fitness advantage to <italic>E. coli</italic> during colonisation of streptomycin-treated mice, this model does not reflect A/E pathogenesis and therefore the role of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation during infection was unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

The Δ<italic>araBAD</italic> mutant was more significantly outcompeted by the wild type in a competitive infection, displaying an increasing fitness defect from day 9 until termination at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To determine whether the fitness defect was associated with tissue adhered or luminal <italic>C. rodentium,</italic> we quantified the bacterial burden of colon sections from mono-infected mice that were cleared of the luminal content. In agreement with the faecal counts, colon-associated Δ<italic>araBAD</italic> were recovered in significantly fewer numbers than wild type <italic>C. rodentium</italic> suggesting that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism actively promotes colonisation of host-tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Finally, we aimed to determine whether the observed fitness defect of Δ<italic>araBAD</italic> was driven by the inability to utilise <sc>L</sc>-arabinose as nutrient or lack of its input as a positive stimulus for regulation of the LEE.

This suggested that constitutive expression of the T3SS can overcome the fitness defect of Δ<italic>araBAD</italic> by mimicking the stimulatory effect that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism imparts on the LEE and suggesting that during a natural infection <italic>C. rodentium</italic> does not require <sc>L</sc>-arabinose as a source of nutrition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Successful cross-feeding on nutrients derived from the host, microbiota or diet is essential for bacterial pathogens to overcome colonisation resistance and replicate within their preferred host-niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, nutrients that support growth can often be “sensed” as stimuli that trigger virulence gene expression, therefore coupling virulence and metabolism to maximise fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Here, we have found that metabolism of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose by A/E pathogens promotes within-host fitness by generating central metabolites that converge with regulation of virulence. While <sc>L</sc>-arabinose supports the growth of EHEC and <italic>C. rodentium in vitro,</italic> it is not required as a source of nutrition during infection of mice. Instead, its catabolism to pyruvate stimulates expression of the LEE-encoded T3SS, a virulence factor essential for colonisation, which provides an advantage during host-colonisation. We suggest that this underlying mechanism revolving around the generation of central metabolic products that enhance LEE expression is generalisable for other pentose sugars with a similar cellular fate. We also identified a novel ABC transporter, termed Aau, that is selectively induced in response to <sc>L</sc>-arabinose exclusively, suggesting that EHEC has an enhanced ability to scavenge <sc>L</sc>-arabinose in the gut and maximise its competitiveness through the convergence of virulence and metabolism.</p><p id="P17">Freter’s nutrient-niche hypothesis suggests that within the complex, multi-species environment of the gut, an invading pathogen must be able to utilise at least one limiting nutrient better than the commensals it competes with<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

As such, non-starch hydrolysis and degradation of L-arabinose-containing polysaccharides by saccharolytic members of the gut microbiota could liberate free <sc>L</sc>-arabinose that is subsequently exploited by species such as <italic>E. coli</italic> during the process of cross-feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Indeed, research from the labs of Conway and Cohen describing carbon nutrition of <italic>E. coli in vivo</italic>, has shown that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose is utilised by both commensal and EHEC strains in the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, they described how EHEC metabolises <sc>L</sc>-arabinose earlier in the hierarchy of carbon utilisation than a commensal strain, when grown on a mixture of sugars. This suggests that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose is an important nutrient for <italic>E. coli</italic> to sustain growth within the mammalian intestine and that EHEC has evolved an enhanced ability to do this.</p><p id="P18">An enhanced ability of EHEC to utilise <sc>L</sc>-arabinose may be achieved by more efficient breakdown within or uptake into the cell. Our discovery of the novel <sc>L</sc>-arabinose ABC transporter Aau suggests that the latter may be particularly important in providing EHEC with a competitive edge in nature. Indeed, despite Aau being encoded on an O-island without a dedicated regulatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we have found that its activation relies on the core genome-encoded AraC in a manner akin to the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This results in a rapid and co-ordinated response to the sugar by inducing the expression of multiple uptake systems. While we are currently investigating the underlying mechanisms (affinity and kinetics of uptake in comparison to the canonical AraE/FGH uptake systems) of this transporter, there have been other reports of Aau induction in ecologically relevant scenarios that support its likely role in EHEC infection. Transcriptome studies of EHEC in response to spinach and lettuce lysates found that the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose genes and those encoding Aau were significantly upregulated, indicating a potential dietary source of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the permease was identified as being one of the most highly expressed EHEC proteins during human infection using <italic>in vivo</italic> antigen detection technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, which is particularly noteworthy considering that <italic>C. rodentium</italic> (a dedicated murine pathogen) does not encode this system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. This therefore provides compelling evidence that Aau, and its role in <sc>L</sc>-arabinose scavenging, likely represents a crucial element of the real-world, human infectious context.</p><p id="P19">Our discovery that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism is required for regulation of the T3SS reveals new insights into how we perceive virulence factor control in the host context. Traditionally, nutrients or small metabolites are thought to be “sensed” either in the cytosol post-uptake by a cognate transcription factor, or from the environment by periplasmic interactions with two-component systems. This is indeed true of pyruvate, which has been described as a virulence-inducing signal in many species beyond <italic>E. coli.</italic> For example, both <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium upregulate virulence gene expression in response to host-derived pyruvate via two-component systems, the latter of which is particularly noteworthy here as this regulation occurred independently of any growth advantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Our proposed mechanism provides new evidence that the endogenous metabolism of certain molecules, that do not in themselves act as “signals”, can cause dramatic shifts in the pathogen response. This follows on from our recent study where we found that metabolism of microbiota-derived 1,2-propanediol generates the short chain fatty acid propionate, which in turn provides a signal that activates LEE expression in <italic>C. rodentium</italic> independently of a growth advantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In a comparable manner, uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> produces excess pyruvate via serine deamination, which in terms results in increased sensing of pyruvate via a two-component system and subsequent uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. These studies collectively point to alternative mechanisms of virulence and fitness regulation whereby “signals” are generated endogenously by the pathogen based on the biochemical status of the environment. Importantly, it also alludes to a more complex view of the consequences of niche adaptation, whereby metabolic systems can provide additional underappreciated benefits to a pathogen through the regulation of genetically unlinked virulence factors. The mechanism of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose induced LEE expression also reinforces the benefit of being able to dynamically shift between available nutrients <italic>in vivo</italic> that are likely to be in constant flux and thus would aid in limiting any associated repressive effects of catabolite repression on virulence gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Finally, while the canonical <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation pathway has been understood and exploited in bacterial genetics for decades, the relevance of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism in promoting pathogenesis has only recently emerged. Dietary <sc>L</sc>-arabinose utilisation by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium promotes expansion in the gastrointestinal tract of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. This occurs via a mechanism involving an intrinsic alpha-<italic>N</italic>-arabinofuranosidase that liberates the sugar from dietary polysaccharides. Dietary fibre is traditionally thought to provide a benefit in maintaining colonisation resistance via maintenance of microbiota composition, the mucosal barrier and short chain fatty acid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The data from Ruddle <italic>et al.</italic> and ours therefore highlight the diverse strategies that enteric pathogens can also use to take advantage of fibre-derived sources of nutrition. Indeed, EHEC utilises several strategies to achieve this. For example, sensing of pectin-derived galacturonic acid promotes initial expansion in the mouse gut while also directly regulating LEE expression throughout the infection lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. These studies collectively highlight the diverse strategies that enteric pathogens use to exploit the host diet and aid in overcoming colonisation resistance.</p><p id="P21">In summary, we have identified a new mechanism by which A/E enteric pathogens regulate an essential virulence factor in response to host associated <sc>L</sc>-arabinose and identified novel genes involved in its uptake from the environment. Our data reveal that important pathogenic processes can be controlled via central metabolism of sugars independently of any effects on growth, warranting a new perspective on this process and its potential impact in bacterial pathogens. We anticipate that by expanding our view of how nutrient “sensing” occurs via metabolism we have the potential to discover new mechanisms of bacterial virulence regulation that are highly relevant to the host context. While our studies using <italic>C. rodentium</italic> cannot rule out that <sc>L</sc>-arabinose metabolism may benefit EHEC on a nutritional level in certain contexts (such as during human infection), the results highlight how virulence factor regulation can provide additional benefits for overcoming colonisation resistance. Lastly, by identifying further functional distinctions between EHEC and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> (exemplified here by the EHEC-specific Aau), we may reveal genetic factors that dictate host-range of these human and murine pathogens exclusively.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Bacterial growth conditions</title><p id="P22">All bacterial strains used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.

QUAST v4.5 was used to assess the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly metrics generated from Shovill by comparing each draft assembly to strain EDL933<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. We identified and excluded the sequence data for certain strains from further analysis based on sequencing coverage being below 20-fold, the presence of contaminants, and the genome length from <italic>de novo</italic> assembly falling outside the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) 1.5 x interquartile range (i.e., &lt; 4,095,491 bp or &gt; 5,889,907 bp) (<italic>n</italic>=157). To assess the publicly available strains for the presence of strain mixtures, paired-end reads were mapped onto the chromosome of EDL933 using SPANDx to generate annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs) matrices. Heterozygous SNPs in each genome were identified from GATK UnifiedGenotyper VCF output. MLST v2.19.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tseemann/mlst">https://github.com/tseemann/mlst</ext-link>) with default settings was used to characterise the multi-locus sequence type (MLST) of the remaining 949 strains (<italic>n</italic>=948 excluding EDL933) against the <italic>E. coli</italic> MLST allelic profiles hosted on PubMLST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>.

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree from the non-recombinant SNP alignment was generated using RAxML v8.2.10 (GTR-GAMMA correction) thorough optimisation of 10 distinct, randomized maximum parsimony trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.

The amino acid sequences of the periplasmic binding protein (Z0415) (minus the predicted signal peptide), ATPase (Z0416-7) and two permease subunits (Z0418/Z0419) of Aau were provided and modelling was run in multimer mode, with a single molecule of each subunit requested. The quality of five ranked models produced by AlphaFold were assessed based on pLDDT score and compared for consistency with the top-ranked model used for further analysis and figure generation.</p><p id="P38">To identify ABC transporters closely related to Z0415-19, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the associate amino acid sequence. The ABC_tran_pfam domain (pfam00005) was searched against EHEC EDL933 using the IMG/M server ‘find function’ tool. The returned hits were then filtered based on the predicted substrates to select only those predicted to transport sugar substates. The amino acid sequences were then exported and aligned in MEGAX (V 10.1.8) using MUSCLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Le_Gascuel_2008 model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-11697.05) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+<italic>G</italic>, parameter = 1.6636)). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. This analysis involved 12 amino acid sequences. There were a total of 546 positions in the final dataset.
