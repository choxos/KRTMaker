We quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in human fetal pancreatic samples from donors aged 6 to 21 post-conception weeks. We found dramatic changes in DNA methylation across pancreas development, with &gt;21% of sites characterized as developmental differentially methylated positions (dDMPs) including many annotated to genes associated with monogenic diabetes. An analysis of DNA methylation in postnatal pancreas tissue showed that the dramatic temporal changes in DNA methylation occurring in the developing pancreas are largely limited to the prenatal period. Significant differences in DNA methylation were observed between males and females at a number of autosomal sites, with a small proportion of sites showing sex-specific DNA methylation trajectories across pancreas development. Pancreas dDMPs were not distributed equally across the genome, and were depleted in regulatory domains characterized by open chromatin and the binding of known pancreatic development transcription factors. Finally, we compared our pancreas dDMPs to previous findings from the human brain, identifying evidence for tissue-specific developmental changes in DNA methylation. To our knowledge, this represents the most extensive exploration of DNA methylation patterns during human fetal pancreas development, confirming the prenatal period as a time of major epigenomic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pancreas</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>fetal</kwd><kwd>monogenic diabetes</kwd><kwd>neonatal diabetes</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Development of the human pancreas is a highly intricate process requiring the precise temporal control of gene expression. The mature pancreas derives from two buds (dorsal and ventral) originating from the distal foregut endoderm and has both exocrine and endocrine functions reflecting distinct cellular lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The exocrine pancreas, responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes, is composed principally of acinar and ductal cells. The endocrine pancreas, assembled into Islets of Langerhans, contains α-cells, β-cells, δ-cells, ε-cells, and γ-cells (otherwise known as PP-cells) which each release specific hormones (glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide, respectively) that act to regulate blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The diversity of the cells within the maturing pancreas indicates a complex developmental pathway involving spatially- and temporally-coordinated changes in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), although the precise molecular mechanisms driving this process are not fully understood. Importantly, several diseases are known to result from aberrant development of the pancreas including maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes - monogenic disorders caused by pathogenic mutations in genes involved in coordinating pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the dynamic regulation of gene function during tissue development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The most extensively studied epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, the covalent addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon position of cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). DNA methylation is traditionally considered to repress local gene expression via disruption of transcription factor binding and the recruitment of methyl-binding proteins that initiate chromatin compaction and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Evidence suggests there is a more nuanced relationship between DNA methylation and transcription that is dependent on genomic and cellular context; DNA methylation in the gene body, for example, is often associated with increased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and has been implicated in other genomic functions including alternative splicing and promoter usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The establishment and maintenance of tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns is a crucial feature for mammalian development, and within the pancreas, DNA methylation plays a critical role in the specification of the endocrine and exocrine lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). To date, a systematic exploration of DNA methylation changes during human pancreas development has not been performed due to, at least in part, the paucity of tissue from fetal donors. Several studies have utilized human fetal pancreatic samples to characterize transcription factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and single cell gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) in the developing human pancreas, although these studies have focused on very early developmental stages and profiled only a limited number of samples. Our understanding of the genomic changes taking place during human pancreas development has therefore relied largely on extrapolations from animal model studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and pancreatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study we quantified DNA methylation across the genome in pancreas samples obtained from 99 fetal donors spanning 6 to 21 post-conception weeks (PCW) and 23 postnatal (adult) donors. We report dramatic changes in DNA methylation across human pancreas development, which are specific to the fetal period and distinct to age-associated changes in the postnatal pancreas. This is, to our knowledge, the most extensive study of DNA methylation across human fetal pancreas development and confirms the prenatal period as a time of considerable epigenomic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generating a high-quality DNA methylation dataset across human fetal pancreas development</title><p id="P6">We obtained flash-frozen 99 human fetal pancreas samples (43 male and 56 female) dissected from donors aged between 6 PCW (Carnegie stage (CS) 18) and 21 PCW from the Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hdbr.org/">https://www.hdbr.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). As expected, mean pancreas mass increased with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and immunohistochemical analysis of matched formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from a subset of donors (n = 10, aged 9 to 19 PCW, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>) was used to confirm the pancreatic origin of tissue from the HDBR prior to methylomic profiling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and Figure 1C</xref>).

We calculated a ‘DNA methylation age’ estimate for each sample using an epigenetic clock previously trained on fetal brain tissue and shown to be robustly associated with gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), finding a strong positive correlation between estimated age and actual developmental age (corr = 0.89, P = 8.31 x 10<sup>-35</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To enable a focus on sites annotated to genes we selected sites located in ‘promoter’ and ‘gene body’ regions characterized by variable DNA methylation, identifying discrete modules of co-methylated positions and used the first principal component of each individual module (the “module eigengene” (ME)) to assess their relationship with fetal pancreas development (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).

In all three cell types, regions of open chromatin were again characterized by an overall depletion of dDMPs driven by a highly significant depletion of hypermethylated dDMPs, mirroring the patterns seen in occupied transcription-factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). This depletion was particularly strong in delta cells where there was also an overall depletion of hypomethylated dDMPs (all dDMPs: odds ratio = 0.221, P &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>-308</sup>; hypermethylated dDMPs: odds ratio = 0.106, P &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>-308</sup>; hypomethylated dDMPs: odds ratio = 0.394, P &lt; 2.2 x 10<sup>-308</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A number of neonatal diabetes genes are enriched for dDMPs</title><p id="P15">Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes are monogenic disorders of the pancreas caused by pathogenic mutations in several genes, including those encoding many of the key transcription factors involved in coordinating pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).

DNA methylation at 8,131 (10.99%) of the tested pancreas dDMPs was significantly associated with development in the human brain at a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold (P &lt; 6.76 x 10<sup>-7</sup>).

A relatively large number of DMPs were also found to be specific to the developing pancreas; in total we found 55,402 pancreas DMPs (74.90%) that did not appear to be dynamically regulated in the developing brain (i.e., pancreas DMPs at which there was a non-significant mean change in proportion DNA methylation per PCW &lt;0.005 and &gt;-0.005 in the fetal brain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 19</xref>).

We profiled genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in pancreas samples from 99 fetal donors (43 male and 56 female) spanning 6 to 21 post conception weeks, and 23 postnatal (adult) pancreas samples (ages 34 to 80 years, 9 male and 14 female). Our data highlight that considerable epigenomic changes taking place in the human pancreas during fetal development, with significant changes in DNA methylation identified at over 21% of sites tested. The distribution of pancreas dDMPs was found to differ across genic regions, with notable depletion in CpG islands, regions of open chromatin and the binding sites of pancreatic transcription factors involved in pancreas development. The dramatic temporal changes in DNA methylation occurring in the developing pancreas were found to be limited to the prenatal period and be distinct to age-associated changes observed in the postnatal pancreas. Finally, we compared our data with those from a similar study on the developing human brain, finding both common developmental changes across tissues and tissue-specific trajectories of DNA methylation. This is, to our knowledge, the most extensive study of DNA methylation across human fetal pancreas development to date, confirming the prenatal period as a time of considerable epigenomic plasticity.</p><p id="P21">Distinct developmental patterns of DNA methylation were observed in several genomic regions. DNA methylation in CpG-rich areas were found to exhibit less variability during fetal pancreas development compared to other genomic regions. Moreover, although CpG-rich regions tend to have more hypermethylated dDMPs than hypomethylated dDMPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), the majority of dDMPs in the genome become hypomethylated as the pancreas develops. This observation is unsurprising considering that CpG islands play a role in stabilizing the expression of essential housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and reflects our previous observations in the developing human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We also investigated changes in DNA methylation within regulatory regions bound by specific islet transcription factors important for pancreas development and function (i.e. FOXA2, NKX2-2, NKX6-1, PDX1, MAFB, and CTCF). DNA methylation is known to disrupt the developmental binding of many transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), and therefore the progressive hypomethylation observed across these domains may orchestrate the complex patterns of gene expression crucial for pancreatic development and function. In particular, the binding of CTCF, which plays a crucial role in the developing pancreas by contributing to the establishment and regulation of chromatin architecture, gene expression and cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), is known to be highly anticorrelated with DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). These data support a critical role for developmental changes in DNA methylation during the differentiation of different pancreatic cell types, including those responsible for insulin production and glucose regulation.</p><p id="P22">We also investigated changes in DNA methylation across pancreas development in relation to sites annotated to genes associated with diseases of the pancreas including MODY and neonatal diabetes, finding that the vast majority of these genes contained at least one significant dDMP. Although MODY genes showed no enrichment for sites characterized exclusively by either increasing or decreasing DNA methylation across pancreatic development, there was a strong enrichment for sites to become hypermethylated in genomic regions annotated to neonatal diabetes genes. This is interesting given the role of aberrant pancreas development in the development of neonatal diabetes, a rare form of diabetes that presents in the first six months of life, and the fact that many of the genetic mutations that cause neonatal diabetes are known to disrupt normal pancreas development and function.</p><p id="P23">Our data may help elucidate novel mechanisms involved in diseases of the pancreas. One of the most significant dDMRs in our dataset, for example, was located within the <italic>LRBA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although <italic>LRBA</italic> mutations result in neonatal diabetes and additional autoimmune features diagnosed as early as six weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). These mutations are thought to cause diabetes through de-regulation of the immune system and there is little previous evidence to suggest a role for <italic>LRBA</italic> in the development of the pancreas. Our data reveals that there are dynamic changes in the epigenetic state of LRBA across pancreas development, with progressive hypermethylation across a discrete region within the gene. Not all cases of neonatal diabetes and MODY can be explained by identified coding mutations in the coding region of known genes and understanding the epigenomic changes occurring during fetal pancreas development could provide clues to the location of novel (potentially non-coding) functional genetic variants contributing to the etiology of these disorders.</p><p id="P24">There are several limitations to this study. First, legal restrictions on later-term abortions precluded the assay of pancreas tissue from later stages of fetal development. However, the observation that DNA methylation at dDMPs was relatively stable between the oldest fetal samples studied and postnatal (adult) pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) implies that the magnitude of epigenetic changes occurring later in pregnancy and during early postnatal life is much lower that was observed across early fetal development. Another limitation is that the tissue used in the present study was whole pancreas and our measurements of DNA methylation represent a composite of different cell types. This precludes us from exploring changes within specific cell-types in the developing pancreas, and future work should focus on profiling changes in purified cell-types. Third, although the Illumina EPIC array can accurately quantify DNA methylation at single-base resolution with probes associated with the majority of genes and CpG islands across the genome, the array targets only ~2% of the CpG sites in the human genome, and probes are not equally distributed across all genomic features. As costs diminish, future studies should employ sequencing-based genomic-profiling technologies to more thoroughly interrogate the epigenome across development in large numbers of samples. Fourth, no demographic or phenotypic information other than developmental age and sex was available for the samples assayed. Fifth, we do not have gene expression data from these samples and are therefore unable to make direct conclusions about the transcriptional consequences of the developmental changes in DNA methylation we observe. Finally, we are not able to distinguish between DNA methylation and its oxidized derivative, DNA hydroxymethylation, as standard sodium bisulfite approaches do not distinguish between these modifications. There is currently very limited information about the prevalence of hydroxymethylated DNA in the pancreas and future studies should aim to characterize this modification across fetal pancreas development using techniques capable of discriminating DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In conclusion we identify highly dynamic changes in DNA methylation occurring throughout the genome across human fetal pancreatic development. The dramatic temporal changes in DNA methylation occurring in the developing pancreas appear to be limited to the prenatal period and be distinct to age-associated changes observed in the postnatal pancreas. The majority of genes involved in neonatal diabetes and MODY were located proximal to sites showing developmental changes in DNA methylation, potentially providing novel insights into the developmental mechanisms involved in these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Human pancreas tissue samples</title><p id="P26">Human fetal tissues were obtained from the Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR).
