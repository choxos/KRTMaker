Here, using four polygenic risk scores for AD (PRS-AD) in a longitudinal adult lifespan sample aged 30 to 89 years (2-7 timepoints), we show that healthy individuals who lose brain volume faster than expected for their age, have a higher genetic AD risk. We first demonstrate PRS-AD associations with change in early Braak regions, namely hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala, and find evidence these extend beyond that predicted by <italic>APOE</italic> genotype. Next, following the hypothesis that brain changes in ageing and AD are largely shared, we performed machine learning classification on brain change trajectories conditional on age in longitudinal AD patient-control data, to obtain a list of AD-accelerated features and model change in these in adult lifespan data. We found PRS-AD was associated with a multivariate marker of accelerated change in many of these features in healthy adults, and that most individuals above ~50 years of age are on an accelerated change trajectory in AD-accelerated brain regions. Finally, high PRS-AD individuals also high on a multivariate marker of change showed more adult lifespan memory decline, compared to high PRS-AD individuals with less brain change. Our results support a dimensional account linking normal brain ageing with AD, suggesting AD risk genes speed up the shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration that starts early, occurs along a continuum, and tracks memory change in healthy adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lifespan neuroscience</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd><kwd>polygenic risk</kwd><kwd>cognitive decline</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Advanced age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) – the leading cause of dementia. Across healthy adult life and ageing, our brains undergo gradual and widespread structural changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Many of these changes are qualitatively similar to atrophy patterns seen in AD, suggesting shared vulnerability of brain systems in ageing and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. For example, medial temporal lobe regions including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are amongst the earliest affected regions in AD in terms of structural atrophy and tau deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and each exhibits accelerated structural loss from around ~50 years of age. Prior to this, many brain structures exhibit slow but steady average volume reduction from early adulthood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Beyond specific regions, whole-cortical atrophy patterns are also largely shared between ageing and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, with characteristic temporo-parietal atrophy patterns in AD also found to a lesser degree in healthy people, including those at low AD risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. It has been argued this parallel pattern is critical to understand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, because reported AD incidence increases exponentially after 65 years of age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">If brain regions vulnerable in AD also exhibit gradual change during adult life, healthy individuals at higher AD risk may show faster atrophy over extended age spans. Polygenic risk scores for AD (PRS-AD) calculated from AD risk variants found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a marker to test this; in AD patients, higher genetic AD risk links with longitudinal outcomes including faster brain and cognitive decline, earlier AD onset, and clinical progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In healthy adults, however, attempts to link genetic AD risk to alterations in brain structure have typically been cross-sectional and yielded mixed results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. For example, although many studies report no effect of <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> on cross-sectional hippocampal volumes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, recent large-scale studies found smaller hippocampal volumes in older <italic>ε4</italic> carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, evidence suggests smaller hippocampal volume as a function of genetic AD risk is evident in neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and longitudinal work suggests the effect of AD risk genes upon lower hippocampal volume is roughly equivalent from childhood to old age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Further, many 70-year-olds have similar size brain measures to many 30-year-olds, and individual differences in brain structure at any age typically exceed the magnitude of change effects through ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, brain differences observed in older at-risk individuals may be ascribable to preexisting differences from early life. Consequently, only longitudinal designs are suited to examine whether elevated genetic AD risk confers a direct genetic effect on the slope of brain ageing across the healthy adult lifespan.</p><p id="P6">Longitudinal studies attempting to link brain changes to genetic AD risk in healthy adults have been inconclusive, often restricted to small samples of older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, and lifespan samples of healthy individuals with extensive follow-up over large age-spans are lacking. Small studies have reported group-level effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> or no effect of <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> upon hippocampal change in healthy older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Another study found evidence that PRS-AD related to hippocampal and entorhinal thinning in an older sample enriched for <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> and memory concerns, though did not report polygenic effects beyond <italic>APOE</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, in a large sample of healthy older individuals, hippocampal change was found to be greater in <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> carriers (N=748)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, a recent GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (N=15,640) observed that an association between <italic>APOE</italic> and faster hippocampal and amygdala change in ageing disappeared when accounting for disease status (notably, the sample included many AD cases). Thus, the effect of <italic>APOE</italic> upon brain change in candidate AD regions was seemingly driven by disease-related processes and not detected in healthy brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, the trajectories of genetically high-risk versus low-risk groups provide little evidence that genetic AD risk affects the slope of brain decline across the adult lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Individualized estimates of the degree to which a healthy person’s brain is changing more or less than expected for their age may be better suited to answer whether genetic AD risk impacts the slope of brain ageing in healthy adults.</p><p id="P7">Regions with greater brain atrophy in AD are encompassed within the Braak staging scheme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This describes the spatiotemporal sequence of tau deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> – from a cortical entorhinal epicentre (stage I) to hippocampus (stage II), amygdala and inferior temporal cortex (stage III), and later to the rest of cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This “AD signature”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> is not specific to AD but also found to a lesser degree in normal ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Beyond this core set of regions with seemingly shared vulnerability to the effects of ageing and AD, many other brain features exhibit accelerated change in AD. Applying a data-driven approach to first delineate these in AD patients – combined with multivariate analyses using individualized brain change estimates in healthy adult lifespan data – may reveal new insights into whether genetic AD risk influences the slope of brain ageing in a select few or across many AD-relevant features in healthy adults.</p><p id="P8">Finally, several studies suggest that genetic AD risk is subtly related to longitudinal memory decline in healthy older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and one adult lifespan study reported genetic AD risk was weakly associated with decline in a composite cognitive and memory score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, AD risk genes may influence differences in memory decline trajectories that are protracted through life and begin in early adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which AD risk genes influence brain and cognitive outcomes probably differs also between individuals at comparatively high genetic risk, which may explain why genetic risk alone is not highly predictive of cognitive change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Given that individualized approaches to risk assessment are predicated on assessing the conjunction of risks, considering known genetic AD risk together with a brain risk marker may improve identification of individuals at higher AD risk, also in healthy adult lifespan data.</p><p id="P9">Here, in a healthy adult lifespan sample with frequent longitudinal follow-up, we establish that individuals changing more than their age would predict in AD-accelerated brain regions are at significantly enhanced genetic AD risk (2-7 timepoints, 1430 scans from 420 individuals aged 30 to 89 years). Using genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5×10<sup>-8</sup>) from four AD GWAS, we first 1) show that PRS-AD significantly associates with more age-relative change in early Braak stage regions. Next, to empirically identify brain features with accelerated change in AD, we run machine learning (ML) binary classification on the individual-specific slopes derived from longitudinal AD patient-control data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; scans = 4410, N = 978, 2-9 timepoints). Modelling change in these in our healthy adult lifespan sample, we 2) show that PRS-AD is significantly associated with change in many AD-accelerated brain features in healthy adults. In an independent replication sample with notably less follow-up (2-3 timepoints), we corroborate some of the observed PRS-AD associations with brain change in healthy adults. Last, we 3) show that high PRS-AD individuals also high on a multivariate brain change marker show greater drop-off in memory over the adult lifespan, compared to high PRS-AD individuals with less brain change. Thus, the conjunction of a multivariate brain change marker and known genetic risk helped identify a subset of individuals showing more memory decline over their healthy adult life (30-89 years).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Age-relative brain change across the healthy adult lifespan associates with genetic AD risk <italic>Univariate analyses: A priori ROI’s</italic></title><p id="P10">To estimate age-relative brain change in adult lifespan data, we used all longitudinal scans fitting age-range and inclusion criteria (≥30 years of age; Methods). This allowed us to obtain the best-fitting age trajectory models from which we could subsequently estimate how much an individual’s change trajectory deviated from the population-average (i.e., from the level of change predicted given age), via individual-specific random slopes in a Generalized Additive Mixed Model of age (Methods). We first explored brain change in initial hippocampal ROI’s – Braak Stage II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref> shows the longitudinal lifespan trajectory, and individual-specific degree of absolute and age-relative change for the left hippocampus (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref> for right hippocampus). As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, most individuals aged ≥30 years exhibited hippocampal volume loss, but to differing degrees, and very few individual-specific slopes were estimated to show growth over time. As also expected, the degree of absolute hippocampal change accelerated on average between the ages of 50 and 60 years. The degree of age-relative change was significantly associated with PRS-AD in the hypothesized negative direction: on average across the adult lifespan (30-89 years), individuals exhibiting more hippocampal loss than expected given their age had significantly higher PRS-AD. This genetic association was probed separately for the bilateral hippocampi (left: β = -.22, t(212) = -3.3, <italic>p</italic>=.001; right: β = -.16, t = 2.4, <italic>p</italic>=.015; [PRS-AD Jansen]; covariates: mean age, sex, N timepoints, and interval between first and last timepoint), and was significant using all four GWAS-derived scores. To ensure we were capturing ageing-specific effects at some point (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref>), we tested the association using change rates extracted from progressively older age-ranges (i.e., progressively discarding data from comparatively younger individuals; Methods). This also ensured that the analysis outcome was not based on a single arbitrary decision such as the age range to test the average association across<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. FDR-correction was applied across all 576 PRS-AD tests reported in this analysis. We then tested whether surviving associations remained statistically significant at p&lt;.05 using polygenic scores computed without <italic>APOE</italic> (PRS-AD<sup>noAPOE</sup>), assuming a 5% chance false positive rate per structure. Despite the progressively smaller sample size, all tested PRS-AD associations with age-relative hippocampal change (left and right) were significant at p&lt;.05 [uncorrected] using all four scores (coloured points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-F</xref> denote associations at p&lt;.05 [uncorrected]; see lower panels for respective effect sizes). 31 of the 36 tests (86%) with age-relative left hippocampal change, and 25/36 (69%) with age-relative right hippocampal change, survived FDR-correction (see lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E-F</xref>; partial r<sup>2</sup> effect size is shown for associations surviving FDR-correction). Using PRS-AD to predict absolute hippocampal change instead in comparable statistical models (i.e., also correcting for mean age), PRS-AD associations were also mostly significant after FDR correction (47/72 [65%] survived correction).

Thus, we sought to empirically obtain a list of brain features with accelerated change in AD, then test whether multivariate change across these features relates to PRS-AD in the LCBC healthy adult lifespan discovery sample (Methods). First, in longitudinal AD patient-control data from ADNI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 2</xref>), we defined two longitudinal groups we could be maximally confident consisted of healthy individuals and those succumbing to AD based on diagnosis: <italic>NC-long</italic> consisted of normal controls consistently classed as healthy over time, whereas <italic>AD-long</italic> comprised all individuals with an AD diagnosis by their final timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; Methods).

As hypothesized, 14 of the 36 tested associations relating PC1<sup>relChange</sup> to PRS-AD were FDR-corrected significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>; FDR-correction applied across all 144 PRS-AD tests in this analysis). Again, post-hoc tests confirmed that the estimated regression coefficients became stronger as the age subset comprised only older individuals (beta reduction = -.023, t = -9.9, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>perm</italic></sub> = .002) and alternative analyses across the full age-range found post-corrected significant PRS-AD × age (mean) interactions upon PC1<sup>relChange</sup> using all four scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 3</xref>). Next, to determine the age at which brain change in AD-accelerated features starts increasing in healthy adults, we took the principal component of absolute change across the same set of 50 features (PC1<sup>absChange</sup>; explaining 45% variance) plotted as a function of mean age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Further, change trajectories were steepest in features most important for separating AD-patients from controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 6</xref>). To ensure that the multivariate associations were not driven by one or a few brain features, we ran a sliding window PCA within the 50-89 year age-range (Methods). PRS-AD associations with age-relative change were evident when calculating PC1 across many combinations of features, including those relatively lower down in terms of model importance (coloured bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> denote feature windows for the PCA and link with the coloured points denoting p-values for the PRS-AD associations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 7</xref> for correlations between features). 13 of the tested associations were significant after FDR correction, illustrating that multivariate change across many AD-accelerated features relates to PRS-AD in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

This prediction incorporates information from the weights of all 364 features (Methods). The dependent variable was the model-implied log odds of having AD (probAD<sup>relChange</sup>; Methods). Importantly, because the model was trained on an index of relative brain change conditional on age, the logistic prediction applied to the healthy adult lifespan data cannot be interpreted in terms of its implied binary outcome (i.e., AD/no-AD). This is because the model could assign the same probability of having AD to a hypothetical 30-year-old with an estimated additional brain loss of 10mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>/year as to a 60-year-old with the same additional brain loss, even though change and AD risk are higher in the 60-year-old, because change is over and above the mean brain loss anticipated at age 60 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We nevertheless hypothesized the learned model weights would be useful, and would relate to PRS-AD in a similar way to the raw age-relative change values in specific features.

We hypothesized that high PRS-AD individuals also showing more age-relative change in AD-accelerated features would exhibit more longitudinal memory decline (pink quadrant 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>; Methods). Akin to the brain analysis, memory-change estimates were derived via the individual-specific random slopes in a GAMM of age, and we used longitudinal memory observations from the full adult lifespan sample to optimize memory-change estimates in the subset of participants that also had genetic data (Methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-C</xref> shows the longitudinal lifespan trajectory, and individual-specific degree of absolute and age-relative change in memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; PC1 across subtests).

However, that study primarily used a PRS-AD constructed with many more SNP’s (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>), and did find some, albeit inconsistent, evidence for a slope effect using the same SNP association p-value as here.

To our knowledge, we are the first to document accelerated amygdala decline in healthy adults harbouring more AD risk variants. Still, while amygdala effects were clear in the discovery sample – currently the most densely sampled MRI dataset for longitudinal lifespan follow-up – these did not replicate in an independent sample with less follow-up, hence this awaits replication. Regardless, in healthy ageing as in AD, medial temporal lobe structures exhibit early vulnerability to structural loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, highest expression of top AD risk genes (e.g., <italic>APOE, BIN1, CLU</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>), and we find PRS-AD influences accelerated change in these structures in healthy adults.

Critical questions concern what mechanisms underlie the shared vulnerability of these structures to lifespan influences and AD, which in the presence of AD risk genes speed up normal age-related neurodegeneration.

Likely, our unique approach to link AD changes to normal ageing benefitted from using multivariate analyses across change data in healthy adults. We also found that ML models trained on longitudinal change in AD can be applied to healthy adult lifespan data and the prediction relates to PRS-AD. This seemed to work best when the model was trained on estimates of change conditional on age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 5</xref>), likely because this places often extreme change values in AD on a scale more comparable across ages, and because modelling relative change in AD versus controls enables identification of features exhibiting a quantitative difference in change despite the presence of a similar qualitative pattern. That our patient-control groups were based on two extremes (consistently healthy versus becoming AD) only further emphasizes the difference lies more in degree than kind, as does the fact that our ML model also captured 100% of independent AD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).

Hence, our change marker provided crucial information for detecting comparatively at-risk individuals in healthy adult lifespan data, beyond that provided by genetic risk alone. These results support and extend previous studies finding PRS-AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> or <italic>APOE-ε4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> relates to longitudinal memory decline across adult life, and possibly shed light on why reported associations are often weak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> or absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. They also underscore the need for follow-up data over extended age-spans when the goal is early prediction or prevention of AD. Future research should examine the biological and exposure-related factors that lead some high PRS-AD individuals to decline more in brain and memory where others remain resilient, as well as combine multivariate change with other biomarkers (e.g., tau, inflammation, or amyloid) as we move towards a future of individualized risk assessment.</p><p id="P25">Our study has several strengths. First, our longitudinal marker of individual-specific brain change circumvents the drawbacks of other approaches attempting to capture interindividual differences in brain ageing – such as brain age models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> – which do not necessarily relate to longitudinal change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Second, we used the full breadth of the adult lifespan data to estimate individual-specific brain and memory change, each in a single model, using all longitudinal scans. This likely optimized the change estimates for all, including the subset with genetic data, likely in part due to improved age trajectory modelling from which one can subsequently estimate the deviation of an individual’s change trajectory. This is exemplified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 9</xref>, wherein we found PRS-AD-change associations in the same individuals in the BETULA study improved when their individual-specific slopes were estimated together with NESDA study data, compared to when estimated in BETULA data alone. Further, largely to ensure we were capturing ageing-specific processes at some point (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref>), we allowed the data to be increasingly comprised of only older individuals and repeatedly tested PRS-AD associations with change. As inferences based on significance are affected by arbitrary analysis choices, we took inspiration from multiverse methods to systematically define a defensible set of analysis choices to perform analyses across<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In our case, the principle arbitrary covariate was the age-range to test the association across, and the influence of this arbitrary choice on statistical significance is made clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, despite accounting for age- and time-related covariates. Adopting this approach, we could ensure capture of ageing-specific processes, document the stability of PRS-AD-change associations in healthy adults, and ensure the results were independent of a single arbitrary decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, thus increasing their robustness.</p><p id="P26">There are also limitations. First, our approach disregards heterogeneity in ageing or AD-related atrophy; we considered all individuals obtaining an AD diagnosis over time as a single group, contrasting their average change against all consistently healthy individuals. For our purpose of delineating features with faster aver-age change in AD, this was reasonable, as there may be a predominant AD atrophy pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> and it is this that overlaps with the average ageing pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, as there are known AD subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, an important question is whether individual variability in AD atrophy presentation traces to heterogeneity in brain change in healthy adults. Second, as with most large-scale brain studies, we relied on FreeSurfer-derived measures. While these are well-validated and reliable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, it is possible measures such as entorhinal cortex may be less reliable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. Indeed, that we observed no PRS-AD associations with left entorhinal change was surprising, and possibly manual entorhinal tracing may have led to different results. Third, longitudinal lifespan studies inevitably culminate in unrepresentative samples comprised of a higher proportion of cognitively high-performers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Since even in healthy adults we find variation in brain ageing slopes that maps onto AD-related genetic variation and memory outcomes, it is possible the population effect-sizes may be larger. Fourth, we used only structural MRI measures sensitive to detecting small changes in brain structure that ultimately form a continuous, lifelong process of change. Including additional imaging or biomarkers will help refine detection of AD-risk in healthy adults. Finally, we do not know which individuals included here will be diagnosed with AD later in life. While our analyses suggest one could assign differential transition probabilities to healthy individuals, only time and follow-up data will tell.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P27">In conclusion, brain ageing trajectories in healthy adults are robustly altered by the presence of AD risk genes, in many brain features, and beyond <italic>APOE</italic>. We show brain features most susceptible to faster deterioration in AD are on a trajectory of accelerated change from age ~50 in healthy individuals, and that models trained on AD patients can be applied to adult lifespan data and the prediction relates to genetic AD risk in healthy adults. Finally, genetically at-risk individuals also high on a marker of brain change showed more adult lifespan memory decline, compared to genetically at-risk individuals with less brain change – suggesting our brain change marker enhanced the value of already knowing an individual’s genetic risk. AD risk genes are likely not AD-specific, but induce variation in the speed of the shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration along a continuum in healthy adults. Our results call for a dimensional approach to late-onset AD as not being clearly distinct from normal brain ageing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Methods Samples</title><sec id="S13"><title>Age-relative change estimation</title><sec id="S14"><title>Adult lifespan discovery sample</title><p id="P28">After applying exclusion criteria (see below), an exclusively longitudinal adult lifespan sample (minimum two timepoints) comprising 1430 scans from 420 healthy individuals aged 30 to 89 years (248 females; mean age [SD] = 63.7 [14.4]; 2-7 timepoints [median = 3]; follow-up range = .15 - 11.1 years) was drawn from the Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition database (LCBC; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo; see SI Note).

We specified random intercepts and slopes for each participant. This enabled fitting an individual-specific linear model (level and slope) across all of their timepoints, to estimate how each person’s slope as a function of age deviates from the average nonlinear estimation. For an age model of e.g., hippocampus, random slopes are interpretable as the extent of additional (or reduced) hippocampal change an individual exhibits relative to the predicted change given their age (taking other covariates into consideration). Hence, we refer to this as an estimate of “age-relative change”. To partition unique variance associated with individual-specific slope, the estimation requires that a number of participants have three or more timepoints, although estimates are also produced for participants with fewer, but then are drawn from a population distribution more skewed towards the sample mean <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup>.

We tested the associations between PRS-AD (4 scores; tested separately) and age-relative change with progressively older age-ranges (i.e., 30-89, 35-89, 40-89 … 70-89). The reasons for this were threefold. First, because some brain features were estimated to have more negative individual-specific slopes in younger adults compared with middle-age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref>), we could not test the association across the entire age-range (30-89) and ensure we were capturing only ageing-specific processes. Second, it enabled assessing the stability of PRS-AD associations detectable in adult lifespan data (note that older age-ranges correspond to smaller sample sizes). Third, because empirical outcomes are influenced by arbitrary analysis decisions, we took inspiration from multiverse methods that attempt to reduce such bias by testing associations across a set of theoretically justified alternatives <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

We also ran post-hoc tests to confirm that the PRS-AD-change estimates became more negative as the age subset steadily comprised only older individuals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Here, we used the pre-computed beta estimates from all PRS-AD-change models (age-relative and absolute; all four scores) as response variable, and the age-range as predictor (coded 0-8), and tested the linear effect of age-range upon the PRS-AD beta estimates (main effect across change models). The observed coefficient thus represents the strengthening of the negative PRS-AD-change association for each increasing age subset. Next, we permuted the empirical p-value for this observed association, by generating a null distribution across 1000 random permutations of the age variable (mean age) in the PRS-AD change associations, then recalculating the effect of age-range (randomized) upon the PRS-AD beta estimates.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Multivariate analyses: data-driven features exhibiting accelerated change in AD Machine learning model in AD</title><p id="P38">We repeated the procedure to estimate age-relative change in ADNI data, fitting a GAMM of age across <italic>NC-long</italic> and <italic>AD-long</italic> groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; covariates: sex, field strength). To guard against overfitting the age trajectories and account for the roughly three-decade drop in age coverage in the AD datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 2</xref>), we reduced the number of knots in the GAMM to 5.

Hyperparameters were chosen using 10-fold cross validation across 500 random combinations of the following possible parameter values: nrounds (100 – 600, step = 50), eta (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2), max_depth (2-8, step = 1), gamma (0.5 – 1.5, step = 0.5), min_child_weight (1 – 4, step = 1). To reduce the risk of overfitting to the training data and increase generalizability, we selected the final hyperparameters based on the mean AUC obtained across the 500 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation, where each iteration logged the maximum AUC achieved across folds (final hyperparameters: nrounds = 500, eta = 0.2, max_depth = 5, gamma = 1, min_child_weight = 1).

First, we took the principal component across the four PRS-AD scores (PC1<sup>PRS-AD</sup>; explaining 87%), and used the association between PC1<sup>PRS-AD</sup> and the principal component across the first 50 AD-accelerated features (here including hippocampal and amygdala volumes), to divide individuals into quadrant groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>; pink group denotes individuals high on both risk factors). Second, from the full adult lifespan discovery sample described above (N = 420; scans = 1430), we identified those with observations on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>. Of these, we discarded individuals with non-usable memory data (due to being part of on-off memory training projects at LCBC; see SI Note 1 for information on the projects that comprised the LCBC sample). In the resulting data (713 observations from 267 individuals), we took the principal component across the three main CVLT subtests (learning, immediate, and delayed free recall; scaled) to index general memory, expressed the loadings as a proportion of the maximum loading, and kept only those with longitudinal memory observations (707 observations from 261 individuals). Then, we ran a GAMM of age on Memory (sex corrected, knots = 8). Akin to the brain analysis, age-relative memory change was estimated via the random slopes, and absolute memory change was calculated by adding the slopes to the first derivative of the GAMM average age trajectory. Having estimated memory change using as many longitudinal CVLT observations as possible – 108 individuals had both memory change and genetic data (i.e., were included in the quadrant-groups). Finally, we tested our hypothesis that the high brain change-high PRS-AD group would exhibit more adult lifespan memory decline, setting this group to the intercept, in linear models of quadrant-group on memory change, correcting for group differences in mean age, sex, N timepoints, interval between first and last timepoint, and <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> carriership (main model). These were tested using both age-relative and absolute memory change. Alternative models correcting for the number of <italic>APOE-ε4</italic> alleles, baseline memory, PC1<sup>PRS-AD</sup>, and PC1<sup>relChange1-50</sup>, were also run.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189622-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d80aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Scripts were run on the Colossus processing cluster at the University of Oslo, and on resources provided by UNINETT Sigma2 (project NN9769K).

X-axis denotes the scan observations across timepoints used in the final sample. Each line represents a participant and colour denotes longitudinal group membership. Single-timepoint ADNI diagnoses (Y-axis; NC normal controls, MCI mild cognitive impairment, AD Alzheimer’s disease) were used to define two longitudinal groups of AD and NC individuals (AD-long; N = 606, obs = 2730; NC-long, N = 372; obs = 1680). <italic>NC-long</italic> individuals were classified as healthy at every timepoint whereas <italic>AD-long</italic> individuals were diagnosed with AD by their final timepoint (Methods). Single-timepoint MCI diagnoses were considered only for the purpose of defining the longitudinal AD group. Note that because the grouping used all diagnosis observations (i.e., not only scan observations), trajectories of individuals that appear to end with a NC or MCI diagnosis nevertheless correspond to individuals with an AD diagnosis by their final timepoint, as do those seemingly reverting (Methods). <bold>b</bold> GAMMs of Age (across groups; upper plot) were used to model age-relative change (individual-specific slopes) in 364 brain features (shown for one example feature).
