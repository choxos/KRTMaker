However, heavily mutated variants such as Omicron and its sublineages, which are characterized by an ever increasing number of mutations in the RBD, have rendered prior antibody therapies ineffective, leaving no clinically approved antibody treatments for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the capacity of therapeutic antibody candidates to bind and neutralize current and prospective SARS-CoV-2 variants is a critical factor for drug development. Here, we present a deep learning-guided approach to identify antibodies with enhanced resistance to SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We apply deep mutational learning (DML), a machine learning-guided protein engineering method to interrogate a massive sequence space of combinatorial RBD mutations and predict their impact on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and antibody escape. A high mutational distance library was constructed based on the full-length RBD of Omicron BA.1, which was experimentally screened for binding to the ACE2 receptor or neutralizing antibodies, followed by deep sequencing. The resulting data was used to train ensemble deep learning models that could accurately predict binding or escape for a panel of therapeutic antibody candidates targeting diverse RBD epitopes. Furthermore, antibody breadth was assessed by predicting binding or escape to synthetic lineages that represent millions of sequences generated using <italic>in silico</italic> evolution, revealing combinations with complementary and enhanced resistance to viral evolution. This deep learning approach may enable the design of next-generation antibody therapies that remain effective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the rapid discovery, development and clinical approval of several antibody therapies. The monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 (bamlanavimab) (Eli Lilly)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and the combination therapy consisting of REGN10933 (casirivimab) and REGN10987 (imdevimab) (Regeneron)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> were among the first to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the United States FDA in late 2020. The primary mechanism of action for these therapies consist of virus neutralization by binding to specific epitopes of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, thus inhibiting viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Beta, Gamma and Delta, each characterized by numerous mutations in the RBD, exhibited reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, including LY-CoV555<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, whose EUA was subsequently revoked. Of note, antibody combination therapies such as those from Regeneron and Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555+LY-CoV16 (etesevimab)) were more resilient to viral variants and maintained their EUA throughout most of 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, the emergence and rapid spread of Omicron BA.1 in late 2021, a variant which has a staggering 35 mutations in the S protein, 15 of which are in the RBD resulted in substantial escape from nearly all clinically approved antibody therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This includes the combination therapies from Regeneron and Eli Lilly, which also had their EUAs subsequently revoked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Even antibody therapies with exceptional breadth, which were initially discovered against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (Wu-Hu-1) and retained neutralizing activity against BA.1 – S309 (sotrovimab) (GSK/Vir)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab) (Eli Lilly)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> – lost efficacy against subsequent Omicron sublineages (e.g., BA.2, BA.4/5, and BQ.1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and had their clinical use authorization revoked. Despite there being a critical need for antibody therapies for the protection of at-risk populations (young children, the elderly, individuals with chronic illnesses, and those with weakened immune systems)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, since March 2023, there are no antibody therapies with an active clinical authorization for COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The ephemeral clinical life span of COVID-19 antibody therapies has emphasized that, in addition to established metrics for antibody therapeutics (e.g. neutralization potency, affinity, and developability)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, it is imperative to evaluate antibody breadth (ability of an antibody to bind to divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants) at early stages of clinical development. This may enable selection of lead candidates that have the most potential to maintain activity against a rapidly mutating SARS-CoV-2. To address this, high-throughput protein engineering techniques such as deep mutational scanning (DMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> have been extensively employed to profile the impact of single position mutations in the RBD on ACE2-binding and antibody escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While DMS has proven effective for profiling single mutations, many SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged possess multiple mutations in the RBD. For example the aforementioned Omicron BA.1 lineage, or the recently identified BA.2.86, which possesses an astonishing 13 RBD mutations relative to its closest Omicron variant (BA.2) and 26 RBD mutations relative to ancestral Wu-Hu-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Experimental screening of combinatorial RBD mutagenesis libraries (e.g., using yeast surface display) vastly undersamples the theoretical protein sequence space, therefore computational approaches are increasingly being employed in concert. For instance, experimental measurements such as DMS data have been used to calculate statistical estimators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> or to train machine learning models that make predictions on ACE2 binding and antibody escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. While such computational tools enable interrogation of a larger mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2, their primary reliance on datasets that largely consist of single mutations from DMS experiments limits their ability to capture the effects of combinatorial mutations, especially in the context of high mutational variants such as Omicron sublineages (e.g., BA.1, BA.4/5, BA.2.86).</p><p id="P5">Here, we apply deep mutational learning (DML), which combines yeast display screening, deep sequencing and machine learning to address the emergence of Omicron BA.1 and its many sublineages. We expand the scope of DML from screening short, focused mutagenesis libraries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> to screening combinatorial libraries spanning the entire RBD for binding to ACE2 or binding/escape from antibodies. Ensemble deep learning models utilizing dilated residual network blocks were trained with deep sequencing data and shown to make accurate predictions for ACE2 binding and antibody escape. Next, deep learning was used to determine the breadth of second-generation antibodies (with known binding to BA.1) across a massive sequence landscape of BA.1-derived synthetic lineages, allowing the rational selection of specific antibody combinations that optimally cover the RBD mutational sequence space. This approach provides a powerful tool to guide the selection of antibody therapies that have enhanced resistance to both current and future high mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design and construction of a high distance Omicron BA.1 RBD library</title><p id="P6">A mutagenesis library was constructed based on BA.1, covering the entire 201 amino acid (aa) RBD region (positions 331 - 531 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein). To maximize the interrogated RBD sequence space, the library design was entirely synthetic and unbiased, as it did not consider evolutionary data or previous experimental findings. For the construction of the library, the RBD sequence was split into 11-12 fragments, each with an approximate length of 48 nucleotides (nt) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For each fragment, 136 different single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) were designed, where each ssODN had either one codon or all combinations of two codons replaced by fully degenerate NNK codons (N = A, G, C, or T; K = G or T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) (Methods). For each fragment, ssODNs were amplified using PCR to generate double-stranded DNA. Each fragment was flanked by recognition sites for the type II-S restriction enzyme BsmBI, thus enabling assembly into full-length RBD regions by Golden Gate assembly (GGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. GGA utilizes type II-S restriction enzymes capable of cleaving DNA outside their recognition sequence, thereby allowing the resulting DNA overhangs to have any sequence. Based on the overhangs, individual fragments were assembled by DNA ligase to full-length RBD sequences with high fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The restriction sites were eliminated during the process, thus enabling scarless assembly of full length RBD sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This approach yielded approximately 98% correctly assembled RBD sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Since GGA required four nt homology between individual fragments for ligation, this led to portions of the sequence which needed to remain constant, thereby restricting library diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation, four sub-libraries were designed and individually assembled. Using sub-library 1 as a reference, sub-library 2 is shifted by 12 nt, sub-library 3 by 24 nt and sub-library 4 by 36 nt. These sub-libraries provided an increase in the mutational space covered by the RBD combinatorial mutagenesis library, since at the GGA homology for a given library, the remaining three libraries can have mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The current read length of Illumina does not allow coverage of the entire RBD with a single sequencing read (paired-end). Therefore, two separate sequencing libraries (seq-library A and B) were individually constructed. The seq-library A and B possessed mutations in positions 331 - 475 and 386 - 531, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The seq-libraries were constructed separately but all subsequent steps were performed in a pooled fashion. Following deep sequencing, complete mutational coverage for each residue was observed in both seq-libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Interestingly, the mutational frequency is somewhat variable across the seq-libraries, showing a marked decrease in mutations every 16 residues. The low mutational frequencies line up with GGA homologies of sub-library 1. We hypothesize that when pooling the sub-libraries, sub-library 1 was more prominent than the other sub-libraries and therefore less mutations at these sites are observed.</p><p id="P8">Next, to optimize the number of mutations per RBD sequence, titration of the fragment assembly step was performed. Wild-type (WT) fragments (BA.1 sequence) and fragments with one and two mutations respectively were pooled in different ratios for assembly. Separately, assembly was performed with 60%, 70% and 80% of WT fragments, with the remaining percentage split evenly between fragments with one and two mutations. Deep sequencing of these libraries revealed a clear trend in mutational distribution based on the different ratios, highlighting the tunable nature of our approach. Based on these results, all subsequent work was carried out using the 60% WT library as it has the highest mean number of mutations, therefore providing an appropriate approximation for extensively mutated Omicron sublineages.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Screening RBD libraries for ACE2 binding and antibody escape</title><p id="P9">Co-transformation of yeast cells (<italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> strain EBY100) using the PCR amplified RBD library and linearized plasmid yielded more than 2 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> transformants (Methods). Yeast surface display of RBD variants was achieved through C-terminal fusion to Aga2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Next, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate yeast cells expressing RBD variants that either retained binding or completely lost binding to dimeric soluble human ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, RBD variants with only partial binding to ACE2 were not isolated, as such intermediate populations could not be confidently classified as either binding or non-binding. Removing these variants is essential to obtain cleanly labeled datasets for training supervised machine learning models.</p><p id="P10">Since binding to ACE2 is a prerequisite for cell entry and subsequent viral replication, only this population is biologically relevant. Thus, only the ACE2-binding population was used in following FACS sorts to isolate RBD variants that either retained binding or completely lost binding (escape) activity to a panel of eight neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The antibodies selected target different epitopes, and are well characterized for their neutralizing activity to BA.1 and its sublineages, which provide a good internal control to assess the accuracy of our method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The panel consists of the following antibodies: A23-58.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, COV2-2196<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, Brii-198<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, ZCB11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, 2-7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, S2X259<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, ADG20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, and S2H97<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Following ACE2 and monoclonal antibody sorting, pure populations of RBD variants (binding and non-binding) were subjected to deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Reads covering the RBD sequence were then extracted from the NGS data and heatmaps were constructed depicting binding scores (relative aa frequencies per position in the RBD of binding vs non-binding variants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The heatmaps demonstrate nearly complete coverage of mutations across the RBD within all sorted populations. A heterogeneous distribution of mutations is observed for ACE2 binding, with no specific positions or mutations showing dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This agrees with previous studies that suggest the Q498R and N501Y mutations present in BA.1 exhibit strong epistatic effects that compensate for many mutations that cause loss of binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. In contrast, for certain antibodies, clear mutational patterns could be observed, including escape mutations that correspond with previous DMS studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). For example, RBD escape variants for Brii-198 are enriched for mutations in positions 346 and 452 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which are present in BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5, respectively and correspond to previous work that shows they drive a drastic loss of binding to Brii-198<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, enrichment of these escape mutations are not observed for antibody 2-7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), even though Brii-198 and 2-7 share a similar epitope, suggesting that the binding modality between these two antibodies are different, which is also reflected by their difference in resistance to Omicron variants (e.g., 2-7 shows strong binding to BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5, while Brii-198 does not bind BA.2.12 and BA.4/BA.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Similarly, the F486V mutation, which has been demonstrated to drastically reduce the neutralization potency of ZCB11 by over 2000-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, is highly enriched in the RBD escape population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). These mutations are also seen in A23-58.1 and COV2-2196, which bind to a similar epitope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Lastly, for ADG20, we observe a high enrichment of escape mutations in 408(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>); this position is also mutated in BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 variants, which have been shown to have drastically reduced neutralization by ADG20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">While heatmap analysis allows specific mutational patterns to be linked with antibody escape profiles, the high-dimensional nature – and potentially higher order impact – of combinatorial mutations is not reflected in this format. It is apparent that protein epistasis and combinatorial mutations can modify the effect of known escape mutations, either amplifying or reducing antibody binding. For example, individual RBD mutations (G339D, S371F, S373P, S375, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H) in BA.1 and BA.1.1 do not enhance escape to COV2-2196, with each mutation causing an average fold reduction of 2.2, but together cause over 200-fold reduction in neutralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Conversely, the introduction of the single R493Q mutation in BA.2 substantially rescued the neutralizing activities of Brii-198, REGN10933, COV2-2196 and ZCB11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, while the heatmaps indicate specific mutational contributions to antibody escape, other techniques such as deep learning are required to capture the high-dimensional nature of combinatorial mutations, and generalize to future mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Deep learning ensemble models accurately predict ACE2 binding and antibody escape</title><p id="P13">To address the high dimensionality of our dataset and to understand epistatic effects between mutations in the full RBD mutational sequence space, which is far too vast to be comprehensively screened experimentally, we trained deep learning ensemble models. Deep sequencing data from FACS-isolated yeast populations underwent pre-processing and quality filtering prior to being used as training data for machine learning. In the datasets for all antibodies, using the BA.1 RBD sequence as a reference, the mean rate of mutations ranged between ED two (ED<sub>2</sub>) and three ED<sub>3</sub>, with a max ED<sub>8</sub> (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">6</xref>). Following nucleotide to protein translation, one-hot encoding was performed to convert aa sequences into an input matrix for machine and deep learning models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Supervised machine learning models were trained to predict the probability (<italic>P</italic>) that a specific RBD sequence will bind to ACE2 or a given antibody. A higher <italic>P</italic> signifies a stronger correlation with binding, whereas a lower <italic>P</italic> corresponds to non-binding (escape). The machine learning models tested included K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (Log Reg), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Additionally, as a baseline for deep learning models, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was also tested. Finally, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by ProtCNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, which leverages residual neural network blocks and dilated convolutions to learn global information across the full RBD sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Each model was trained using an 80/10/10 train-validate-test split of data. Inputs were one-hot encoded RBD sequences, with the CNN using a 2D matrix and others using a 1D flattened vector. For initial benchmarking, a collection of different baseline machine learning models were trained on each dataset with hyperparameter optimization through random search, and were evaluated with 5-fold cross validation based on several common metrics (accuracy, F1, MCC, precision and recall). In the baseline machine learning models, class balancing was achieved by random subsampling from the majority class. Unsampled majority class sequences were set aside and merged with the held-out test set for use in model evaluation. Following training, most of the baseline models resulted in relatively high accuracy scores (0.7-0.9) across all datasets, however for smaller datasets (under 20,000 sequences) substantially lower values of F1 (0.2-0.3) and MCC (0.2-0.4) were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, the baseline MLP and CNN deep learning models performed substantially better, including large improvements in F1 and MCC scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). While in most cases, the MLP models resulted in relatively high MCC scores (up to &gt; 0.9), CNN models performed substantially better, with MCC scores up to 0.15 higher than MLPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Having determined that the CNN models performed superior to the machine learning models and MLP, we next applied an exhaustive hyperparameter search on CNN models to optimize their performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Training data was balanced through rejection sampling, while the held-out test set remained imbalanced to accurately evaluate F1 and MCC scores. To prevent data leakage during training, the held-out test set was fixed and multiple models were trained on different training-validation splits of the remaining dataset to make sure each model learned slightly different parameters of the data. When tested on the held-out test set, the final models yielded robust predictive performance up to an ED of eight from the WT BA.1 sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For our final ensemble, we selected three CNN models from each library with the highest MCC scores to generate the predicted labels for each variant through majority voting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In short, each model outputs <italic>P</italic> of binding for each input sequence, and labels are assigned based on a threshold. Here, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.75 was classified as binding, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.25 was classified as non-binding (escape), and those in between were labeled as “uncertain”. The final classification label was taken as the majority label across the three models. An RBD variant was assigned a predicted “escape” label if either the ensemble models of seq-library A or seq-library B predicted escape, and assigned a predicted “binding” label only if both models predicted binding. This leads to a more conservative prediction of antibody binding to variants, and minimizes false-positives. We tested the performance of the ensemble models on published experimental data of antibody binding (or neutralization) to Omicron sublineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. In general, the ensemble model predictions performed well, assigning accurate labels to over 80% of the antibody-variant pairs, with only four mis-classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Three of these mis-classifications were false-negatives, which is likely due to the more conservative approach used for binding classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary File</xref>).

While antibody breadth is normally evaluated retroactively based on neutralization or binding to previously observed variants, here we aimed to leverage this machine learning-guided protein engineering approach to prospectively characterize and assess the breadth of antibodies against Omicron variants that may emerge in the future. This was achieved by generating synthetic lineages stemming from BA.1. Since the potential sequence space of combinatorial RBD mutations is exceedingly massive, it was necessary to reduce this to a relevant subspace, therefore mutational probabilities were calculated across the RBD using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing data (available on Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data, GISAID [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org">www.gisaid.org</ext-link>]) and used to generate synthetic lineages that mimic natural mutational frequencies. Starting with the BA.1 sequence, mutational frequencies from 2021 and 2022 were utilized to generate ten sets of 250,000 synthetic RBD sequences through six rounds of <italic>in silico</italic> evolution, where the 100 variants with the highest predicted score for ACE2 binding (averaged across the ensemble CNN models) in each round were used as seed sequences for the next round of mutations. Next, the ensemble deep learning models were used to predict antibody binding or escape (or uncertain classification) for the synthetic variants. This provides an estimation of each individual antibody’s binding breadth in the generated sequence space and thus correlates with resistance to prospective Omicron lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Since several of the clinically used antibody therapies for COVID-19 consisted of a cocktail of two antibodies (e.g., LY-CoV555+LY-CoV16, REGN10933+REGN10987, COV2-2130+COV2-2196), we also determined antibody breadth across all two-way combinations. For the 2022-based synthetic lineages, ZCB11 showed the greatest predicted breadth, followed by A23-58.1, Brii-198 and ADG20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The ensemble models predict very low breadth for 2-7 and COV2-2196, despite both maintaining binding to BA.2 and beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This is likely due to the high uncertainty of these models. The predicted coverage of ZCB11 corresponds well with experimental measurements that show it maintains high affinities and neutralization to several Omicron variants (BA.2, BA.4/5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, Brii-198 and A23-58.1 have been shown to bind BA.2, BA.2.12 and BA.2.75 variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, aligning with the predictions of their relatively high breadth. Examining breadth profiles of each antibody as a function of ED revealed differing profiles, such as ZCB11 and Brii-198 maintaining high breadth at larger ED (&gt;ED<sub>4</sub>), while A23-58.1 and ADG20 have substantially lower breadth at large ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The predicted breadth of several antibodies were substantially different for synthetic lineages generated using 2021 mutational probabilities. For example, the breadth of ADG20 is substantially higher as it is predicted to bind over 50% of variants, while the breadth of Brii-198 and A23-58.1 is reduced by 9% and 15%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">10</xref>). This suggests that correctly anticipating antigenic drift and changes in mutational frequencies play an important role in determining breadth predictions.</p><p id="P19">It is worth noting that calculating the breadth of antibody combinations is not simply additive. For example, while Brii-198 ranks lower than A23-58.1 in total breadth, Brii-198 provides more complementary coverage to ZCB11 (Brii-198 binds to more variants that escape ZCB11), resulting in an overall increase in variant coverage in a simulated cocktail. Examining the distribution of escape variants for ZCB11 at ED<sub>6</sub>, where it sees its most significant breadth reduction— the three other highly ranked antibodies (A23-58.1, Brii-198 and ADG20) re-establish coverage over unique clusters in the sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, only ADG20 and Brii-198 cover and mitigate variants that include the key F468V mutation (e.g., BA.4/5). Furthermore, Brii-198 covers the most diverse clusters that contain additional critical mutations at the F468 position, in addition to the surrounding residues in this epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Thus, while any of the three antibodies would be complementary to ZCB11 by nature of targeting a different epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, our breadth analysis aids in identifying the most complementary antibody by variant coverage.</p><p id="P20">To quantify the impact of how individual mutations can drive antibody escape, an escape score (<italic>S</italic>_<italic>m</italic>^) was computed for each mutation (<italic>m</italic>) within the synthetic lineages. This metric is a normalized product of the number of antibodies escaped by a given mutation and the mutation’s frequency within the lineage (see Methods). When examining individual RBD mutations across the synthetic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), it was revealed that T523P has the highest escape score. Comparatively, DMS results showed that mutations at position 523 have a slightly negative influence on RBD protein expression level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which may explain its low occurrence in natural variants, having only been observed in 70 sequences in the GISAID database. Furthermore, the combination of D339R, F486A and T523P mutations in the simulated BA.1 lineages caused the most antibody escape among mutations not previously observed in major variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Out of these, the positions 339 and 486 are mutated in BA.2.75 and XBB and their sublineages. The top 50 mutations with the highest escape scores include K356T and R403K, which are present in the recently reported and highly mutated BA.2.86 variant and had not been previously reported in any other major variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Additionally, positions V445 and N481 were also mutated in BA.2.86.

This rapid pace of viral evolution has underscored the need for novel approaches to adequately profile antibody candidates and predict their robustness to emerging variants early on during drug development.

Screening of these libraries for ACE2 binding and antibody escape yielded high-dimensional data sets with combinatorial mutations spanning the entire RBD sequence, which is not obtainable through frequently employed approaches such as DMS. In addition, the RBD library design can be updated to accommodate mutations present in emerging variants, and the average number of mutations can be titrated to generate data suitable for the training of machine learning models. This library design and screening approach could also be exploited to profile viral surface proteins from other rapidly evolving viruses such as influenza or HIV, two viruses which undergo substantial antigenic drift that drives their immune escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">So far, the breadth of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics has been assessed through the use of past variants and observed mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Measuring breadth in this way does not adequately predict long-term resistance against future variants. The deployment of ensemble deep learning models to make predictions on synthetic mutational trajectories of the RBD enabled an effective quantitative method to evaluate the breadth of each antibody based on its coverage of RBD mutational sequence space. DML predictions confirm that ZCB11 has exceptionally broad breadth to major Omicron lineages that emerged in 2022, while many other antibodies fail against Omicron variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our results suggest that the standard structure-based approach of selecting antibodies targeting different epitopes in a cocktail does not sufficiently determine which combinations offer the most cumulative breadth. High breadth cocktails would ensure that even if a variant escapes one antibody in the cocktail, it has a high chance to be re-captured by the other antibody - thus potentially maintaining the clinical effectiveness of the therapy. For example, this occured with the combination antibody therapy from Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555+LY-CoV16), which continued to be used clinically when only a single antibody in the combination was effective after the emergence of Beta, Gamma and Delta variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a comprehensive search through a SARS-CoV-2 antibody database (Cov-AbDab, accessed April 2023)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> reveals that a number of neutralizing antibodies discovered early in the pandemic from patients infected with the ancestral Wu-Hu-1 are still able to neutralize Omicron variants such as BA.5, BQ.1 and XBB.1.

1</label><caption><title>Construction of a high edit distance (ED) synthetic variant library based on Omicron BA.1 RBD.</title><p id="P49"><bold>a</bold>, The RBD sequence was split into 11-12 fragments, each being approximately 48 nt in length. For each fragment, a ssODN library with either zero, one or two mutations was designed. <bold>b</bold>, To introduce mutations, NNK codons were tiled across the fragments (1). Each fragment was flanked by BsmBI sites (2). The ssODNs were flanked by primer binding sites for double stranded synthesis through PCR (primers are represented by black arrows and primer binding sites are peach colored) (3). The type II-S restriction enzyme BsmBI gives rise to orthogonal four nt overhangs, which are used by a ligase to assemble individual fragments into full-length RBD sequences (4). <bold>c</bold>, The use of GGA for library construction required the presence of constant regions for ligation between fragments (in black), thereby restricting the library diversity. To overcome this drawback, four staggered sub-libraries were constructed. Due to limitations in sequencing length, it was further necessary to split the RBD into two separate libraries. The extent of seq-library A is indicated in orange and seq-library B in cyan. The primer binding sites for deep sequencing are indicated using orange and cyan arrows. <bold>d</bold>, Targeted sequencing of seq-libraries A and B showed comprehensive mutational coverage for both libraries. The same color scheme as in (c) was used to indicate the extent of both libraries. <bold>e</bold>, To adjust the mutational rate of the library, three different conditions were tested. Different amounts of fragments with zero, one or two mutations were pooled in different ratios which yielded libraries with different mutational distributions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189498-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Screening RBD libraries for ACE2 binding and antibody escape by yeast display and deep sequencing.</title><p id="P50"><bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>, Workflow for sorting of yeast display RBD libraries and FACS dot plots for <bold>a,</bold> ACE2 and <bold>b</bold>, antibodies Brii-198 and ZCB11.
