It has been suggested that multiple horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) from fungi- to-oomycetes contributed to the evolution of plant-pathogenic traits. These HGTs are predicted to include secreted proteins that degrade plant cell walls. This is a key trait in the pathology of many oomycetes, as the plant cell wall represents a primary barrier to pathogen invasion and a rich source of carbohydrates. Many of the HGT gene families identified have undergone multiple rounds of duplication. Using a combination of phylogenomic analysis and functional assays, we investigate the diversification of a horizontally-transferred xyloglucanase gene family in the model oomycete species <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>. Our analyses detect 11 genes retained in P. <italic>sojae</italic> among a complex pattern of gene duplications and losses. Using a phenotype assay, based on heterologous expression in yeast, we show that eight of these paralogs have xyloglucanase function, including variants with distinct protein characteristics, such as a long-disordered C-terminal extension that can increase xyloglucanase activity. The functional xyloglucanase variants analysed subtend an ancestral node close to the fungi-oomycetes gene transfer, suggesting the horizontally-transferred gene was a <italic>bona fide</italic> xyloglucanase. Expression of xyloglucanase paralogs in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> triggers distinct patterns of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, demonstrating that enzyme variants differentially stimulate pattern-triggered immunity in plants. Mass spectrometry of detectable enzymatic products demonstrates that some paralogs catalyze production of variant breakdown profiles, suggesting that secretion of multiple xyloglucanase variants increases efficiency of xyloglucan breakdown, as well as potentially diversifying the range of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) released during pathogen attack. We suggest that such patterns of protein neofunctionalization, and variant host responses, represent an aspect of the Red Queen host-pathogen co-evolutionary dynamic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Horizontal Gene Transfer</kwd><kwd>Gene Duplication</kwd><kwd>Host Pathogen Interaction</kwd><kwd>Plant Cell Wall</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Oomycetes are heterotrophic protists that form part of the stramenopile lineage (also sometimes called heterokonts) (1–5). They resemble fungi in their filamentous growth and osmotrophic feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), which initially led to their taxonomic placement within the kingdom Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). It is now known that oomycetes and fungi branch on distant parts of the eukaryotic tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), suggesting that biological similarities of the two groups were the product of convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The oomycetes are a highly diverse group of protists, but include ecologically- and agriculturally-destructive pathogens of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Many plant pathogens penetrate or break down the cell walls of their hosts, a heterogenous refractory structure rich in diverse polysaccharides. Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose cross-linked by glycans, and embedded within a matrix of pectin, hemicelluloses, lignin, other aromatic polymers, and proteins, which together provide structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). One of the most abundant hemicellulosic polysaccharides is xyloglucan, consisting of a backbone of D-glucose linked by β-1-4 glycosidic bonds (similar to cellulose), however, most are substituted with α-1,6-linked xylose (often in turn capped with galactose, arabinose, or fucose). Owing to the different possible variations of the sugar side chains on xylosyl residues, the xyloglucan structure varies significantly between plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). A nomenclature-based system has been used to define side chain variants and describe the oligosaccharides released by enzymatic degradation of xyloglucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Interestingly, mixed xyloglucan oligosaccharides (obtained through enzymatic extraction from apple pomace) have also been demonstrated to act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (grapevine) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, leading to direct activation of a range of plant immune responses across phylogenetically-distant plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The genomes of many plant pathogens, especially hemibiotrophic species, are replete in genes encoding secreted glycoside hydrolases, predicted to break down external plant cell wall layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). These gene families include previously identified horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) from fungi-to-oomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). HGT, or lateral gene transfer (LGT), describes the movement of genes across species boundaries, a process which can potentially add new functionality to the recipient lineage (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>)). New functionality can also be acquired through gene duplication events– specifically when the gene duplication is coupled with neofunctionalization of sister paralogs. In oomycetes there is evidence of widespread gene duplication (post-acquisition) of fungal-derived HGT genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), resulting in multiple paralogs, many of which are predicted to encode secreted products which interact with a host. This pattern of evolution seems to be prevalent among economically-important <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, including <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> – a hemibiotrophic pathogen of soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We know very little regarding the functional significance of HGT events and subsequent gene family duplications in <italic>Phytophthora</italic>. Gene duplication events can be linked to subsequent adaptation regarding increased gene dosage and/or functional divergence known as neofunctionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) or subfunctionalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that one paralog of the <italic>P. sojae</italic> Glycoside Hydrolase 12 (GH12) gene family, PsXLP1, has undergone a significant pattern of deletion within the encoded open reading frame (ORF), rendering a catalytically-inactivated protein that acts as a ‘decoy’ of plant immune response, helping to facilitate infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The PsXLP1 gene is located in a conserved head-to-head orientation with the closely-related paralogous PsXEG1 gene, and has been shown to inhibit the host immune protein GmGlP1, whereas none of the other GH12 members tested were shown to inhibit the same host protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Additional work has also focused on detailed examination of the functional PsXEG1 paralog and its contribution to <italic>P. sojae</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). These results demonstrated that neofunctionalization through peptide sequence evolution has been adaptive with regard to <italic>P. sojae</italic> virulence and immunity evasion.</p><p id="P6">Here, we characterize all 11 HGT derived paralogs [xenologues] that have resulted from gene duplication in the same HGT-derived <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 gene family, using bioinformatics, heterologous protein expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and transient expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. Our analysis suggests a pattern of functional divergence linked to unique protein characteristics important for xyloglucanase function. We also show that some paralogous functional forms render different xyloglucan breakdown product profiles, and suggest that secretion of multiple variants could therefore increase the efficacy of substrate breakdown. Importantly, we demonstrate that the variant paralogs trigger unique patterns of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation <italic>in planta</italic>, suggesting that the host must be on high alert to multiple related protein signatures during pathogen interaction. The concordant action of multiple paralogs transcribed during infection may therefore act to perturb plant immune perception both within individual infections (e.g. via differential transcription), and over evolutionary divergence (e.g. by replacement of variant paralog functions). Such a scenario would suggest that the pattern of gene loss, duplication and neofunctionalization observed here is an evolutionary consequence of the Red Queen co-evolutionary dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), which predicts that host-pathogen co-evolution acts to increase genetic variation by generating diversity on molecular signatures involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">The aim of this work was to investigate the functional consequences of a series of gene duplications of a horizontally-transferred, putatively secreted, enzyme using a bioinformatics approach, combined with heterologous expression in S. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to allow for functional assessment of enzymatic function. The enzyme is a putative xyloglucanase, and this gene family was previously identified as a candidate HGT from fungi to the oomycetes primarily based on taxon distribution data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In this study we investigated the hypothesis that gene duplication events which occurred after the HGT event, drove diversification and neofunctionalization of this enzyme function in <italic>P. sojae</italic>. To better understand the dynamics of GH12 gene turnover in oomycetes, we explored patterns of lineage-specific gene gains (e.g. via duplication and fixation) or losses (e.g. via inactivation and deletion) across representative <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp., and <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (an obligate biotrophic pathogen of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 11 paralogs of GH12 in <italic>P. sojae</italic> were confirmed by HMM searches against Ensembl genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). The <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 paralogs were aligned to a range of candidate GH12 genes identified in additional oomycete genomes sampled using the same HMM search method described above but excluding some sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then constructed a phylogenetic tree to explore the specific evolutionary relationships between <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 paralogs, using focused sampling of orthologs in closely related oomycetes, demonstrating the presence of 11 <italic>P. sojae</italic> genes across multiple paralog clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We note that this analysis shows weak phylogenetic resolution in several sections of the tree (i.e. bootstrap support values) and clear evidence of multiple cases of gene loss both within the 9 clades identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and unspecified gene losses among the intermediate phylogenetic groups which lack resolution. Even with many nodes lacking strong support, these data demonstrate that the gene family has been subject to numerous cases of gene duplication and loss typical of strong diversifying selection operating on the GH12 gene repertoire and putatively contributing to functional variation in this lineage important for pathogenesis.</p><p id="P8">FungiDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) was used to locate approximate genomic coordinates of each <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 gene - the relative approximate distances between the paralogs are shown in kilobases (kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate two phylogenetically-defined sister paralog pairs, which also demonstrate close clustering on chromosomal contigs (<italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1) and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1); <italic>P. sojae</italic>_247788 and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953).

Analysis of these transcriptomes demonstrated that the duplicated sequences exhibit stage-specific expression, as well as differences in levels of expression (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (FPKM) were used to calculate Log2 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>)). Four paralogs are expressed in <italic>P. sojae</italic> mycelia, seven paralogs are expressed in cyst, and nine paralogs are expressed during plant infection. Four of the eleven xyloglucanases are expressed to some level during all three stages: <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1), <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1), <italic>P</italic>. sojae_482953, and <italic>P. sojae_355355</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gene expression of two of the eleven xyloglucanases was undetectable in all stages: <italic>P. sojae</italic>_247788 and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_520599 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We do not include it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, but we note that previous analyses describe fine-scale correlated expression patterns for <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1) and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1), which are consistent with their expression during all stages as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The authors demonstrate that both variants are expressed at low levels in mycelia, cyst, germinating cyst and zoospore stages, with an increase in expression at 10 minutes post-infection of soybean hypocotyls, up to the highest peak in expression at 1-hour post-infection, before declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Alignment analysis demonstrated the predicted amino acid sequences of <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953 and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_247788 had an extended C-terminus compared to the other nine paralogs, while <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1) has two single amino acid insertions not found in other <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 paralogs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).

Concentrated supernatants of yeast strains, each expressing a <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 paralog, were used as crude protein extracts for enzyme activity assays using 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent compared to a yeast strain carrying an empty vector. DNS is an aromatic compound that is reduced in the presence of reducing sugars (released during the breakdown of polysaccharides), to 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid, which absorbs light at ~540 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Therefore, an increase in absorbance at 544 nm over time was used to infer enzymatic activity.</p><p id="P12">After 6 hours incubation with 1% (w/v) xyloglucan (pH 7, 30°C), significant levels of reducing sugars released by enzyme activity were detected for the <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953, 559651 (PsXEG1), 520924, and 338074 xyloglucanase variants (Dunnett’s test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). After prolonged incubation (72 h), significant levels of reducing sugars were also detected for the <italic>P. sojae</italic>_260883, 355355, 520599, and 247788 enzymes (Dunnett’s test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that eight out of eleven paralogs display enzymatic activity towards xyloglucan compared to a control yeast carrying an empty vector. However, these data demonstrate that the paralogs have very different rates of catalysis, consistent with a pattern of diversified function. Interestingly, <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953 and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1) appeared to show more rapid degradation than the other active paralogs under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As both paralogs subtend the ancestral node, at the point when horizontal gene transfer from the fungi to the oomycetes was predicted to occur, they therefore putatively share the conserved function of the ancestral fungal-to-oomycete HGT, i.e. the HGT was likely a <italic>bona fide</italic> xyloglucanase. The shared derived function of this gene family is further suggested by previous studies which report homologous fungal proteins that function as xyloglucanases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). These results confirm that detectable xyloglucanase function was, however, lost during expansion of this gene family in the branch leading to <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1). Loss of enzymatic function in <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1) has previously been demonstrated to be linked to a deletion event within the peptide-encoding sequence and shown to result in improved host immune-evasion, demonstrating a link between evolution of peptide characteristics and an evolutionary response to host function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). We also find loss of enzymatic function in the branch leading to <italic>P. sojae</italic>_338064, but note that this paralog expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was subject to manual sequence correction, due to identification of three miscalled introns that were removed from the predicted gene sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). It is therefore possible that this paralog does not accurately reflect the mature transcript expressed by <italic>P. sojae in vivo</italic>, or indeed that this variant is a possible pseudogene. We note that <italic>P. sojae</italic>_520248 displayed enzymatic activity to xyloglucan in a cell culture agar plate-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref>), but it was not possible to detect function of this paralog from concentrated supernatants, potentially falling below our limit of detection for enzymatic activity.</p><p id="P13">Both <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953 and <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1), although representing functional forms that subtend the ancestral HGT phylogenetic node, showed radically different peptide modifications (i.e. in the case of <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1), two separate single amino acid insertions and, in the case of <italic>P. sojae</italic>_482953, a C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>)). These results make it difficult to identify how peptide characteristics relate to xyloglucanase function or the ancestral function of the horizontally-transferred encoded gene, but confirm that this gene family has been subject to additional peptide level variation beyond the deletion identified by Ma et al. (2017) for <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

In contrast to <italic>P. sojae</italic>_247788, the orthologous proteins of <italic>P. cactorum</italic> and <italic>P. nicotianae</italic> demonstrated significantly higher xyloglucanase function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To investigate if this function was specific to the presence or absence of the C-terminal extensions, truncated versions of the proteins (removing the C-terminal regions) were engineered and expressed in S. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>.

These data suggest that high-level xyloglucanase catalytic function within the 482953 - 247788 clade was, in part, a result of the acquisition of a highly disordered C-terminal extension, but that this high-level function has not been retained specifically in the <italic>P. sojae</italic>_247788 paralog, yet is present in the <italic>P. cactorum</italic> and <italic>P. nicotianae</italic> orthologous proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The functional <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1) xyloglucanase and its orthologs are predicted to encode an additional substrate-binding site</title><p id="P16">As discussed above, <italic>P. sojae</italic>_559651 (PsXEG1) and its associated orthologs were shown to have two separate single amino acid insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).

Further work is therefore necessary to elucidate the function, if any, of this additional putative binding site. The two indels are also conserved in <italic>P. sojae</italic>_360375 (PsXLP1), however, as this paralog is significantly truncated at the C-terminus (missing a glutamic acid residue required for enzymatic activity (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)), a second putative binding site was not originally predicted.

Specifically, we present a variant paralog with a C-terminal extension that increases enzymatic activity, as well as demonstrate diverse ROS accumulation patterns <italic>in planta</italic>, and diverse profiles of enzymatic breakdown products amongst the members of this HGT xyloglucanase family. We therefore suggest that the host immune system must perceive and respond to fluctuations in multiple protein signatures, enzymatic catalysis rates and, potentially, multiple DAMP signatures. If the host fails to recognize the function or effects of one paralog, a selective sweep would quickly favour a variant strain, utilizing a paralog that produced a profile that was not detected, allowing immune evasion and therefore selection for that variant. Consistent with this hypothesis, this gene family shows multiple paralogs that have reduced detectable xyloglucanase function, and paralog forms which do not trigger ROS accumulation, and others which show near-absence of some classes of oligosaccharide output – a possible product of pathogen protein evolution with the selected outcome of escaping host immune detection. If, and when, the plant immune system catches up with a pathogens amended protein signature, a variant set of paralogs with an altered signature could then be selected for prominence, allowing improved evasion of the plant immune system and resulting in fixation of additional gene duplication forms with neofunctionalized functions. Collectively, we argue the data presented here and in Ma et al. (2015 and 2017) demonstrates that the <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 xyloglucanase paralog families show such an evolutionary dynamic. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the functional differences between gene duplications post-HGT, giving us improved insight into the dynamics of phytopathogenicity, as well as a better understanding of the consequences of gene flow in phytopathogenic oomycetes.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p id="P33">Candidate homologs (paralogs) of <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 (Pfam: PF01670, InterPro: IPR002594) were collated by performing Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches against Ensembl genomes (restricted by taxonomy to <italic>P. sojae</italic> NCBI taxids 67593 and 1094619) with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), using the raw profile HMM training set for the putative protein family (Pfam: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>)).

id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance Statement</title></caption><p>The oomycetes are a diverse group of eukaryotic microbes that include some of the most devastating pathogens of plants. Oomycetes perceive, invade, and colonize plants in similar ways to fungi, in part because they acquired the genes to attack and feed on plants from fungi. These genes are predicted to be useful to oomycete plant pathogens because they have undergone multiple rounds of gene duplication. One key enzyme for attacking plant cell wall structures is called xyloglucanase. Xyloglucanase in the oomycetes has undergone multiple rounds of gene duplication, leading to variants including an enzyme with a C-terminal extension that increases activity. Some xyloglucanase variants trigger unique patterns of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <italic>in planta</italic>, and generate different profiles of cell wall breakdown products - such outcomes could act to mystify and increase the workload of the plant immune system, allowing successful pathogens to proliferate.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Evolutionary history of oomycete GH12.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Maximum likelihood tree constructed with IQ-Tree v2.0.3 (WAG+R5 model of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>) selected as the best-fit model by ModelFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>)). The tree was constructed from an alignment of 161 sequences comprising 211 amino acids to confirm the evolutionary relationships between oomycete GH12. The final tree was visualized with iTOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>), and nodes indicate results (%) of non-parametric bootstrap (200 pseudoreplicates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). The tree is rooted with a fungal outgroup because fungi were previously identified as the putative donor group of the GH12 HGT into the oomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The eleven <italic>P. sojae</italic> GH12 paralogs are visually identifiable as they have adjacent transcriptome profiles (column B).
