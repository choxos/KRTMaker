We show that functional subdivisions of visual cortex and DMN sit at opposing ends of parallel streams of information processing that support visually-mediated semantic and spatial cognition, providing convergent evidence from univariate and multivariate task responses, intrinsic functional and structural connectivity. Participants learned virtual environments consisting of buildings populated with objects, drawn from either a single semantic category or multiple categories. Later, they made semantic and spatial context decisions about these objects and buildings during functional magnetic resonance imaging. A lateral ventral occipital to frontotemporal DMN pathway was primarily engaged by semantic judgements, while a medial visual to medial temporal DMN pathway supported spatial context judgements. These pathways had distinctive locations in functional connectivity space: the semantic pathway was both further from unimodal systems and more balanced between visual and auditory-motor regions compared with the spatial pathway. When semantic and spatial context information could be integrated (in buildings containing objects from a single category), regions at the intersection of these pathways responded, suggesting that parallel processing streams interact at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy to produce coherent memory-guided cognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>intrinsic connectivity, structural connectivity</kwd><kwd>semantic cognition</kwd><kwd>spatial cognition</kwd><kwd>default mode network</kwd><kwd>visual</kwd><kwd>large-scale cortical networks</kwd><kwd>brain organization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The Default Mode Network (DMN) is involved in higher-order cognition including in semantic cognition, mental time travel and scene construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Spreng et al., 2009</xref>). Its functions and architecture are plagued by apparent contradictions: it often deactivates in response to visual inputs yet it is connected to visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Knapen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Leech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Szinte and Knapen, 2020</xref>). In addition, this network is associated with both abstraction from sensory-motor features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chiou et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Rice et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">2015a</xref>) and internally-generated states like imagery and autobiographical memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Philippi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Ritchey and Cooper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Spreng and Grady, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). A recent perspective suggests these diverse functions are facilitated by the topographical location of DMN on the cortical mantle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). DMN is maximally separated from sensory-motor regions – both in terms of its physical location and in connectivity space. It is at one end of the principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity that captures the separation of unimodal and heteromodal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) and this location is thought to allow DMN to sustain representations that are distinct from sensory-motor features and at odds with the current state of the external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">2018</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Despite these common functional characteristics of DMN, parcellations of intrinsic connectivity reveal subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Wen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Lateral fronto-temporal (FT) DMN regions are associated with semantic cognition, including the abstraction of heteromodal meanings from sensory-motor features and the ability to access these meanings from sensory inputs in a task-appropriate way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chiou et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, scene construction, thought to be a key component of episodic recollection, is associated with a medial temporal (MT) subsystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">D’Argembeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). FT and MT-DMN subnetworks are interdigitated in regions of core DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>) and they are assumed to work together but little is known about how information within them is integrated. One hypothesis is that the spatial adjacency of DMN subsystems allows their common recruitment and coordination when semantic and scene-based information is aligned; for example, when semantically similar objects are found in a common location, or spatial position predicts the meanings of items that are found there.</p><p id="P4">FT and MT-DMN support heteromodal representations and yet can be accessed by visual inputs, raising the question of how neural pathways between vision and DMN are organised. Visual neuroscience has revealed different responses associated with recognising objects and scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2011</xref>). Objects engage a ventral pathway extending laterally and anteriorly through ventral lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and the fusiform gyrus towards the anterior temporal lobes (ATL), thought to be a key heteromodal hub for conceptual representation. This pathway might act as input to FT-DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Malach et al., 2002</xref>). Navigating visuospatial environments and scene construction, on the other hand, involves the occipital place area, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, before this pathway terminates in hippocampus. These regions are associated with the MT-DMN subnetwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Epstein and Baker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</xref>). This work suggests that visual and DMN subsystems may be linked. For example, during memory for people and places, medial parietal cortex mirrors the well-established medial-lateral organisation of ventral temporal cortex during the perception of scenes and faces; medial parietal regions also show differential connectivity to these visual regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Silson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Steel et al., 2021</xref>). Yet these past studies did not examine whole-brain connectivity or semantic cognition beyond the social domain and were also unable to explore the interaction of these pathways.</p><p id="P5">Here, we used multiple neuroscientific methods to delineate the pathways from visual cortex to DMN, providing convergent evidence for two parallel streams supporting semantic and spatial cognition. In Study 1, participants learned about virtual environments (buildings) populated with objects belonging to diverse semantic categories, <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">both man-made (tools, musical instruments, sports equipment) and natural (land animals, marine animals, birds)</styled-content>. We then used fMRI to examine neural activity as participants viewed object and scene probes and made semantic and spatial context decisions. Some buildings were associated with a specific semantic category (e.g., a building filled with musical instruments), while others included a mix of categories, allowing us to examine the interaction between semantic and spatial cognition. We identified dissociable pathways <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">of connectivity between</styled-content> different parts of visual cortex <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">and</styled-content> DMN subsystems; these overlapped with visual localiser responses for objects and scenes (in Study 2), as well as previously described DMN subsystems, and showed different patterns of functional and structural connectivity (in Study 3). <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">These pathways refer to regions that are coupled, functionally or structurally, together, providing the potential for communication between them.</styled-content> They also had distinctive locations in a functional space defined using whole-brain gradients of connectivity: the semantic pathway was further from unimodal systems and more balanced between visual and auditory-motor regions compared with the spatial pathway. Moreover, when semantic and spatial context information could be combined (e.g. when the objects in a building were from the same semantic category), regions at the intersection of these pathways responded, in both DMN and visual cortex, suggesting these parallel processing streams can interact at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy to produce coherent memory-guided cognition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Behavioural Results</title><p id="P6">To examine task accuracy, we performed a 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA using task (2 levels: semantic, spatial context) and condition (2 levels: Mixed-Category Building (MCB), and Same-Category Building (SCB)) as factors.

We first delineated the regions in visual cortex that are engaged by the viewing of probes during our task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), as well as the DMN regions that respond when making decisions about those probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>): we characterised both by comparing the activation maps with well-established DMN and object/scene perception regions, analysed the pattern of activation within them, their functional connectivity and task associations. Having characterised these dissociable visual and DMN regions, we proceeded to ask whether they are differentially linked: are the visual regions activated by object probe perception more strongly linked to DMN regions that are activated when making semantic decisions about object probes, relative to other DMN regions? Is the same true for visual regions associated with scene perception and DMN regions responding to spatial decisions about which rooms were in the same building? We answered this question through a series of connectivity analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) that examined: 1) if the functional connectivity of visual to DMN regions (and DMN to visual regions) shows a dissociation, suggesting there are object semantic and spatial cognition processing ‘pathways’; 2) if this pattern was replicated in structural connectivity; 3) if it was present at the level of individual participants, and, 4) we characterised the spatial layout, network composition (using influential RS networks) and cognitive decoding of these pathways. Having found dissociable pathways for semantic (object) and spatial context (scene) processing, we then examined their position in a high-dimensional connectivity space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) that allowed us to document that the semantic pathway is less reliant on unimodal regions (i.e., more abstract) while the spatial context pathway is more allied to the visual system.

The principal gradient relates to connectivity differences between unimodal and heteromodal cortex, while the second gradient captures connectivity differences between visual and auditory/somato-motor cortex. By locating the ends of the two visual-to-DMN pathways within gradient space, we can establish if DMN regions supporting semantic and spatial cognition are equally distant in connectivity from sensory-motor cortex: semantic cognition is arguably more abstract than spatial cognition and might be supported by DMN regions that are more isolated from sensory-motor systems on the principal gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>).

We compared responses in SCB and MCB trials, since semantic and spatial information are aligned when buildings contain items from a single semantic category, but not in mixed-category buildings. In these analyses, there were differences between conditions in the probe but not the decision-making phase (perhaps because many probes were presented without decisions, increasing statistical power).</p><p id="P28">First, we performed univariate contrasts of MCB and SCB trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, panels a-c). For scene probes in the spatial context task, the MCB &gt; SCB contrast elicited a stronger response in dorsal lateral occipital cortex and retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, panel a). In these circumstances, spatial context probes could only activate spatial and not semantic information. The SCB &gt; MCB contrast activated an adjacent region of right angular gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, panel b). For semantic probes, the contrast of MCB &gt; SCB identified greater engagement in distributed parietal, occipital and temporal regions, associated with the multiple-demand network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, panel c). There were no clusters that showed a stronger response to same than mixed category building probes for the semantic task.

A two-way repeated measures ANOVA examined seed (spatial context SCB&gt;MCB and MCB&gt;SCB; semantic MCB&gt;SCB) and ROI (semantic and spatial context pathways) as factors. The results can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, panel e).

A cross-task RSA of the SCB trials, where semantic and spatial information were aligned, allowing integration, identified a separate set of regions in right LOC, topographically situated between the two pathways, that captured spatial context information during the semantic task. An intrinsic connectivity analysis in data from Study 3 using the RSA regions as seeds and the pathways as ROIs showed that the regions sensitive to semantic and spatial context information during MCB trials were maximally connected to the semantic and spatial context pathways, respectively. On the other hand, the regions where spatial information could be decoded during the SCB trials of the semantic task showed an intermediate pattern of connectivity to both pathways (especially to the semantic pathway), suggesting a role in integrating information between them (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S9</xref>).</styled-content></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Functional subdivisions of visual cortex and DMN sit at opposing ends of parallel processing streams supporting visually-mediated <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">object-centric</styled-content> semantic and spatial cognition; moreover, regions with intermediate patterns of connectivity are implicated in the integration of these streams into coherent experience. Viewing object probes in a semantic task and location probes in a spatial context task activated different parts of visual cortex, functionally related to the passive viewing of objects and scenes. Semantic and spatial context decisions about these probes engaged FT and MT-DMN subsystems. Visual regions sensitive to object probes showed stronger intrinsic functional connectivity and structural connectivity to FT-DMN, while scene probe regions were more connected to MT-DMN. In a functional space defined by whole-brain connectivity patterns, the <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">object-centric</styled-content> semantic pathway was more distant from unimodal regions on a unimodal-to-heteromodal connectivity gradient, and it had a more balanced influence of visual and auditory-motor systems, while the spatial context pathway was more visual. Finally, we found evidence that both heteromodal and visual regions integrate information about meaning and spatial context. When all the items in a building were drawn from a particular semantic category, there was greater recruitment of right angular gyrus; multivariate pattern analysis similarly found a cluster in lateral occipital cortex that represented spatial context information during the semantic task.

Previous literature has robustly established distinct FT and MT subsystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>); however, the way in which this architecture reflects differences in visual inputs remains contentious. One proposal is that different DMN subnetworks are differently engaged by tasks that are externally versus internally oriented. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chiou et al., 2020a</xref>) propose that there is a basic distinction between parts of the network that process semantic information accessed from words and images, and between DMN regions that sustain internally-focussed cognition. Other work has called into question whether semantic responses in FT-DMN are specific to external tasks: for example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) found that lateral temporal regions changed their patterns of connectivity depending on the task, with more visual connectivity in externally-oriented tasks like reading, and more DMN connectivity in internally-orientated conceptual states like mind-wandering and autobiographical memory. This work suggests FT-DMN might support <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">object-centric</styled-content> semantic cognition across internal and external modes of cognition.</p><p id="P33">Our findings also suggest that the distinction between these subsystems is not organised according to visual coupling; instead, DMN organisation arises from differential connectivity between distinct visual and DMN regions that gives rise to partially segregated pathways that process information about locations and meanings. Visual responses to scenes and objects reflect entry points to these processing pathways such that the key distinction between FT-DMN and MT-DMN relates to the type of information being processed, as opposed to how the information is accessed.</p><p id="P34">Our observed dissociation between semantic and spatial context pathways echoes a similar domain-specific organisation for working memory in prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Levy and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Romanski, 2004</xref>), in which there are dorsal and ventral streams associated with the maintenance of item location and identity respectively. This organising principle has been extended to long term memory more recently. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Deen and Freiwald, 2021</xref>) found a similar dissociation between places and people (instead of objects) in the DMN and other areas of association cortex. This was not tied to a specific input modality or task, indicative of parallel, domain-specific networks, at the top of the cortical hierarchy. Here, we extend this approach to consider whether functional divisions within DMN and visual cortex are connected, giving rise to pathways which are differentially situated in a connectivity state space defined by whole-brain dimensions of intrinsic connectivity, and we ask how these pathways might be integrated, and how they might be flexibly recruited according to task demands.</p><p id="P35">Although our research suggests a <italic>domain</italic>-specific view of brain organisation within visual-to-DMN pathways linked to <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">object-centric</styled-content> semantic and spatial cognition, there may be different <italic>processes</italic> within meaning and spatial context tasks that drive these effects.

One possibility is that, at the visual end of these pathways, spatial location is more dependent on peripheral vision, while object recognition is dependent in central fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Hasson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Levy et al., 2001</xref>); consequently, the distinct visual-to-DMN pathways we have recovered may reflect a basic property of how peripheral and central visual regions project to DMN.

We are not aware of a literature on right AG lesions impairing the integration of semantic and spatial information but, in the face of our findings, this might be a promising new direction. Patients with damage to right AG should be examined with specific tasks aimed at probing this type of integration.</styled-content> We also found evidence of information integration in occipital regions that were closer to the input regions of the visual to DMN pathways. These different levels of integration shared a common characteristic: in both cases, the region implicated in integration was spatially interposed between the pathways, consistent with the view that topography is highly relevant to information integration since adjacent brain regions tend to share a high degree of functional connectivity and represent similar information.</p><p id="P37">While we might assume that common visual-to-DMN pathways support memory access from vision (as in this study), and subserve the generation of visual features when imagining objects versus scenes, this hypothesis awaits empirical investigation. Moreover, our pathways are vision-specific, and it remains unclear if there are analogous pathways from auditory or somatomotor cortex to DMN. The generality of these pathways must be confirmed across tasks, since spatial representations are likely to interact with other representational codes, including emotion and social information – the interdigitated pathways highlighted in these circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">DiNicola et al., 2020</xref>) might show anatomical differences or be broadly the same as the pathways uncovered here.</p><p id="P38"><styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">Likewise, further research should be carried out on memory-visual interactions for alternative domains. Our study focused on spatial location and semantic object processing and therefore cannot address how other categories of stimuli, such as faces, are processed by the visual-to-memory pathways that we have identified. Previous work has suggested some overlap in the neurobiological mechanisms for semantic and social processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Chiou et al., 2020b</xref>), suggesting that the FT-DMN pathway may be highlighted when contrasting both social faces and semantic objects with spatial scenes. On the other hand, some researchers have argued for a ‘third pathway’ for aspects of social visual cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Pitcher, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Pitcher and Ungerleider, 2021</xref>). Future studies that probe other categories will be able to confirm the generality (or specificity) of the pathways we described.</styled-content></p><p id="P39"><styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">One important caveat is that we have not investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural propagation along the pathways we identified between visual cortex and DMN. The dissociations we found in task responses, intrinsic functional connectivity and white matter connections all support the view that there are at least two distinct routes between visual and heteromodal DMN regions, yet this does not necessarily imply that there is a continuous sequence of cortical areas that extend from visual cortex to DMN – and given our findings of structural connectivity differences that relate to the functional subdivisions we observe, this is unlikely to be the sole mechanism underpinning our findings. It would be interesting in future work to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural propagation along visual-DMN pathways using methods optimised for studying the dynamics of information transmission, like Granger causality or travelling wave analysis.</styled-content></p><p id="P40">Moreover, many questions remain about information integration across the semantic and spatial domains; does spatial juxtaposition promote the emergence of an integrated code, and are neural representations that emerge at the intersection of these pathways more than the sum of their parts? Although further research is needed, the current study highlights how subdivisions within visual and DMN networks are related to types of information, giving rise to distinct processing streams that capture different unimodal to heteromodal transformations relevant to <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">object-centric</styled-content> semantic and spatial <styled-content style-type="color" style="#FF0000">context</styled-content> processing, and shows how these pathways might interact at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy to produce coherent cognition.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Study 1.

Half of the buildings contained images from the same semantic category (‘Same Category Building’, SCB), and the other half contained images from different semantic categories (‘Mixed Category Building’, MCB).

Participants watched each video at least 6 times in 3 rounds (twice per round). Each round consisted of 4 mini-blocks of videos containing 3 videos. After each mini-block, participants were given a test in Psychopy3: they were asked to choose the room that each item was presented in, responding via button press. Items were pictured at the top of the screen, with the correct room and another room below (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, left half of bottom panel). Screenshots were taken of the location of each framed image and the rooms themselves (from the entrance way), with the images and their frames removed (see bottom panel of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). They had 5 s to respond, after which the correct room was presented as feedback for a further 5 s.

Feedback showed the correct object in each room. Finally, to establish how well the item-location pairs were learned, participants were given a final test on all the rooms and items: this followed the structure of the mini-block tests, except that materials from the entire session were included. If accuracy was below 80%, participants watched the videos again until this threshold was reached. In total participants spent approximately 2 hours on the training.

The semantic task involved judgements about the semantic category of objects and animals (using the same images that has been presented in the buildings), while the spatial context task involved matching rooms that belonged to the same building. Both tasks consisted of ‘no-decision’ and ‘decision’ trials. No-decision trials were optimised for representational similarity analysis and included an image of the probe item (for 2s) followed by an “arrow task” in which participants pressed ‘left’ or ‘right’ to match the direction of a series of chevrons (‘&lt;’ ‘&gt;’) presented on the screen (for 3s), ending with a red fixation cross (1s). The probe in the semantic task was an object or animal from the training; for the spatial context task, it was a screenshot of an item’s location within a room (excluding the item itself). In decision trials, the same types of probes were presented but they were followed by three central dots (for 4s) indicating a decision would be made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 9</xref>). In the decision phase, a target image (from the same category or building as the probe) was presented together with a distractor image, creating a 2-alternative forced-choice judgment. In the spatial context task, the distractor was a room from a different building, while in the semantic task, the distractor was an item from a different category. On SCB (same category building) trials, semantic and spatial information were aligned in the sense that the target and probe were from the same category and the same building. On MCB (mixed category building) trials, semantic and spatial information did not converge: semantic targets were in a different building from the probe, while spatial context targets were from a different semantic category from the probe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 9</xref> for the structure of semantic and spatial context trials). Decisions were required within 4 s, and then the task progressed to the next trial. Participants made their responses using a button box, pressing with their right index finger to indicate whether the target image was on the left or right side of the screen. Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. After the decision was made, participants carried out the arrow task again (for 6.5s minus their response time) followed by a red fixation cross (1s) indicating the end of the trial. The arrow task served as a non-memory baseline and was included to increase separation of the BOLD signal between trials.</p><p id="P47">During the fMRI scan, there were 4 runs of the spatial context task and 4 runs of the semantic task. Each run contained 36 trials and lasted approximately 6 minutes. All 72 objects were presented as stimuli across blocks 1 and 2, and across blocks 3 and 4. Each run included 18 decision and 18 no decision trials. The decision trials in each run were further subdivided into 9 SCB and 9 MCB decision trials. The decision trials in run 1 and run 2 became the no-decision trials in runs 3 and 4, and vice versa. Spatial context runs preceded semantic runs.

Pre-processed time series data were modelled using a general linear model in FSL, using FILM correcting for local autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Woolrich et al., 2001</xref>). We used an event-related design. Our aim was twofold: (1) to characterise differential activation between the semantic and spatial context tasks at each phase of the trials, and (2) to document any potential differences of activation in response to MCB and SCB trials in probe and decision phases, in each task. To this end, the following 8 EVs were entered into a general linear model, convolved with a double-gamma haemodynamic response function: the probe, dots and decision phases (only correct responses) were modelled for both MCB and SCB trials (3x2 EVs). Correct decisions made during the arrow task were modelled in a separate EV to use as an explicit baseline. Incorrect and omitted responses in the decision phase, as well as errors made during the arrow task, were combined into a regressor of no interest. The fixation crosses between trials were not explicitly modelled. Probe and dots phases were modelled as fixed-duration epochs, while semantic, spatial context and arrow decisions were modelled using a variable epoch approach, based on each participant’s reaction time on that trial. At the first level, the semantic and spatial context tasks were entered into separate models for each run performed by all participants.

First, we compared activation for the two tasks, contrasting semantic and spatial context models. Inputs for this analysis were lower-level contrasts of the probe phase of each task against the implicit baseline, and the decision phase of each task contrasted against the explicit baseline of arrow decisions. In our second analysis, we used the same lower-level contrasts but examined the semantic and spatial context tasks separately, examining within-task differences between MCB and SCB trials in the probe and decision phases. This also allowed us to explore interactions between MCB/SCB trials and task.

Neurosynth is an automated meta-analysis tool that uses text-mining approaches to extract terms from neuroimaging articles that typically co-occur with specific peak coordinates of activation. It can be used to generate a set of terms frequently associated with a spatial map. The results of cognitive decoding were rendered as word clouds using in-house scripts implemented in R. We excluded terms referring to neuroanatomy (e.g., “inferior” or “sulcus”), as well as the second occurrence of repeated terms (e.g., “semantic” and “semantics”). The size of each word in the word cloud relates to the frequency of that term across studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Structural connectivity analysis</title><p id="P69">To provide converging evidence for parallel visual-to-DMN pathways, we performed tractography analysis using DTI data from an independent sample derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).</p><sec id="S38"><title>DTI pre-processing</title><p id="P70">We used data from a subgroup of 164 HCP participants who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging at 3 Tesla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Uǧurbil et al., 2013</xref>)<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/">http://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/</ext-link>). The imaging parameters were previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Uǧurbil et al. 2013</xref>, and involved acquiring 111 near-axial slices with an acceleration factor of 32, an isotropic resolution of 1.25 mm3, and coverage of the entire head. The diffusion-weighted images were obtained using 90 uniformly distributed gradients in multiple Q-space shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Caruyer et al., 2013</xref>), and this process was repeated three times with different b-values and phase-encoding directions. We used a pre-processed version of this dataset, previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Vu et al., 2015</xref>), that included steps to correct for susceptibility-induced off-resonance field, motion, and geometrical distortion.</p><p id="P71">We used StarTrack software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mr-startrack.com">https://www.mr-startrack.com</ext-link>) to perform whole-brain deterministic tractography in the native DWI space. We applied an algorithm for spherical deconvolutions (damped Richardson-Lucy), with a fixed fibre response corresponding to a shape factor of α = 1.5 × 10–3 mm2.s−1 and a geometric damping parameter of 8. We ran 200 algorithm iterations. The absolute threshold was set at three times the spherical fibre orientation distribution (FOD) of a grey matter isotropic voxel, and the relative threshold was set at 8% of the maximum amplitude of the FOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2011</xref>). To perform the whole-brain streamline tractography, we used a modified Euler algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Dell’Acqua et al., 2013</xref>) with an angle threshold of 45°, a step size of 0.625 mm, and a minimum streamline length of 15 mm.</p><p id="P72">To standardize the structural connectome data, we followed these steps: first, we converted the whole-brain streamline tractography into streamline density volumes, with the intensity corresponding to the number of streamlines crossing each voxel. Second, we generated a study-specific template of streamline density volumes using the Greedy symmetric diffeomorphic normalization pipeline provided by ANTs. This average template was created for all subjects. Third, we co-registered the template with a standard 1mm MNI152 template using the FLIRT tool in FSL to produce a streamline density template in the MNI152 space. Finally, we registered individual streamline density volumes to the template and applied the same transformation to the individual whole-brain streamline tractography using ANTs GreedySyn and the Trackmath tool in the Tract Querier software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">Wassermann et al., 2016</xref>). This produced whole-brain streamline tractography in the standard MNI152 space.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Tract extractions and ROI analysis</title><p id="P73">Our starting point for extracting semantic and spatial context pathway tracts was each participant's whole-brain streamline tractography in MNI (1mm) space. We used the same univariate regions described in Section 2.3.3 as seeds (i.e., the seeds in the intrinsic connectivity analysis): these consisted of regions that were activated during the probe phase of each task, masked by Yeo’s visual networks, and regions that were activated during the decision phase of each task, masked by Yeo’s DMN networks. For each of our seeds, we used Trackvis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Wang and Benner, 2007</xref>) to extract all streamlines emerging from these regions as a volume, yielding one streamline group per seed per participant. Then, for each probe visual seed, we calculated what percentage of streamlines touched one decision DMN ROI or the other (activated by semantic and spatial context decisions; percentages adding to 100%); likewise, for each decision DMN seed, we calculated what percentage of streamlines touched either visual probe ROI (activated by object and scene probes; again adding to 100%). This allowed us to examine if the object probe regions were more connected to the semantic decision DMN regions, and if the scene probe regions were more connected to the spatial context DMN regions, in line with dual pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Situating the pathways in whole-brain gradients</title><p id="P74">We examined the position of the semantic and context pathways in a functional connectivity space defined by the first two dimensions of whole-brain intrinsic connectivity patterns, frequently referred to as “gradients”. The first dimension of this space relates to the distinction between the connectivity patterns of unimodal and heteromodal cortical regions, while the second dimension captures the separation of visual and auditory/somatomotor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). This analysis can reveal whether the semantic pathway shows more of a balance between visual and somatosensory/auditory modalities than the spatial context pathway, in line with view that concepts are heteromodal, abstracted from multiple sensory-motor features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>). The analysis can also show whether the spatial context pathway is anchored in more visual portions of this functional space, in line with this modality’s importance for scene processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Epstein and Baker, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P75">First, we examined the univariate BOLD activation for each participant during the probe and decision phases of each task. The decision phase was contrasted with the arrow task baseline to control for low level motor responses. Next, we identified the MNI voxel location of the peak response for each participant: for activation during the decision phase, this was done within a mask of the DMN from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Yeo et al. (2011)</xref> 7-network parcellation, while for probe responses, we performed this analysis within the visual network of the same parcellation. We then fitted a sphere with a 5mm radius around this peak and used it as a ROI to extract the mean value in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Margulies et al.’s (2016)</xref> maps for the two dimensions or gradients described above.
