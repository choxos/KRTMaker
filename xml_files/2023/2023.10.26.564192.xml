Parkin is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a variety of roles in the cell including the degradation of proteins and the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, integrity, and biogenesis via the PARIS-PGC-1α pathway. In 2001 the R275W mutation in the <italic>PRKN</italic> gene was identified in two unrelated families with a multigenerational history of postural tremor, dystonia and parkinsonism. Drosophila models of Parkin R275W showed selective and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neuronal clusters, mitochondrial abnormalities, and prominent climbing defects. In the Prkn mouse orthologue, the amino acid R274 corresponds to human R275. Here we described a muscle phenotype in R274W +/+ mice and discovered that a defective Parkin-PARIS-PGC-1α pathway may impact mitochondrial biogenesis and, eventually, myoblast proliferation and differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Parkin</kwd><kwd>atrophy</kwd><kwd>PARIS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Recessive mutations in Parkin gene (<italic>PRKN</italic>) are the most common cause of young-onset inherited parkinsonism (Lesage et al., 2020). <italic>PRKN</italic> is located on chromosome 6q25.2-q27 and encodes a 52 kDa protein called Parkin, a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Seirafi et al., 2015</xref>). Parkin is highly expressed in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and it is present both in the cytosol and marginally in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>). Parkin modulates mitochondrial homeostasis, biogenesis, quality control and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Harper et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, Parkin can translocate to damaged mitochondria upon membrane depolarization and promote their autophagy-mediated degradation, a process called mitophagy, in a PINK1-dependent manner. Parkin is important not only for mitochondria elimination but is also involved in their biogenesis. Parkin ubiquitinates PARIS, a transcriptional repressor of PGC-1α, one of the key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. PARIS ubiquitination leads to its proteasomal degradation, allowing PGC-1α transcription and subsequent expression of downstream genes such as Nrf-1, Nrf-2, and TFAM, which increase cellular respiration, energy utilization and mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in Parkin mouse models cause PARIS accumulation and a reduction in the size and the number of mitochondria in ventral midbrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Stevens et al., 2015</xref>). In 2001, Farrer and colleagues identified a novel 924C&gt;T point mutation in exon 7 of <italic>PRKN</italic> that leads to the substitution of arginine with tryptophan at position 275 (R275W) in the RING1 domain of the Parkin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Farrer et al., 2001</xref>). In 2012 Ruffmann and his group identified the first pure heterozygous R275W patient with clinical features typical of sporadic PD, like late age of onset (62 years), severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, and diffuse Lewy pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ruffmann et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike other common <italic>PRKN</italic> mutations that result in the complete ablation of enzyme function, R275W Parkin retains a residual E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpression of human R275W Parkin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes selective and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neuronal clusters, decreased Parkin solubility and prominent climbing defects in mutant flies compared to wild type. <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants also showed marked fiber degeneration in the flight muscles, accompanied by severe and pleiomorphic mitochondrial pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). In the Prkn mouse orthologue, the amino acid R274 corresponds to human R275. We have recently characterized the Parkin R274W +/+ mice, which show age-related nigrostriatal degeneration and motor impairment (Regoni et al., 2023). Here, we described a muscle phenotype in R274W +/+ mice and discovered that a defective Parkin-PARIS-PGC-1α pathway may impact mitochondrial biogenesis and, eventually, myoblast proliferation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P3">The University of Trento and the National Ministry of Health approved all animal protocols (authorization #162/2022-PR).

First, 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells were inserted in the chambers and permeabilized with digitonin (16.2 μM; Sigma) in MiR05 medium (10 mM KH2PO4, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 20 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM taurine, 110 mM D-Sucrose and 1 mg/ml BSA fatty acid free). To characterize mitochondrial respiration, the following respiratory states were assessed: physiological respiration with endogenous substrates (routine respiration), complex I- and complex II-dependent respiration by addition of malate (M, 2mM), glutamate (G, 10 mM), ADP (D, 2.5 mM) and succinate (S, 10 mM), maximal capacity of the electron transfer system after stepwise titration of uncoupler (FCCP, 0.3 μM steps), respiration after complex I inhibition with Rotenone (Rot, 0.5 μM). Residual oxygen consumption (ROX) was measured after addition of antimycin A (Ama, 2.5 μM). Spare respiratory capacity was determined as the difference between maximal respiration and routine respiration. Absolute respiration values were normalized for the total number of cells (1x10<sup>6</sup>) and total activity of citrate synthase (nmol ml-1 min-1). Citrate Synthase was assayed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm and 30 °C on the EnVision 2105 Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin-Elmer), according to (Coore et al., 1971) with slight modifications.

To assess muscular capacity we tested wild type and homozygous mice at 6, 12, and 18 months on the rotarod at fixed acceleration (12 rpm), on the hanging wire and by the anterior limbs grip strength. While the performances were similar between genotypes at 6 months, we observed a decreased muscular performance in homozygous mice at 12 months in the rotarod at fixed acceleration [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-F</xref>]. At 18 months, R274W+/+ mice performed poorly in all the tests performed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-I</xref>]. Altogether, these data show that R274W+/+ mice display an age-dependent strength impairment starting at 12 months of age. We have recently assessed that Parkin R274W is expressed at low level in mouse brain (Regoni et al., 2023). Accordingly, we detected by biochemical means a reduction in Parkin levels in 12-month-old homozygous soleus muscle compared to age-matched wild type [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>]. Next we analyzed skeletal muscle histology. We focused our analysis on homozygous mice at 12 and 18 months, when muscular performance is overtly impaired. Histological analyses were conducted on the soleus muscle, as it contains predominantly type I slow twitch fibers, the most involved in efforts of long duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin staining on transversal sections of the soleus muscle revealed a 20% and 26% decrease in the fibers cross-sectional area (CSA) of mutant mice compared to wild type respectively at 12 and 18 months, with an increase in the interstitial connective tissue that surrounds the muscle units [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>]. These findings suggest that homozygous mice present a degeneration in the skeletal muscle already at 12 months of age.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Parkin R274W +/+ derived muscle cells show alterations in proliferation, fusion ability, and mitochondrial defects</title><p id="P19">The reduced strength and defects in muscle structure observed in R274W +/+ mice may follow an impairment in muscle development. To this aim we derived myoblasts from wild type and homozygous mice. Myoblasts are precursors of muscle cells that differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> into myocytes which eventually fuse together to form multinucleated myotubes. Myotubes are terminally differentiated cells useful for studying the characteristics of muscle fibers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). The quantification of cell cycle kinetics by EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine)-coupled-fluorescence-intensity analysis of myoblasts derived from wild type and homozygous mice showed that mutant cells are less proliferative, remaining mostly blocked in G1/G0 phase [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>]. Furthermore, myoblasts derived from homozygous mice showed a strong decrease in their fusion ability [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A, B</xref>] and a 25% reduction in their diameter compared to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>]. These results suggest that R274W substitution in Parkin leads to defects in myoblasts differentiation and fusion. At the subcellular level, electron microscopy (EM) of 100nm-thin plastic sections showed normal ultrastructure of the mitochondrial network in WT myotubes. Throughout the entire cell population mitochondria presented as elongated ~220nm wide rods with local, moderate narrowings and occasional branches. R274 +/+ cells, however, were characterized by a high diversity of partly abnormally shaped mitochondria. Apart from a few, virtually “normal”, branching rods, there regularly occurred comparatively huge, pleomorphic organelle profiles (up to &gt;800nm in diameter), sometimes forming only ~120nm-wide, rod-shaped protrusions. Similar slim rods displaying envelope and cristae (i.e., mitochondrial characteristics) appeared to lie freely within the cytoplasm, but this phenomenon might result from adverse section planes and/or artifactual organelle fragmentation during specimen fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>]. It is well established that Parkin controls mitochondrial biogenesis via the modulation of PARIS degradation. PARIS represses the transcription of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Parkin LOF induces PARIS accumulation, down-regulates PGC-1α transcription, and eventually leads to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. By biochemical measn, we found that parkin protein is down-regulated in R274W+/+ myoblasts. We also observed an increase of PARIS and a reduction of the mitochondrial marker Tomm20 in homozygous myoblasts compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-F</xref>]. In addition, we observed that the mRNA of PGC-1α and its target TFAM, a crucial actor in mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as of COX2, a mtDNA-encoded gene [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 G-I</xref>] are reduced in mutant cells.

In mutant fibroblasts we also noticed the accumulation of PARIS protein [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>] and the reduction of PGC-1α mRNA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>]. By high resolution respirometry, we observed a general decrease in the respiratory capacity, detected in the Routine state, complex I and II-dependent respiration, the maximal respiratory capacity as well as the respiration after complex I inhibition (Rot) in homozygous cells compared to wild type cells. Spare respiratory capacity indicates the mitochondrial capability to respond to a chronic mitochondrial insult, which might be the presence of a Parkin mutation, and this parameter was also significantly reduced in the mutant cells [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>]. Finally, we assessed mitochondrial content by imaging and measured a reduction in mitochondrial content in R274W +/+ cell. Interestingly, the overexpression of PGC-1α is sufficient to restore the mitochondria content in mutant fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 G-H</xref>]. Our data may suggest that PARIS upregulation impairs PGC-1α dependent mitochondrial biogenesis in R274W +/+ cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Beside the well-known symptomatology related to tremor, gait, and postural imbalance, PD in humans is characterized by motor symptoms that are not strictly correlated with dopamine depletion in the extrapyramidal system. For example, bilateral muscle weakness and fatigue are often present in PD patients with unilateral parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Cano-de-la-Cuerda et al., 2010</xref>). It is still not clear whether impairments in the muscle are caused by central deficits due to lack of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Frazzitta et al., 2015</xref>), incorrect muscular stimulation and stiffness, or other peripheral causes secondarily linked to PD like ATP depletion, mitochondrial degeneration, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kostić et al., 2016</xref>). Parkin R274W homozygous mice display defects in muscular strength and increased fatigue compared to wild type mice starting from 12 months of age. Accordingly, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis of muscle tissue revealed alterations in the structure and organization of the muscle fibers, with decreased diameter and enlargement of interstitial tissue, similar to observation on R275W <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Coherent with these data, EM analysis of myotubes derived from our R274W+/+ mice regularly showed seriously damaged mitochondria. Most conspicuous were their enlarged, pleomorphic shape, their slim protrusions and virtually isolated slim mitochondrial “rods”nearby. Additionally, muscle cells derived from R274W+/+ mice also displayed alterations in their ability to replicate and fuse, processes that deeply rely on the correct functionality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In fact, myoblasts differentiation and fusion processes strongly rely on ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>). To obtain insight into the mechanisms that link Parkin R274W mutation, impaired mitochondria, and defects in muscle tissue we explored the PARIS-PGC-1α pathway of mitochondrial biogenesis, which is modulated by Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). PGC-1α is recognized as one of the major regulator of mitochondrial content and oxidative metabolism in several tissues, including skeletal muscle (Handschin and Spiegelman, 2006). We noticed that PARIS accumulates in homozygous muscle cells. PARIS accumulation has been put in relation to ROS production that may damage mitochondria and reduce cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bae et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the subsequent downregulation of PGC-1α and its downstream target genes may lead to the reduction in mitochondrial mass that we observed in homozygous myotubes and fibroblasts both by qRT-PCR and biochemical assays. Altogether, these data show that PARIS upregulation due to Parkin R274W mutation impairs mitochondrial biogenesis, reduces oxidative metabolism, and eventually affects myoblast proliferation and fusion. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this pathological cascade may result in reduced muscle fiber diameter and therefore, muscle strength.</p><p id="P22">We observed a significant deterioration of muscle strength only in 12- and 18-months mice, suggesting the occurrence of an age related mechanism. The life expectancy of mice is approximately 24 months. Muscular strength, exercise endurance, muscle volume, and muscle mass are significantly impaired in 18-month-old mice, suggesting the presence of sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Kim and Hwang, 2020</xref>). Aging is one of the main contributing factors for most musculoskeletal diseases, including sarcopenia (Sharma et al., 2023). Ageing is characterized by an increased generation of ROS (Calvani et al., 2013) and lower gene and protein expression of PGC-1α (Joseph et al., 2012). An impaired mitochondrial function and reduced biogenesis may contribute to muscle atrophy observed in ageing (Kubat et al., 2023). The PARIS-PGC-1α axis is reportedly involved in different aspects of skeletal muscle biology, which include the regeneration upon damage, the adaptive response to exercise, the control of fiber typing, and the control of mitochondrial dynamics (Adhihetty et al., 2009; Dinulovic et al., 2016b; Lin et al., 2002). The alteration in PARIS-PGC-1α pathway and the reduction in mitochondrial content observed in Parkin R274W models may eventually exacerbate the age-related sarcopenia.</p><p id="P23">It is well established that adult skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for regeneration endowed by a population of adult resident stem cells, the satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Increasing observations suggest an association between muscle atrophy and satellite cell dysfunction (Biressi and Gopinath, 2015). Particularly, the loss of satellite cells is reportedly associated with age-related skeletal muscle atrophy in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). A large body of evidence indicates that intrinsic and extrinsic satellite cell defects are mediating an impaired regeneration in old muscle (Muñoz-Cánoves et al., 2020). These defects include metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction (García-Prat et al., 2016). The PARIS-PGC-1α axis controls the lineage progression of satellite cells (Dinulovic et al., 2016a) Given the severe proliferative and differentiation dysfunction that we report here for satellite cell-derived Parkin R274W myoblasts, it is tempting to speculate that the Parkin mutation might affect via the PARIS-PGC-1α pathway the satellite cell population and, eventually, accelerate age-related sarcopenia in Parkin R274W mice.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P24">The correct functionality of Parkin is important for mitochondrial biogenesis and tissue functionality not only in the CNS but also in the periphery. The modulation of the PARIS-PGC-1α axis, including downstream target as Nrf-1, Nrf-2, and TFAM may represent a therapeutic target to ameliorate skeletal muscle performances in Parkin-PD patients. Intriguingly, a recent report identified farnesol as a potent inducer of PGC-1α, capable of ameliorating aging-associated muscle wasting through enhanced PARIS farnesylation, thereby relieving PARIS-mediated PGC-1α suppression (Bae et al., 2023). This observation calls for further investigation of this drug in PD models. A clear limitation of this study is that we mainly focused on the role of Parkin in mitochondria biogenesis. Future work will consider the effect of R274W mutation on Parkin-related mitophagy and its impact on muscle physiology. In fact, Parkin -/- mice demonstrated inefficient mitophagy and increased mitochondrial ROS, resulting in the acceleration of skeletal muscle atrophy (Chen et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ito et al., 2022).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplementary figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190404-supplement-supplementary_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d148aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>supplementary figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190404-supplement-supplementary_figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d148aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was partially funded by Fondazione Telethon (TCP14005) and Fondazione Cariplo (2019-3415) to GP.</p></ack><sec id="S25" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="P25">the full data set is available upon reasonable request.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P26"><bold>Author Contributions</bold>: conceptualization M.S. and G.P.; methodology M.S., A.L., MP.C and F.G.; data curation M.S., I.P, M.H, S.B. and G.P.; writing M.S, S.B., and G.P.; funding acquisition G.P..

(B) Schematic overview of Parkin-PARIS-GC-1α pathway. Parkin controls PARIS degradation via the proteasome. PARIS represses the transcription of PGC-1α binding the insulin response sequence (IRS) region of its promoter. PGC-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis as it promotes the transcription of key genes such as the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Parkin loss-of-function induces PARIS accumulation, down-regulates PGC-1α transcription, and eventually leads to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. (C) We analysed wild type and R274W+/+ myotubes for Parkin, PARIS, and Tomm20 content via western blot. The graphs (D-F) show proteins level normalized on β-actin.

(F) We assessed oxygen consumption in wild type and homozygous primary fibroblasts by high resolution respirometry. The graph reports routine respiration, complex I and complex II-dependent respiration (upon treatment with malate, glutamate, ADP and succinate), maximal respiration (maximal uncoupled respiration after uncoupler addition), respiration after inhibition of complex I (upon Rotenone addition), residual oxygen consumption (ROX) due to oxidative side reactions (after addition of antimycin A), and difference between maximal respiration and routine respiration (spare respiratory capacity).
