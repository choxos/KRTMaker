The structure of the HeV N protein adopts the common bi-lobed paramyxoviral N protein fold; the N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains are bisected by an RNA binding cleft containing six RNA nucleotides and are flanked by the N-terminal and C-terminal arms, respectively. In common with other paramyxoviral nucleocapsids, the lateral interface between adjacent N and N<sub>+1</sub> protomers involves electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions mediated primarily through the N-terminal arm and globular domains with minor contribution from the C-terminal arm. However, the HeV N multimeric assembly uniquely identifies an additional interaction between N<sub>+1</sub> and N<sub>-1</sub> protomers. The model presented here broadens the understanding of RNA-bound paramyxoviral nucleocapsid architectures and provides a platform for further insight into the molecular biology of HeV, as well as the development of antiviral interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus <italic>Hendra henipavirus</italic> (HeV) emerged in 1994 as a fatal infectious agent on the Hendra racetracks of Brisbane, Australia, leading to the deaths of 15 horses and one human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Since its discovery, there have been over 65 recognised and suspected outbreaks of HeV along the Australian east coast, with documented annual outbreaks since 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Serological sampling of wild populations has identified pteropid fruit bats as the natural reservoir of HeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. While all recorded spillover events of HeV have occurred in Australia, the natural range of pteropid bats extends much further north into Asia, potentially extending the at-risk area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Indeed, sampling among bats and humans in Africa has uncovered neutralising antibodies in both populations against HeV, as well as fellow genus members <italic>Nipah henipavirus</italic> (NiV) and <italic>Ghanaian bat henipavirus</italic> (GhV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Seropositivity in humans was most common amongst individuals dealing in bat bush meat or inhabiting areas of active deforestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], highlighting the increasing spillover risk of emerging zoonotic viruses due to human encroachment on natural landscapes. HeV infection typically exhibits a predominantly respiratory and neurological tropism, explaining the common symptoms of HeV infection including pulmonary haemorrhage and oedema, encephalitis, and meningitis and carries a mortality rate of 60-75% for both equine and human victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Disease progression is generally rapid and most infected individuals die within days, or in the case of horses are euthanised. However, one human case of recovery and subsequent fatal relapse 14 months after infection has been reported that resembles the brain inflammation seen in persistent <italic>Measles morbillivirus</italic> (MeV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Documented HeV transmission is predominantly through contact with bodily fluids and the data reported on spillover events suggests that inter-equine transmission can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. No direct transmission from bats to humans, or humans to humans, has yet been described, with all human cases the result of contact with infected horses. However, highly productive inter-human transmission of the closely related NiV has been observed in an outbreak with a mortality rate of around 75%, suggesting that similar outbreaks of HeV with inter-human transmission may occur in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The HeV negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome is 18,234 nucleotides long, encodes six genes, and conforms to the paramyxoviral 'rule of six' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The first gene encodes the nucleoprotein (N protein) which associates with the viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs to form the helical nucleocapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The nucleocapsid associates with the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) comprising the large (L) and phospho (P) proteins to form the holonucleocapsid. The N-RNA interaction is critical for virus multiplication as genomic RNA is only recognised by the RdRp as a template for mRNA transcription and genome replication when in the context of the assembled nucleocapsid (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]), and incorporation of genomic RNA into new virions depends on interactions between N protein within the nucleocapsid and the viral matrix (M) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Paramyxoviral nucleocapsids, as well as those from the closely related family <italic>Pneumoviridae,</italic> classically exhibit a flexible, hollow, left-handed helical architecture under electron microscopy (EM), showing a characteristic herringbone pattern on transmission micrographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In these nucleocapsids, neighbouring N protomers laterally interact through their globular domains and completely encapsidate the viral genomic and antigenomic RNA within a continuous RNA binding cleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The N protomer of interest is topographically referred to as the index nucleoprotein (N<sub>i</sub>) while the immediately adjacent protomers upstream and downstream of the N<sub>i</sub> are referred to as index +1 N protein (N<sub>i+1</sub>) or index -1 N protein (N<sub>i-1</sub>), respectively. Each paramyxovirus N protomer covers exactly six RNA bases, which obeys the paramyxovirus 'rule of six', with the RNA bases generally following a 'three in, three out' binding register where three RNA bases are oriented in towards the RNA binding cleft and three RNA bases are oriented out towards the solvent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Each helical turn of the paramyxoviral nucleocapsid comprises approximately 13 N protomers, although the exact number differs between viral species and is not necessarily an integer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P8">In addition to the extended helical nucleocapsid architecture, other atypical nucleocapsid assemblies have been observed in recent years. The formation of N protein-RNA ring complexes has been described for recombinantly-expressed nucleoproteins from various viruses, such as decameric N-RNA rings of <italic>Human orthopneumovirus</italic> (RSV) and <italic>Vesiculovirus Indiana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], undecameric N-RNA rings of <italic>Lyssavirus rabies</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], and tridecameric N-RNA rings of <italic>Mammalian orthorubulavirus 5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, features that resemble N-RNA rings were also observed packaged within RSV virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, so-called 'clam-shell' nucleocapsid assemblies have been observed from recombinantly expressed nucleoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. These clam-shells are formed by two helical nucleocapsids engaged in back-to-back stacking and have been found for <italic>Avian orthoavulavirus 1</italic> (formerly Newcastle disease virus; NDV), <italic>Murine respirovirus,</italic> and NiV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Structural information on the HeV N protein and nucleocapsid assembly is scarce, collectively no more than a handful of negative-stain EM micrographs of isolated HeV nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] or recombinantly expressed HeV nucleocapsid-like filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] exist. While these confirm the similar herringbone morphology of HeV nucleocapsids to those of closely related viruses, a high-resolution reconstruction of the HeV N protein and nucleocapsid assembly has not yet been determined. Here, we report for the first time the HeV N protein structure in the context of a double-ring assembly as determined through cryoEM from recombinantly expressed HeV N protein. The approach taken reveals the full HeV Ncore structure (residues 1-394) and further elucidates established and novel paramyxoviral N-N and N-RNA interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Architecture of the HeV N protein-RNA assembly</title><p id="P10">HeV N protein was recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified through IMAC using an N-terminally fused hexahistidine-SUMO affinity purification tag, followed by proteolytic removal of the affinity purification tag and subsequent SEC purification (Supplementary Figure S1). The purified HeV N sample was applied to cryo-grids and automated data collection was performed, including on-the-fly (OTF) pre-processing of the 3548 collected micrographs (Supplementary Figure S2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The micrographs contained a range of particles exhibiting circular and squat ring morphologies. Selection of these particles followed by 2D and 3D classification in RELION [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] revealed that these morphologies represent different orientations of the same multimeric N protein assembly, viewed across a 14-fold and 2-fold axis of symmetry, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3). Subsequent 3D refinement of a curated particle stack comprising 5638 particles and using D14 symmetry resulted in a 3.5 Å resolution EM density map, revealing a previously uncharacterised multimeric nucleoprotein assembly (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Figure S4). The final map is a dimer of tetradecameric rings which enabled model building resulting in the first reported HeV N protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary Table S1). In the HeV N protein assembly, two rings stack 'bottom-to-bottom', where the globular N-terminal domains (NTDs) intercalate to form a dimer of tetradecamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>). Each tetradecameric ring is topped with the C-terminal arms (Ct-arms) which cover parts of the globular C terminal domains (CTDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>). The N-terminal arm (Nt-arm) lies completely within the particle's central cavity where it crosses over the NTD and interfaces with the back face of the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structure of the HeV N protein</title><p id="P11">The EM map of the HeV N protein assembly fully resolved the N protein core (Ncore), however no density was observed in the map corresponding to the intrinsically disordered C-terminal N protein tail (Ntail, Ala395-Val532). The HeV Ncore structure follows the common bi-lobed paramyxoviral N protein fold and includes the Nt-arm (Met1-Thr32), NTD (Thr33-Glu260), CTD (Glu261-His370), and Ct-arm (His371-Ala394), as well as bound <italic>E. coli</italic> host-derived RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d-e</xref>). Both the Nt- and Ct-arm are linked to the globular domains by flexible loops and each forms an alpha helix in proximity to the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). The N protein surface area is overall hydrophilic, with three prominent hydrophobic patches that are covered by neighbouring N protomers in the assembly (Supplementary Figure S5, Supplementary Figure S6). The Nt-arm alpha helix (α1) contains a strongly negatively charged, solvent-exposed region facing the central cavity consisting of residues Asp3, Asp6, and Glu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HeV N - N protein interactions in the multimeric assembly</title><p id="P12">The HeV N protein double-ring assembly is formed through extensive lateral interactions in each tetradecameric ring as well as intercalating interactions between two tetradecameric rings. The lateral interfaces consist of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and are mediated primarily through the Nt-arms, NTDs, and CTDs of two neighbouring N protomers, with contributions from the Ct-arm, over a total buried surface area of ~2930 Å<sup>2</sup>, calculated via PDBe PISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] (Supplementary Figure S5, Supplementary Figure S6). At a calculated buried surface area of ~1195 Å<sup>2</sup>, the N<sub>i</sub> - N<sub>i+1</sub> interface mediated by globular domains represents just over a third of the total buried surface area between the neighbouring protomers. The globular domain interface consists of extensive electrostatic interactions, with the N<sub>i</sub> surface containing mostly positively charged patches and the N<sub>i+1</sub> surface mostly negatively charged patches (Supplementary Figure S5). While the contribution of the Ct-arm is minor, with a calculated buried surface area of only ~340 Å<sup>2</sup>, the Nt-arm contributes extensively to the lateral interactions. At a calculated buried surface area of ~1740 Å<sup>2</sup>, this interface represents just over half of the total lateral interface between N<sub>i</sub> and N<sub>i+1</sub>. Aside from electrostatic patches, a conserved hydrophobic region consisting of a triad of aromatic residues (Phe267, Phe268, and Tyr301) in the CTD of the N<sub>i</sub> protomer and Phe11 in α1 of Nt-arm N<sub>i+1</sub> protomer forms a key interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). A further hydrophobic cleft in the N<sub>i</sub> NTD (Tyr80, Ser81, Leu87, Val162, Val165, Ile166, Ile234, and Val249) is occupied by the N<sub>i+1</sub> Nt-arm loop Ala27-Thr33. Within this N<sub>i+1</sub> Nt-arm loop, residue Leu31 is buried inside a pocket in the N<sub>i</sub> NTD consisting of Asn43, Arg48, Tyr80, Glu82, Met158, Leu161, Val162, and Val165 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Beyond the extensive N<sub>i+1</sub> Nt-arm interface with the Ni NTD and CTD, a minor contact exists between the utmost amino-terminal residues of the N<sub>i+1</sub> Nt-arm (Met1, Ser2, Ile4, and Phe5) and the N<sub>i-1</sub> Ct-arm loop region Gln376-Lys381 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This N<sub>+1</sub> - N<sub>-1</sub> interface represents a novel interaction that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been described in the literature for paramyxoviral nucleocapsids and will be referred to as the 'elbow interface'. Since the elbow interface only has a calculated buried surface area of ~80 Å<sup>2</sup>, it is unlikely to contribute strongly to N-N interactions. A defining feature of this HeV N protein double-ring assembly is the gear-wheel interface between the two tetradecameric rings. This intercalation zone consists solely of residues in the NTDs of N protomers in the top ring and N protomers in the bottom ring (indicated by the lower-case n) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The N<sub>i</sub> protomer contacts two protomers in the bottom ring (n<sub>i</sub> and n<sub>i+1</sub>), with a total calculated buried surface area of ~545 Å<sup>2</sup>. A clear, reciprocal electrostatic interface exists between N<sub>i</sub> and n<sub>i+1</sub> with the residues Lys120, Glu123, and Glu124 where the two Glu residues in Ni form a tab that interacts with the Lys residue in n<sub>i+1</sub> and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). The poor electron density surrounding loop Met114-Asp119 forced the stubbing of side chains and, accordingly, these were modelled as alanines (indicated in italics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b-c</xref>). An electrostatic interaction may exist between the N<sub>i</sub> Asp157 and n<sub>i</sub> <italic>Arg116,</italic> as they are in proximity and there is ample space for the Arg side chain. Similarly, N<sub>i</sub> residues Ser44 and Glu46 form a patch that may interact with ni residues <italic>Met114</italic> and <italic>Glu115</italic> which are in close proximity. The absence of clear electron density neither supports nor refutes these putative interactions and improved local resolution may further elucidate the intercalation zone and increase the calculated buried surface area.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>HeV N - RNA interactions</title><p id="P13">The HeV N assembly map showed clear density for single-stranded RNA in the RNA-binding cleft that separates the NTD and CTD, which was modelled as a poly-uridine; one hexa-uridine per N protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Figure S7). The RNA binding cleft contains hydrophobic patches and is mostly positively charged near the RNA backbone and negatively charged near the RNA bases (Supplementary Figure S5). The RNA molecule is oriented in the conventional 'three-base in, three-base out' similar to other paramyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. This orientation is facilitated by a 180° turn of the RNA backbone every three nucleotides. In the case of HeV N, the 3'-most three-base stack is oriented in towards the RNA-binding cleft while the 5'-most three-base stack are oriented towards the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Figure S7. The charged RNA-binding cleft consists of a cleft floor and two ridges that follow the orientation of the RNA chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a-c</xref>). Residue segments Thr181-Gln200, containing α8, in the NTD and the loop Ser344-Tyr354 in the CTD form the solvent-facing cleft ridges. The cleft floor consists of the NTD-CTD-connecting loop Glu260-Ala265 continuing into α12 until Arg272 as well as the α14-containing stretch Ser317-Gly326. Within the RNA-binding cleft, a series of conserved basic (Lys178, Arg192, Arg193, Arg352) and polar (Thr185, Gln199, Gln200, Tyr258, Gln319, Ser344, Tyr354) residues likely interact with the RNA chain through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b-d</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P14">Adjacent to and contiguous with the RNA binding cleft floor is a large cavity surrounding the inward facing three-base stack flanked by the N<sub>i</sub> NTD and CTD as well as α13 of the N<sub>i+1</sub> CTD and α1 of the N<sub>i+1</sub> Nt-arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). While the modelled RNA bases are all uridines, this cavity - here called the 'in-base cavity' - is sufficiently spacious to accommodate the larger purine bases and, correspondingly, Ni residues Tyr258, Glu260, Glu261, Phe268, Ser344, and Met345, and N<sub>i+1</sub> residue Lys321 may be involved in interactions with these bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Comparison with other paramyxoviral N protein assemblies</title><p id="P15">The HeV N protein fold resembles that of NiV N protein, its closest relative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The NiV N protein structure has been solved recently through cryoEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and earlier through X-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Structural alignment of the HeV N protein model with the NiV N models reveals some key differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The global RMSDs for the HeV N protein structure compared to that of the cryoEM-derived, RNA-bound NiV N protein structure and that of the NiV N protein structure solved through X-ray crystallography are very similar (0.756 Å and 0.783 Å, respectively). In the NiV X-ray structure, however, the NTDs and CTDs are rotated approximately 25° with respect to each other compared to the HeV N and NiV cryoEM structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] resulting in a shift of the CTD of up to 15.5 Å at its greatest extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a</xref>). This rotation in the crystal structure is likely induced by binding to the P protein Nt region which keeps the N monomers in an 'open' RNA-free conformation (N<sup>0</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Three key differences appear from the alignment of HeV N with the two NiV N structures. Firstly, the HeV N Nt- and Ct-arms in the double-ring assembly are shifted compared to the Nt- and Ct-arms in the NiV N helical assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8b</xref>). Helical spiralling of a single split tetradecameric ring would generate a nucleocapsid-like helix and inevitably requires some minor conformational changes. The flexible nature of the Nt- and Ct-arm put them forward as suitable candidates to provide those changes. Secondly, the solvent facing NTD alpha-helix 5 and its succeeding loop (α5-loop) are also shifted compared to the homologous helix-loop in the NiV structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8b</xref>). In fact, this helix-loop region exhibits significant structural and sequence variability among paramyxoviruses. Both its position and length are highly variable among the N proteins of closely related paramyxoviruses, including <italic>Mammalian orthorubulavirus 5</italic> (formerly human parainfluenza virus 5; PIV5), MeV, NDV, NiV, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. For example, the HeV N protein α5-loop region contains two amino acid substitutions compared with the NiV N protein; L108V and E137D, both of which are solvent exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Whether there is a functional relevance to these substitutions is unknown, however in the context of a helical nucleocapsid the α5-loop region is the main solvent exposed section of the N protomer and may be important for interactions with the RdRp complex during transcription and replication, or could potentially interface in-phase with the M protein lattice during virion assembly, as proposed for other paramyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the α5-loop region has also been identified as the main interface in intercalating interactions in the HeV N protein assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), as well as in clam-shell formation in NDV, NiV, and SeV nucleocapsid-like filaments (NLFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The intercalating interface observed in the HeV N double-ring assembly suffered from local poorly resolved electron density (Supplementary Figure S4), which abrogated confident model building and forced the stubbing of residue side chains for <italic>Met114, Glu115, Arg116, Arg117,</italic> and <italic>Asp119</italic>. This poor local density may reflect the existence of weak interactions within the interface since stronger interactions would rigidify the loop side chains and by extension produce clearer density. The modelled alanines likely do not accurately portray the potential for extensive interactions these residues may engage in with neighbouring N protomers. Indeed, residues homologous to these have been identified as putative drivers of clam-shell interactions in the paramyxoviruses NDV, NiV, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Focussed refinement on this area failed to improve map resolution, and likely reflects − in part − the inherent flexibility of both this loop and the intercalating interface. Similarly, local resolution around the HeV N protein Ct-arm α17 was poor and while an alpha helix could confidently be built into the density, a number of side chains were also stubbed and modelled as alanines. Finally, more Ct-arm residues are resolved in the helical NiV N protein structure than in the HeV N double-ring structure, while the HeV N protein structure shows the very N-terminal Met1 residue where the NiV N protein structure cuts off at Ile4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Comparison of the cognate region in protein structures from related viruses revealed that the extreme N-terminal residues are either distended away towards the central cavity as in NDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] or are completely absent as for PIV5, NiV, MeV, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c-f</xref>). The shift in orientation or complete absence of the extreme N-terminal residues may be due to the presence of remaining N-terminal affinity tags that limit local cryoEM resolution. Indeed, an N-terminal affinity purification tag remained attached to resolved N protein structures for PIV5, NDV, NiV, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] while the MeV purification used a C-terminal tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The tag-free N-terminal residues in the HeV double-ring assembly were identified as a potential minor interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This elbow interface likely exists in NiV N protein assemblies as well, and the data suggest a similar interface may occur in more distantly related viruses such as PIV5 and MeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">The emergence of novel pathogens such as HeV is accompanied by gaps in fundamental knowledge and technical resources.

The N protein consists of an Ncore region and an intrinsically disordered Ntail, and, as is common for paramyxoviral N proteins, only the Ncore region was well resolved with no clear cryoEM density representing the Ntail. The HeV N protein shares around 92% amino acid identity with the NiV N protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The crystal structure for NiV N was solved as a truncated protein - missing both the Nt- and Ct-arms - and in complex with the Nt region of the NiV P protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. More recently, the full NiV Ncore structure was solved through cryoEM from helical particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P20">Structural alignment of the final HeV N protein model (PDB: 8CBW) with both the NiV N protein crystal structure (PDB: 4CO6) and cryoEM structure (PDB: 7NT5) revealed a globally similar protein fold, with some key differences. The most prominent of these differences is the approximately 25° rotation and up to 15.5 Å shift in the CTD, which is the result from the open, apo-configuration of the P protein-bound NiV N (P-N<sup>0</sup>) complex in the NiV N crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Since the cryoEM NiV N structure is RNA-bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], it offers a better comparison with the similarly RNA-bound HeV N structure. A slight shift in the orientations of both the Nt- and Ct-arms likely stems from the differences in overall multimeric morphology, since the NiV structure originates from a helical segment with ~13.2 N protomers per helical turn, while the HeV structure is drawn from a 14 N protomer-containing flat ring within the double-ring particle. Helical spiralling of a single, split tetradecameric ring would generate a helix resembling that of NiV and inevitably incur some minor conformational changes likely engendered by the flexible Nt- and Ct-arms whilst maintain a relatively static globular domain fold.</p><p id="P21">Furthermore, the NiV N Ct-arm has resolved four additional residues compared to the HeV N protein structure, while the HeV N protein structure resolves the extreme N-terminal Met residue where the NiV N protein structure terminates at Ile4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Similarly, the extreme N-terminal residues are often absent in N protein structures from other, related viruses, including PIV5, MeV, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The resolution of the extreme N-terminal residues in the HeV N structure enabled the identification of a novel, albeit likely weak, interaction surface between the N<sub>i+1</sub> and N<sub>i-1</sub> protomers here called the elbow interface. The presence of an elbow interface in the N protein assemblies of PIV5, MeV, NiV, and SeV is likely obscured due to the absence of the extreme N-terminal residues in these structures. Where the expression and purification pipeline for HeV N included an affinity-tag removal step to generate a native protein sequence, those for the viral N proteins listed above did not. As a result, the presence of remaining, unstructured, N-terminal affinity tags may locally limit cryoEM resolution and fail to depict the elbow interface. This hypothesis is further supported by the N protein structure of NDV which does resolve the extreme N-terminal residues, but these face away from the putative elbow interface and towards the central cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], likely due to the presence of an N-terminal affinity tag.</p><p id="P22">Finally, the solvent facing HeV NTD alpha-helix 5 (α5) and its succeeding loop show significant structural and sequence variability among paramyxoviruses and its position and length are highly variable among the N proteins of closely related paramyxoviruses, including MeV, NDV, NiV, PIV5, and SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Compared to the cryoEM NiV N structure, the HeV α5-loop region contains two amino acid substitutions compared with the NiV N protein; L108V and E137D, both of which are solvent exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].

Symmetrised reconstructions often struggle to resolve regions of structural or compositional heterogeneity, and their signal may be diluted compared to the less heterogenic regions. In the reconstruction of the HeV N protein assembly, some of these heterogenic regions, foremost Met114-Asp119, are poorly resolved and as a result hindered confident model building of side chain residues. The electron density in the RNA binding cleft, identified through comparison with homologous structures, enabled <italic>de novo</italic> modelling of a hexameric RNA chain in the asymmetric unit. The electron density unambiguously identified the RNA backbone and the general location of the bases, but not their identities. This is to be expected due to both the presence of random host-derived RNA and symmetrised averaging of that RNA. Individual HeV N protein double-ring assemblies are unlikely to have complete occupancy by bacterial host-derived RNA over each of the 28 N protomers. Any RNA-free N protomers in the assembly would be outnumbered by RNA-bound protomers and as a result are averaged out against them, evidenced by the clear RNA density. Non-symmetrised particles would likely shed more light on both the uniformity of RNA occupancy as well as regions of structural flexibility with the requirement for larger particle stacks.</p><p id="P24">The RNA occupying the RNA binding cleft was modelled as one hexa-uridine per N protomer, adhering to the convention for paramyxoviral N proteins. The typical 3' to 5' 'three in, three out' base stacking orientation observed in other paramyxoviral N proteins is also found in the HeV N assembly, where bases 1, 2, and 3 face in towards the protein and bases 4, 5, and 6 are solvent exposed. Furthermore, a series of basic (Lys178, Arg192, Arg193, Arg352) and polar (Thr185, Gln199, Gln200, Tyr258, Gln319, Ser344, Tyr354) residues were identified as putatively interacting with the RNA chain through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. While most of these interactions are with the RNA backbone, a key, conserved interaction occurs between RNA bases 5 and 6 and the amino acid dyad Gln199 and Gln200 which HeV N shares with the N proteins from MeV, NiV, and PIV5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Additionally, a conserved in-base cavity is contiguous with the RNA binding cleft, consisting of two neighbouring N protomers and can accommodate larger purines in the in-base stack comprising nucleotides 1, 2, and 3. Putative interactions with residues Tyr258, Glu260, Glu261, Phe268, Lys 321, Ser344, and Met345 may facilitate purine binding where pyrimidines are too distant. A homologous cavity exists in closely related N protein assemblies, such as NiV, NDV, and MeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="P25">While N-RNA interactions are thought to be sequence non-specific and HeV N model building was done in a sequence-agnostic manner, some evidence for MeV suggests RNA encapsidation exhibits a preference for purine-rich sequences and importantly, the antigenomic leader sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Similar preferences for purine rich and leader-specific RNA were also observed for the more distantly related RSV and VSV, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Indeed, the HeV genomic and antigenomic leader sequences are purine rich as well, with ~70% and ~63% purines for the genomic and antigenomic leaders, respectively. Moreover, the terminal six nucleotides of the HeV genomic and antigenomic leaders are identical (5'-ACCGAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Additional interactions with these purine bases both in the in-base cavity as well as in the region of bases 5 and 6 may drive this difference in specificity and be important factors in the initial stages of 5' encapsidation of the nascent genome as it emerges from the RdRp complex. As a result, the in-base cavity and the RNA binding cleft may present a target for the development of therapeutics that abrogate the critical step of RNA-encapsidation in the paramyxoviral life cycle.</p><p id="P26">HeV, discovered in 1994, is the type species for the genus <italic>henipavirus</italic> in the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].

The recent discovery of a novel HeV strain in Australia, called HeV-var [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], as well as the addition of four new henipaviral species in the past 3 years, highlights the needs for continued surveillance and research into this genus and HeV specifically. With around 88% sequence identity for the HeV-var N gene sequence compared to the HeV reference strain (NCBI RefSeq: NC_001906), a total of 18 amino acid substitutions were found of which 13 lie in the intrinsically disordered Ntail region (Supplementary Figure S8). Five substitutions are located in the Ncore region; S2G, D6E, and S13N in the Nt-arm, L153M in the NTD, and S386P in the Ct-arm (Supplementary Figure S8). Both D6E and S13N face the solvent of the double-ring central hole, however Ser2 forms part of the putative elbow interface between the N<sub>i-1</sub> and N<sub>i+1</sub> neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The S2G substitution in HeV-var could abrogate this elbow interface. The NTD-located L153M substitution sits at the upper surface of the NTD facing the exterior solvent and is unlikely to be involved in intercalation zone interactions. Finally, the S386P substitution in the Ct-arm faces the solvent in the double-ring assembly, but likely forms part of the interface between successive helical turns in the nucleocapsid assembly. These interactions are thought to contribute minimally to nucleocapsid stability due to the nucleocapsid's inherent flexibility and the observation that each helical turn consists of a non-integral number of N protomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, no substitutions were described in the α5-loop region, which normally exhibits significant structural and sequence variability among paramyxoviruses. Taken together, the amino acid substitutions in the Ncore observed in the HeV variant strain likely have a minimal impact on HeV nucleocapsid formation and architecture. The large number of substitutions in the intrinsically disordered Ntail region, especially towards the C-terminus, could indicate a changed interaction with the RdRp complex and M proteins however these assumptions still await experimental validation.</p><p id="P27">The dimer of tetrameric rings that form the HeV N protein double-ring assembly is, to our best knowledge, a unique paramyxoviral N protein architecture that lacks a formal description in the current literature. However, other paramyxoviral N protein architectures have been observed that are reminiscent of the double-ring assembly. N protein clamshell interfaces have been described, in detail, for the paramyxoviruses NDV, NiV, and SeV NLFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. In these cases, recombinant expression of N proteins revealed clamshell interfaces as both discrete particles reminiscent of, but distinct from, the double-ring assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] as well as part of a so-called double-headed helix; two anti-parallel NLFs stacked bottom-to-bottom and following the NLF's helical register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. While a similar loop region is involved in these interactions in all three, the specifics of the clamshell architectures differ between the three reports. In the case of NDV, the N protomers that constitute the clamshell are positioned vertically in line and do not intercalate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Those described for SeV appear to have two forms, called 'closed' and 'hyper-closed', where the level of intercalation is higher for the hyper-closed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Finally, the NiV clamshell exhibits extensive intercalation similar to the HeV double-ring assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, while in each of these cases the two faces of the clamshell follow the helical register of the NLF, an additional small population of NiV clamshells have been observed where the ~13.2 N protomer helix is capped with a flat tetradecameric ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. This ring closely matches one half of the HeV double-ring assembly. Importantly, the presence of double-headed helices was confirmed from virus-extracted nucleocapsids of SeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and the inability to form double-headed nucleocapsids was detrimental to EGFP reporter gene expression in an NDV minigenome-based replicon assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P28">The double decameric N protein rings of RSV, a member of the family <italic>Pneumoviridae,</italic> has recently been resolved through cryoEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. In this RSV N protein assembly, akin to HeV, two N protein rings stack in a bottom-to-bottom orientation. Interestingly, the two rings do not intercalate to an appreciable degree and instead interact solely through the tips of the NTDs. The RSV N<sub>i</sub> thus only interacts with one N protomer in the opposite ring (n<sub>i</sub>) where in the HeV N double-ring assembly the N<sub>i</sub> protomer interacts with two N protomers (n<sub>i</sub> and n<sub>i+1</sub>). As a consequence, the RSV double-ring assembly exhibits ten apertures along the interface between the two rings that made up of the NTDs of N<sub>i</sub>, N<sub>i-1</sub>, n<sub>i</sub>, and n<sub>i+1</sub> which are over 13 Å wide at their narrowest point Interestingly, a recent paper describes the presence of single-faced closed-ring N protein assemblies inside RSV virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Although of lower resolution due to the use of cryo-ET, these rings bear a striking resemblance to the single and double decameric rings observed for recombinantly expressed RSV N protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] and indeed one tetradecameric half of the HeV double-ring assembly. Their abundance in RSV virions hints at a potential physiological relevance. While the occupancy and identity of RNA in these virion-enclosed rings was not confirmed, it is known that in RSV-infected cells short, 21 to 25 nucleotide-long RNAs generated from the genomic leader and trailer sequences are among the most abundant viral RNAs present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Furthermore, some of these RNAs are resistant to nuclease treatment, indicating they may be encapsidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>].</p><p id="P29">The occurrence of N protein double-rings and the related clamshells in recombinantly expressed N protein samples could be an artefactual result of the method of sample generation. However, the presence of clamshells in virion-extracted nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and of N protein ring assemblies inside virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] suggests otherwise. A picture emerges where the double-ring assembly may be indicative of one or multiple of a number of viral processes.</p><p id="P30">Firstly, it is hypothesised that the occurrence of clamshell interfaces both protects the viral genome from nuclease and protease attack and drives the inclusion of multiple copies of the viral genome into nascent virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, these clamshells appear to join only the 5' ends, which are the first to emerge from the RdRp during genome replication and may be the most vulnerable to degradation. Furthermore, polyploidy is increasingly recognised in a wide range of members of the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] and clamshell interfaces may explain this occurrence at least partially. The double-ring resembles these clamshells, in particular the flat ring of the semi-spiral clamshell interface found in NiV N assemblies, and the double-ring assembly may therefore be a by-product of the viral need for genomic 5' nucleocapsid capping.</p><p id="P31">Secondly, the high abundance of complementary leader and trailer RNAs in virus-infected cells could result in the activation of the innate immune response. The encapsidation of these sequences is hinted at for RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], which could shield them from detection by the innate immune system. Interestingly, the 56 nt-long HeV leader sequence, which is transcribed and separated from the mRNA transcripts during the RdRp transcription mode, falls within the occupancy range for a single tetradecameric ring (84 nt). This purine-rich sequence is also likely preferentially encapsidated over RNA chains with an even purine-pyrimidine ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. The HeV trailer sequence is shorter than the leader and similarly rich in purine bases. An antagonistic function in stress granule formation and cellular apoptosis and has been reported for the (released) trailer sequence in SeV and RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and a similar function could exist for the HeV trailer. Whether putative encapsidation of the trailer aids or hinders this function is unclear, but encapsidation of both the leader and the trailer could permit inclusion into progeny virions and subsequent release in newly infected cells to perform their suggested antagonistic functions without immediate the requirement for viral RNA transcription.</p><p id="P32">Thirdly, single or double N-RNA rings such as the HeV double-ring assembly, could play a role in nucleating liquid-liquid phase separation for biomolecular condensates and aid in the formation of viral transcription/replication centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Evidence has been found for this process in RSV and has recently been investigated in detail for MuV where a combination of cryo-ET, fluorescence microscopy, and mass spectrometry reveal a stress-induced modulation of phase-separated N-P complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. A similar role may exist for the HeV double-ring assembly during phase separation in HeV infected cells.</p><p id="P33">Finally, the HeV N protein double-ring, and indeed N protein rings observed elsewhere, may reflect the need for short-term, reversible storage of N protomers in the absence of abundant P protein chaperones. Indeed, the P protein engages in extensive interactions with N protomers to maintain them in an open, apo-state (N<sup>0</sup>). Re-initiation of transcription by the RdRp complex is inefficient and as a result viral mRNA abundance is inversely correlated to the distance from the genomic 3'-end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>]. Consequently, the abundance of non-nucleocapsid-bound N protein is likely much higher than that of P protein and there is the potential for excessive N protein concentrations inside the infected cell. The formation of double-ring assemblies, either RNA-bound or in the apo-state, could therefore provide a short-term, metastable, multimeric N protein storage where P protein shuttles between them and the RdRp complex during active encapsidation of nascent genomic or antigenomic RNA.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cloning <italic>Hendra henipavirus</italic> N gene into bacterial expression vectors</title><p id="P34">The HeV N gene sequence was taken from the reference <italic>Hendra henipavirus</italic> genome (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_001906.3), codon-optimised for recombinant expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> hosts, flanked by 5’ <italic>Bam</italic>HI and 3' <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites, and supplied in pTwist (Twist Bioscience).
