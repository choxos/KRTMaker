Here we determined the effect on 5-HT neurochemistry of discontinuation from the SSRI paroxetine. Paroxetine was administered repeatedly to mice (once daily, 12 days versus saline controls) and then either continued or discontinued for up to 5 days. Whereas tissue levels of 5-HT and/or its metabolite 5-HIAA tended to decrease during continuous paroxetine, levels increased above controls after discontinuation, notably in hippocampus. In microdialysis experiments continuous paroxetine elevated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT and this effect fell to saline control levels on discontinuation. However, depolarisation (high potassium)-evoked 5-HT release was reduced by continuous paroxetine but increased above controls post-discontinuation. Extracellular hippocampal 5-HIAA also decreased during continuous paroxetine and increased above controls post-discontinuation. Next, immunohistochemistry experiments found that paroxetine discontinuation increased Fos expression in midbrain 5-HT neurons, adding further evidence for a hyperexcitable 5-HT system. The latter effect was recapitulated by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist administration although gene expression analysis could not confirm altered expression of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors following paroxetine discontinuation. Finally, in behavioural experiments paroxetine discontinuation increased anxiety-like behaviour, which partially correlated in time with the measures of increased 5-HT function. In summary, this study finds that SSRI discontinuation triggers a rebound activation of 5-HT neurons across a range of experiments. This effect is reminiscent of neural changes associated with various psychotropic drug withdrawal states, suggesting a common unifying mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the pharmacological treatment of major depression and anxiety-related disorders, as well as a range of other common and disabling neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite their high therapeutic value, abrupt cessation of treatment with an SSRI can produce a debilitating set of psychological and somatic symptoms including heightened anxiety, sleep disruption and sensory disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. These symptoms are commonly referred to as a ‘discontinuation’ rather than ‘withdrawal’ syndrome, in part due to SSRIs not being associated with compulsive use, tolerance and craving, and appear within days of treatment cessation. In a recent observational study half of patients experienced the discontinuation syndrome and many reported that their symptoms were severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], suggesting a greater clinical problem than previously recognised. This adverse effect of treatment cessation is common to all SSRIs as well as other antidepressants, but the risk of discontinuation syndrome differs between drugs. In particular, paroxetine was estimated to be 10 to 100 times more likely to induce a discontinuation syndrome than other SSRIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Notably, the mechanisms underpinning SSRI discontinuation are currently unknown.</p><p id="P3">Emerging evidence suggests that SSRI discontinuation occurs across species, which offers opportunities for mechanistic studies. Specifically, rats administered chronic citalopram demonstrated increased startle responsivity within 2 days of discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In addition, we recently found that mice discontinued from repeated treatment with paroxetine exhibited altered behaviour on the elevated plus maze (EPM) test of anxiety 2 days post-discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. There is a strong evidence linking certain discontinuation symptoms such as anxiety with changes in brain 5-HT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Moreover, since the primary target of SSRIs is the 5-HT transporter, and since 5-HT neurons are well known to adapt to continuous SSRI exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], further changes in 5-HT function during SSRI discontinuation seem likely, as speculated in earlier reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, the effect of SSRI discontinuation on the 5-HT system has been little investigated to date.</p><p id="P4">In one of the few such studies (that was not in itself directed at discontinuation mechanisms) carried out 30 years ago, continuous administration of fluoxetine exposure caused a decrease in the 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA in hippocampus and other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, a striking increase in 5-HIAA was evident over 2 weeks following treatment cessation. Similar findings were later observed in mice administered citalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. It is now well known that continuous SSRI treatment causes an adaptive fall in 5-HT metabolism and synthesis, an effect likely mediated through indirect activation of 5-HT autoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Although changes in 5-HT metabolism/synthesis do not always model 5-HT release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], these early findings with fluoxetine and citalopram are suggestive of a rebound increase in 5-HT function over days following discontinuation. Notably, evidence of rebound increases in neural function have been observed after withdrawal from various psychotropic drugs including morphine, benzodiazepines and alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], suggesting potential parallels between the mechanisms of cessation of treatment with these different psychotropic drugs.</p><p id="P5">Against this background the current study investigated the effect of paroxetine discontinuation on 5-HT function in mice using a combination of neurochemical, immunohistochemical and behavioural approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P6">C57BL/6J male mice (7 weeks; Charles River) were habituated to the holding facility for one week prior to use.

Experiments followed the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and ARRIVE guidelines. We did not use a mixed sex design because in our recent study for reasons female mice did not demonstrate behavioural evidence of SSRI discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. This possibly reflects recent clinical findings that compared to women men were more likely to experience discontinuation symptoms, and symptoms are more likely to be severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Drug treatment</title><p id="P7">Mice were allocated to treatment groups by stratified randomisation.

In contrast, on discontinuation day 5 the performance of mice on the EPM was not different from continued paroxetine or saline controls (open arm time: F<sub>(2,33)</sub>=1.451, p=0.2490; open arm entries: F<sub>(2,33)</sub>=1.100, p=0.3449; head dips: F<sub>(2,33)</sub>=2.422, p=0.1043; distance: F<sub>(2,33)</sub>=2.588, p=0.0908; for post hoc analysis see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Overall, these data indicate that the rebound increase in 5-HT function observed on discontinuation day 2 was associated with increased anxiety-like behaviour. However, this temporal correlation was not apparent on discontinuation day 5.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Abrupt cessation of a course of treatment with an SSRI is often associated with a disabling discontinuation syndrome (see Introduction), which is currently of unknown cause and little studied. Here we found that across experiments, abrupt cessation of treatment with paroxetine was associated with evidence of increased 5-HT neuronal function. Specifically, paroxetine discontinuation; i) increased tissue levels of 5-HIAA and 5-HT, especially in hippocampus <italic>ex vivo</italic> (without altering dopamine or its metabolite DOPAC), ii) increased extracellular 5-HIAA in hippocampus <italic>in vivo</italic>, iii) increased depolarisation-evoked release of hippocampal 5-HT <italic>in vivo</italic>, and iv) increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in 5-HT neurons (TPH2-immunolabelled) in the DRN <italic>ex vivo</italic>. These effects occurred during a 5 day discontinuation period, with some (evoked 5-HT release, increased c-Fos expression) being already detected after 2 days. Finally, several experiments observed a predicted decrease in 5-HT neuronal function in mice receiving continued paroxetine that preceded the rebound increase.</p><p id="P30">The emergence of these discontinuation effects is consistent with the short half-life of paroxetine in rodents (t<sub>1/2</sub>=6.3 h, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]) as well as paroxetine having non-linear metabolism kinetics and inhibiting its own metabolising enzyme (CYP2D6) such that when plasma paroxetine levels fall its metabolism increases and its washout is accelerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The timing also fits with behavioural effects appearing within 2 days of paroxetine discontinuation as observed in the present and a recent study in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], as well as previous studies in depressed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Moreover, earlier studies reported increased 5-HT metabolism/synthesis in rodent hippocampus and other brain regions within days of discontinuation from fluoxetine or escitalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Here, the rebound increase in 5-HT neuron function was not investigated beyond 5 days after discontinuation but the latter studies on 5-HT metabolism/synthesis suggest that the rebound effect may last several weeks.</p><p id="P31">A plausible explanation for the rebound increase in 5-HT transmission following paroxetine cessation is removal of the constant suppression of 5-HT neurons produced during repeated exposure to the drug, mediated by negative 5-HT feedback mechanisms. That these feedback mechanisms were operational during continuous paroxetine was evident both as reduced 5-HT metabolism and reduced depolarisation-evoked release of 5-HT in hippocampus. Previous studies also report reduced brain 5-HT synthesis and metabolism in rodents chronically exposed to paroxetine and other SSRIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The negative feedback effects of continuous SSRI administration likely result from the inhibition of 5-HT uptake causing a sustained elevation in extracellular 5-HT. Here, continuous paroxetine increased extracellular 5-HT 2-3 fold in hippocampus in accord with previous findings in this and other brain regions including the DRN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Increased extracellular 5-HT will activate various 5-HT feedback mechanisms including somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors and terminal 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> autoreceptors, and potentially 5-HT receptors located on postsynaptic neurons that suppress the firing of 5-HT neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Indeed, SSRI-induced decreases in 5-HT neuronal activity and synthesis/metabolism can be attenuated by 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Hence, a likely scenario is that on abrupt cessation of SSRI administration and reversal of 5-HT transporter inhibition, extracellular 5-HT rapidly falls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) relieving inhibitory 5-HT feedback systems, which triggers a rebound increase in 5-HT synthesis, release and neuronal excitability.</p><p id="P32">The present finding of reduced 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor mRNA in the midbrain raphe region and frontal cortex at 2 days after paroxetine discontinuation comprises evidence that loss of 5-HT feedback control contributes to the rebound increase in 5-HT transmission. This change was not evident at 5 days but 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor desensitization during continuous SSRI administration has been difficult to demonstrate at the gene/protein expression, as opposed to functional, level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Previously, mice with a genetic depletion of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors demonstrated increased firing of 5-HT neurons and increased physiological reactivity to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Moreover, here administration of the selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist WAY-100635 mimicked the effect of paroxetine discontinuation on c-Fos/TPH2 double-labelled DRN neurons, in accord with previous studies showing that WAY-100635 increased the firing of 5-HT neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. This is not to say that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor blockade fully models the effects of SSRI discontinuation, not least because such agents block not only pre-but also postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Nevertheless, rapid relief from negative 5-HT feedback control seems a likely contributor to an increase in excitability of 5-HT neurons after SSRI discontinuation although the present study does not rule out the involvement of other adaptive changes.</p><p id="P33">A rebound increase in 5-HT seems difficult to reconcile with the fact that reinstatement of SSRI treatment is often used to manage the discontinuation. However, re-introduction of an SSRI would likely increase extracellular 5-HT and reduce 5-HT neuron firing by indirectly activating inhibitory feedback mechanisms such as somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. In effect, recommencement of SSRI treatment would restore 5-HT neuron feedback and thereby dampen down 5-HT neuron hyperexcitability that is a potential driver of discontinuation symptoms. The idea of increased in excitability of 5-HT neurons also contrasts with earlier speculation that SSRI discontinuation may be mediated by <italic>reduced</italic> synaptic 5-HT due to rapid relief of 5-HT transporter blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The latter idea was largely based on the observation that the symptomatic effects of tryptophan depletion in SSRI-treated patients resembled those of SSRI discontinuation. However, others have suggested that the effects of tryptophan depletion were more characteristic of depression relapse than those of SSRI discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, it is conceivable that during continuous SSRI exposure, an acute fall in 5-HT induced by tryptophan depletion relieves 5-HT feedback which may generate 5-HT neuron instability; in this case effects of tryptophan depletion in SSRI-treated patients may indeed reflect SSRI discontinuation.</p><p id="P34">The current study found that day 2 following paroxetine discontinuation, mice showed increased anxiety-like behaviour on the EPM. This replicates the finding in our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and is consistent with an earlier report of increased acoustic startle responsivity in rats within a few days of discontinuation from citalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. There is much evidence that increased 5-HT transmission generates an anxiogenic effect on the EPM and in other anxiety paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], suggesting that the discontinuation-induced increase in 5-HT function and anxiety-like behaviour may be causally linked. However, the anxiogenic effect of paroxetine discontinuation had dissipated by discontinuation day 5 when increases in 5-HT neuronal function were still evident. Explanations for this mismatch in timing include the possibility that there is adaptation to increased 5-HT function on discontinuation day 2, resulting in normalisation of behaviour on the EPM. It is also possible that other mechanisms contribute to increased anxiety-like behaviour. For example, it is speculated that a rebound increase in cholinergic transmission contributes to discontinuation effects of various antidepressants including paroxetine, which has moderate affinity for muscarinic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Aside from anxiety, a rebound increase in 5-HT neurotransmission after paroxetine discontinuation might generate other behaviours or physiological changes that were not monitored here. For instance, we recently reported that mice demonstrated evidence of sleep disruption that commenced 2 days after discontinuation from paroxetine and continued for up to 9 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Sleep is well known to be regulated by 5-HT, and sleep disturbances are a recognised feature of SSRI discontinuation syndrome.</p><p id="P36">Interestingly, increased 5-HT neuron excitability in response to SSRI discontinuation has parallels with a previously proposed account of withdrawal from psychotropic drug administration. According to this account, adaptive influences develop when neural systems are subjected to prolonged suppression and rebound when, on drug removal, these oppositional influences no longer meet resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Thus, rebound increases in neurotransmission are reported in response to discontinued administration of other psychotropic drugs; for example, a rebound increase in excitatory transmission is associated with alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] whereas opiate withdrawal is associated with elevated noradrenergic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Variation in the symptoms of withdrawal from these different classes of psychotropic drugs likely reflects the different neurotransmitter systems involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, we report evidence that SSRI discontinuation is associated with a rebound increase in 5-HT function that lasts many days. We speculate that this effect is a consequence of a rapid fall in extracellular 5-HT following abrupt cessation of SSRI administration, leading to disinhibition of 5-HT neurons via removal of inhibitory 5-HT feedback. This response to SSRI discontinuation resembles the changes of other neural systems following cessation of treatment with other psychotropic drugs, suggesting a common neurobiological mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS188464-supplement-Supplementary.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d19aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust PhD Studentship in Basic Science (HC; grant no. 219982/Z/19/Z), a studentship from the Oxford-MRC Doctoral Training Partnership (SG), and research support funds from the University of Oxford.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P38"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P39">HMC performed experiments, analysed the data, and contributed to writing the manuscript.
