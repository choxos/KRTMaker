recurrent fever, vasculitis and stroke as well as immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure. It is caused by pathogenic variants in <italic>ADA2</italic> that lead to impaired ADA2 protein secretion and reduced deaminase activity. However, the mechanisms driving the disease on a cellular level remain elusive. Here, we analyze protein expression of mutant ADA2 in human monocyte-derived macrophages from 10 DADA2 patients. We identify a low-molecular-weight (LMW) form of ADA2 expressed exclusively intracellularly in healthy control macrophages. This LMW-ADA2 is subject to glycan trimming by α-mannosidases after transfer to the Golgi and is distinct from secreted high-molecular-weight (HMW) ADA2. DADA2 patients’ monocyte-derived macrophages lack LMW-ADA2 and mutant ADA2 does not undergo glycan processing in the Golgi. We confirm the absence of LMW-ADA2 upon overexpression of 11 pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants in HEK293T cells and monocytic U-937 cells. By subcellular fractionation, we show that LMW-ADA2 localizes to the cytosolic and lysosomal compartments. In conclusion, we describe a previously unreported intracellular hypoglycosylated form of ADA2 and establish the absence of this LMW-ADA2 as a cellular characteristic of DADA2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an inborn error of immunity caused by biallelic deleterious mutations in the <italic>ADA2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The disease manifests with a diverse phenotype displaying features of both autoinflammation and immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). More than 600 missense or predicted loss-of-function variants in <italic>ADA2</italic> are listed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v4.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In the Infevers registry, 116 <italic>ADA2</italic> variants are classified as (likely) pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Complete loss-of-function variants are more likely to cause bone marrow failure. Missense variants which account for 80% of pathogenic variants are found in patients with a primarily vasculitis phenotype as well as in those presenting with cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P3">How mutations in <italic>ADA2</italic> give rise to this diverse phenotype, even in patients with identical genotypes, is not understood. Inflammatory symptoms of the disease typically respond well to TNF inhibitors (TNFi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Insufficient resolution of bone marrow failure in response to this treatment however often necessitates hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and disease lethality still is 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To develop improved treatment options, we require a better understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying the immunological and clinical phenotype of DADA2.</p><p id="P4">ADA2 is a 59-kD glycoprotein with a signal peptide that mediates secretion of the protein via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and exhibits extracellular adenosine deaminase activity as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The protein has four N-glycosylation sites and insufficient glycosylation leads to ER retention and intracellular aggregate formation of ADA2 transfected into HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Impaired protein secretion and absent serum ADA2 enzyme activity have been established as characteristics shared by the majority of pathogenic ADA2 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Mechanistic approaches to the pathophysiology of ADA2-deficient cells have therefore been based on impaired extracellular adenosine deamination driving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This assumption fails to acknowledge the weak affinity of ADA2 for adenosine and the presence of functional ADA1 in DADA2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Research into alternative functions of the ADA2 protein and DADA2-causing variants is therefore warranted. Biochemical characterization of pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants has until now mostly been performed in a HEK293T overexpression system with supraphysiological intracellular levels of ADA2 while expression of the mutant protein has been shown to be minimal in DADA2 CD14+ monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Disease-associated ADA2 variants have to date hardly been studied in their physiological milieu.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we analyze trafficking and glycosylation of endogenous ADA2 expressed in primary human macrophages from healthy donors and DADA2 patients. We provide evidence of an intracellular glycoform of ADA2 that results from glycan trimming by Golgi α-mannosidases and show that DADA2 macrophages are characterized by the absence of this low-molecular-weight-form of ADA2.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> macrophage differentiation partially restores ADA2 protein expression in DADA2 monocytes</title><p id="P6">Of the circulating leukocytes, monocytes express ADA2 most abundantly. We analyzed ADA2 protein expression and <italic>ADA2</italic> mRNA levels in peripheral blood monocytes of 10 DADA2 patients and three heterozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A+B</xref>). CD14+ monocytes from DADA2 patients showed very low or absent ADA2 protein expression despite normal <italic>ADA2</italic> mRNA levels in patients with missense mutations which account for 80% of pathogenic variants found in DADA2 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Upon macrophage differentiation, we observed an increase in mutant ADA2 protein expression in the patient cells while ADA2 protein expression was reduced in healthy control (HC) human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Successful differentiation of DADA2 HMDM was achieved both with granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), which confirms the reported restoration of macrophage differentiation of monocytes from DADA2 patients under treatment with TNFi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Interestingly, western blotting of pathogenic ADA2 protein variants expressed in DADA2 HMDM revealed the presence of only a high-molecular-weight (HMW) band of around 60 kD compared to HC HMDM displaying two bands at 60 and 57 kD, with the low-molecular-weight (LMW) band being more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). A novel ADA2 variant serendipitously created in the process of generating an ADA2<sup>-/-</sup> Jurkat cell line showed the same phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). The molecular weight of secreted wild-type (WT) ADA2 in the supernatant of HC HMDM corresponded to the intracellular HMW form – the only form expressed in DADA2 HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed the secretion of HMW-ADA2 in the monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). HMDM from DADA2 patient P8 showed residual secretion of HMW-ADA2 with a molecular weight equivalent to secreted WT ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). This HMW-form of ADA2 also corresponded to the ADA2 form detected in human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of tagged WT ADA2 and several confirmed pathogenic variants in HEK293T cells uniformly led to predominant intracellular expression of HMW-ADA2 (63 kD) which was equal in size to the secreted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). In line with our findings in DADA2 HMDM, intracellular LMW-ADA2 was absent after overexpression of mutant ADA2 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, this band was still present – albeit at lower intensity – in the variants p.N127Q and p.W326R, two variants not found in DADA2 patients but created for the study of ADA2 glycosylation and dimerization, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Collectively, we show that HC HMDM intracellularly express a form of ADA2 that is lower in molecular weight than the secreted protein. This LMW-form is absent in DADA2 HMDM which only express the HMW-form intracellularly.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Human monocyte-derived macrophages intracellularly express a hypoglycosylated low-molecular-weight form of ADA2 that is absent in DADA2 macrophages</title><p id="P7">Differences in the molecular weight of a protein can be caused by posttranslational protein modifications and N-glycosylation of ADA2 has previously been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Therefore, we initially hypothesized that the LMW-form of ADA2 unique to cells expressing WT ADA2 corresponded to glycan-free ADA2. To test this, we performed glycan removal on lysates and supernatants containing ADA2 protein. Complete removal of N-glycans by Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) yielded a difference in molecular weight of 7 kD between HMW-ADA2 and glycan-free ADA2 both overexpressed in HEK293T cells and endogenously expressed in the monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1 as well as HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A+B</xref>), revealing that LMW-ADA2 was in fact slightly larger than glycan-free ADA2. Importantly, the anti-ADA2 antibody clone EPR25430-131 (#ab288296; abcam) was superior in detecting LMW-ADA2 but poorly detected glycan-free ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Glycan removal by PNGase F eliminated the differences in molecular weight between the LMW-form and the HMW-form in HMDM, yielding a single band of glycan-free ADA2 at 53 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B+C</xref>). Hence, the difference in molecular weight between intracellular WT ADA2 (LMW) and secreted WT ADA2 or intracellular pathogenic ADA2 (both HMW) was due to differential protein glycosylation. Of note, glycan removal yielded a smaller band of 53 kD in addition to the glycan-removed 56 kD protein for tagged WT ADA2 overexpressed in HEK293T cells that was absent for all tested pathogenic variants and did not appear after inhibition of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As this band was absent after glycan removal of endogenous WT ADA2, its physiological relevance is unclear.</p><p id="P8">Overall, we showed that the difference in size between HMW- and LMW-ADA2 is due to differential protein glycosylation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>N-glycosylated ADA2 undergoes glycan trimming in the ER as part of protein quality control</title><p id="P9">In order to better characterize the glycosylation of endogenous ADA2, we inhibited N-glycosylation in HMDM and the monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1 by 24-hour treatment with tunicamycin. We found that this treatment only acted on the fainter HMW-band while LMW-ADA2 remained unchanged in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C+D</xref>). In accordance with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we showed that adenosine deaminase activity of ADA2 was preserved after glycan removal while treatment with tunicamycin reduced enzymatic activity. This was true for ADA2 overexpressed in HEK293T cells as well as endogenous ADA2 from HC HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A+B</xref>). These findings indicated that N-glycosylation was required for adequate folding of the ADA2 protein. The ER glucosidases I and II form part of the ER quality control by removing glycosyl residues from accurately folded proteins prior to transfer to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Treatment with castanospermine, an inhibitor of the ER glucosidases I and II, caused an additional increase in the size of HMW-ADA2 in both HC and DADA2 HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming trimming of N-glycosylated ADA2 in the ER. Since the same shift in molecular weight was observed in DADA2 HMDM, we concluded that processing of WT and mutant did not yet diverge at this early stage of the secretory pathway. As seen previously upon incubation with tunicamycin, the LMW-form of ADA2, which is absent in DADA2 HMDM, was unaffected by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We confirmed this finding in the three ADA2-expressing cell lines U-937, THP-1 and Jurkat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Following glycan processing in the ER, proteins exit the ER to the Golgi apparatus. ER to Golgi trafficking is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA). We observed that treatment of WT ADA2-expressing cells with BFA yielded a single ADA2 band with a molecular weight between that of HMW- and LMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that both HMW- and LMW-ADA2 are the result of further glycan processing in the Golgi. In summary, we showed that N-glycosylation is required for folding and secretion of ADA2 and that both WT and mutant ADA2 are subject to processing by the ER glucosidases I and II.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking partially reproduced the ADA2 proteotype of DADA2 cells</title><p id="P10">Since the glycan pattern of LMW-ADA2 was unaffected by treatment with tunicamycin – an inhibitor of the initial step of N-glycosylation – we concluded that glycosylation of this form must have occurred prior to the treatment incubation period, suggesting high stability of LMW-ADA2. Accordingly, LMW-ADA2 was responsive to prolonged incubation with tunicamycin at a lower concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). The same was true for inhibition of ER glucosidases: the more stable LMW-ADA2 was unaffected by 24-hour incubation with castanospermine and the detected LMW-form had likely already matured before the beginning of the incubation period. The increased stability of LMW-ADA2 compared to HMW-ADA2 was also confirmed by cycloheximide chase assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Besides, this experiment revealed that HMW-ADA2 protein expressed by HEK293T cells transfected with pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants showed increased intracellular stability compared with the WT protein. This was also true after inhibition of N-glycosylation and after an increased incubation period of 48 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B+C</xref>). Since ADA2 is a secreted protein, protein secretion must be taken into account when assessing the intracellular signal reduction in this assay over time. Impaired secretion has previously been established as a characteristic of pathogenic ADA2 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We confirmed the secretory defect in HMDM from our DADA2 cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Overexpression in HEK293T cells recapitulated the endogenous behavior of the respective variants well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). While residual ADA2 enzyme activity largely correlated with preserved secretion, the catalytic domain variant p.N370K displayed absent deaminase activity despite comparatively high protein levels in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The partially preserved secretion of the variant p.G47R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) was verified in HMDM from patient P8 who is homozygous for this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and corresponded to higher serum ADA2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) in the absence of serum deaminase activity (0.3 U/L).</p><p id="P11">Comparing the levels of increased ADA2 stability observed by cycloheximide chase assay with residual protein secretion, the variants p.T129P and p.R169Q that exhibited complete absence of secretion did indeed show the highest levels of intracellular ADA2 24 hours after inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). However, intracellular levels of the secreted mutant p.P344L were still higher compared to WT. By blocking the secretory pathway to impair secretion of WT ADA2, we confirmed that the secretory defect strongly contributed to the increased intracellular protein levels of mutant ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D</xref>). As described above, this treatment also hindered the generation of LMW-ADA2. Consequently, inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking by BFA mimicked major characteristics of ADA2 processing in DADA2 cells: ER retention, impaired secretion and absence of LMW-ADA2. Besides incomplete glycan processing and ER retention, aggregate formation can be a consequence of protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).

Additionally, we observed an increase in lysosomal proteins in the ADA2 interactome after treatment with tunicamycin, suggesting autophagic degradation of non-glycosylated ADA2. Among the induced interactors were several proteins of the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway, e.g. LAMP2 and HSPA13, and we verified the presence of a KFERQ-related motif (QKFVE, amino acids 274-278) in the sequence of ADA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). IP-MS of HC and DADA2 HMDM did not yield any specific binders, which was possibly due to low protein abundance in the pull down of endogenous ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). Notably, IP preferentially pulled down the HMW-form of ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B+C</xref>). The experiment consequently did not allow us to draw conclusions about the interactome and potential distinctive function of LMW-ADA2.</p><p id="P14">Given the increased binding of mutant ADA2 to the ER folding machinery, we verified whether pathogenic ADA2 variants induced an increased ER stress response.

In summary, our experiments revealed the interaction of the ADA2 variant p.R169Q overexpressed in HEK293T cells with mediators of the folding machinery and ER quality control despite lack of increased ER stress in the presence of pathogenic ADA2 variants. The interactome analyses were inconclusive regarding potential alternative functions of LMW-ADA2.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>LMW-ADA2 is generated from HMW-ADA2 after transfer to the Golgi and localizes to the lysosome</title><p id="P15">We showed that the secretory defect of mutant ADA2 was phenocopied by WT ADA2 upon inhibition of the secretory pathway by BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, this treatment also caused increased degradation of the mutants p.G47V, p.T129P and p.R169Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To determine whether this effect was specific to brefeldin A, we also inhibited protein trafficking with monensin. BFA blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus while monensin inhibits trans Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Treatment with monensin also caused intracellular retention of WT ADA2 but protein levels of mutant ADA2 were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The differential behavior in response to the secretory pathway inhibitors BFA and monensin was confirmed in DADA2 HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, unlike BFA, incubation with monensin did not impair the generation of LMW-ADA2 in cells overexpressing WT ADA2. The absence of LMW-ADA2 upon inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking and the increase in LMW-ADA2 upon inhibition of trans Golgi transport indicated that the hypoglycosylated LMW-form is generated from HMW-ADA2 after transport to the Golgi apparatus. In order to better understand the subcellular localization of LMW-ADA2, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments. We showed that HMW-ADA2 localized exclusively to the membranous fraction that also contains ER and Golgi membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). LMW-ADA2 was also present in the membrane fraction. Moreover, this form was strongly detected in the cytosolic and lysosomal extracts. Considering that LMW-ADA2 only emerges at a later stage of the secretory pathway and localizes to different cellular compartments than the HMW-form, it is unlikely that LMW-ADA2 represents an intermediate – not yet fully glycosylated – form of yet unsecreted ADA2. Instead, we hypothesize that it is generated by partial intracellular glycan trimming of the fully glycosylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Overall, we showed that ER to Golgi transport is required for the synthesis of LMW-ADA2 and that this ADA2-form is found in the lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Wild-type HMW-ADA2 is subject to additional glycan maturation prior to secretion</title><p id="P17">Because of the differences observed in the processing of mutant ADA2 expressed in HEK293T cells or primary HMDM as well as the limitations of the HEK293T model system, we created a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out of <italic>ADA2</italic> in U-937 cells, a monocytic cell line with endogenous ADA2 levels similar to those measured in HMDM. These ADA2<sup>-/-</sup> U-937 cells were then transduced with different pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants. We showed that expression levels of the mutant protein in these cells came very near to DADA2 HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, this model system excellently mirrored the expression pattern of WT and mutant ADA2 with respect to LMW- and HMW-ADA2. ADA2<sup>-/-</sup> U-937 cells transduced with the pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants p.G47R, p.G47V and p.R169Q expressed only HMW-ADA2 while LMW-ADA2 was the predominant form found in U-937 cells endogenously expressing WT ADA2 or transduced with WT after <italic>ADA2</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). The stability of LMW-ADA2 upon 24-hour incubation with tunicamycin was also reproduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this system, we endeavored to confirm and extend our findings with respect to the ADA2 glycoforms: First, we showed that complete N-glycan removal by PNGase F cancelled out the differences in molecular weight between HMW- and LMW-ADA2, confirming that they are due to N-glycosylation. Endo H is another endoglycosidase that cleaves high mannose glycans and – unlike PNGase F – does not remove complex glycans. We found that WT and mutant ADA2 were both sensitive to glycan removal by Endo H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), hinting at the presence of high mannose oligosaccharides in both LMW- and HMW-ADA2 glycans. In contrast with PNGase F treatment, glycan removal by Endo H revealed differences between WT and mutant ADA2: Compared with mutant ADA2, Endo H-treated WT ADA2 visualized as a smear on western blot as opposed to the clean single band observed for mutant ADA2 in U-937 cells and HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). This suggests that WT ADA2 underwent additional glycan processing as complex glycans are less sensitive to Endo H. Since the size of LMW-ADA2 makes the presence of additional carbohydrate residues unlikely, we concluded that in WT ADA2-expressing cells, the glycan trees of HMW-ADA2 mature into complex glycans, generating HMW(c)-ADA2, the HMW-form observed in HC HMDM. For all tested pathogenic variants, glycan removal by Endo H yielded a clean band very close in molecular weight to complete removal of N-glycans by PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequently, mutant HMW-ADA2 is likely not subject to any glycan maturation beyond the ER, which is in agreement with the postulated ER retention of pathogenic ADA2 protein variants. This finding also implies that WT HMW(c)-ADA2 and mutant HMW-ADA2 – while very similar in molecular weight –differ in their glycan structures and do not represent the same ADA2 glycoform.</p><p id="P18">Collectively, our findings suggest that the N-glycan structures of ADA2 contain high-mannose oligosaccharides and that WT HMW(c)-ADA2 contains complex glycan branches while mutant HMW-ADA2 does not undergo advanced glycan maturation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>LMW-ADA2 is generated by glycan trimming through alpha-mannosidases</title><p id="P19">The addition of complex glycan structures is usually preceded by the removal of α-linked mannose residues in the late ER and Golgi by a set of α-mannosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that mutant ADA2 is inaccessible to glycan-trimming by endogenous α-mannosidases, accounting for the absence of complex glycan structures as well as the absence of LMW-ADA2. To test this hypothesis, we incubated WT and mutant ADA2-expressing U-937 cells with different inhibitors of glycan-processing enzymes. The corresponding western blots were performed in a capillary-based separation and detection system to allow for a more precise distinction of the different molecular weight peaks. After synthesis and N-glycan transfer in the ER, proteins are initially trimmed by the ER α-glucosidases I and II that are inhibited by castanospermine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). As shown in HMDM, castanospermine caused an increase in the molecular weight of HMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). By increasing the incubation time ≥ 48 hours we observed a shift also for LMW-ADA2, confirming the superior stability of LMW-ADA2 and the hypothesis that this glycoform is generated at a later stage of glycan processing. After passing the quality control mechanisms in the ER, proteins can be trimmed further by different α-mannosidases in the ER and Golgi. Kifunensine inhibits class I α-mannosidases that are typically found in the late ER and cis-Golgi and cleave α-1,2-linked mannose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Incubation of U-937 cells with kifunensine led to an increase in the molecular weight of LMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>). After 96 hours, LMW-ADA2 almost overlay HMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Concomitant incubation with swainsonine led to similar results. However, incubation with swainsonine alone also increased the molecular weight of LMW-ADA2, suggesting that multiple mannosidases are involved in the trimming of LMW-ADA2. Swainsonine inhibits both α-mannosidase II in the medial Golgi and the lysosomal α-mannosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To better understand whether also the lysosomal enzyme is involved in the trimming of LMW-ADA2, we analyzed HMDM from a patient with α-mannosidosis, harbouring biallelic mutations in <italic>MAN2B1</italic> encoding the lysosomal α-mannosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We found that the patient’s cells phenocopied HC cells treated with the class II α-mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine and that swainsonine treatment did not have an additional effect on the molecular weight of LMW-ADA2 expressed in the lysosomal α-mannosidase-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). This finding suggests that LMW-ADA2 undergoes processing not only in the ER and Golgi but also in the lysosomes. The fact that HMW(c)-ADA2 expressed in the patient’s HMDM appeared to undergo a slight shift towards a lower molecular weight upon addition of swainsonine might indicate that Golgi α-mannosidase II is involved in the maturation of the complex glycans of this glycoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Finally, as a proof of principle, we performed glycan removal by α1-2,3,6 mannosidase on WT ADA2. This experiment yielded a single band slightly lower but very close in molecular weight to LMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). This is in line with the findings of the previous experiments since the inhibited glycan-processing enzymes typically do not cleave α-1,6-linked mannose residues, which accounts for the lower molecular weight of α1-2,3,6 mannosidase-treated ADA2 compared with LMW-ADA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In summary, we demonstrated that LMW-ADA2 is generated from HMW-ADA2 by glycan-processing through multiple α-mannosidases in the ER, Golgi and lysosomal compartments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we showed that pathogenic protein variants of ADA2 expressed in HMDM from DADA2 patients do not undergo glycan processing beyond the ER and that DADA2 HMDM therefore lack lysosomal LMW-ADA2 and secreted HMW(c)-ADA2.

Yet, the behavior of mutant ADA2 on the cellular level has to date only been examined in overexpression systems of cells that do not express the protein endogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Importantly, expression of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases and therefore glycosylation patterns of individual proteins show striking variation even between different immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). It is therefore essential to understand the behavior of ADA2 in the patients’ primary cells. In our cohort of 10 DADA2 patients, we identified the intracellular predominance of unprocessed HMW-ADA2 in the absence of LMW-ADA2 as a feature that was shared by all missense variants, independently of the patients’ clinical phenotype. Differential patterns of glycosylation of the same protein being associated with distinctive protein functions have previously been described: IL-24 is a signal peptide-containing glycoprotein that is secreted via the ER. A partially glycosylated cytosolic form of IL-24 has been shown to mediate protein kinase R activation independently of its extracellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The predominance of the partially glycan-trimmed LMW-form of ADA2 in HC HMDM raises the question of whether, in a similar way, this form differs in function from secreted HMW(c)-ADA2. In fact, the function of ADA2 has repeatedly been subject to discussion for several reasons: (i.) Pathogenic ADA2 variants display a wide spectrum of residual adenosine deaminase function which does not clearly correlate with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). (ii.) ADA2 has evolved towards lower affinity to adenosine in higher species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). (iii.) ADA1 exhibits superior adenosine deaminase activity (Km of 20-50 μM vs. 2-3 mM for ADA2) and extracellular ADA1 bound to CD26 theoretically compensates for the absence of ADA2 at physiological levels of adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Yet, the majority of studies proposing possible pathomechanisms underlying the immunological phenotype of DADA2 rely on the role of ADA2 as an extracellular adenosine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In contrast, two groups introduced the possibility of an intracellular function of ADA2 as a lysosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Greiner-Tollersrud and colleagues characterized the glycan structures of ADA2 isolated from porcine brain and identified a high mannose-6-phosphate content, indicating targeting of ADA2 to the lysosome. Indeed, they showed an overlap between the glycosylation pattern of ADA2 with several known lysosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We showed that the glycan structures of LMW- and HMW-ADA2 expressed in HMDM were sensitive to glycan removal by Endo H, suggesting the presence of high-mannose oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This would be in line with a potential lysosomal localization of ADA2. Moreover, we showed that multiple – also lysosomal – α-mannosidases are involved in the processing of LMW-ADA2. Combined inhibition of class I and II α-mannosidases caused an increase in the molecular weight of LMW-ADA2 yielding a glycoform almost identical to HMW-ADA2. We proposed that the ADA2-glycoform observed in HC cells after inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking might correspond to mutant HMW-ADA2. Yet, in most blots, DADA2 HMW-ADA2 looks identical in size to WT HMW(c)-ADA2. While the differential processing by Endo H clearly showed that the mutant protein does not undergo the same glycan maturation as HMW(c)-ADA2, the resolution of the western blots does not allow to definitively determine the precise molecular weight of the mutant protein. In the light of the complexity of glycan structures and glycan-processing enzymes, further analyses will be needed to define the exact composition of the LMW-ADA2 glycoform. Whether the predominant intracellular LMW-form of ADA2 that we detected in HMDM represents this lysosomal protein cannot be conclusively established from our data. Due to insufficient pull-down of LMW-ADA2 by immunoprecipitation, we could not elucidate its interactome and approach its potential function in this way. We did however detect LMW-ADA2 in the lysosomal compartment of U-937 cells after lysosomal enrichment. The subcellular fractionation experiments provide only an approximation of the intracellular localization of LMW-ADA2 since the enriched fractions are not sufficiently pure to exclude interfractional contamination. Combined with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), our data provide a strong hint that LMW-ADA2 represents the lysosomal glycoform of ADA2 and might be functionally distinct from secreted HMW(c)-ADA2.</p><p id="P23">In the HEK293T model system, transfected ADA2 was predominantly expressed as the HMW-form corresponding to secreted ADA2 in these cells, highlighting the limitations of this system to understand the behavior of endogenous ADA2. Discrepancies between the two systems are also evident from the fact that ADA2 in whole cell lysates from transfected HEK293T cells was equally sensitive to glycan removal by PNGase F or Endo H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), while we observed some residual glycan structures upon Endo H treatment of ADA2 in lysates from U-937 cells and HMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Another limitation of the relevance of macrophage LMW-ADA2 in the pathogenesis of DADA2 is that in primary CD14+ monocytes, the cells with the highest endogenous expression of ADA2, differentially glycosylated forms of ADA2 cannot be clearly distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A+B</xref>). Moreover, patient monocytes – both from patients with missense variants with normal <italic>ADA2</italic> mRNA expression and from patients with variants that exhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay – show complete absence of mutant ADA2 protein expression. This implies that mutations in the <italic>ADA2</italic> gene might manifest differently on a cellular level depending on the expressing cell.</p><p id="P24">This notion needs to be taken into account when examining the potential induction of ER stress by pathogenic variants of ADA2. Intracellular retention of ADA2 has only been reported after overexpression in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). While primary monocytic cells also show impaired secretion of mutant ADA2, intracellular protein levels are very low in HMDM and close to absent in CD14+ monocytes. In our cohort of DADA2 patients, we did not observe an increased ER stress response in CD14+ monocytes. This was in line with single-cell RNA-sequencing data reported by Watanabe et al. that showed downregulation of eIF2 signaling – a main pathway of the integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Although we could not confirm that the presence of misfolded mutant ADA2 contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease by induction of an unfolded protein response, our data highlight the need for a better understanding of the folding and trafficking mechanisms of WT and mutant ADA2. We verified that the presence of pathogenic ADA2 protein variants as well as inhibition of N-glycosylation provoked the formation of intracellular protein aggregates, thereby extending previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In addition, we showed that aggregate formation also occurs after co-transfection in the presence of the wild-type protein. These findings offer a possible explanation for heterozygous carriers presenting with clinical symptoms and underscore the importance of gaining in-depth understanding of the intracellular pathophysiology of DADA2. Next to Sanger sequencing of the <italic>ADA2</italic> gene, the measurement of serum ADA2 enzyme activity currently represents the diagnostic gold standard for DADA2. Assuming an intracellular function of the protein, it is possible that this strategy may overlook a proportion of patients. In this article, we introduced the absence of LMW-ADA2 as a new characteristic of pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants that was verified for all pathogenic variants included in this study. Despite the focus on pathogenic missense variants in our cohort, we propose the absence of LMW-ADA2 as cellular feature of DADA2 since complete loss of ADA2 protein expression due nonsense-mediated mRNA decay also leads to absence of this form. Our findings suggest a possible role of LMW-ADA2 as a biomarker in DADA2, which would need further validation in a larger set of pathogenic and benign <italic>ADA2</italic> variants.</p><p id="P26">Until now, monocytes as the main producers of endogenous ADA2 have received the most attention in deciphering the pathophysiology of the disease. Considering the role of glycosylation in protein folding and the potential impact of this modification on protein function, we cannot exclude that the main ADA2 function might vary even between different immune cells. This might also account for the diverse clinical phenotype of the disease and the varying involvement of different immune cell populations. The large number of pathogenic variants and their diversity with respect to biochemical characteristics are additional factors contributing to the difficulties in delineating a single all-encompassing pathomechanism that explains the complexity of the disease. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the differential N-glycosylation of pathogenic ADA2 in patient-derived macrophages. We establish LMW-ADA2 as a hypoglycosylated non-secreted form of ADA2 in healthy controls. This LMW-ADA2 is generated by α-mannosidases after transfer to the Golgi and is absent in DADA2. Further studies will be needed to confirm the functional relevance of these results in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Study design</title><p id="P27">This exploratory study included patients treated at University Hospitals Leuven and their parents were included as heterozygous carriers.

It was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Our study examined male and female individuals, and similar findings are reported for both sexes.</p><p id="P28">The aim of this study was to determine the protein characteristics of ADA2 endogenously expressed in human immune cells carrying pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants. To compensate for the limited sample size in the study of patients with rare diseases, our results were validated in two separate <italic>in vitro</italic> models of ADA2 deficiency examining a total of 11 pathogenic <italic>ADA2</italic> variants. The results were confirmed using two different anti-ADA2 antibodies both validated with the help of ADA2 knockout samples and reproduced in two technically distinct blotting systems to exclude technical artefacts.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p id="P29">Adherent cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) (#25300062; Gibco) for 5 minutes at 37°C and the reaction was blocked by addition of complete medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400xg for 5 minutes at 4°C. Whole cell lysates were obtained by lysing 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells in 25 μL RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) or NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor (#78429; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes on ice, followed by centrifugation at 13,500xg for 20 minutes at 4°C.</p><p id="P30">To collect supernatants, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24h. For immunoblotting, supernatants were concentrated by added 1200 μL ice-cold acetone to 300 μL supernatant and overnight storage at -20°C. Supernatant proteins were then precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. The protein pellet was resuspended in 25 μL NP-40 buffer containing protease inhibitor. Bolt™ LDS sample buffer (#B0007; Thermo Fisher Scientific) mixed with Bolt™ Sample Reducing Agent (#B0009; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the samples prior to gel electrophoresis. For analysis of intracellular dimer formation, the reducing agent was omitted. Samples were heated for 5 minutes at 70°C. Supernatants from HEK293T cells transfected with ADA2 were diluted 1:10 in 2X Bolt™ LDS sample buffer (#B0007; Thermo Fisher Scientific), serum was diluted 1:200. SeeBlue™ Plus2 Pre-stained Protein Standard (#LC5925; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as protein molecular weight marker.</p><p id="P31">Proteins were transferred onto PVDF transfer membranes. Protein expression was visualized by enzymatic chemiluminescence using Pierce™ ECL western blotting substrate (#32106; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (#34580; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a ChemiDoc XRS+ Imaging System (Bio-Rad).</p><p id="P32">The experiments examining the glycan-processing of LMW-ADA2 were performed in a Wes Automated Western Blot System (ProteinSimple / bio-techne) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample were loaded at a final protein concentration of 0.4 mg/mL.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Glycan removal</title><p id="P33">Glycan removal was performed on whole cell lysates generated with NP-40 lysis buffer or precipitated supernatant protein reconstituted in NP-40 lysis buffer. Glycan removal was performed on 20 μg, 10 μg or 25 μg total protein using PNGase F (#P0704; New England Biolabs), Endo H (#P0702; New England Biolabs), α1-2,3,6 Mannosidase (#P0768; New England Biolabs) or PNGase F (#A39245; Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Glycan removal with PNGase F (#P0704; New England Biolabs) was completed under denaturing conditions for 1h at 37°C or under non-denaturing conditions for 4h at 37°C as indicated.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P34">For the SomaScan assay, raw counts expressed in relative fluorescent units (RFU) were normalized across samples using a cyclic loess algorithm implemented by the package limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Two outlier samples identified with principal component analysis were removed before downstream analysis. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a linear model based on subject condition (HC, Carrier, DADA2), subject age, and number of freeze-thaw-cycles of the sample. Pseudoreplicates coming from subjects with multiple samples were handled using blocking. Statistics were moderated using the empirical Bayes method of the package limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Statistical analysis of the mass spectrometry data was performed using Perseus software (v1.6.2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Log2 transformed LFQ intensity values were filtered for minimum of 3 valid values in at least one experimental group and missing values were imputed with random low intensity values taken from a normal distribution. Differences in protein abundance between groups were calculated using two-sample Student’s t-test using an FDR-based significance cut-off of 5% (<italic>HEK293T</italic>) or 10% (<italic>HMDM</italic>) in order to define enriched proteins.</p><p id="P36">A complete description of all additional methods is provided in the Supplementary Materials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS190414-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190414-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d35aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Prof. Jaak Jaeken, Prof. Daisy Rymen and Dr. Eva Morava-Kozicz for kindly sharing their expertise and insight on protein glycosylation.
