Preventing biofilm formation on food products and in food processing environments is crucial for reducing the incidence of foodborne diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of colonisation and establishment on fresh produce will inform the development of decontamination approaches.

We established an alfalfa infection model and compared the findings to those obtained from glass surfaces. Our research revealed dynamic changes in the pathways associated with biofilm formation over time, with distinct plant-specific and glass-specific mechanisms for biofilm formation, alongside the identification of shared genes playing pivotal roles in both contexts. Notably, we observed variations in the significance of factors such as flagella biosynthesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, and stringent response regulation in biofilm development on plant versus glass surfaces.

Historically, these pathogens were predominantly linked to meat products. However, in recent years, fresh produce is emerging as a major source of these outbreaks, being implicated in over a third of reported outbreaks in certain countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brennan et al., 2022</xref>). The majority of these outbreaks are associated with ready-to-eat crops, although some cases have been attributed to the mishandling of vegetables that are typically subjected to cooking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Launders et al., 2016</xref>). Certain human pathogens, such as <italic>Salmonella,</italic> are able to colonise various ecological niches and survive outside their primary host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Humphrey, 2004</xref>). <italic>S. enterica</italic> has been implicated in numerous recent multistate outbreaks in the USA associated with contaminated fruits and vegetables, including lettuce, tomatoes, alfalfa, cucumbers, and melons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Heaton and Jones, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">EFSA et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated <italic>Salmonella</italic>’s ability to actively colonise plant tissues employing specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Salazar et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella</italic> has been found to persist in produce for extended periods, with viability lasting over six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Islam et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>Salmonella</italic>’s adaptive strategy to persist in the challenging plant environment includes the formation of biofilms. Biofilms are structured, aggregated communities of microorganisms encased in an extracellular matrix and attached to surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Monier and Lindow, 2005</xref>). These communities play a critical role in enabling pathogenic bacteria to adhere to fresh produce increasing the risk of enteric disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yaron and Römling, 2014</xref>). Bacteria within biofilms exhibit intrinsic tolerance to high concentrations of antimicrobials, biocides, and disinfectants, which complicates decontamination efforts and poses challenges for ensuring food safety. Previous studies have contributed valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying <italic>Salmonella’s</italic> biofilm formation and its ability to persist on plants, highlighting the significance of these processes in the context of food safety and public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fett, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brandl, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brandl and Mandrell, 2002</xref>). However, the range of plants and conditions studied has been limited and little whole genome analysis of factors responsible for plant colonisation has been done to date.</p><p id="P4">Transposon sequencing (TnSeq) approaches have previously been used to determine the mechanisms through which bacteria survive in different environments. For example, TnSeq was used to identify the genes involved in <italic>Pseudomonas simiae</italic> colonisation of plant roots, which highlighted the importance of genes involved in flagella production, cell envelope biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cole et al., 2017</xref>). We have previously used another TnSeq variant, TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic>, to identify genes involved in biofilm formation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Holden et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Holden et al., 2022</xref>) on glass over time. TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> builds on conventional transposon sequencing approaches by using larger denser transposon mutant libraries and by incorporating an outwards-transcribing promoter into the transposon element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Yasir et al., 2020</xref>). Induction of this promoter enables increased expression of genes downstream of transposon insertions thereby facilitating investigation into how expression, as well as gene disruption, affects survival of the mutant in a given condition. This approach also generates information about essential genes which do not tolerate insertional inactivation by transposons and can therefore not be assayed with conventional tools.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we established an alfalfa plant infection model that was used in conjunction with TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> to investigate gene essentiality in biofilm formation on alfalfa over time. A comprehensive library of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium transposon mutants was cultivated on sprouted alfalfa plants and mutants were isolated at different stages to identify the genes involved in biofilm development <italic>in planta</italic> over time. Comparisons were made with data from biofilms on glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Holden et al., 2022</xref>). This allowed for the identification of plant-specific and glass-specific mechanisms used by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to establish in organic and inorganic surfaces, as well as conserved genes that play crucial roles on both surfaces.</p><p id="P6">We showed different sets of genes were needed for colonisation of alfalfa compared to glass, with variations in the importance of factors including flagella biosynthesis, LPS production, and stringent response regulation in biofilm development on plants.

Alfalfa was chosen as an important vehicle of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and as an easily studied laboratory model. Initially, seeds underwent sterilisation and were allowed to germinate in Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium for three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1-A</xref>).

These timepoints were chosen to capture the potentially diverse mechanisms required by <italic>Salmonella</italic> at different stages of alfalfa colonisation. This includes the early stages involving initial attachment and microcolony formation (at 24 hours, representing Day 1) and the subsequent phases of establishment and biofilm formation (spanning 48 to 72 hours, representing Day 2 and 3). We identified 69 genes as significantly involved in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium colonisation and biofilm formation on alfalfa sprouts over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 1</xref>). These included genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, DNA housekeeping, respiration and responding to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).

Typhimurium TraDIS library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Holden et al., 2022</xref>). Insertion frequencies in mutant libraries colonising glass or plant surfaces were both compared to planktonic cultures grown for the same amount of time. This acted as a standard to demonstrate where transposon insertions affected surface colonisation relative to planktonic growth, and the subsequent gene lists were then compared. This found some core pathways involved in S. Typhimurium establishment on both surfaces which included flagella biosynthesis, LPS production, respiration, iron storage and stress responses. Seven genes were found to be conserved between biofilms grown on alfalfa sprouts and on glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>).

The ethanolamine utilisation pathway played an important role in S. Typhimurium establishment on both alfalfa sprouts (<italic>eutT</italic>) and on glass (<italic>eutQ</italic>) at all time points tested, with disruption of each gene seen to aid colonisation. Together, this reveals a core set of pathways involved in colonisation of both biotic and abiotic surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Differential Flagella and Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis on Alfalfa vs. Glass</title><p id="P13">Deletion mutants were constructed in targets identified by TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> to investigate their effects on colonisation and establishment on diverse surfaces (both inorganic and organic).

Equal numbers of mutant and wild type were inoculated onto glass beads and alfalfa plant sprouts. Subsequently, the percentage change in mutants within the recovered populations from each surface was determined over time.</p><p id="P14">TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> indicated that inactivation of genes involved in flagella biosynthesis was beneficial for plant colonisation after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). As flagella are detected by the plant’s immune system, aflagellated cells may have a competitive advantage in these communities once an immune response is raised. Our previous work found aflagellated cells were disadvantaged at colonising glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Holden et al., 2022</xref>). To characterise the role of flagella in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium establishment on both environments, a deletion mutant of the main flagella biosynthetic regulator (<italic>flhDC</italic>) and a component of the flagella export machinery (<italic>flhA</italic>) were grown on glass and alfalfa sprouts in competition with wild type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. At the initial stages of colonisation (Day 1), Δ<italic>flhDC</italic> and Δ<italic>flhA</italic> exhibited a significantly enhanced competitive advantage at colonising glass but were competitively disadvantaged at colonising alfalfa plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This contrasts with the prediction from the TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> findings, however TraDIS measures competitive fitness in a large pool of competing mutants where individuals lacking flagella may benefit from adhesion of neighbouring cells whilst also being less susceptible to host immunity.</p><p id="P15">LPS core and O-antigen biosynthesis genes were beneficial for growth on alfalfa sprouts, however the impact of different LPS biosynthesis genes on S. Typhimurium colonisation varied. Some exhibited beneficial effects when inactivated during glass colonisation, while others had detrimental impacts.

We created a deletion mutant of <italic>rfbJ</italic> in S. Typhimurium to investigate its effect on glass and plant colonisation. Deletion of <italic>rfbJ</italic> resulted in reduced colonisation of both glass and plant over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

To achieve that, we established a fresh produce alfalfa infection model and draw a comparative analysis using genome-wide transposon sequencing (TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic>) on alfalfa, comparing them to mechanisms previously identified for biofilm formation on glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Holden et al., 2022</xref>). Our aim was to discern the extent to which these mechanisms are universally necessary for adhesion, colonisation, and establishment on organic surfaces in contrast to inorganic ones. Our working hypothesis was that there would be both common and bespoke mechanisms important for colonisation of the two tested environments. Several key findings emerge from this study.</p><p id="P19">We identified seven conserved genes important in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium establishment on both alfalfa sprouts and glass, highlighting these shared genes as critical for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium colonisation of diverse surfaces. These genes belong to various functional categories, including NADH hydrogenase synthesis (<italic>nuoA</italic> and <italic>nuoB),</italic> fimbrial regulation and production (<italic>fimA</italic> and <italic>fimZ</italic>), LPS O-antigen synthesis (<italic>rfbJ</italic>), iron acquisition (<italic>ybaN</italic>), and stress responses (<italic>rpoS).</italic> Ethanolamine utilisation genes, <italic>eutT</italic> and <italic>eutQ,</italic> were also identified to play an important role in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium establishment on both environments, with their disruption aiding colonisation of both surfaces. Notably, ethanolamine signalling has been reported to aid <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Srikumar and Fuchs, 2011</xref>). The identification of these conserved genes underscores their significance in surface colonisation, regardless of the surface material and shows a core requirement for different pathways providing diverse functions in colonisation to surfaces.</p><p id="P20">There were also significant differences between the two conditions. Flagella biosynthesis was found to affect colonisation of biotic and abiotic surfaces differently in our study. We showed that aflagellated mutants (Δ<italic>flhDC</italic> and Δ<italic>flhA</italic>) exhibit significantly enhanced glass colonisation at the early stages of colonisation (24 hours) but perform significantly worse on alfalfa. However, with time, these mutants regain their ability to grow on alfalfa. This demonstrates the potential role of the flagellum for initial stages of adhesion to the roots. We know that flagellar motility is essential for initial host colonisation in several bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Haefele and Lindow, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Van de Broek et al., 1998</xref>). This contrasts with the prediction from the TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> results which identified the system as under selective pressure but suggested mutants would have a benefit. This highlights the complexity of the role of flagella at different stages of colonisation but also is likely to reflect the differences between comparing fitness of mutants within a pool to as a monoculture where functions cannot be provided by neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rossez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We also found pathways involved in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium establishment on alfalfa seedlings that were not involved in biofilm formation on glass. Notably, genes related to type III secretion regulation (<italic>sirC</italic>), Fe-S cluster assembly (<italic>iscA</italic>), curcumin degradation (<italic>curA</italic>), and copper tolerance (<italic>cueR</italic>) confer a competitive advantage to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium during colonisation of alfalfa. Deletion of <italic>cueR</italic> reduced the ability of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to colonise plants but had no effect on glass, demonstrating a conditional importance between surfaces. Metals play an important role in plant-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fones and Preston, 2013</xref>) with copper being commonly deployed as a host antimicrobial. Regulating the expression of copper export through <italic>cueR</italic> is clearly beneficial for colonisation and establishment on a plant. Deletion of <italic>iscA</italic> reduced colonisation of both glass and plant surfaces, and there was no difference in colonisations seen in Δ<italic>sirC</italic> or Δ<italic>curA</italic> deletion mutants. TraDIS-<italic>Xpress</italic> can determine very small changes in competitive fitness that may not always be seen in culture-based assays, therefore further characterisation is needed to determine how these genes affect plant colonisation.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic determinants that influence <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium colonisation and establishment on diverse surfaces.

Alfalfa seeds were sterilised by immersion in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by a 3-minute wash in 5% sodium hypochlorite. B. Subsequently, the sterilised seeds were left to germinate in darkness at 20°C in Murashige-Skoog (MS) agar medium for 3-4 days. C. Infection of the seedlings was performed at the root-shoot intersection using 5 μL of Salmonella inoculum, normalised to an optical density (OD) of 0.02. Infected seedlings were then transferred to fresh MS plates and incubated in a benchtop plant growth chamber at 20°C. D. To facilitate selection via blue colony screening, Salmonella recovery and quantification were performed using the 14028S::lacZ strain after 6, 24, and 48 hours. Inoculated seedlings were homogenised by mechanical disruption using a pestle to release the bacterial cells. Cell suspensions were subjected to serial dilution and plated onto X-gal/IPTG LB plates for further analysis. Visualisation experiments were conducted using the 14028S::lux strain to monitor the localisation of Salmonella on the seedlings via chemiluminescence.

Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals and asterisks show significant differences (One-sample t-test, change from 0) of each mutant from time point 0, where time points are distinguished by colour: * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, **** p &lt; 0.0001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190174-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>a) Transposon insertions within and around iscA, sirC, cueR and curA in S. Typhimurium planktonic culture compared to biofilms on an alfalfa plant grown for 24 or 72 hours. Lines show the insertion loci and the height of the lines shows the number of reads mapped to the loci. The colour of the line indicates the orientation of the promoter within the transposon: red lines denote the promoter is promoting transcription left-to-right, and blue lines denote right-to-left. Plot files shown are representative of two independent replicates. b) Percentage increase or decrease in iscA, sirC, cueR deletion mutants in biofilms formed on glass (top panel) and alfalfa plant sprouts (bottom panel) in competition with wild type (WT) S.
