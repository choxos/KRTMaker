Often, and on both sides, the genes at the forefront of the interaction are part of large, diverse, and highly mutable gene families. Pathogen effectors, and host resistance genes, can be part of some of the most numerous gene families in their respective genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tang et al. 2022</xref>). Effectors are typically more diverse than other genes in pathogen genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2016</xref>), and in some cases are encoded by parts of the genome that mutate rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rouxel et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Like many pathogen effector genes, HYPs encode nematode proteins that are secreted into the plant, are necessary for infection, have no known homologues, and do not encode any recognised PFAM domains (with the exception of an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>). HYPs, however, are highly unusual even among effectors. To date, 75 unique genomic sequences across three subfamilies (HYP1, <italic>n</italic>=41; HYP2, <italic>n</italic>=12; and HYP3<italic>, n=22; average length</italic> 888 bp) have been cloned. Irrespective of subfamily, all cloned HYPs share two continuous strings of coding sequence that are ~95% identical between genes (410 bp at the 5’ and 94 bp at the 3’). Subfamilies are distinguished primarily, although not exclusively, by a subfamily-specific hyper-variable “domain” (HVD) of unknown function, between the conserved regions. Using HYP1 subfamily members as an example, the HVD can encode up to four “motifs”, some of which themselves contain variable single- or di- amino acid residues (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4). Ignoring the variability within each motif, the 41 unique HYP1 genes contain 17 different organisations of these motifs, with little observable pattern. HYP3s show similar levels of variation (although their HVD contains a different number and organisation of an entirely different set of “motifs”), while HYP2 lacks the HVD domain altogether.</p><p id="P5">Regardless of organisation, the entire HVD is transcribed as a single exon, in frame with the flanking conserved regions: the variation described is genomic, rather than being the result of alternative splicing. Most of the variation within this domain is not just differences in the number of repeats of a particular motif, but differences in the organisations of motifs, which themselves can vary in the sequence that encodes them.</p><p id="P6">Despite that 75 unique HYP genes have been cloned from a population, no individual nematode genome encodes them all. Individuals vary in the types of effector subfamilies that their genomes encode, and individuals vary in their overall number of HYP genes across an order of magnitude. Importantly, this is not several copies of the same gene, but several different HYP genes that vary in the organisation of their respective HVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there is no known mechanism that can account for both the hyper-variable domain organisations and the apparent gene number variation spanning an order of magnitude between sisters of the same population.</p><p id="P7">The genetics underlying HYP effectors has remained elusive because previous genome sequencing attempts pre-dated the discovery of HYPs, and used a combination of 76 bp and 100 bp Illumina reads that are shorter than either HYP conserved region (5). To understand the genetic basis of variability and stability in the HYP effectors, we sequenced and assembled long-read genomes of two related species. Strikingly, we found single gene loci for HYP1 and HYP3, indicating that the bewildering diversity of HYPs in fact represents one of the largest allelic series of any organism described to date: conservatively close to a thousand alleles.</p><p id="P8"><italic>We</italic> use the expanded HYP repertoire to define the rules underlying HYP “editing” in sufficient detail to simulate HVDs <italic>in silico.</italic> Finally, by analysing the HYP complement of 68 individual nematodes we found that despite the huge number of alleles, most individuals are homozygous. Hypothetical solutions which explain the juxtaposition of these apparently contradictory phenomena are discussed, perhaps pointing to the underlying cause of the diversity itself.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HYP variation is allelic</title><p id="P9">To investigate the genetic basis of HYP variation, we needed to first determine the genomic neighbourhood of HYP effectors in individual nematodes. Due to the microscopic size of each animal, we employed single molecule read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio) of a population. While we cannot be certain any two reads came from the same individual (even if they overlap perfectly), we can be absolutely certain that each read came from a single individual. By assigning long HYP-containing single DNA molecules from individuals onto a highly contiguous consensus assembly, based primarily on the non-HYP surrounding sequence, we were able to determine the HYP content of individual nematodes.</p><p id="P10">Therefore, to provide the necessary high-quality consensus assemblies, the genomes of <italic>Globodera pallida</italic> and <italic>Globodera rostochiensis</italic> were re-sequenced and assembled (See methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To identify HYP-containing long reads from single <italic>G. pallida</italic> individuals, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each HYP subfamily. These modelsw were trained the 75 unique cloned HYP sequences available in NCBI (GenBank accession numbers KM206198 to KM206272 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>). The parameters were iteratively optimised to accurately identify reads from each subfamily while still maintaining sensitivity for discovering reads with new HYP variants. A total of 251, 334 and 339 unique reads were identified for subfamilies 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</p><p id="P11">Strikingly, no single read contained more than one HYP, with the exception of HYP2-containing reads. All HYP-containing reads were mapped, in their entirety, to the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly revealing just two, otherwise unremarkable, loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): HYP1-containing reads mapped to <italic>G. pallida</italic> Newton scaffold 46, while HYP2 and HYP3-containing reads mapped to <italic>G. pallida</italic> Newton scaffold 8. Upon closer inspection and comparison to related isolates and species, a broadly conserved arrangement and the ancestral state in the <italic>Globodera</italic> was revealed - a single gene locus for HYP1, and a single gene locus for HYP3 approximately 30 kb away from a two or three-gene locus for HYP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Taken together, these data show that, strikingly, all of the HYP1 and HYP3 variation observed (which encompasses the dominant majority of all HYP variation) is allelic.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The rules of HYP variation</title><p id="P13">To date, four degenerate motifs were discovered for HYP1, and 2 for HYP3, based on Sanger sequencing of cloned HYPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>). To determine a fuller extent of HYP variants, and the frequency in the population of each, a CRISPR enrichment protocol was developed to selectively enrich for the HYP1 and HYP3 loci, providing thousands of unbiased nanopore reads across each locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). To characterise the variants within a <italic>G. pallida</italic> population, a fraction of the available nanopore reads (the top ~130 highest quality reads (Phred &gt;17)) were used in an iterative approach to, as far as possible, classify the HYP motifs within each read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In so doing, we were able to re-classify degenerate motifs based on their nucleotide sequence. For example, motif 1.1 ([Y|S][N|E|D]RGGG) can be readily divided into deduced amino acid sequences 1.1.a (YERGGG), 1.1.b (SDRGGG), and 1.1.c (SNRGGG) - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). The following lists all motifs that can be reliably distinguished in this way in <italic>G. pallida</italic>: 1.1.a (YERGGG), 1.1.b (SDRGGG), 1.1.c (SNRGGG); 1.2.a (RDRGD), 1.2.bc (SDRGD/SDRGE); 1.3 (RDNKRG); 1.4 (REGGD).</p><p id="P15">We found that the number and organisation of the motifs within the HVD are clearly non-random. Most unique HYP1s contain 23 or 24 motifs within their hyper-variable domain, although this varies greatly (from 1 to 27 motifs). Some motifs occur more frequently than others within unique HYP1s within the entire population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), or within an individual HVD, although this varies greatly: motif 1.1.b is 10 times more common than motif 1.4 overall, and in one case eight times more common within a HVD.</p><p id="P16">Interestingly, patterns are clearly evident in the organisations of the motifs. Not all possible adjacent motif pairs were observed, and many of those that were observed were not reciprocal: 1.4 (REGGD) was almost always followed by 1.1.a (YERGGG), but 1.1.a was never followed by 1.4. Exceptions include 1.1.b (SDRGGG) and 1.2.a (RDRGD) which were regularly observed following one another. Strikingly, the most common pair (1.1.a (YERGGG) followed by 1.1.c (SNRGGG)) occurs 180 times more than the least common pair (1.2.bc (SDRGD/SDRGE) followed by 1.1.c (SNRGGG)). Homopolymers were almost never observed: only motifs 1.1.c (SNRGGG) and 1.1.b (SDRGGG) occur in homopolymers, with four 1.1.c being the longest observed to date. Of all possible organization of motifs in triples (343) we only observed 75, and the distribution is similarly skewed. The top 20 most common triples include all motifs, and account for 85% of all observed triples, and yet are insufficient to build most HYP1s HVDs with a variable domain &gt;20 (31 out of the 43 HVDs of length longer than 20). This suggests that the skewed distribution of observed triples in the population is not due simply to differences between HYPs, but rather that most individual HVDs are characterised by common higher-order combinations of motifs interspersed with rare higher-order combinations of motifs.</p><p id="P17">Zooming out further, patterns coalesce. The HYP1 HVD almost always started (i.e. 54 out of 55 times) and ended (i.e. 47 out of 55 times) with motif 1.1.a (YERGGG). More specifically, HYP1 hypervariable domains often end in the following block of five motifs: 1.4 (REGGD), 1.1.a (YERGGG), 1.1.c (SNRGGG), 1.2.a (RDRGD), 1.1.a (YERGGG). The probability of each motif in each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), together with the analysis of adjacent pairs and triples, revealed clear rules to the organisation of motifs within the HVD at the scale of the HVD itself. Interestingly, a phylogenetic tree inferred from the non-HVD domains of HYP1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) grouped certain categories of HVDs. This suggests that although the non-HVD is highly conserved it somehow carries information about the structure of the HVD itself.</p><p id="P18">Based on just three rules: 1) possibility of a given motif to follow another one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>); 2) probability of motif at each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>); and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) known starts and ends - we can simulate HYP1s with &gt;20 motifs that look “normal”. When we simulate a million HYP1 HVDs in silico, we re-identify most known organisations and extend the theoretical limit to &gt;73,000 unique variants. This suggests that we have developed a sufficient understanding of the rules of HYP variation to recreate known HYPs <italic>in silico,</italic> and thereby provide a theoretical limit in the tens of thousands, based on extant examples. In contrast, these rules do not apply to the HYP1s of the closely related species, <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> (GrHYP1s). GrHYP1s are shorter (typically 11 or 13 motifs), composed of an almost entirely different set of motifs, and seem to obey a very different set of rules, but obey rules nonetheless (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HYP variation is conservatively estimated to exceed a thousand alleles</title><p id="P19">The theoretical limit of HYP1 variation will massively exceed the true limit because reality is constrained in a multitude of ways that the simulation is not. To estimate the number of alleles in the population, we adopted a population genetics approach. Using the ~130 highest quality (Phred&gt;q17) nanopore CRISPR-enrichment reads for each species, we identified 55 unique GpHYP1 variants and 90 unique GrHYP1 variants. Not all variants were equally represented within the populations sequenced. In fact, the distribution was extremely skewed, roughly following Zipf’s law: the most common sequence is about twice as common as the next, which itself is about twice as common as the next, etc.. The top two most common HYP1s account for 3.6% of unique variants but 50% of all reads, while at the same time, 47 variants each only occur once and account for 85% of unique variants but only 35% of the reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). A similar pattern is observed for HYP1s of <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> (albeit with an even greater proportion of unique variants - 93% of unique variants only occur once (84/90), representing 67% of reads).</p><p id="P20">We can extrapolate to the total number of alleles in the population by using the frequency distribution of unique sampled alleles in classical species richness calculations. Using the 133 reads alone, the total number of <italic>G. pallida</italic> HYP1 alleles is estimated to be 235 and 654 using Chao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">O’hara 2005</xref>) species estimation or the Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">O’hara 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chiu et al. 2014</xref>)), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The total number of predicted alleles for HYP1 in <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> is even higher; 1252 and 1235 using Chao species estimation or the ACE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). HYP3 alleles show a similar distribution but are generally less variable than HYP1s in <italic>G. pallida:</italic> 18 unique out of 130, estimated population size of 31 and 48 for Chao and ACE respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Given that the bulk of HYP variation is HYP1 variation, HYP1s are the focus of this manuscript.</p><p id="P21">Given that we: 1) analysed a single population of a global pathogen; 2) knowingly ignored all variation outside the HYP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>); and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were conservative in predicting variants in general - these estimates are likely underestimates. Taken together, we predict that global HYP1 variation likely exceeds a thousand alleles per locus.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Apparent non-mendelian inheritance of HYP alleles</title><p id="P22">To ascertain the contribution of each individual nematode to the overwhelming diversity of HYPs at the population level, we adapted a PCR protocol to reliably function for two amplifications from a second stage juvenile nematode (J2). From each of 68 individual J2s the HYP1 and HYP3 loci were amplified (with unique barcode pairs appended to the primers), pooled and sequenced using PacBio HiFi. In parallel a series of control amplifications were carried out from known homozygous or heterozygous pools of plasmids containing HYPs.</p><p id="P23">Consistent with the nanopore data, we found that few HYP variants dominate and that many variants occurred very rarely. As is common for a metagenetic approach in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2015</xref>), within each barcode pair, even homozygous controls, several different HYP alleles could be identified. These could be explained by multiple HYPs in the starting DNA, cross contamination, miss characterisation of barcodes, and/or sequencing errors (in the gene or the barcode). The controls allowed us to establish a threshold to confidently distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous starting material. As expected, known homozygous controls have most (&gt;90%) of their reads corresponding to a single HYP variant. Heterozygous controls have about half (approx. 40%) of their reads corresponding to a single HYP variant. Analysing the proportion of reads for each barcode pair contributed by the most common allele allowed us to determine whether the underlying control sample was homozygous or heterozygous, without error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We could not, however, reliably distinguish unequal ratio controls (1:100, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000, and 1:5000) from homozygous controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Therefore, for reads from individual animals of unknown zygosity, we established a threshold of &gt;80% for a likely homozygous sample.</p><p id="P24">Computing the zygosity of individual J2s revealed a surprising anomaly: most individuals were homozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This result was surprising because the probability of being homozygous decreases as a function of the number of alleles in the population, which we estimated to be over a thousand. Known heterozygous controls do not show homozygosity using these criteria, so we reasoned this was not an artefact of PCR “selecting” one allele over the other. To calculate the improbability of this result, we made the conservative assumption that the known 55 HYP1 alleles are all that exist, and empirically derived the probability of 38/68 individuals being homozygous to be substantially less than one in 10 million: after 10 million simulations of selecting two parental alleles from the population for each of 68 nematodes, the highest number of homozygous individuals was 8/68, which occurred once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). HYP3 had a similarly large proportion of homozygous individuals (19/45), but seems to be independent from the HYP1 locus (i.e. individuals homozygous for HYP3 are not also preferentially homozygous for HYP1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Importantly, dominant alleles in those homozygous individuals are not diverse enough to explain the distribution of alleles in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysing the most common allele in each of the 38 HYP1 homozygous individuals revealed just four variants in total, which include the top three most common alleles from the nanopore sequencing (36/133, 30/133, and 10/133) and only one rare allele (1/133). Combining the second most common alleles in all 38 “homozygous” individuals reveals 17 additional variants and 15 of which only occur once in this set. Including 1st and 2nd alleles in “homozygous” individuals is sufficient to recreate the Zipfian distribution observed in the population data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Although we have been extremely conservative at each step when constructing estimates of HYP diversity, an effector with one thousand alleles is unprecedented in pathology, and perhaps in genes in general. HYP allelic variation even exceeds the most widely recognised hypervariable genes, immunoglobulins. While thousands of immunoglobulin variants have been characterised, and theoretically millions of variants are possible (1x10^7 in humans) (Schroeder, 2006), V(D)J diversity is achieved by recombination of segments that exist as multiple copy arrays on the chromosome. By contrast, HYPs are single copy loci with potentially thousands of alleles.</p><p id="P27">We can confidently rule out sequencing errors contributing in whole, or even in small part, to both the diversity and the nature of the diversity because: we have used three sequencing technologies (Nanopore, PacBio, and Sanger) each of which reveals HYP variation; two species, each of which show considerable, but different, HYP variation; and importantly we have found two sets of quite different rules, the nature of the variation in <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> (a pseudo alternating pattern, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) is largely different to the nature of the variation in <italic>G. pallida</italic> (shuffling of blocks).</p><p id="P28">Phylogenetics points to an accumulation of HVD alleles, rather than a contraction of multi-copy arrays into a single copy locus, over evolutionary time. The synteny between <italic>G. pallida</italic> and <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> suggests their last common ancestor had all three HYP families. Whether it had HVDs of today’s diversity is unknown, but given that the HVDs of <italic>G. pallida</italic> and <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> today are markedly different from one another and appear to obey very different sets of rules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), we know that the present day complement of HYP alleles in at least one, but perhaps both, of <italic>G. pallida</italic> or <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> must have arisen since their divergence (i.e. the last 30 million years). Supporting this hypothesis, the close outgroup <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> has two HYP-like genes (Hsc_gene_1517 and Hsc_gene_17937) with yet again entirely different HVD structures that neither resemble HYP1s or HYP3s from either Globodera species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Siddique et al. 2022</xref>). Taken together, this suggests a proto-HYP predated the divergence of Heterodera spp. and Globodera spp., which is estimated to be some 100 million years ago.</p><p id="P29">To understand how HYP diversity evolved, i.e, the pathway from one to one thousand alleles, we need to understand how HYP diversity is created. We intuitively rule out random mutations and subsequent selection because they seem incongruent with the diversity and nature of HYP variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Similarly, we must rule out mechanisms akin, even in small part, to V(D)J recombination because of: a) genetic capital; and b) imprecision. In terms of genetic capital, V(D)J diversity requires a reservoir of multiple copy arrays on the chromosome that HYPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) do not require. Most likely, the genetic capital used to generate new HYP variants comes from within the HVD itself. In terms of imprecision, V(D)J domains are joined by non-homologous end joining, resulting in imprecise joints that contain added nucleotides, contributing to the diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chi et al. 2020</xref>). The source of HYP diversity is apparently flawless. This is evident from extant HYP genes differing in only the middle of the middle exon without disrupting the open reading frame, despite rearrangements of motifs that differ in length. A mechanism of genome editing that is aware of frame, is both unexpected and more akin to guided shuffling/rearranging of the HVD (without inversion), rather than error-prone assembly from a diverse repertoire. We term this phenomenon HVD-editing.</p><p id="P30">Our primary hypothesis on HVD-editing comes from the striking observations that: i) sequencing a population reveals many rare alleles, and ii) despite potentially thousands of alleles, most individuals appear homozygous for common alleles. We therefore conclude that there must be some mechanism to bias apparent inheritance. Four options are considered: 1) selective mating; 2) abortion of heterozygote zygotes; 3) gene conversion; and 4) post embryonic hypermutation in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Selective mating and zygote abortion seem highly improbable because the number of alleles could easily be greater than the number of nematodes that may infect a single plant. Sex resulting in progeny, in either scenario, is deemed to be sufficiently rare to doom the species to extinction.</p><p id="P31">The gene conversion hypothesis only explains the improbably high proportion of homozygous individuals, but fails to account for the lack of diversity between said individuals. Consequently, somatic hypermutation remains the only hypothesis we cannot rule out, as it explains all observed phenomena. Specifically, the Zipfian distribution of allele frequency of the population can only be recapitulated with individual whole nematode sequencing if we include the second most common allele in “homozygous” individuals. This may initially seem counterintuitive, but is analogous to what would happen if individual whole humans were sequenced and their immunoglobulin diversity analysed: some rare and re-arranged immunoglobulins, with some “dominant” alleles that have apparently biased inheritance. This observation would only mase sense with the understanding that V(D)J recombination takes place in a small subset of somatic tissues, namely T- and B-cells. If a similar idea, albeit a different mechanism, gives rise to polyzygotic individuals at the HYP locus from a homozygous progenitor, it is tempting to think this would take place in the two cells in which HYPs are expressed, the amphid sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>). This would also elegantly explain the observed ratios of HYP variation within the individual and within the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A programmed difference between the genomes of the germline and the soma, as seen for immunoglobulins, is also important because it means that the mechanism(s) is(are) still happening today - we would be observing an ongoing process, not cataloguing what evolution has selected from a greater pool of diversity.Hypothetical explanations for observations</p><p id="P32">If novel alleles within the individual resemble derivatives of the dominant allele, then this would also favour somatic hypermutation over conversion. I.e. the second most common allele in “homozygous” individuals would be related to the most common allele, in ways that the two most common alleles in “heterozygous” individuals would not be related to one another. Indeed, the second most common alleles in “homozygous” individuals are typically shorter than the dominant allele (22/38 J2), whereas for “heterozygous” individuals they are not (2/24). Similarly, not all HYPs have all motifs within their HVD. So we would expect 2nd alleles in “homozygous” individuals, if they were derivatives of the dominant allele, to contain only those motifs present in the dominant allele, but we would not expect the same constraint on the two most common alleles in “heterozygous” individuals. Indeed, 37/38 2nd alleles in “homozygous” individuals contain exclusively motifs present in the dominant allele, whereas the opposite is observed for “heterozygous” individuals (1/24). Taken together, classical Mendelian inheritance of the locus, coupled with somatic hypermutation in the soma, would explain all observed phenomena.</p><p id="P33">While determining the teleology of phenomena is often challenging, it is particularly so for HYP variation. Programmed variation is relatively rare, but widely distributed across the tree of life including invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Wang et al. 2017</xref>). When and why organisms distinguish between germline and somatic genomes varies, but can include the “silencing” of germline-active genes in the soma (e.g. programmed DNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Wang et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gonzalez de la Rosa et al. 2021</xref>)) or restricting the generation of variation to the soma, to balance adaptability in recognising invading pathogens with genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chi et al. 2020</xref>). HYPs are involved in inter-kingdom interactions, expressed during parasitism, and required for full pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eves-van den Akker et al. 2014</xref>), but in this case they are deployed by the invading organism. What aspect of plant-biology requires such extreme diversity in the pathogen is not clear, nor whether it is diversity to overcome some aspect of one host, or the differences between hosts/host species. The implication would be that the allele you are born with, and presumably the one you pass on to your offspring, is not the one you interact with the plant with. Plant-parasitic nematodes face a very uncertain environment, the host might change every year, and one can imagine strategies evolving that maximise “getting through the year”.</p><p id="P34">Given that pathogens are engaged in a fierce co-evolutionary arms race with their host, it should not be surprising to uncover yet more unusual, but potentially useful, biology (c.f. CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jinek et al. 2012</xref>); TALENs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boch et al. 2009</xref>); and transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Joos et al. 1983</xref>)). Taken together, our working hypothesis is that there is remarkable and potentially useful biology underlying HVD variation, it is active today, it creates variation from genetic capital within the HVD itself, it does so in a subset of the soma (most likely the cells in which they are expressed), it is precisely guided, and it can theoretically produce thousands of such variants without scars. Future work will test these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>DNA extractions</title><p id="P35">For DNA extractions from a population, a pellet of freshly hatched J2s was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Between 30,000 and 50,000 J2s were used for high-molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction, resulting in ~3.5-5μg of DNA. This was scaled up as required to make larger/multiple libraries. Briefly, a pellet of frozen J2s was homogenised in 20 μL of lysis buffer (0.1M Tris at pH 8.0, 0.5M NaCl, 50mM EDTA and 1%SDS) using a micropestle.
