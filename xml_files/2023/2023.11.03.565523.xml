Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (<italic>i</italic>) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the Animal Tree of Life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (<italic>ii</italic>) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus interaction networks, and (<italic>iii</italic>) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>viromes</kwd><kwd>invertebrates</kwd><kwd>metatranscriptomics</kwd><kwd>virus ecology</kwd><kwd>compositional analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Viruses are arguably the most successful biological entities on Earth, given their ubiquitousness, diversity and numerical abundance, apart from their capability to infect organisms from all domains of cellular life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Breitbart &amp; Rohwer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Koonin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Wasik &amp; Turner, 2013</xref>).

However, despite the accelerated pace of virus discovery through metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, knowledge of animal viral diversity is still skewed towards viruses that cause disease in humans, involve arthropod vectors, or affect economically relevant species, including culturable arthropods and mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Harvey &amp; Holmes, 2022</xref>). Countless viral species, which might play pivotal roles in underexplored organisms, still remain obscured by this bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cobbin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The scientific community is actively making efforts to address this bias.

Some works have greatly improved the exploration of invertebrate viromes with a larger scope, simultaneously analyzing the viromes of invertebrate species distributed across different phyla, including the first characterizations of annelid, platyhelminth and tunicate viromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gudenkauf &amp; Hewson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). However, the Metazoa Tree of Life encompasses a vast diversity of groups (Dunn et al., 2014), and viral communities have yet to be discovered for the first time in many phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Harvey &amp; Holmes, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The SRA archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>) hosts millions of publicly accessible meta-transcriptomic and meta-genomic datasets that comprise more than 7⋅10<sup>16</sup> sequenced bases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sragrowth/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sragrowth/</ext-link>). Since many researchers who create these datasets do not focus on viral communities, this data provides an opportunity to explore virus diversity in uncharted organisms and ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Olendraite et al., 2023</xref>). The insightfulness of such analyses depends on the quality of complementary metadata in the databases (Pérez-Riverol et al., 2019), including accurate descriptions of sampling conditions, geographic location, and host taxonomy, among other factors. In the present study, the viromes of 417 publicly accessible invertebrate RNA-Seq datasets spanning 31 animal phyla are inferred through a read taxonomic classification pipeline. After classifying the read sequences to existing families of RNA and DNA viruses, the study: (<italic>i</italic>) provides the first description of the virome composition at the family level for several invertebrate phyla, such as Bryozoa, Ctenophora or Onychophora, (<italic>ii</italic>) involves diversity measurements for the estimated viromes and the characterization of the obtained virus-invertebrate interaction network structure, and (<italic>iii</italic>) investigates whether virome composition differences among samples can be attributed to the host phylum and/or habitat.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sampling of sequencing datasets</title><p id="P7">All sequencing accession numbers for the 31 different invertebrate phyla stored in NIH’s SRA database were retrieved in January 2023. This comprehensive database combines information from NCBI’s SRA, EBI’s ENA and DDBJ databases, according to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) initiative. This added up to a total of 762,540 accessions for which metadata from multiple fields were fetched from SRA and BioSample databases. Mainly, it was important to collect for each accession its associated BioSample identifier, the organism’s TaxID, the number of sequenced bases, the average read length and details about the library, such as its strategy, source, and layout. Additionally, characteristics of the sampling conditions were retrieved from <italic>isolation_source</italic>, <italic>geo_loc_name</italic> and <italic>lat_lon</italic> fields from BioSample data.</p><p id="P8">The taxonomic lineage of each TaxID, spanning from the phylum level to subspecies, was obtained using TaxonKit and the NCBI’s taxonomy database (<italic>taxdump</italic>) version last modified on March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2023. Since NCBI’s species names often involve subspecies, laboratory strains or species mixtures, it was necessary to perform a harmonization step. Namely, all species names had to be binomial, and when this degree of specificity could not be reached, the “sp.” or “spp.” abbreviations would be added after the lowest certain taxon.</p><p id="P9">SRA metadata information was used to narrow down the selected accession data to a subset that was eligible for the analysis. The following three criteria were used to do this: (<italic>i</italic>) library strategy was restricted to RNA-Seq, (<italic>ii</italic>) average read length had to be greater or equal than 75 bases and (<italic>iii</italic>) the total number of sequenced bases had to be greater than 3 Gb. The rationale behind these two last criteria is to obtain samples with longer reads in order to have higher sensitivity of read-based taxonomic classifiers and to keep samples where the virome composition estimation is as independent from the sequencing depth as possible, respectively.</p><p id="P10">This led to a total number of 82,145 eligible run accessions. Moreover, by using the three above mentioned criteria a decline was noted in the number of unique species to roughly one fourth of the original number.</p><p id="P11">To avoid the overrepresentation of individual species, only one run per species was analyzed. Furthermore, since the distribution of unique species is highly asymmetrical between phyla, the maximum number of analyzed species was set to 20 per phylum when possible, trying to select species from different lineages within each phylum. The sampling algorithm tries to maximize the number of samples selected for rare phyla (<italic>i.e</italic>., phyla with a smaller number of datasets), while maintaining a balanced number of samples for phyla with a greater availability of datasets. However, an exception was made for mollusks (39 observations), since they contained a large number of unique species from a wide range of habitats. Taking this into account, the selected species, as well as their final run accession for the analysis, were sampled randomly. When possible, sequenced samples with less than 30 Gb were prioritized over larger datasets in order to speed up the analysis.</p><p id="P12">The habitat of each organism was reconstructed using the descriptors about the location and source of each sample’s isolate alongside with the information found in the corresponding WoRMS website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahyong et al., 2023</xref>) entry. Habitat annotation for 143 samples relied solely on ecological information of the species obtained from WoRMS or specific publications, since the geographical location was completely unrecoverable from their metadata in SRA and BioSample. We classified each sample’s habitat into five categories: brackish, freshwater, intertidal zone, marine, and terrestrial. This also served as a way to identify samples that were laboratory-reared, finding that nine out of the 417 analyzed accessions had a laboratory origin. This fraction could be even larger due to the widespread sparse metadata annotation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Download and pre-processing of raw read files</title><p id="P13">Raw read files were downloaded in FASTQ format using fasterq-dump of SRA toolkit version 2.11.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools">https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools</ext-link>).

These can be caused by technical issues of NGS and do not reflect the true abundance of the transcript within the sample’s RNA molecule population. This step was implemented with the purpose of reducing the volume of reads for downstream analyses, which speeds up the pipeline.</p><p id="P15">Second, SortMeRNA version 4.3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kopylova et al., 2012</xref>) was used to filter out reads of abundant transcripts with non-viral origin. All reads were compared against SortMeRNA’s default rRNA databases for 18S and 28S rRNA subunits of eukaryotes and a custom database consisting of more than 4000 variants of cytochrome c oxidase (<italic>COX</italic>) mRNA sequences. If a single-end read showed significant similarity to any sequence in these reference databases, it was excluded. Similarly, paired-end reads were only kept for downstream analyses if neither of the ends had a match with any sequence in the reference databases.</p><p id="P16">Third, Trimmomatic version 0.39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) was used over the remaining reads to trim out adapters introduced by NGS platforms and terminal regions with an average base call accuracy lower than 80%. The minimum read length after trimming was set to 25.</p><p id="P17">In some instances, pairing of FASTQ files was found to be corrupted either from the beginning or after any of the preprocessing steps. When necessary, pairing was restored using BBMap’s repair.sh script in order to resume the pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Read-based taxonomic classification</title><p id="P18">The taxonomic classification of preprocessed reads was conducted using Kaiju version 1.8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Menzel et al., 2016</xref>). A subset of NCBI’s RefSeq non-redundant proteins (<italic>nr</italic>) database, which includes all protein sequences classified under the superkingdom ‘Viruses’ (TaxID = 10239), served as the reference database. This subset was derived from a version of the <italic>nr</italic> database downloaded in November 2022.</p><p id="P19">Kaiju takes the reads and translates them to all six possible reading frames. Subsequently, these amino acid sequences are compared with those in the reference database.

However, if the virus of the matching sequence is not classified to a taxon as specific as the family level or if it is not classified under an existing viral family, the read count is added to a category of viruses with uncertain family. So, a vector of read absolute abundances of viral families is constructed for each sample and these are combined into a matrix.</p><p id="P21">It is important to acknowledge that the virus family nomenclature used in this study is the one reported on the NCBI’s taxonomy database.

In this case, compositions were first transformed to relative abundances vectors with respect to the total number of reads assigned to eukaryotic viral families. In the case of microbiome compositional data, it has also been acknowledged that dimensionality reduction both in observations and features can lead to a more informative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, it was decided to exclude viral families that did not reach an average relative abundance of 0.01%.

There is an outlying sample in terms of the viral proportion of the reads population, which corresponds to the flatworm <italic>Rhynchomesostoma</italic> sp. (9%). This was likely influenced by the fact that this was the only sample with less than a million reads, leading to a more inaccurate estimation of its transcriptome. When sorting the phyla based on their median viral proportion of reads, it can be observed that phyla such as Onychophora, Mollusca, and Echinodermata lie on the lower end of viral abundance, while samples of Rotifera and Bryozoa harbor a larger proportion of viral RNA.</p><p id="P46">Additionally, when examined by habitat, freshwater samples showed the highest proportion of viral reads on average (1.7%), while terrestrial samples had the lowest (0.8%).

However, proteins identified within these ubiquitous families often exhibited eukaryotic orthologs or xenologs. For instance, actin-like products were erroneously classified to <italic>Retroviridae</italic> in great numbers (CAA25063.1, P00544.1, QDH76138.1, and QDH76139.1). Furthermore, numerous sequences assigned to NCLDV families exhibited significant similarity to various host proteins, including heat-shock proteins, tRNA synthetase, histone, and ubiquitin sequences, among others. Although these genes with eukaryotic homologs can potentially be encoded by NCLDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Raoult et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">de Souza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ha et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Farzad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Talbert et al., 2022</xref>), their abundance was significantly greater than those associated with the virus replication, which lack close homologs in the host genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Koonin &amp; Yutin, 2010</xref>). This could hint in the direction of these hits representing host sequences in the samples, which could partly explain why a large part of the apparently more dominant viral families identified across the viromes were DNA viruses, contrary to the common consensus, which states that RNA viruses dominate invertebrate viromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Porter et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P52"><italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, an RNA virus family known to infect invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Moureau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Parry &amp; Asgari, 2019</xref>), emerged as the third family with a higher average relative abundance of reads. However, its hits were often linked to a polyprotein of a bovine pestivirus species, incorporating a ubiquitin-like sequence (AAA42855.1). Flaviviruses are known to interact with host’s ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and some flaviviruses of vertebrates even incorporate it into their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mayer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Simmonds et al., 2017b</xref>). However, the scarcity of other matches for <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and the recent incorporation of ubiquitin to genomes of flaviviruses make it unlikely that a significant number of these transcripts have a true viral origin. Consequently, the abundance of flaviviruses may have been notably overestimated within the viromes.</p><p id="P53">The surprising position of <italic>Mitoviridae</italic> as the fifth most consistently abundant viral family was found to be almost entirely caused by the identification of a highly conserved transcription elongation factor of eukaryotes that was misannotated as part of a mitovirus genome in the reference database (QDH87640.1).</p><p id="P54">Overall, it was challenging to determine whether the identified transcripts stemmed from genomes of independent viruses or from integrated virus sequences within the host’s genome since the study was based solely on RNA-Seq data. It is well-known that endogenous viral elements (EVEs) of DNA and non-retroviral RNA viruses are widespread across invertebrate genomes and these EVEs can be transcriptionally active (ter Horst et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Veglia et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, EVEs of invertebrate genomes originate from a wider range of viral families when compared to vertebrate genomes and the abundance and diversity of EVEs is highly variable even between closely related invertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gilbert &amp; Belliardo, 2022</xref>). Besides, in case of a true presence of retroviruses in the samples, it remains unknown if the viruses are found in the form of proviruses, as it has been reported to be common in insect retrovirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Terzian et al., 2001</xref>). It is also uncertain to which extent these integrated viruses could be transcriptionally active across the different invertebrate phyla.</p><p id="P55">With respect to the host of the detected viruses, 18 of the 30 most abundant viral families (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4 at [Supplementary_files]</xref>) have at least one member described that is able to infect invertebrates, considering the recent discoveries in <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Mitoviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jacquat et al., 2022</xref>) and <italic>Partitiviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cross et al., 2020</xref>). In many cases, the known host range of these families among invertebrates is limited to arthropods, but it is yet unknown if eventually they will be found in other invertebrate phyla. For instance, the presence of viruses of the family <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> was recently confirmed in sponges, thereby broadening its previously acknowledged host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Canuti et al., 2022</xref>). In our results, around 0.8% of all eukaryotic virus reads were mapped to <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> for Porifera samples on average, which is nonetheless lower than the mean relative abundance reported overall (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4 at [Supplementary_files]</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Sequences related to <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> were also identified in substantial amounts, following a trend seen in other studies on invertebrate viromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Grasis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brüwer &amp; Voolstra, 2018</xref>). In this case, most of the hits for <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> were mainly related to sequences of thymidylate synthase, which is encoded both by the genomes of herpesviruses and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gáspár et al., 2002</xref>). To a lesser extent, hits to both subunits of ribonucleotide reductase were also frequent for <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>.

Although <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> is acknowledged to harbor exclusively vertebrate-infecting viruses, it has recently been suggested that the closely related family of <italic>Malacoherpesviridae</italic>, whose only two members are mollusk-infecting viruses, could be largely underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rosani et al., 2023</xref>). In our study, sequences classified to <italic>Malacoherpesviridae</italic> were rare, absent from most of the samples and mostly related to a single hit, a putative ATP-dependent DNA ligase (YP_006908759). This protein is not encoded by viruses of <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, but it has been annotated with this function in three different malacoherpesvirus genomes. Apparently, this protein shows especially close similarity to the ATP-dependent DNA ligase of invertebrates, mainly arthropods, nematodes, placozoans, and platyhelminths. BLASTp searches were performed for the query sequences that matched this protein and significant similarities to the homologs within invertebrate genomes were found. Thus, it is unclear to which extent the abundance and ubiquitousness of herpes-like viruses was overestimated.</p><p id="P57">Establishing the hosts of viruses discovered through meta-transcriptomics presents significant challenges, given the coexistence of multiple potential hosts within a single sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cobbin et al., 2021</xref>). Generally, the microbiome of an invertebrate constitutes a diverse set of organisms that can serve as hosts for very different viruses. Although the bacterial part of the microbiome can be ignored in this context, since phages have been excluded from the analysis, the eukaryotic fraction is nowhere near negligible in invertebrate microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Holt et al., 2022</xref>). The common occurrence of these symbioses could have further contributed to the reported abundance of protist-infecting NCLDVs. Additionally, RNA from eukaryotic viruses can be present in dietary components, ranging from other invertebrates to protists, algae, or plants or they can be present simply due to sample contamination.

In sharp contrast, Ctenophora was the phylum with the lowest number of different viral families per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The outlying sample of Chordata (Tunicata) shifted its mean to positive values compared to its median, which makes it the phylum with the second highest number of viral families on average. When seen by habitat, terrestrial and marine samples had an average ⍺-diversity almost identical to the global mean. The average viral family richness for freshwater samples was slightly higher at 23 families and intertidal zone samples showed the lowest ⍺-diversity overall with 21 distinct families on average per virome. Compared to purely marine habitats, intertidal zone habitats pose a series of stresses to local organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mouritsen &amp; Poulin, 2002</xref>), which might reduce the range of hosts that viruses are adapted to and can find in intertidal zones.

This revealed that a number of samples &gt; 15 seems to be required to capture the full range of distinct viral families within any phylum, as none of the curves reached a plateau at this sample size. However, the lack of available samples for some phyla in the SRA database makes it impossible to reach that plateau. This should point out that more sequencing and explorative efforts are needed to describe the full diversity of invertebrate viruses.</p><p id="P63">In the case of Arthropoda, the accumulation curve seemed to be exceptionally steep, which suggests that the sampled transcriptomes for this phylum harbored the most diverse sets of viral families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, Bryozoa differed from the rest of the cited phyla by starting at a much higher value of ⍺-diversity. On the lower end, Ctenophora, Platyhelminthes and Porifera showed the lowest accumulation of viral families as the sample size increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). It does not seem that habitat affiliations are the main cause of these differences between phyla, since single habitat phyla were found on both extremes, just as phyla with more variable habitats.

This set of ubiquitous families, comprising <italic>Baculo-</italic>, <italic>Flavi-</italic>, <italic>Partiti-</italic>, <italic>Polydna-</italic>, <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, and several NCLDV families, could form a core virome that is common to the majority of the analyzed samples. Nevertheless, nestedness could have been overestimated because of the erroneous classification of highly conserved host sequences as viral, as seen in some of these families.</p><p id="P68">Specialization indices (<italic>d’</italic>) were calculated for both invertebrate species and viral families within the bipartite matrix. Remarkably, the distribution of <italic>d’</italic> values was almost identical for both viruses and hosts, both having a mean <italic>d’</italic> = 0.01. The highest observed <italic>d’</italic> values did not surpass 0.06 in any case. These low <italic>d’</italic> values suggest that interactions are not restricted to specific pairs of organisms. Consequently, any of the 30 viral families included in this matrix could potentially be found in any of the viromes, as determined by the taxonomic classification pipeline employed. Furthermore, a comparison of d’ indices among phyla using an ANOVA model revealed a significant association between phylum grouping and variations in <italic>d’</italic> values (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Notably, species belonging to Onychophora, Tardigrada, Arthropoda, and Mollusca displayed a higher degree of specialization in hosting viral families. In contrast, Chaetognatha, Nematoda, and Bryozoa were characterized by a greater tendency toward generalism of viral families.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Virome composition analysis</title><p id="P69">In order to assess the dominance of each viral family within the viromes, the matrix of relative abundances was transformed into <italic>clr</italic> coefficients. Viral families with an average relative abundance below 0.01% were excluded. The transformed matrix was used to examine viral family dominance across phyla through a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). PCA was also performed, but the biplot representation of the results was not visually intuitive because of the large amount of data points and different groups defined by phylum and habitat in this dataset. The first two principal components accounted for 23% of the total variance, indicating a limited correlation among the <italic>clr</italic> coefficients of the 30 viral families studied.</p><p id="P70">Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the presence of three clusters of viral families that were distinguishable with considerable resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The first cluster consisted of 13 superabundant, ubiquitous viral families (<italic>Baculo</italic>-, <italic>Flavi</italic>-, <italic>Hepe</italic>-, <italic>Irido</italic>-, <italic>Marseille</italic>-, <italic>Mimi</italic>-, <italic>Mito</italic>-, <italic>Partiti</italic>-, <italic>Phycodna</italic>-, <italic>Pitho</italic>-, <italic>Polydnaviriformi</italic>-, <italic>Pox-</italic>, and <italic>Retroviridae</italic>) showing positive <italic>clr</italic> coefficients for all phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Within this cluster, eight of the families harbored viruses with dsDNA genomes (<italic>Baculo</italic>-, <italic>Irido</italic>-, <italic>Marseille</italic>-, <italic>Mimi</italic>-, <italic>Phycodna</italic>-, <italic>Pitho</italic>-, <italic>Polydnaviriformi</italic>-, and <italic>Poxviridae</italic>), with a notable presence of NCLDV families. In the analysis, all NCLDV families except <italic>Ascoviridae</italic> clustered together in this group. Furthermore, this cluster was the one with the highest distance to the other two clusters.</p><p id="P71">A second cluster contained less abundant families with values of <italic>clr</italic> coefficients oscillating around zero (<italic>Alloherpes</italic>-, <italic>Asco</italic>-, <italic>Nairo</italic>-, <italic>Herpes</italic>-, <italic>Hytrosa-</italic>, <italic>Nudi</italic>-, and <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>), signifying their dominance within the virome only for specific phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). DNA virus families are again more frequent here (five out of seven) and the acknowledged host ranges of these families include invertebrates in all cases except for <italic>Herpes-</italic> and <italic>Alloherpesviridae</italic>.</p><p id="P72">The last cluster is constituted by even rarer viral families that were only found to be dominant in the viromes of one or very few phyla: <italic>Adeno</italic>-, <italic>Adinto</italic>-, <italic>Adoma</italic>-, <italic>Betaflexi</italic>-, <italic>Dicistro</italic>-, <italic>Iflavi</italic>-, <italic>Marna</italic>-, <italic>Nima</italic>-, <italic>Polycipi</italic>-, and <italic>Potyviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Among the ten viral families included in this cluster, six of them were families of RNA viruses. The two only families of exclusively plant and/or fungi-infecting viruses of this 30 families dataset were found in this cluster: <italic>Betaflexi-</italic> and <italic>Potyviridae</italic>. In both cases, sequences similar to these families were identified predominantly in phyla of marine invertebrates, where the occurrence of these viruses has not been confirmed. In the case of <italic>Betaflexiviridae</italic>, most hits pointed to the occurrence of viral replicases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases within the samples. Meanwhile, most of the hits of <italic>Potyviridae</italic> were related to an inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) protein, which is only present in two potyvirus species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Tomlinson et al., 2019</xref>). This protein shows significant sequence homology to ITPase proteins of plants, and, to a lesser extent, in invertebrates. However, hits to coat proteins of potyviruses were also reported in several samples. True viral presence of both families among the samples seems likely, although the abundance of potyviruses was probably overestimated. Interestingly, <italic>Betaflexiviridae</italic>-like sequences were also identified in different transcriptomes of marine mollusk samples by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rey-Campos et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P73">Unlike the clustering observed for viral families, the separation of phyla into clusters was less obvious. Interpreting the clusters proved more challenging, not only because of the clustering’s low resolution, but also for the apparent lack of consistent patterns within the clusters based on the phylogenetic or habitat affinities between the phyla. One of the groups with a greater distance to the rest was the one formed by Arthropoda and Onychophora, two phyla that are closely related phylogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that their viromes have similar compositions at the family level. For instance, these two were the only phyla where sequences of <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>, a family of insect-infecting RNA viruses, were found with a high relative abundance.</p><p id="P74">PERMANOVA models were fitted in order to investigate the potential impact that the phylum and the habitat of an invertebrate sample could have on the composition of its virome. The dataset was restricted to phyla and habitats with 15 or more samples for the analysis. In both one-way models, it was seen that virome compositions were significantly influenced by the host’s phylum and habitat (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, the effect of the host’s phylum on the compositions was nearly six times greater than that of habitat (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6 at [Supplementary_files]</xref>). It has to be taken into account that the habitat effect could have been underestimated in this study because of the lack of a more comprehensive set of habitat categories. The phylum factor alone accounted for approximately 26% of the variance in the Euclidean distances matrix.</p><p id="P75">In the additive two-way model, regression parameters associated to both factors remained significant, suggesting that collinearity, although present, does not totally neglect the separate effect of both factors in shaping the viromes. Furthermore, the model considering phylum and habitat interaction showed that even the interaction had significant regression parameters. Nevertheless, the slight improvement in goodness of fit did not offset the increase in model complexity of the two-way models, since the model with phylum as its single covariate was the one that minimized AIC. It was checked that similar results overall were obtained when using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of the raw relative abundances matrix, which is a more traditional approach.</p><p id="P76">However, it’s important to note that the rejection of the null hypothesis in PERMANOVA could also arise from varying within-group dispersions in the case of unbalanced designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anderson &amp; Walsh, 2013</xref>). The result of PERMDISP showed that within-group dispersions were indeed heterogeneous between phyla (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Virome composition variation was more thoroughly examined using a procedure based on the analysis of the distances to the centroid, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the “average virome”, in each phylum. The strategy of fitting an ANOVA model and performing a Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was also used for this variable and showed that distances to centroid were significantly different between some phyla (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, most of the phyla exhibiting extreme distances to centroid have already been mentioned for having an exceptional behavior in terms of ⍺-diversity. Bryozoans appeared to have the most consistently similar virome compositions, closely followed by ctenophores. Conversely, mollusks showed the greatest mean distance to the centroid, together with xenacoelomorphs and sponges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P77">The habitat variability between phyla does not appear to be the primary driver of these observed differences, as phyla with both diverse and singular habitats were represented at both extremes. One potential influencing factor for these findings could be the phylogenetic proximity among species within the same phylum. This study treats species as independent observations of their respective phylum, disregarding their membership in the same genus, family, or order. This is a limitation of this study, since the phylogenetic constraints underlying species relatedness within phyla were not taken into consideration.</p><p id="P78">Additionally, the viromes of Arthopoda, Onychophora and Xenacoelomorpha exhibit notable variability in their distances to the phylum centroid. This indicates that within these phyla, certain samples are positioned very close to the centroid, while others are located considerably farther away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). That is to say, these phyla tend to show a high variability in their virome compositions, not only as the different viral families that can be found in these viromes, but also in what relative abundances they are found.</p><p id="P79">A pairwise algorithm with bootstrap resampling and simultaneous PERMANOVA and PERMDISP testing was implemented to further investigate if virome compositions were different between phyla. To ensure balanced group sizes, the sample count per phylum was standardized to 15. The results highlighted that a significant majority of phyla pairs exhibited dissimilar centroid locations in most iterations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B at [Supplementary_files]</xref>), even if a <italic>P</italic>-value adjustment method was employed to correct for multiple pairwise comparisons. Moreover, equivalence of centroid locations was observed as the most frequent result through the iterations only for a limited number of phyla pairs. Surprisingly, heterogeneous within-group dispersions were not found to be the most frequent result in any case, in contrast to earlier findings using the whole dataset.</p><p id="P80">The results of this matrix were condensed into a network to allow a visual interpretation of the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Curiously, all phyla remained connected to at least some other phylum, meaning that their virome composition centroids were not considered significantly different to each other. This resulted in a continuous network, where no phylum had an outlying virome composition that differed from the rest. However, there were some cases of phyla with few and weak connections, such as Ctenophora, Echinodermata and Platyhelminthes. In contrast, Mollusca was the phylum with the highest number of connections, some of which were strong, meaning that the “average virome” of mollusks was not distinguishable from that of some other phyla.</p><p id="P81">Some of the strongest similarities between virome compositions that can be observed in the network, can also be identified in the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), namely Arthropoda-Onychophora, Mollusca-Annelida, Kinorhyncha-Porifera, and Rotifera-Nematoda. Viromes of Arthropoda only appear to be closely similar to those of Onychophora, which also shares a rather pronounced centroid homology with Annelida, all three being phyla dominated by terrestrial species. In the case of Arthropoda and Onychophora, both belong to the clade of Panarthropoda, alongside Tardigrada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Wu et al., 2023</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), which could explain the remarkable degree of similarity observed between their virome compositions. Unfortunately, Tardigrada could not be included in this part of the analysis to test this hypothesis further because of its low sample count. Likewise, the reported similarity between the viromes of Mollusca and Annelida could be attributed to their phylogenetic relatedness, since both group within a subclade under the superphylum Lophotrochozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kocot et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the average viromes of Nemertea showed weak resemblance to those of the rest phyla in this subclade, while the similarity between the viromes of Mollusca and Bryozoa, another phylum of this subclade, was one of the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The hypothesis behind this phenomenon of closely related phyla having equivalent viromes is that viromes may have coevolved with their hosts. Viromes of these phyla are probably less influenced by changes in the host’s habitat or lifestyle during evolution. Nonetheless, this explanation seems applicable only for the virome composition similarities of a limited number of phyla.</p><p id="P82">In other cases, such as the reported similarity of virome compositions between Kinorhyncha and Porifera or Nemertea and Xenacoelomorpha, the explanation could not be found in the phylogenetic relationships between the phyla. Rather, these phyla appeared to have similar habitats among their samples. However, it is unknown why the viromes of these specific phyla were found to be so similar, given that many other phyla have apparently similar habitats. For instance, it has been described that kinorhynchs can be found inhabiting sponges, although this is not thought to be the norm and they are generally interstitial organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Higgins, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Neuhaus &amp; Higgins, 2002</xref>). Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis of lifestyles, diet, and associations with other organisms would be needed in this regard.</p><p id="P83">The reason behind some other phyla having notable similarities across their average virome compositions, such as Kinorhyncha and Mollusca, Bryozoa and Kinorhyncha or Nematoda and Rotifera, remains uncertain, since these specific pairs of phyla do not exhibit any close phylogenetic or ecological affinity. But in summary, our findings align with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Shi et al. (2016)</xref>. They underscore that the assumption of virus-host co-divergence cannot be inferred from all cases where viromes exhibit similarities across different phyla, since transmission of viruses between divergent host taxa has been frequent throughout the evolutionary history of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dolja &amp; Koonin, 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P84">A read taxonomic classification pipeline for RNA and DNA viruses was applied to more than 400 RNA-Seq datasets of invertebrates comprising 31 phyla. Overall, the estimated viromes were not widely variable in terms of ⍺-diversity, although significant differences in the means could be found between the phyla. Additionally, viromes were consistently dominated by a set of ubiquitous families, the abundance of which was likely overestimated due to the misclassification of host sequences as viral, as such is the case for families like <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> or <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>. The structure of the invertebrate-virus bipartite network showed that its interactions were highly nested, which hints to a shared core virome across the Animal Tree of Life. In the majority of the most abundant viral families found, their acknowledged host ranges in the literature included invertebrates. However, the confirmed host ranges of these families are limited to overrepresented phyla such as Arthropoda or Mollusca and the presence of most of these families has still to be confirmed for the most understudied phyla. Consequently, virus sequences in the reference databases are also biased toward these relevant phyla.</p><p id="P85">Further improvements in the resolution of the Animal Tree of Life could help improve the interpretation of invertebrate viromes, since many nodes remain unresolved and changes in the phylogeny of animal phyla keep occurring to this date. However, evidence shows that the host’s phylum has a predominant role in shaping its virome composition, rather than its habitat. A main limitation for this observation could be the effect that differential expression of host genes that had been erroneously classified as viral could have had between the phyla. Also, it is important to note that the reconstruction of the host’s habitat was based on the taxonomy of the host rather than the sampling source due to the lack of metadata in many cases. Consequently, the host’s habitat affiliation was limited to a very generic set of habitat categories.</p><p id="P86">As a concluding remark, comparability to other studies has remained limited due to the lack of studies analyzing together the RNA and DNA viromes of invertebrates at the phylum level. Additionally, ecological community structure of invertebrate-virus interactions at the phylum and family levels, respectively, and the systematic review of similarities between the virome compositions of the different phyla had not yet been published. Finally, we recommend that similar studies implement a more intensive filtering of host sequences that is not limited to rRNA transcripts, although a trade-off will always exist between false positives and false negatives when classifying host sequences as viral and excluding transcripts encoded by the viral genome with true homology to eukaryotic genes, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary files</label><media xlink:href="EMS190762-supplement-Supplementary_files.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d105aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS190762-supplement-Supplementary_materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d105aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>PA was supported by fellowship JAEIntro-2021-LifeHub-10 from CSIC.

unexamined invertebrate lineages from a large number of animal phyla. It showcases the great diversity of viromes within each phylum and investigates the role of habitat shaping animal viral communities. Furthermore, our research identifies dominant virus families in invertebrates and distinguishes phyla with analogous viromes. This study sets the road towards a deeper understanding of the virome across the Animal Tree of Life.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the bioinformatics pipeline results.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Logarithmic scale plot for the distribution of the total number of reads remaining after pre-processing for each sample.
