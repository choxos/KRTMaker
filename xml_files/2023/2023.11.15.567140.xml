Here we dissect it by perturbing colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combining longitudinal tracking, single cell ‘omics, evolutionary modelling, and machine leaning, we found that different targeted drugs select for distinct subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration, from which multiple transcriptional programmes could run, supporting a one-to-many (epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and plasticity manifest together. This may ensure drug resistance subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their selective advantage. Chemotherapies resistance was instead entirely driven by plasticity. Inducing further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution but not convergent transcriptional programmes. Collectively, our data show how genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to “permissive epigenome” enabling phenotypic plasticity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cancers develop following the Darwinian rules of clonal evolution, where selected subclones bearing new heritable alterations come to dominate the cellular compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The same paradigm is extended to explain the emergence of treatment resistance, arguably the biggest problem in oncology today<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, only a subset of resistance mechanisms have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Even when genetic mutations are known to cause resistance, often these are only detected in a minor proportion of cells within tumours that are refractory to treatment. In many patients, treatment failure remains entirely unexplained by genetic alterations alone. Accumulating evidence suggests that additional Darwinian mechanisms involving non-genetic alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, as well as non-Darwinian cellular plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> also contribute to tumourigenesis. Importantly, these mechanisms can co-exist in the same tumour at the same time and, hence therapy resistance is likely multi-factorial.</p><p id="P3">Relatively little attention has been paid to identifying epigenetic changes that drive cancer evolution, and “epigenetic driver” identification has been hindered by the lack of proper controls to compare cancer and normal epigenomes from the same tissue of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Further, because cancer cell plasticity is inherently a dynamic property, it is challenging to study in clinical samples typically collected at a single timepoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Elegant experiments based on the Luria-Delbruck approaches have demonstrated in cell lines that indeed one can distinguish plasticity from Darwinian adaptive changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Such mechanisms have also been identified in patient-derived xenograft models under the pressure of anti-EGFR drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Fundamental open questions remain, such as “to what extent are epigenetic changes heritable upon cell division?”, “is plasticity a new cancer programme or a reactivated cellular state?”, “is plasticity reversible?”, “is the propensity to cell plasticity in itself a heritable trait?”. Since therapy resistance is multi-factorial, another important question is: “are different subclones in the same tumour adapting differently to drugs?”. Answering these complex questions requires concomitant measurements of genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes, matched with cell lineage histories to deconvolute Darwinian from non-Darwinian mechanisms. Because drug resistance is multi-factorial in the same tumour, single cell resolution is also required.</p><p id="P5">In this study we designed an evolutionary experiment using patient-derived tumour organoids under the pressure of different sequences of drugs. We used expressed lentiviral barcodes combined with single cell multi-omics to track the evolution of single cell genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes over time. We studied adaptation in persistor cells under the pressure of drugs, and in the same cell lineages when drug pressure is released to understand how the therapeutic environment dynamically perturbs cells. We leveraged archetype analysis to chart the mapping between data modalities in individually tracked subclones.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental Design</title><p id="P6">Microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal tumours are characterised by large numbers of chromosomal rearrangements, whereas microsatellite unstable (MSI) malignancies have largely diploid genomes but very high number of point mutations due to deficiency in the mismatch repair machinery. These are the two main genomic subtypes in colorectal cancer. In this study we utilise two patient-derived organoid lines. Firstly, an MSS, AKT-mutant and AKT amplified organoid that was derived from a metastatic colorectal cancer sample (patient F-016 in ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>). Secondly, an MSI mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) organoid that was derived from a primary colorectal cancer (CRC0282 from ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>). We infected each organoid with a library of 5 million random Cellecta® expressed barcodes, a form of lentiviral barcoding system that generates poly-A transcripts that can be captured by single cell RNA sequencing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Material and Methods</xref>). We ensured to have one barcode per cell through dilution of 0.1 MOI. Single infected cell lineages are subject to high genetic drift due to cell turnover and death, giving rise to an expected final distribution of barcode sizes that scales as a power-law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This power-law was used as the “null” distribution for comparison against our subsequent evolutionary experiments. We expanded each barcoded population to 75 million cells and 2.5 million cells/well were plated in multiple 6-well plates. At baseline, the “parental sample” of the first organoid line (AKT-mutant) had 3,000-5,000 individual cell lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), whereas the second organoid (MMRd) had lower barcode diversity (400 barcodes).</p><p id="P7">We exposed the MSS AKT mutant organoid line to a set of targeted drugs for 45 days at a high dose of 2μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used allosteric AKT inhibitor (MK-2206), a competitive AKT inhibitor (capivasertib), an mTOR inhibitor (KU-0063794) and a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We use those in sequence, making cells become resistant to drug A, followed by pressure by drug B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Dose-response curves confirmed the cells became resistance to those drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). We started with 6 replicas per condition, after 45 days collected cells under the pressure of the drug from 3 wells, and performed bulk DNA barcode analysis and single-cell RNA-seq. We left the other three wells regrowing in the absence of the drug until confluence and harvested the population again for barcode analysis, bulk DNA profiling and single-cell RNAseq. We replated cells into a new 6-well plate for a second drug and repeated the profiling as before. Every two days during the whole course of the experiment we collected “floating barcodes” by magnetic bead capture of cell-free DNA released in the media by apoptotic cells: this can be thought as a “liquid biopsy” of the cell culture. At the end of the experiment, we had five cellular timepoints directly derived from the system (i.e. a “solid” biopsy, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) as well as 58-61 timepoints taken from floating barcodes. Floating barcode samples allowed characterising the system evolution without perturbing it with physical sampling.</p><p id="P8">In a subsequent experiment, both the MSS and MSI organoids were exposed to a single line of ERK inhibitors (SCH772984) and chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) at IC90 concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This enabled the study of chemotherapeutic vs targeted drug. Furthermore, to probe the contribution of chromosomal changes to drug resistance, we induced chromosomal instability (CIN) in both organoid models by perturbing chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> using a CENP-E inhibitor alone or in combination with an MPS1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Resistance evolution to targeted drugs but not chemotherapy is heritable, pre-existing and highly repeatable</title><p id="P9">We first focused on the MSS (AKT mutant) organoid. In all cases we found that drugs selected for one or a few subclones that massively expanded during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The three biological replicas we seeded per drug showed almost identical composition of selected barcodes, indicating that those subclones were pre-existing in the population and were selected by natural selection.</p><p id="P10">We examined the floating barcodes to reveal longitudinal clonal dynamics. Dynamics were extremely similar between replicas, indicating that drug-resistance evolution was highly repeatable under the strong selective pressures of cancer drugs, and depended strongly on the initial conditions of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These data implied that the drug resistant phenotype was heritable, as the cellular memory encoding the drug resistant features was passed on to the offspring (i.e. drug resistance was clonally inherited).</p><p id="P11">Subsequent “second line” treatment with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) selected the same subclone as first line, which was cross-resistant to the other drugs when selected at first line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We measured the growth rates over time of different clonal subpopulations (barcodes), showing that most surviving clones were not growing under the drug pressure, but were instead drug tolerant (i.e. barcode frequencies did not increase with time). When the drug pressure was released, the same subclones massively expanded with a high selective coefficient of up to <italic>s=0.5</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, in the MSI organoid, treatment with the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 revealed selection for pre-existing resistant subclones in a recurrent fashion between replicas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Contrastingly, chemotherapy with oxaliplatin did not select any pre-existing subclone in either of the two organoids, with the population structure of the cancer that remained unchanged, suggesting that instead plasticity could be responsible for resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Different targeted drugs select for different pre-existing clones</title><p id="P12">We then investigated which subclones (identified by specific barcodes) were selected by different drugs. The two different AKT inhibitors, despite targeting the same signalling mechanism, selected for distinct subclones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the mTOR inhibitor selected similar subclones as the allosteric AKT inhibitor. The MEK inhibitor trametinib selected for an entirely different subclone that became dominant after drug exposure. The selective advantage of the trametinib-resistant subclone was very strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and C</xref>; blue clone). The same subclone also proved to be a persistor in other drug contexts. For example, during first line treatment of AKT and mTOR inhibition, the trametinib-resistant subclone did not have a selective advantage but remained at low-frequency in the population until the second line of MEK inhibitor was later introduced which, subsequently, took over very rapidly.</p><p id="P13">These data indicate that evolutionary adaptation to targeted drugs was highly repeatable, driven by strong selective pressure on pre-existing subclones and led to the evolutionary divergence of subclones under distinct drugs. Therefore, evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the system (presence/absence of subclones), making it highly predictable, with the opportunity of exploiting evolutionary trade-offs for subclones in different drug contexts with specific sequences of drugs. These are the necessary conditions to exploit evolutionary <italic>steering</italic> strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">We performed bulk whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of all MSS organoid samples at re-growth and compared to parental to identify candidate genetic alterations causing resistance. We found a small set of somatic mutations and copy number alterations that were different in resistant samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 and 7</xref>). However, none of these variants were convincingly linked to a candidate mechanism of drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Archetype analysis reveals transcriptional programmes</title><p id="P15">In MSS organoids, we had, at first, performed single cell RNA-seq and single cell barcode extraction from a total of 19 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>) and we were able to recover the barcode of 46% of cells on average per sample [30-64%]. Transcriptomes of cells under treatment clustered separately from parental, reflecting the strong influence of the environment on the transcriptomic profile of a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cells under different drugs also clustered separately, suggesting each drug influences the transcriptome differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Single cell barcodes recapitulated barcode distributions from bulk profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, most cells in S phase belonged to samples from re-growth after drug pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We used markers of known cell types in the intestine to classify the transcriptional programmes active in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The parental sample was characterised by a small but significant component of LGR5+ stem-like cells and a large component of transient amplifying cells (TA). Under the pressure of first line AKT (capivasertib and MK-2206) and mTOR inhibitors (KU-0063794), which act on the PI3K/AKT pathway, the population maintained a stem cell component but expanded significantly a population with a Paneth signature, similar to what previously reported for patient-derived xenografts under the pressure of EGFR inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Inhibiting the MAPK pathway with the MEK inhibitor (trametinib), even after PI3K/AKT suppression, induced instead different transcriptional dynamics where the LGR5+ stem-like component and partly a Goblet-like component emerged. Instead, blocking AKT after having previously inhibited MEK gave rise to yet another transcriptional programme with low LGR5+ stem component but high ASCL2+ stem-like cells. At regrowth, stem-like programmes were evident and a tendency of microfold cells. Instead for second line drugs a wider range of stem-like programmes emerge, again together with Paneth cell programmes.</p><p id="P16">Given the heterogeneity of transcriptional programmes we found, we hypothesised that a high level of phenotypic plasticity, possibly a reflection of aberrant differentiation pathways, was present in our cell populations. To deconvolve this signal we developed a new approach based on Archetypal Analysis, a dimensionality reduction technique that decomposes an input matrix of gene expression values as a convex combination of ideal extreme gene expression phenotypes called archetypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In this study we implemented a new Deep Archetypal Analysis framework called MIDAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to account for non-linearity in the dimensionality reduction step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). We found that distinct archetypes were enriched for clearly different cell type markers, highlighting the fact that they represent highly distinct cellular programmes, spanning all eight of the cell types we considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Archetype presence clustered distinctively between cells as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). These results indicate that archetypes are robust, cluster populations of cells in a meaningful way that is biologically interpretable. We performed the same analysis in the second line of experiments, obtaining similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). We used archetypes in the rest of the study as a surrogate of cell phenotype or transcriptional programme and studied their relationship to clonal evolution (with barcodes), copy number alterations and chromatin profiles.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The drug environment produces plastic shifts in transcription that are reversible</title><p id="P17">We examined the composition of clonal barcodes within cells displaying each gene expression archetype. Subclones did not split by archetype, instead cells from the same barcoded clone gave rise to different archetypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>) suggesting “differentiation” to an archetype occurred in each cell lineage. Drug exposure (i.e. the environment) shifted the archetype distribution within a subclone, while those distributions were restored to the pretreatment distribution following drug suspension and re-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). Hence, the selected subclones were transcriptionally plastic as in pre-treatment the archetype distribution within a barcode was similar to the background parental population, then changed under the drug, but finally returned to the original distribution of states after drug pressure was released. We observed a similar pattern in the second experiment where we exposed the two organoid lines to ERKi and chemotherapy, although this was expected under chemotherapy due to lack of selection for specific barcodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9E and 9F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The epigenome but not the transcriptome of selected subclones reveals their identity</title><p id="P18">We had observed that cells showed phenotype plasticity upon drug exposure, but drug resistance was nonetheless associated with clonal selection. We hypothesised that the epigenome could reconcile these apparently contradictory biological observations. We performed single cell multiome ATAC + Gene Expression on four samples: parental, trametinib, capivasertib and capivasertib→trametinib, as those were samples with the strongest bottlenecks. UMAP embeddings, in particular for the scATAC component, clearly separated the cells by treatment with a much stronger signal than the previous scRNA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We inferred archetypes from the ATAC signal and called 3 archetypes that distributed differently in distinct samples. We then used the scATAC signal to infer copy number alterations with CONGAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, identified 10 copy number alteration (CNA) subclones and reconstructed their phylogenetic history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We used the lentiviral barcode recovery from the RNA component of the assay to assign barcodes to cells. The efficiency of barcode recovery here was lower (mean per sample = 27% [2-44%]) and we could only recover a strong signal for the ‘blue’ barcode selected under trametinib and capivasertib. The proportion of epigenetic archetypes, unlike for scRNA, was different in the parental between the pre-existing selected barcode and the rest of the population, suggesting that the memory that induced the selection is encoded in the epigenome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Immune predation has also been shown to remove chromosomal aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The data suggested that negative selection was stabilising the karyotypes, and hence that cancers were sitting on a fitness peak, where all additional chromosomal variation was largely neutral, constrained around a fitness maximum. We had two questions: can we push cancers away from that maximum by inducing additional chromosomal instability? Would changing the initial chromosomal configuration in this way alter future evolution of drug resistance? We induced chromosomal instability with CENP-E and MPS1 inhibitors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Material and Methods</xref>) in both organoid lines. The MSS AKT mutant organoid was MMRp and chromosomally highly altered to start with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), and exposure to the agents above proved relatively toxic (IC50=15nM for the MSS and 100nM for MSI organoid lines). In the MSS AKT mutant line this caused chromosomal rearrangements that nevertheless disappeared with time, and the cellular population returned to the chromosomal configuration of the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found no alterations to the evolution of the tumour following exposure to drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The MMRd organoid instead was chromosomally stable, mostly diploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

However, the clone does not manifest as a single transcriptional phenotype, but rather as a set of transcriptional programmes that could be represented within a Waddington landscape, similarly to those that regulate development <bold>(C)</bold>. As Darwinian selection occurs at the level of phenotypes, it is likely that the selective pressure is at the bottom of the Waddington landscape, possibly for only a subset of the transcriptional programmes of a clone, despite the molecular memory carrying these programmes also containing as a side effect other plastic phenotype. This may explain the persistent phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of cancer clones, despite the strong selective pressure of treatments that instead should select for a single fittest phenotype.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191304-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
