Intriguingly, single gliding cells of the predatory deltaproteobacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> form bacterial focal-adhesion (bFA) sites; therein, helically-trafficked motors become immobilized at anchored locations through Glt apparatus association with cell-surface integrin αI-domain-like adhesin CglB. Using traction-force, bead-force, and total internal reflection-fluorescence microscopies combined with biochemical approaches, we herein identify the von Willebrand A domain-containing cell-surface lipoprotein CglD to be a β-integrin-like outer-membrane lipoprotein that functionally associates with and anchors the trans-envelope Glt-CglB gliding apparatus, stabilizing and efficiently anchoring this assembly at bFAs. Calcium dependence governs CglD importance, consistent with its integrated ECM eukaryotic cartilage oligomeric matrix protein domains. CglD thus confers mechanosensory and mechanotransductory capabilities to the gliding apparatus, helping explain bFA-mediated trans-envelope force transduction, from inner-membrane-embedded motors to the cell surface.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cellular motility on surfaces necessitates complex interactions between the cell and the underlying substratum across all biological kingdoms. In metazoans, translocating cells adhere to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via nucleation of integrin proteins linked to the internal actomyosin network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Integrins are composed of an a and a β subunit, with half of all a variants, and all β variants, elaborating I-domains containing a von Willebrand A (VWA) module that binds specific ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>; in turn, integrin adhesion to the ECM is mediated by their interaction with soluble ECM proteins such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Such adherence generates eukaryotic focal-adhesion (eFA) sites; these sites do not move (relative to the substratum) and transduce motor forces via induction of local traction, thus mediating cell motility relative to fixed points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In bacteria such as Gram-negative <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, individual cells are able to glide on surfaces (without external appendages such as flagella or pili) using motorized (Agl) substratum-coupled gliding transducer (Glt) complexes that are transported towards the lagging cell pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>; similar to the abovementioned metazoan cells, these complexes in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> remain stationary relative to the substratum in a gliding cell and form bacterial focal adhesion (bFA) sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> is a social predatory soil deltaproteobacterium with a complex developmental cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, vegetative cells in a swarm biofilm aggregate, differentiate, and form multicellular spore-filled fruiting bodies. This complex life cycle is modulated by the interplay between several secreted polysaccharides and the motility of cells at the group and individual levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Type IV pilus extension-and-retraction is responsible for the former, while as described, the latter is mediated by Agl–Glt-dependent gliding.</p><p id="P4">In gliding <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, the motorized trans-envelope Agl–Glt complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> is assembled at the leading pole, and is transported towards the lagging pole along a trajectory matching a right-handed helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Upon reaching the ventral side of the cell in contact with the substratum, the motorized Agl–Glt apparatus becomes coupled to the substratum via unmasking of the αl VWA domain-containing adhesin CglB, which otherwise remains loaded in the outer-membrane (OM) module of the gliding complex until engaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The OM module of the gliding apparatus is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of the integral OM β-barrels GltA/B/H and periplasmically-oriented OM lipoprotein GltK, which along with OM-associated protein GltC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> form a complex that recruits and shields the surface-localized adhesin CglB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Engagement of CglB results in Agl–Glt complex immobilization at bFA sites, allowing for force transduction across the cell envelope and gliding locomotion relative to the fixed bFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Several factors were identified &gt;45 years ago as important for gliding when random mutagenesis screens revealed 5 classes of “conditional gliding” (<italic>cgl</italic>) mutations (<italic>cglB/C/D/E/F</italic>) that, in isolation, rendered cells gliding-null; however, mixing one class of these gliding-null mutant cells with another (e.g. <italic>cglB</italic> + <italic>cglC</italic>) resulted in a transient restoration (“stimulation”) of gliding motility across the entire population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These data suggested the missing factors between mutant classes could be physically transferred between cells and integrated into the defective gliding mechanism to transiently restore single-cell locomotion. The <italic>cglB/C/E/F</italic> factors were later identified as specific genes encoding OM(-associated) proteins of the gliding apparatus (CglB/GltK/GltH/GltF, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, the role of CglD in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> physiology has remained contentious, with conflicting reports as to its requirement and function; though the initial randomly-generated mutant was reported to be gliding-null<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, a subsequent clean gene-deletion mutant still resulted in gliding-capable cells, while a <italic>cglD</italic> missense mutation had a stronger gliding defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

This bacterial protein with structural homologies to eukaryotic ECM-binding components at eFAs is shown to analogously confer traction to the substratum in gliding bacterial cells, impacting bFA formation, stability, and positioning. In turn, this drastically influences both single-cell and community-level events that are essential to multicellular outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CglD is a ft-integrin-like lipoprotein</title><p id="P7">To elucidate the contribution of CglD to the complex physiology of <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, we first set out identify structural motifs that could help explain its function. Fold-recognition analysis of CglD (1130 aa; predicted MW: 117 kDa) using HHpred revealed distinct high-confidence structural matches of the N- vs. C-terminal halves of the protein. CglD residues 40 – 430 were matched to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain of human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP, i.e. thrombospondin type-5; PDB 3FBY_B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). COMP is a secreted glycoprotein that is engaged by integrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and impacts cellular attachment to, and structuration of, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The identified dodeca-repeating motif DxDxDG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) would be consistent with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence for the protein. Calculation of the 3D structure of CglD via AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A-C</xref>) revealed this putative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain to form a predicted (largely unstructured) globular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with its COMP structural homologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Conversely, CglD amino acids 644 – 1111 were identified as a match to the β1 domain of human integrin β3 (i.e. CD61; PDB 3FCS_B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>); βI modules are ubiquitous in β integrins and include a VWA domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif implicated in adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. MIDAS motifs are a discontinuous structural element (Asp-x-Ser-x-Ser…Thr…Asp) that coordinate a divalent cation (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>), structurally modifying VWA domains upon binding of their ligand(s) to generate a high-affinity conformation toward the ligand(s). Based on the predicted structure for CglD, D656, S658, S660, T693/761, and D799 constitute the putative MIDAS amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>); while the former three residues were previously predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the remaining residues were identified based on their spatial proximity and orientation towards the canonical DxSxS tract. A mutant strain of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> encoding a chromosomal D656N variant of CglD was found to be compromised for gliding motility dependent swarm-edge flare formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, consistent with the MIDAS motif being functionally important for CglD.</p><p id="P9">Intriguingly, CglD was found to be a Cys-rich protein (46 of 1130 amino acids = 4.1%), with 18 predicted intra-protein disulphide bonds stabilizing various structural loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1D</xref>). Titration of whole-cell lysates with reducing agent followed by α-CglD Western immunoblot analysis revealed CglD-specific bands shifting from faster to slower-migrating protein species, consistent with disulphide-dependent conformational stability of CglD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Eleven of these disulphide bonds were located in repeating predicted anti-parallel domains resembling epidermal growth factor (EGF) in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). Conversely, this unfolding of CglD was not impacted by the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to which the protein was exposed during cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref>), suggesting that any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding capacity of the β-integrin-like protein may not serve to stabilize its own structure.</p><p id="P10">Given its’ (i) overall domain arrangement, (ii) structural homologies to known human counterparts, and (iii) denaturation profiles, we conclude that CglD is a β-integrin-like protein with an integrated COMP module.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CglD is exposed at the cell surface</title><p id="P11">Lipoproteins in the OM were historically thought to localize to its periplasmic leaflet; however, cell-surface exposure of various lipoproteins is becoming more widely acknowledged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, including with our recent determination of surface localization for the principal gliding adhesin lipoprotein CglB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Given the calculated integrin-like structure of CglD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), we hypothesized that it too is exposed at the cell surface. We initially attempted immunolabelling of CglD (with α-CglD pAb) on live cells, but various fluorescent clusters were detected on both WT and ΔcglD cells. To overcome this ambiguity, we adopted an analogous approach to that used to test CglB surface exposure in the presence/absence of OM-module Glt proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. I.e. intact WT cells were digested with Proteinase K over the course of 60 min; aliquots removed at regular intervals revealed a steady decline in full-length CglD signal (with no visible accumulation of pAb-reactive degradation products) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These data are consistent with β-integrin-like CglD being a surface-exposed lipoprotein.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>CglD modulates</italic> M. xanthus <italic>community structuration/behaviour</italic></title><p id="P12">As integrins in humans serve to interact with cells/substrata and structure the ECM, we set out to probe comparable community-level outputs in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>. Swarms of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> spreading on “soft” (0.5% w/v) agar plates form stratified biofilms of cells surrounded by ECM polysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the absence of β-integrin-like CglD, swarm expansion was consistently found to be negatively impacted; this community-level effect was not due to a potential defect in gliding motility at the single-cell level as swarm expansion in a gliding-deficient <italic>ΔcglB</italic> strain (compromised for surface-coupling of the gliding machinery) was instead found to be augmented relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>), consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Similarly, developmental progression on minimal media requiring cell–cell aggregation was more drastically affected in the absence of CglD compared to the absence of CglB, further supporting a role for CglD in forming inter-cell connections in dense populations.</p><p id="P13">Swarm cohesiveness was also impacted by CglD, with larger clumps of fluorescent cells in WT swarms being sloughed off in response to increasing shear force applied by a rheometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>); however, as the same swarm cohesiveness phenotype was shown to depend on the principal gliding adhesin CglB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), this would suggest a role for CglD in gliding motility, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, with gliding motility potentially rendering swarms more dynamic and hence less stable. Similarly, community-level responses to mechanical substratum changes were affected in the absence of CglD, as assayed via polymertropism response (i.e. changes in swarm aspect ratio) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Polymertropism is a gliding- and glycocalyx-dependent phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> in which swarms preferentially spread in an east–west direction, in response to aligned substratum polymers caused by north–south compression of the underlying agar matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. While the absence of CglB resulted in a severely-compromised polymertropism response, swarms lacking CglD displayed an intermediate polymertropism phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), again implicating CglD in gliding motility (albeit in a non-essential capacity).</p><p id="P14">Taken together, the above-described data are consistent with β-integrin-like CglD playing roles in both community-level inter-cell interactions as well as gliding motility outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CglD promotes (but is not required for) gliding motility on deformable substrata</title><p id="P15">As the <italic>cglD</italic> locus was originally identified through its conditional importance for gliding motility, we next set out to reconcile the disparate datasets in which CglD has been postulated to either be required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> for gliding motility. We first compared gliding-dependent swarm-edge flare formation for WT and <italic>ΔcglD</italic> cells across diverse matrices, each characterized by a distinct elastic modulus (i.e. resistance to deformation). For agar (1.5% w/v), carrageenan (1.5% w/v), and gellan (0.6% w/v) matrices, gliding flares were clearly detected for both strains already after 7 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Incidentally, flares on gellan were considerably more prominent/noticeable compared to those on either carrageenan or (canonical) agar substrata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that gellan-based matrices may be a superior alternative for the examination of myxobacterial gliding-flare formation. For both strains, individual and groups of cells were found to follow previously-carved troughs in the deformable matrices, further supporting the notion of sematectonic stigmergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> — i.e. behavioural coordination within a population without direct interactions between individuals, accomplished via physical modifications of the local environment — being responsible for the eponymous “trail following” phenotype of myxobacteria atop agar matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). At the level of individual cells, those lacking CglD were found to glide on the various substrata at slower speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) with less-frequent reversals of gliding direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The only instance in which we found <italic>ΔcglD</italic> cells unable to manifest gliding-dependent flares compared to flare-forming WT cells was related to the drying conditions used for the agar matrix. Namely, freshly-poured “hard” (1.5% w/v) agar plates left to cool uncovered in the biohood for increasing 10-min intervals prior to covered drying on benchtop (2 h) and spotting of cells, sealing of the plate, and incubation for 24 h. These parameters were able to support gliding-flare formation in WT cells, but not in <italic>ΔcglD</italic> cells.

These data could indicate that in a non-surface-engaged state, CglD may already associate with members of the Glt OM module. Functional analogies exist for eukaryotic integrin proteins: when not engaged/activated, integrins are believed to adopt a “resting state” conformation that does not fully associate with their ligands. However, upon binding of the target ligand, integrins undergo a conformational change to an “activated state” in which the VWA domain interacts with the ligand, changing the conformation of the ectodomains into an unbent form. In turn, this transmits a signal across the cytoplasmic membrane to the tail domain of each integrin subunit, leading to activation of multiple cytoplasmic proteins and eFA formation.
