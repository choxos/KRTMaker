To look directly at AP-1 function, we generated stably transduced HeLa cells co-expressing tagged AP-1 and various tagged membrane proteins. Live cell imaging showed that AP-1 is recruited onto tubular carriers trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, as well as onto transferrin-containing early/recycling endosomes. Analysis of single AP-1 vesicles showed that they are a heterogeneous population, which start to sequester cargo by 30 minutes after exit from the ER. Vesicle capture showed that AP-1 vesicles contain transmembrane proteins found at the TGN and early/recycling endosomes, as well as lysosomal hydrolases, but very little of the anterograde adaptor GGA2. Together, our results support a model in which AP-1 retrieves proteins from post-Golgi compartments back to the TGN, analogous to COPI’s role in the early secretory pathway. We propose that this is the function of AP-1 in all eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Adaptor protein (AP) complexes are an ancient family of heterotetramers, which select cargo for packaging into transport vesicles at various locations in the cell. The first AP complexes to be discovered, AP-1 and AP-2, were identified as major components of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), with AP-1 acting at intracellular membranes and AP-2 at the plasma membrane. The three additional AP complexes were found by searching for homologues of AP-1 and AP-2. Out of the five complexes, AP-1 is arguably the most indispensable. It is the only one that is present in every eukaryote whose genome has been sequenced, and knocking it out in animals is invariably embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Robinson, 2015</xref>). In addition, AP-1 has several medical connections, including genetic disorders caused by mutations in some of the AP-1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dell’Angelica and Bonifacino, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sanger et al., 2019</xref>), and hijacking of the complex by pathogens, most notably HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lubben et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Roeth et al., 2004</xref>). But in spite of AP-1’s importance, its function is not well understood.</p><p id="P3">Initially AP-1 was assumed to be involved in the receptor-mediated trafficking of newly synthesised lysosomal hydrolases, packaging them into CCVs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). By using the clathrin/AP-1 pathway, the hydrolases would be diverted away from the secretory pathway and targeted to lysosomes via endosomes. However, the evidence for this has always been somewhat circumstantial. Early cytochemical studies on rat neurons by Novikoff and co-workers showed that lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) could be detected in clathrin-coated budding profiles near the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Holtzman et al., 1967</xref>). However, we now know that LAP is a transmembrane protein rather than a soluble hydrolase, and that it is transported to lysosomes mainly via the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Braun et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, the LAP in the clathrin-coated profiles could have come from endosomes rather than the Golgi apparatus.</p><p id="P4">Subsequent studies showed that in vertebrates, most soluble hydrolases are trafficked by the cation-dependent and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptors, CDMPR and CIMPR. These receptors bind to newly synthesized hydrolases as they leave the Golgi and deliver them to endosomes, after which the empty receptors return to the TGN for another round. The two receptors can also traffic to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dahms et al., 1989</xref>). Both CDMPR and CIMPR have been detected in preparations of isolated CCVs, and both are able to bind to AP-1 and AP-2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Robinson, 2015</xref>). In addition, knockdowns and knockouts of AP-1 cause increased secretion of the hydrolase cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hirst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P5">All of these studies are consistent with a role for AP-1 in the anterograde trafficking of M6P receptors and hydrolases, but they are equally consistent with a role for AP-1 in the retrieval of M6P receptors. Indeed, when AP-1 is depleted, the receptors are largely lost from the Golgi region and relocated to peripheral endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Meyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). This finding supports a role for AP-1 in the recycling of receptors back to the TGN, rather than in anterograde trafficking. The situation is further complicated by the presence of other types of machinery, such as GGAs, proteins found in opsithokonts (e.g., animals and fungi) that act together with clathrin to facilitate the forward trafficking of receptor-bound hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boman, 2001</xref>). In yeast, knocking out AP-1 affects the retrieval of late Golgi resident proteins from endosomes, with no apparent effects on outward traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>), while knocking out GGAs impairs transport of hydrolases from the late Golgi to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Costaguta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dell’Angelica et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hirst et al., 2000</xref>). However, the relationship between AP-1 and GGAs in yeast is not entirely clear. Although they show little colocalisation with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>), the combined knockout has a more severe phenotype than either knockout alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Costaguta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hirst et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Knocking out or knocking down AP-1 in animal cells has a surprisingly subtle phenotype. Although hydrolase receptors and other late Golgi proteins are relocated to peripheral endosomes, they are still present in normal amounts in isolated CCV-enriched fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Navarro Negredo et al., 2017</xref>). Because of the possibility that cells might be able to compensate for the gradual loss of AP-1, we developed the knocksideways system, which rapidly depletes the available pool of a protein of interest by rerouting it to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). AP-1 knocksideways produced a robust phenotype, with nearly 100 proteins lost 2-fold or more from CCV-enriched fractions, including hydrolase receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>). We also carried out a GGA knocksideways, and found that hydrolases and their receptors were lost over 2-fold from CCV-enriched fractions, while most other proteins were unaffected. Because GGAs and hydrolases were among the proteins that were lost from the CCV fraction in the AP-1 knocksideways, we proposed that AP-1 is bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>), acting at the TGN together with GGAs to facilitate forward trafficking of hydrolase-receptor complexes, and also acting at endosomes to retrieve empty receptors and other proteins back to the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, Model 1).</p><p id="P7">Further support for a role for AP-1 in retrograde trafficking came from studies by Buser and Spiess, using an elegant system they developed in which cells expressing GFP-tagged membrane proteins are incubated with derivatized anti-GFP nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buser et al., 2018</xref>). Attaching tyrosine sulfation sequences to the nanobodies enabled trafficking from the plasma membrane to the TGN to be monitored, because tyrosine sulfation occurs in the late Golgi. Nanobody sulfation in cells expressing GFP-tagged CDMPR or CIMPR was partially inhibited by AP-1 knocksideways, indicating a function in retrieval back to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buser et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, however, knocking down AP-1 caused a ~2.5-fold increase in nanobody sulfation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buser et al., 2022</xref>). The authors interpreted these findings as further evidence for a role for AP-1 in bidirectional trafficking, and proposed that the increased nanobody sulfation in AP-1 knockdown cells was caused by increased residence time in the TGN, even though the endocytosed nanobody was found to accumulate in peripheral endosomes rather than in the Golgi region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buser et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Studies in yeast and plant cells have provided further insights into AP-1 function, but also some confusing and/or contradictory findings. Arabadopsis has two genes encoding the AP-1 medium subunit, and knocking out the more strongly expressed gene caused defects in both the secretory and the vacuolar pathway, leading to the suggestion that AP-1 is required for trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Park et al., 2013</xref>). However, subsequent studies showed that other proteins that are normally intracellular become mislocalised to the cell surface in AP-1-deficient Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> studies dating back over 20 years show that AP-1 mutants mislocalise several late-Golgi resident proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>), and there is now a general consensus that the function of AP-1 in yeast is in retrieval back to the Golgi.</p><p id="P9">It seems unlikely that such an ancient and conserved piece of cellular machinery would have completely different functions in different eukaryotes, and we wondered whether some of the mutant phenotypes might be explained by indirect effects, even when they occurred very rapidly. For instance, our own observation that both hydrolases and GGAs are lost from HeLa cell CCV-enriched fractions in AP-1 knocksideways cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>) does not necessarily reflect a role for AP-1 in anterograde traffic. It could be that AP-1 is entirely retrograde, but that it is needed to retrieve one or more molecules required by the GGAs to facilitate forward transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, Model 2). Thus, we wanted to look more directly at AP-1 function. To this end, we have generated cells expressing tagged versions of both AP-1 and putative AP-1 cargo proteins. We have then used complementary approaches to investigate if, when, and where the cargo is getting packaged into AP-1 vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Coexpression of tagged AP-1 and membrane proteins</title><p id="P10">We began by generating a cell line in which the AP-1 γ-adaptin gene, <italic>AP1G1,</italic> was tagged by inserting mRuby2 into its flexible hinge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Initially we used gene editing; however, the mRuby2-positive clones all expressed considerably less γ-adaptin than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>). This is most likely because HeLa cells are severely aneuploid, with multiple copies of most genes, and only some of the <italic>AP1G1</italic> alleles had been tagged, while others had been disrupted by indels. Therefore, mRuby2-tagged γ-adaptin was introduced into the cells by retroviral transduction, and the endogenous gene was then deleted using CRISPR/Cas9. Clonal cell lines were confirmed by Western blotting to express only tagged γ-adaptin, at close to endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because the cells became more heterogeneous with time, they were routinely sorted by flow cytometry before experiments were carried out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Additional constructs were then introduced into the cells by retroviral transduction. Cells were first stably transduced with a “hook” construct, consisting of streptavidin with a KDEL sequence for ER retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Various candidate cargo constructs containing streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) were then added, so that their transit through the secretory pathway could be followed using the RUSH (Retention Using Selective Hooks) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of biotin, these constructs remain in the ER, but addition of biotin releases them from the streptavidin-KDEL hook. Most of the SBP-containing proteins also had a GFP tag, allowing their appearance at the plasma membrane and subsequent endocytosis to be monitored with an anti-GFP nanobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our previous work suggested that CDMPR is the most abundant AP-1 cargo protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hirst et al., 2015</xref>), so initially we used cells expressing SBP-GFP-CDMPR to set up the system. The cells were incubated with biotin for various lengths of time over the course of 2 hours, and in each case HaloTag-conjugated nanobody and far-red HaloTag-binding dye were added for 30 minutes prior to harvesting or fixation. The Western blots and fluorescent images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> show that by 15 minutes after biotin addition, most of the construct had reached the Golgi region, although it still had a similar electrophoretic mobility to the ER form. By 30 minutes, when most of the construct was still in the Golgi region, its mobility had partially shifted, indicative of terminal glycosylation. This shift was essentially complete by 40 minutes, and although the construct still localised mainly to the Golgi region, endocytosed nanobody could now be detected. By 90 minutes, the construct had reached steady state, with much of it found in more peripheral endosomes where it colocalised with the nanobody.</p><p id="P12">Several other Type I membrane proteins that had been identified as AP-1 cargo were also investigated, including carboxypeptidase D (CPD), N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGPA, the mannose 6-phosphate uncovering enzyme), and KIAA0319L, all of which localise to the Golgi region at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Eng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rorher and Kornfeld, 2001</xref>), and CIMPR and sortilin, which have a more widespread distribution, similar to CDMPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dahms et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>). NAGPA was particularly well expressed so it was chosen for further studies. In addition, the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 was chosen as an example of a Type I membrane protein that does not appear to be cargo for AP-1, even though it has an AP-binding motif, YQTI, in its cytosolic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Peden et al., 2004</xref>). Like CDMPR, NAGPA and LAMP1 tagged with SBP and GFP reached their steady state localisation within 90 minutes after biotin addition, but with distinct distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Peden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Rohrer and Kornfeld, 2001</xref>), NAGPA was tightly juxtanuclear, presumably localising to the TGN, while LAMP1 was more punctate, with larger spots than either CDMPR or NAGPA, presumably localising to late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cells expressing both constructs had internalised a substantial amount of anti-GFP nanobody by 90 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Comparative localisation of AP-1 and membrane proteins</title><p id="P13">As a first test for AP-1-mediated trafficking of the three constructs, we transiently transfected cells with gadkin, a protein initially identified as a binding partner for the γ-adaptin appendage domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Neubrand et al., 2005</xref>). Gadkin in fact has several partners, including the kinesin KIF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) and the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Maritzen et al., 2012</xref>), and it is S-palmitoylated, which facilitates its association with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Maritzen et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpression of gadkin stabilises the association of AP-1 with membranes, and causes AP-1 and associated proteins to accumulate at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have shown that endogenous CDMPR is affected by gadkin overexpression, while there is little or no effect on endogenous LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that after 90 minutes in biotin, SBP-GFP-CDMPR co-localised with gadkin and AP-1 at peripheral foci (arrowheads), while SBP-GFP-LAMP1 for the most part did not. SBP-GFP-NAGPA also showed strong colocalization with gadkin. Thus, these three constructs were used as model proteins to investigate the function of AP-1. Two of the constructs, SBP-GFP-CDMPR and SBP-GFP-NAGPA, appear to be AP-1-dependent, but they have distinct steady state distributions, while the third construct, SBP-GFP-LAMP1, appears to be AP-1-independent.</p><p id="P14">To determine whether AP-1 is associated with any of these constructs when they exit the Golgi apparatus, we treated cells with biotin for 20-35 minutes and then imaged the cells using Lattice SIM super-resolution microscopy. As has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), CDMPR left the Golgi mainly in vesicular carriers, and we saw no obvious colocalization of these carriers with AP-1. In contrast, NAGPA was found mainly in tubular carriers, typical of proteins that are transported from the TGN to the plasma membrane, such as LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, when SBP-GFP-LAMP1 and SBP-HaloTag-NAGPA were co-expressed, they could be seen to exit the Golgi in the same tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Video 1</xref>) Most unexpectedly, these tubules were frequently decorated with AP-1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). Unlike NAGPA and LAMP1, CDMPR was not concentrated in the tubules, but small amounts could sometimes be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Video 3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">AP-1 puncta were found not only in the Golgi region, but also at the cell periphery. To find out whether these puncta corresponded to endosomes, we loaded cells expressing mRuby2-tagged AP-1 and SBP-GFP-NAGPA with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated transferrin, and then treated the cells with biotin for 20-35 minutes. Live cell imaging showed that many or even most of the peripheral AP-1 puncta were associated with transferrin-containing spots and tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">All of these structures were extremely dynamic. AP-1 has been shown to be removed from vesicles within seconds after scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kural et al., 2012</xref>), so it was not possible to determine whether any of the NAGPA, CDMPR, or transferrin was getting incorporated into AP-1 vesicles, especially because the number of copies of each cargo protein in an individual vesicle would be difficult to discern above background. Therefore, we developed a complementary assay, which would enable us to get a snapshot of these very transient transport intermediates, without interference from the rest of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Single vesicle analysis</title><p id="P17">Our assay, which we call single vesicle analysis (SVA), is based on widefield microscopy of isolated CCVs, and is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. CCV-enriched fractions were prepared from cells co-expressing mRuby2-tagged AP-1 and SBP-GFP-tagged membrane proteins, which had been incubated with biotin for 0, 30, 40, or 120 minutes, and with HaloTag-nanobody for the final 30 minutes. Varying dilutions of the CCV fraction were aliquoted onto slides that had been pre-coated with 100-nm fluorescent beads, to act as a fiducial marker for channel alignment. The beads are of similar size and fluorescence intensity to CCVs, but they fluoresce in four channels instead of three, so they could be eliminated from our final analysis. An example of such an experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>. At least ten images were collected for every time point, and each experiment was repeated three times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). To analyse the dataset, we developed a Python-based pipeline, which first uses the beads to achieve homographic channel alignment. The pipeline then discerns each punctate structure through the application of the Laplacian of Gaussian filter, and quantifies the fluorescence intensity of each fluorophore for individual puncta. The beads are then excluded from subsequent analyses. Thresholds were established by using single-channel controls (i.e., CCV-enriched fractions from cells expressing only one fluorescent protein), facilitating the binarisation of data to determine the presence or absence of each fluorophore. This methodology allowed every vesicle to be categorised based on the presence of AP-1 and/or cargo.</p><p id="P18"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> shows a Western blot (equal protein loading) of homogenates and CCV-enriched fractions from cells expressing SBP-GFP-CDMPR. In the lanes containing CCV fractions, there is strong enrichment of both construct and nanobody after 30 minutes in biotin, which continues to increase up to 2 hours. This is consistent with packaging into AP-1 vesicles, but the Western blot only shows that they are enriched in the CCV-containing pellet, which contains other small structures as well, including non-clathrin-coated vesicles and ribosomes. Thus, the CDMPR and nanobody could be associated with other types of CCVs, or with a completely different type of transport intermediate. Using single vesicle analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S3A</xref>), we were able to identify the percentage of AP-1-positive vesicles that also contained cargo and/or nanobody. By 2 hours, when the CDMPR had reached steady state, about three quarters of the AP-1 vesicles were found to contain CDMPR, and nearly half of these also contained endocytosed nanobody. There were essentially no nanobody-containing spots that were not also positive for CDMPR, as expected because the nanobody gets into the cell by piggybacking onto the tagged CDMPR. These percentages are probably an underestimate, as the expression of both AP-1 and cargo constructs was somewhat heterogeneous (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1B</xref>), so there may have been additional AP-1-positive spots containing tagged CDMPR that were below the limit of detection. In addition, the widefield imaging system used in these experiments appears to be relatively insensitive to far-red; thus, the percentages of CDMPR puncta that contained nanobody may also have been underestimated.</p><p id="P19">NAGPA showed somewhat different behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S3B</xref>). First, whereas CDMPR continued to increase in AP-1 vesicles between 40 minutes and 2 hours, NAGPA plateaued at 40 minutes. Second, after 2 hours in biotin, the majority of the AP-1 vesicles contained detectable CDMPR, while no more than a third of the AP-1 vesicles ever contained detectable NAGPA. Third, there was more endocytosed nanobody associated with the AP-1/NAGPA-positive vesicles than with AP-1/CDMPR-positive vesicles after 30 and 40 minutes in biotin. However, whereas nanobody uptake increased dramatically between 40 minutes and 2 hours in the SBP-GFP-CDMPR-expressing cells, this did not occur in the SBP-GFP-NAGPA-expressing cells. These results, together with our imaging data, suggest that at least some of the CDMPR and NAGPA get packaged into AP-1 vesicles shortly after leaving the Golgi. However, our results also suggest that much of the NAGPA is transported to the plasma membrane via the constitutive secretory pathway, where it is then endocytosed and subsequently packaged into AP-1 vesicles. Our nanobody uptake experiments indicate that CDMPR gets to the plasma membrane more slowly, with very little nanobody accumulated after 40 minutes in biotin. However, by the time the CDMPR has reached steady state, much of it has picked up nanobody, and like AP-1, CDMPR is found at the cell periphery as well as the juxtanuclear region. In contrast, NAGPA has a more restricted distribution, and is likely to be packaged mainly into juxtanuclear AP-1 vesicles.</p><p id="P20">Unlike CDMPR and NAGPA, LAMP1 did not show much enrichment in AP-1 vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>), even though it was present in the same AP-1-studded tubules as NAGPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). After 40 minutes in biotin, SBP-GFP-LAMP1 was enriched in the CCV-containing pellet, but we never found more than ~20% of AP-1 vesicles showing colocalisation with LAMP1. Moreover, some of this colocalisation may be non-specific, because for all of our constructs, we always saw close to 10% colocalisation with AP-1 in the absence of biotin, which we suspect may be background. LAMP1 is known to use both AP-2 and AP-3 for its trafficking, so these and possibly other types of transport intermediates could account for the increased levels of SBP-GFP-LAMP1 in the CCV-enriched fraction (which also contains non-clathrin-coated vesicles) during the biotin time course.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Heterogeneity of AP-1 vesicles</title><p id="P21">Our SVA results show that both CDMPR and NAGPA are packaged into AP-1 vesicles, but are these the same vesicles, or are there different types of vesicles for different types of cargo? To address this question, we generated cells co-expressing SBP-GFP-CDMPR and SBP-HaloTag-NAGPA. Although their steady state distributions were distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), and although they left the Golgi primarily in different carriers, ~80% of the AP-1 vesicles that contained NAGPA also contained CDMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 3D</xref>). The percentage of AP-1 vesicles that were positive for NAGPA was less with HaloTag than with the GFP tag, most likely because of the lower sensitivity of our system to far-red. To test whether the vesicles that contained detectable NAGPA but not CDMPR might be due solely to differences in expression levels, we transduced cells with both SBP-GFP-CDMPR and SBP-HaloTag-CDMPR. In these cells, there was essentially complete overlap between the GFP and HaloTag signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>). However, in isolated vesicles, there were not only AP-1/GFP-positive spots without detectable HaloTag (as expected because of the lower sensitivity to far-red), but also AP-1/HaloTag-positive spots without detectable GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 3E</xref>). These accounted for ~10% of the AP-1/ HaloTag-positive spots, and we assume that this is due to cell heterogeneity. Thus, a very small fraction of the AP-1 vesicles contain NAGPA but not CDMPR, and a larger fraction contain CDMPR but not NAGPA.</p><p id="P22">There are many reports, including the present study, that some AP-1 is associated with tubular endosomes containing internalised transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Futter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Peden et al., 2004</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">7</xref>). To look for possible overlap between internalised transferrin and newly synthesised CDMPR, we fed far-red transferrin for one hour to cells expressing SBP-GFP-CDMPR, while at the same time carrying out a biotin time course. About 30% of the AP-1 vesicles were positive for endocytosed transferrin at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure 3F</xref>). The percentage of these vesicles that also contained CDMPR increased with time from ~20% at 30 minutes to ~70% at 2 hours, indicating that there is more CDMPR in transferrin-containing endosomes when the CDMPR has reached steady state than when it first leaves the Golgi apparatus. Nevertheless, the overlap was always less than the overlap between CDMPR and NAGPA. Together, these data show that AP-1 vesicles are a heterogeneous population, presumably reflecting the widespread distribution of AP-1.</p><p id="P23">Are some of the AP-1 vesicles in our fraction also coated with clathrin? We found that we could fix the vesicles after aliquoting them onto slides, and then look for the presence of other proteins by immunofluorescence. Nearly 100% of the AP-1 vesicles were positive for clathrin, although not vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F and G</xref>), as expected because clathrin is present on other vesicles as well, such as those that bud from the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Comparison of AP-1 and GGA2</title><p id="P24">The results presented so far show that at least a third of the AP-1 vesicles can carry material that has been endocytosed, such as nanobodies and transferrin, supporting a role for AP-1 in trafficking out of endosomes. But AP-1 can also be detected on carriers that have just left the Golgi. Are some of the AP-1 vesicles involved in anterograde transport? The diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> show that two potential markers for the forward pathway are lysosomal hydrolases and GGAs. Unfortunately, when we tried to tag several different hydrolases with GFP, both with and without SBP, we found that all of the constructs were unable to leave the ER.</p><p id="P25">Our studies on GFP-tagged GGA2 were more successful. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Boman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dell’Angelica et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hirst et al., 2000</xref>), both AP-1 and GGA2 were concentrated in the juxtanuclear area, and there were also puncta in more peripheral parts of the cell, which were more numerous for AP-1. However, there was relatively little apparent colocalization between the AP-1 and GGA2 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, by live cell imaging using simultaneous capture, the AP-1 and GGA2 puncta could be seen to be mainly on separate trajectories. Occasionally the two moved in concert, but they could usually be spatially resolved to different domains of a larger moving spot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Video 6</xref>). These observations are inconsistent with Model 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which proposes that AP-1 and GGAs cooperate in the same budding vesicle. They are also inconsistent with an earlier model, which proposed that GGAs and AP-1 act sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Doray et al., 2002</xref>), because we did not see any clear examples of an individual spot changing from GGA2-positive to AP-1-positive.</p><p id="P26">Although GGA2-positive puncta were easily detectable within intact cells, when a CCV-enriched fraction was prepared from such cells, the GFP signal was below the limit of detection. This is most likely because the association of GGAs with membranes is relatively labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hirst et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we developed a complementary approach to analyse the protein composition of AP-1 vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Vesicle isolation by antibody capture</title><p id="P27">Using a new rabbit antiserum against mRuby2, together with protein A-coated magnetic beads, we devised a method for capturing AP-1 vesicles. First, we carried out our usual CCV fractionation protocol, but then before the final centrifugation step, we added beads that had been pre-incubated with either anti-mRuby2 antiserum or preimmune serum from the same rabbit. The beads were then either prepared for electron microscopy or treated with SDS-containing sample buffer to elute bound proteins.</p><p id="P28"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref> shows an electron micrograph of the anti-mRuby2 beads. The beads can be seen to be covered with ~100 nm vesicles (arrowheads), and in most cases, a clathrin coat can be discerned. By SDS PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), there are several high molecular weight bands in the lane containing the anti-mRuby2 beads that are not visible in the lane containing preimmune beads. The bands numbered 1-4 were excised and analysed by mass spectrometry, and they were found to correspond respectively to CIMPR, clathrin heavy chain (CHC17), the AP-1 γ subunit, and the AP-1 β1 subunit. Other proteins expected to be enriched on the anti-mRuby2 beads include the AP-1 μ1 and σ1 subunits and CDMPR, but these proteins migrate with similar motilities to the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (labelled H and L), and so could not be resolved.</p><p id="P29">Western blots of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref> confirmed and extended these observations. Both AP-1 γ and CIMPR were captured very efficiently, with similar band intensities in the bead-captured lane and the CCV-enriched fraction lane, indicating that most of the protein had bound to the beads. Clathrin heavy chain was captured less efficiently, even though the Coomassie blue-stained gel indicates that it is the most abundant protein pulled out by the beads. This is consistent with our immunofluorescence results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>), which show that much of the clathrin in the CCV-enriched fraction is not associated with AP-1. There was much less GGA2 captured by the beads, and in fact, its profile was very similar to that of AP-2, which we did not expect to see at all, because it is associated with the population of CCVs that bud from the plasma membrane rather than intracellular membranes. There appeared to be even less of the ribosomal protein RPS17, which was usually undetectable in the bead samples.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>AP-1 vesicle composition</title><p id="P30">For a more comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the protein content of AP-1 vesicles, we performed mass spectrometry on SILAC-labelled cells. Preparations were carried out in parallel on cells incubated with either heavy or light amino acids, but before the final step, AP-1 vesicles were captured from the heavy preparation with anti-mRuby2 beads, while the light preparation was centrifuged one last time to provide a reference CCV-enriched fraction. The heavy-to-light ratio for each protein is a measure of how efficiently that protein was captured by the beads. For instance, the mean ratio for AP-1 γ was 0.81 (i.e., &gt;80% of the reference), confirming the high efficiency of our AP-1 vesicle capture. The experiment was carried out four times, and the mean heavy-to-light ratio of CLTC (clathrin heavy chain 17) was used as a reference. Our rational was that CLTC is the most abundant protein in both the CCV-enriched input sample and the bead-captured sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>), but not all of the clathrin in the input sample is expected to associate with AP-1; thus, any protein with a heavy-to-light ratio greater than that of clathrin heavy chain is a potential component of AP-1 vesicles. The results are presented as a volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, with the <italic>t</italic>-test difference (showing the enrichment of each protein relative to CLTC) on the x-axis and the statistical significance on the y-axis. The AP-1 complex itself is the top hit, and the three hydrolase receptors also score very highly. Lysosomal hydrolases are also major hits. Other strong hits, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>, include a number of TGN resident proteins, such as carboxypeptidase D, KIAA0319L, and the late Golgi SNAREs syntaxins 6, 10, and 16 (arrowheads), as well as peripheral membrane proteins such as the kinesin KIF13A, the SM protein VPS45, and SPRYD7 (formerly called CLLD6), a protein of unknown function. Most of the top proteins also scored highly in our AP-1 knocksideways dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, ribosomal proteins, which are not expected to be associated with AP-1 vesicles, are all on the left side of the plot. This demonstrates they are de-enriched relative to CLTC, despite being some of the most abundant proteins in the input (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>).

However, our Western blotting results suggest that the behaviour of GGA2 is similar to that of AP-2, which is at the borderline in our proteomics dataset, indicating low levels of capture by the beads. In addition, we saw little colocalisation between GGA2 and AP-1 in intact cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Video 6</xref>). Together, these results indicate that although there may be small amounts of GGA2 associated with AP-1 vesicles, most of the GGA2 is associated with a different population of vesicles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">The AP-1 complex was first described over 35 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Keen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pearse and Robinson, 1984</xref>), but its precise function is still unclear. Genetic studies have provided some insights, but also some contradictory results, most likely because of indirect effects. The present study was an attempt to get around these problems by looking directly at AP-1 vesicles.</p><p id="P33">Using a combination of live cell imaging and single vesicle analysis, we were able to determine the time at which membrane proteins are first incorporated into AP-1 vesicles. The two AP-1 cargo proteins we investigated, CDMPR and NAGPA, were for the most part seen to leave the Golgi separately in different types of carriers. Surprisingly, it was the tubular carriers containing NAGPA, which also contained LAMP1 and thus were presumably on their way to the plasma membrane, that were decorated with AP-1 puncta. We propose that the function of the AP-1 on these tubules is to package selected membrane proteins, such as NAGPA, into CCVs to be returned to the TGN before they stray too far. The steady state localisation of NAGPA to the TGN was reached early on, and it seems likely that this localisation is maintained at least in part by constant retrieval by AP-1. Some of the NAGPA travelled all the way to the plasma membrane and brought in bound nanobody, and these NAGPA-nanobody complexes were also packaged into AP-1 vesicles.</p><p id="P34">In contrast, CDMPR took longer to reach its steady state distribution, and there was also less nanobody uptake at earlier time points, consistent with its exit from the TGN primarily in a different type of carrier, which is presumably going to endosomes rather than the plasma membrane. By 90 minutes, however, the CDMPR had moved out to the cell periphery and picked up nanobody. By 2 hours, the majority of AP-1 vesicles contained detectable CDMPR, with nearly half of these also containing detectable nanobody. At all time points, most of the AP-1 vesicles that contained NAGPA also contained CDMPR, but not vice versa.</p><p id="P35">We think this is because of the more widespread distribution of CDMPR, which with time became increasingly colocalised with endocytosed transferrin. Thus, we propose that the function of AP-1, both on post-Golgi tubules and on early/recycling endosomes, is to sequester proteins into CCVs so that they can be returned to the late Golgi. This hypothesis is consistent with phenotypes that have been reported by ourselves and others, where proteins that localise mainly to the TGN at steady state relocate to peripheral compartments and to the plasma membrane when AP-1 is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Harasaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Meyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P36">But what about our earlier study showing that acute depletion of AP-1 by knocksideways caused a &gt;2-fold decrease in both GGA2 and lysosomal hydrolases from the CCV-enriched fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>)? Initially we proposed two models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): either that AP-1 cooperates with GGAs to facilitate forward transport of hydrolase-receptor complexes in mixed CCVs (Model 1), or that AP-1 is solely retrograde, acting indirectly to retrieve something needed by GGAs for forward transport, and only packaging empty receptors (Model 2). However, our vesicle capture experiments produced a surprising result. Instead of showing either efficient capture of both hydrolases and GGA2, or efficient capture of neither, they showed efficient capture of hydrolases but not GGA2. Our interpretation of this result is that many of the M6P receptors packaged into vesicles by AP-1 still retain their bound hydrolases because of the pH of their environment. Dissociation of hydrolases from the two M6P receptors only occurs if the pH is below 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tong and Kornfeld, 1989</xref>), and the intralumenal pH of early and recycling endosomes has been estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987</xref>). Thus, we propose a third model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>), in which hydrolase-receptor complexes are initially sorted at the TGN by GGAs, but those complexes that fail to be sorted by GGAs are then retrieved by AP-1. The GGA pathway would deliver the hydrolase-receptor complexes to an endosome with a pH below 6.0, and then the empty receptors would be retrieved by retromer and sorting nexins. Meanwhile, AP-1 would continue to retrieve hydrolase-receptor complexes from early/recycling endosomes, and would also retrieve TGN resident proteins that had wandered away.</p><p id="P37">If AP-1 is solely retrograde, how can we explain all the other studies in mammalian cells, which support a role for AP-1 in anterograde trafficking? We think that the findings in these studies are open to different interpretations. For instance, a live cell imaging study carried out 20 years ago showed AP-1 puncta on tubules emanating from the Golgi region, containing a CIMPR chimera, and some of these tubules appeared to fuse with transferrin-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wagurii et al., 2003</xref>). The authors proposed that the AP-1 was facilitating TGN-to-endosome trafficking, but what they showed was fusion of the two compartments, not fusion of AP-1-derived vesicles with endosomes. Thus, their results are equally consistent with AP-1 trafficking in the opposite direction. Indeed, we suspect that they were visualising the same types of tubules that we saw, although we did not see much SBP-GFP-CDMPR in the tubules. We think this is probably because of the way we made our cargo constructs. The lumenal and/or transmembrane domains of M6P receptors have been shown to play a major role in determining whether they exit the Golgi in vesicles or tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and whereas we kept the lumenal domain intact, in the earlier study they replaced the lumenal domain with GFP.</p><p id="P38">Similarly, there are different ways of interpreting the study showing that knocking down AP-1 in cells expressing GFP-tagged CDMPR causes a dramatic increase in nanobody sulfation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buser et al., 2022</xref>). The authors suggested that this is due to an increase in the TGN residence time of nanobody-GFP-CDMPR complexes, but their own images show that depleting AP-1 actually caused the nanobody to accumulate in peripheral endosomes, not the Golgi region. Thus, an alternative explanation is that AP-1 depletion caused the tyrosine sulfation machinery, normally resident in the TGN, to be relocated to endosomes. This machinery includes the transporter SLC35B2, and our knocksideways study suggests that trafficking of SLC35B2 is dysregulated in AP-1 deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P39">What about other organisms, such as plants and yeast? Studies on AP-1-deficient plants showed defects in trafficking to the plasma membrane and the vacuole, leading to the idea that AP-1 is particularly important for the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Park et al., 2013</xref>). However, the AP-1 deficiency phenotype is far from straightforward, because both plasma membrane and vacuolar proteins accumulated in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Teh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting an indirect effect on ER exit. Another observation linking AP-1 to the secretory pathway in plants comes from a recent high resolution live cell imaging study on the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shimizu et al., 2021</xref>). Plant cell biologists have identified two TGN compartments: the Golgi-associated TGN (GA-TGN) and the Golgi-independent TGN (GI-TGN), with the former giving rise to the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Both forms of TGN can receive endocytosed markers, and clathrin-coated buds have been observed on both, but are more abundant on the GI-TGN. The recent imaging study showed that the GI-TGN is covered with AP-1 puncta and contains proteins destined for the plasma membrane, while proteins destined for the vacuole remain in the GA-TGN, where they are thought to be sorted by AP-4. Although the authors interpreted these observations as further evidence for a role for AP-1 in the secretory pathway, once again, there are alternative explanations. We suspect that the GI-TGN in plants is essentially the same compartment as the AP-1-studded tubules that we saw leaving the Golgi in HeLa cells, containing NAGPA and LAMP1. Several observations in plants support the hypothesis that the AP-1 associated with the GI-TGN is involved in retrieval back to the Golgi rather than in forward trafficking to the plasma membrane. First, in AP-1-deficient cells, several membrane proteins were shown to be mislocalised to the plasma membrane, including two late Golgi SNAREs: the Qa SNARE SYP41 and the Qc SNARE SYP61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Second, these same two SNAREs were identified as cargo in a proteomic analysis of plant CCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dahhan et al., 2022</xref>). Third, in the recent live cell imaging study, SYP61 was shown to be packaged into AP-1 vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shimizu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the mammalian orthologues of SYP41 and SYP61, syntaxin 16 (STX16) and syntaxin 6/syntaxin 10 (STX6/STX10) respectively, were identified as AP-1 vesicle cargo both in our earlier knocksideways study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>) and in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>, arrowheads). Moreover, we showed that when AP-1 is depleted, both STX10 and STX16 become mislocalised away from the Golgi region and accumulate at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P40">In yeast, a role for AP-1 in retrograde traffic was first proposed over 20 years ago, when AP-1 was identified as a hit in a screen for genes involved in intracellular retention of chitin synthase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>). The authors went on to show that the Qc SNARE Tlg1, the yeast orthologue of STX6/STX10 in mammals and SYP61 in plants, is also mislocalised in AP-1-deficient cells, and they proposed that AP-1 facilitates trafficking from early endosomes to the TGN. Subsequent studies have shown that AP-1 is required for the Golgi localisation of several other transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Foote and Nothwehr, 2006</xref>), including Tlg2, the yeast orthologue of STX16 in mammals and SYP41 in plants (Areti Fernando and Benjamin Glick, personal communication). Given the evolutionary distance between plants (Archaeplastida) and animals and yeast (both opisthokonts), we propose that the retrieval of these SNAREs is an ancient function of AP-1, most likely present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The role of AP-1 in SNARE localisation may help to explain some of the phenotypes of AP-1 deficiency, because once SNAREs are mislocalised, there are likely to be many knock-on effects.</p><p id="P41">Thus, we would like to propose a unifying hypothesis for AP-1 function: that in all eukaryotes, its role is to transport selected proteins, including the two SNAREs, from post-Golgi compartments back to the late Golgi. The forward pathway in opisthokonts is mediated (at least in part) by GGAs, as shown in Model 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). However, GGAs are a relatively recent innovation, found only in opisthokonts, so Model 3 is not universally applicable. In plants, the TGN-to-endosome pathway is thought to be mediated by AP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fuji et al., 2016</xref>), which (like all the APs) is present in every branch of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dacks and Robinson, 2017</xref>). We suggest that in some opisthokonts, the acquisition of GGAs may have made AP-4 redundant. Interestingly, many opisthokonts, including flies, worms, and most fungi, have lost all four of their AP-4 genes. Even mammals are viable without AP-4, and expression levels of AP-4 are extremely low: in HeLa cells, the AP-4 subunit genes are expressed at ~50-fold lower levels than the AP-1 subunit genes, while in mouse neurons, AP-4 is expressed at ~150-fold lower levels than AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Itzhak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, proteomic studies on plants show ~2-fold lower expression of AP-4 than AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Castellana et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a modified version of Model 3 would put AP-4 in place of GGAs for non-opisthokonts. But in any case, we propose that in all eukaryotes, the function of AP-1 is similar to the function of COPI, but acting at a later stage. Whereas COPI retrieves proteins that need to be in the ER and early Golgi, AP-1 retrieves proteins that need to be in the late Golgi. Although there are still some studies that are difficult to reconcile with an exclusively retrograde role for AP-1, we believe that this is a useful working hypothesis that will lend itself to further testing.</p><p id="P42">Finally, we think that the combination of approaches that we used in this study, single vesicle analysis and vesicle capture, should be very versatile. For instance, these two approaches could be used to characterize AP-1 vesicles in other organisms, such as yeast and plants. They could also be used to identify AP-1-dependent sorting signals in cargo proteins, such as M6P receptors and SNAREs. But this combination of approaches does not need to be limited to studies on AP-1; it could be equally applicable to studies on other transport intermediates, such as those formed using AP-3, AP-4, and COPI, all of which are components of our CCV-enriched fraction. The two approaches are complementary, because vesicle capture gives a global view of the protein composition of a population of vesicles, while single vesicle analysis reveals the heterogeneity within that population. Together, they could be valuable tools for studying many different kinds of trafficking machinery.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P43">The following antibodies were used in this study: rabbit anti-CHC17 (one made in house and one purchased from Abcam, ab172958); mouse anti-CHC17 (X22, Abcam); rabbit anti-AP1G1 (made in house); rabbit anti-GFP (one a gift from Matthew Seaman, CIMR, Cambridge, and one purchased from Abcam, EPR14104); mouse anti-HaloTag (Promega, G9211); rabbit anti-CIMPR (made in house); mouse anti-AP-2 α subunits (AC1-M11, Abcam); and mouse anti-GGA2 (a gift from Doug Brooks, University of South Australia).</p><p id="P44">In addition, a new antiserum was produced against mRuby2, which is not recognised by antibodies against other red fluorescent proteins because it comes from a different organism <italic>(Entacmaea quadricolor</italic> instead of <italic>Discosoma</italic>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>, this worked in principle, but expression was always much lower than that of wild-type AP1G1 in the parental cells. We assume this is because of the extreme aneuploidy of HeLa cells, so that we were only tagging 1-3 copies of the AP1G1 gene and often introducing indels into the others.</p><p id="P46">Because we needed tagged AP1G1 to be expressed at endogenous levels, we used a different strategy: to introduce the tagged AP1G1 by retroviral transduction and then to knock out the endogenous gene. First, we used Gibson assembly to make a construct in a modified version of the retroviral vector pLXIN (a gift from Andrew Peden, University of Sheffield, UK), which has a moderate LTR promoter. The construct consisted of the mouse AP1G1 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Robinson, 1990</xref>) with mRuby2 inserted between amino acids 667 and 668. We also introduced four silent mutations near the beginning of the coding sequence to make the cDNA resistant to our guide RNAs. The resulting plasmid, pAP1G1-mRuby2, was mixed with the packaging plasmids pMD.GagPol and pMD.VSVG, in a ratio of 10:7:3, and transfected into HEK293 cells (ECACC) using TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio LLC), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested after 48 h, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and applied directly to the target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hirst et al., 2021</xref>). Antibiotic selection for stable expression in 500 μg/ml G418 was initiated 48 h post-transduction. We then used gene editing to disrupt the endogenous AP1G1 gene, targeting the sequence CCATCAGATTGCGGGAGCTGATC. Guide RNAs were synthesised and cloned into pX330 (Addgene) and the plasmid was transfected into the cells expressing tagged AP1G1 using a TransIT-HeLaMONSTER kit (Mirus Bio LLC), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clonal cell lines were isolated and assayed by Western blotting (see below) for expression at near-endogenous levels. The clonal cell line A5 was used as the basis for all further experiments.</p><p id="P47">To make use of the Retention Using Selective Hooks (RUSH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>), we used the construct pDCGx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), which encodes a myc-tagged Hook construct, downstream from a strong CMV promoter, in the retroviral vector pQCXIP. The A5 cell line was transduced as described above, and positive cells were selected by puromycin resistance, using a concentration of 1 μg/ml. This (non-clonal) stably transduced cell population was called AH. Cells were routinely screened by immunofluorescence for Hook expression using the mouse anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 (Abcam). Expression was normally very stable, but occasionally the expression became more heterogeneous. When this happened, we transduced the cells again using the same method.</p><p id="P48">Cargo constructs were made using the coding sequences of CDMPR, NAGPA, and LAMP1. The original CDMPR construct, with a streptavidin-binding peptide followed by EGFP, is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al. (2017)</xref>. It was moved into the same modified pLXIN retroviral vector that was used for AP1G1. The resulting plasmid, pVGM, was transduced into AH cells to create AHGM cells, which were sorted by flow cytometry using an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The retroviral constructs VGN and VGL were made by replacing the CDMPR coding sequence with the coding sequences (just after the signal peptide) of NAGPA (cDNA purchased from Stratech, HG20591-UT-SIB) and LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. Again, after transduction into AH cells, the resulting AHGN and AHGL cells were sorted by flow cytometry. HaloTag-conjugated versions of CDMPR and NAGPA, pVOM and pVOM, were also constructed, replacing EGFP with HaloTag (Addgene). These plasmids were then stably transduced into AHGM cells to generate AHGMOM and AHGMON cell populations, which were sorted by flow cytometry. pVOM was also transiently transfected into AHGL cells for live imaging. HaloTag was visualised with the dye Janelia Fluor 646 (Promega) at a concentration of 200 nM.</p><p id="P49">A HaloTag-conjugated nanobody against GFP was made for uptake experiments, following the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buser et al. (2018)</xref>. A plasmid encoding mCherry-tagged camelid anti-GFP, pET24a-VHH-mCherry, was obtained from Addgene, and HaloTag was then inserted in place of mCherry to produce pET24a-VHH-HaloTag. This plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Thermo Fisher) and purified using nickel Sepharose as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buser et al., 2018</xref>). The resulting nanobody was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 5-10 μg/ml.</p><p id="P50">Two other constructs were used for transient transfections, gadkin and GGA2. The gadkin cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hirst et al., 2015</xref>), followed by HaloTag, was inserted into pEBFP-N1 (Clontech) cut with EcoRI and NotI (so the BFP dropped out), using Gibson assembly. Full-length GGA2 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>) was internally tagged with mClover3 and inserted into modified pLXIN using Gibson assembly.</p><p id="P51">For imaging fixed cells, the cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, and mounted onto slides. Widefield images were captured on a Zeiss Axio Imager II microscope using a 63x objective/1.4 NA oil immersion objective and AxioCam 506 camera.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Lattice SIM microscopy</title><p id="P52">For live-cell imaging, cells were grown in MatTek dishes and imaged in an Elyra 7 with Lattice SIM2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an environmental chamber (temperature controlled at 37°C, humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere), two PCO.edge sCMOS version 4.2 (CL HS) cameras (PCO), solid state diode continuous wave lasers, and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC M27, all under the control of ZEN black software (Zeiss). Biotin (400 μM), Janelia Fluor 646 (200 nM), and/or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated human transferrin (25 μg/ml; Invitrogen) were added to the cells for some experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Western blotting</title><p id="P53">Western blotting was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hirst et al., 2021</xref>), using antibodies listed above. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. For probing blots of captured AP-1 vesicles, we used either HRP-conjugated protein A or HRP-conjugated protein G (both from Cell Signaling) because of high background from the immunoglobulin bands when we used secondary antibodies. HRP was detected using ECL Prime reagent (Amersham). To quantify bands, we used a BioRad ChemiDoc imaging system and then analysed the images using FIJI software.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>CCV isolation and single vesicle analysis (SVA)</title><p id="P54">Our protocol for isolating CCVs from HeLa cells is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borner et al. (2006)</xref>. Briefly, it involves homogenising the cells, centrifuging at a relatively low speed to remove unbroken cells and large debris, and then centrifuging the supernatant at high speed to pellet organelles, vesicles, and smaller particles such as ribosomes. The resuspended pellet is mixed with an equal volume of 12.5% Ficoll/12.5% sucrose and centrifuged at a moderate speed to pellet larger structures such as organelles, then the supernatant is diluted and centrifuged at a higher speed to pellet smaller structures, with the final centrifugation step carried out at 50,000 RPM. Pellets were then resusupended in 20 μl buffer A. For some experiments, the cells were pre-treated before starting the isolation procedure. Biotin was added to cells at a concentration of 400 μM for 30, 40, or 120 minutes. In some of these experiments, the HaloTag-conjugated nanobody described above was added for the final 30 minutes and Janelia Fluor 646 was added to the low-speed supernatant. In other experiments, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated human transferrin (Invitrogen) was added to the cells for one hour at a concentration of 25 μg/ml.</p><p id="P55">The slides used for SVA were precoated with 0.1 μm fluorescent beads (Invitrogen TetraSpeck microspheres) to act as a fiducial marker, because the channels needed to be aligned for every image. The beads were diluted 1:300 in 1 mg/ml BSA in water (the BSA ensured that the beads adhered to the slides). A ~1 cm diameter circle was drawn on the bottom of microscope slides and 2 μl of the bead suspension spread over this circle on the other side. The slides were then allowed to dry on a 37° dry block heater. Resuspended CCV-containing pellets were diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, and 2 μl were aliquoted onto the slides on top of the beads. 2 μl mounting medium (Invitrogen ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant) was aliquoted onto coverslips, and the coverslips were placed over the circles, gently pressed down, and allowed to dry. The beads fluoresce in 4 wavelengths (green, red, far-red, and blue), while the CCV-enriched samples only fluoresced in 3 (green, red, and far-red), so it was possible to identify the beads, which are otherwise difficult to distinguish from CCVs as they are of similar size and brightness.</p><p id="P56">To visualise clathrin on the slides by immunofluorescence, bead-coated slides were prepared as described, then circles were drawn on the top of the slide with an ImmEdge pen (Vector Laboratories) after the beads had dried. Then, after applying the resuspended pellet, the slides were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS (PBS/BSA), and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton-X100. Antibody incubations were carried out in PBS/BSA for one hour, with washes in between. The primary antibody was X22 (see above); the secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 499-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher).</p><p id="P57">Widefield images of the vesicles were captured as above, but using a 100x objective. At least 10 images were collected for each condition, using varying dilutions of the pellet. Three biological repeats were carried out for each experiment. A newly written script was used for image analysis (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Quantification of SVA</title><p id="P58">To analyse our dataset, we utilised a Python-based pipeline. Raw microscopy data in CZI format were loaded from a designated directory, with each set containing multiple channels, including fluorescence channels for different markers and a fiducial bead channel. Employing fiducial beads as references, a homographic alignment was performed, using the green fluorescence channel as the primary reference. The blue and red channels were aligned to the green channel, while the far-red was aligned to the red channel, utilising OpenCV’s <bold>findTransformECC</bold> and <bold>warpPerspective</bold> functions. Punctate structures across channels were discerned using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter from the <bold>skimage</bold> library. For each identified structure, a region of interest (ROI) was demarcated based on its radius, and the mean fluorescence intensity within this ROI was calculated for all channels.</p><p id="P59">Leveraging single-channel controls, thresholds were set to binarise data, determining vesicle cargo and adaptor presence. Notably, fiducial beads, consistent across channels, were excluded from analysis. Post-processing, results were aggregated and exported as CSV files. This methodology facilitated robust and reproducible vesicle categorisation based on the presence of machinery or cargo.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Vesicle capture</title><p id="P60">AP-1-positive vesicles were captured from A5 cells using the mRuby2 antiserum described above and protein A-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The beads were first incubated with either mRuby2 antiserum or the preimmune serum from the same rabbit, using 10 μl serum for 50 μl beads, following the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing with PBS containing 0.2% TWEEN 20, the beads were washed three times with PBS alone (because the presence of the detergent might extract membrane proteins from the vesicles). A CCV-enriched preparation was carried out using our standard protocol (see above), but before the final centrifugation step, two volumes of 0.33M MOPS, pH 7.4, were added to the supernatant, to raise the pH and facilitate binding. The CCV-enriched supernatant was then rotated with the beads for 1 hour at room temperature and washed with a 2:1 mixture of 0.33M MOPS and Buffer A. The washed beads were either prepared for electron microscopy (see below) or eluted with SDS-containing sample buffer for gel electrophoresis, usually followed by Western blotting (see above).</p><p id="P61">For electron microscopy, the beads were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, stained en bloc with aqueous uranyl acetate, serially dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Agar 100 resin (Agar Scientific). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being imaged on a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope at an operating voltage of 80 kV.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Proteomics</title><p id="P62">To quantify bead-captured vs. total CCV-enriched proteins, A5 cells were metabolically labelled in either SILAC heavy or SILAC light medium for at least 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ong et al., 2002</xref>). The labelling was performed in SILAC RPMI 1640 medium (89984, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialysed foetal calf serum (10,000MW cut-off; Invitrogen), and either “Heavy” amino acids (50 μg/ml <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N4 Arginine HCl and 100 μg/ml <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N2 Lysine 2HCl; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), or the equivalent “Light” amino acids. CCV-enriched preparations were carried out in parallel on both sets of cells (12 confluent 150-mm dishes for each). Before the final centrifugation step, the preparation from the cells grown in heavy medium was incubated with anti-mRuby2 coupled to magnetic beads to capture AP-1 vesicles, as described above. The preparation from the cells grown in light medium was centrifuged one last time at 50,000 RPM to obtain an input fraction for reference. The two samples were made up to the same volume in SDS-containing sample buffer, mixed, loaded in a single lane onto a preparative 1.5-mm 10% acrylamide gel, and run so that the sample separated into a 5-cm strip. The gel was then washed, stained with Coomassie blue, and cut into 10 slices. Proteins were reduced with 10 μM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich), alkylated with 50 μM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), and in-gel digested with 10 ng/μl trypsin (Roche).</p><p id="P63">Digested peptides were collected in 0.5ml tubes (Protein LoBind, Eppendorf) and dried almost to completion. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl solvent (3% MeCN, 0.1% TFA) with 6μl analysed by LC-MSMS using a Thermo Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) equipped with an EASYspray source and coupled to an RSLC3000 nano UPLC (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Peptides were fractionated using a 50 cm C18 PepMap EASYspray column maintained at 40°C with a solvent flow rate of 300nl/min. A gradient was formed using solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) rising from 7 to 37% solvent B by 88 min followed by a 2 min wash at 95% solvent B. MS spectra were acquired at 120,000 resolution between m/z 350 and 1500 with MSMS spectra acquired in the ion trap following HCD activation. Data were processed in Maxquant 2.2.0.0 with carbamidomethyl (C) set as a fixed modification and oxidation (M) and acetyl (protein N-terminus) set as variable modifications. Data were searched against a Uniprot Homo Sapien database (downloaded 06/12/22) and a database of common contaminants.</p><p id="P64">To compare the heavy (H) and light (L) datasets, mass spectrometry raw files were processed in MaxQuant Version X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). Downstream data analysis was performed on the ‘proteinGroups.txt’ output file and all data transformation, filtering, and statistical analyses were performed in Perseus software version 1.6.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). For a statistical analysis of the four datasets, they were first subjected to a standard filter for reverse hits, matches based on modified peptides only, and common contaminants. Then the rows were filtered to include only those proteins that had at least three valid H/L ratios (i.e., were quantified in three out of the four datasets), leaving 632 proteins. Next, for each of the four experiments, the H/L ratios were normalised by dividing by the median H/L ratio for that experiment, to make them comparable, and the normalised H/L ratios were then log2-transformed. We then performed a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) to compare the normalised log2 ratios for each protein to a hypothetical ratio defined as the mean normalised log2 ratio for CLTC (0.0976484). The rationale for using CLTC is that it is the most abundant protein in both the CCV input sample and the AP-1 IP (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). CLTC is known to be associated with AP-1 vesicles, but not all the CLTC is expected to associate with AP-1 vesicles, as the preparation also contains AP-2 vesicles and probably reassembled empty clathrin coats as well. Therefore, we would expect any protein with a ratio greater than CLTC to be a potential component of AP-1 vesicles. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> we plot the results of the <italic>t</italic>-test, with the <italic>t</italic>-test difference (log2 fold enrichment over CLTC in the IP) on the x-axis and the unadjusted -log<sub>10</sub> <italic>p</italic>-value on the y-axis. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and report the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <italic>q</italic>-values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p id="P65">Supplemental Material</p><p id="P66">Supplemental material includes five figures, two tables, and six videos.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190633-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d85aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190633-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d85aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190633-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d85aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matthew Seaman and Doug Brooks for antibodies; Andrew Peden for plasmids; Reiner Schulte, Gabriela Grondys-Kotarba, and Chiara Cossetti for cell sorting; Nick Bright for help with electron microscopy; John Suberu for preparing samples for mass spectrometry; and Paul Luzio for reading the manuscript and for helpful discussions.

These proteins include hydrolases and their receptors, which are sorted by GGAs, with AP-1 playing an auxiliary role. AP-1 has a further role in retrieving proteins from peripheral endosomes, including empty hydrolase receptors and TGN-resident membrane proteins such as syntaxins 6, 10, and 16. Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hirst et al. (2012)</xref>. <bold>(B)</bold> In Model 2, AP-1 and GGAs act independently. GGAs sort hydrolases and their receptors at or near the TGN for trafficking to endosomes, while AP-1 acts exclusively at endosomes to retrieve proteins, including empty receptors, back to the TGN. One or more of these proteins may be needed by GGAs for forward transport.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190633-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>System for investigating outgoing and incoming membrane traffic.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of the system. A HeLa cell line was generated in which the endogenous AP-1 γ-adaptin subunit, encoded by <italic>AP1G1,</italic> was replaced by an mRuby2-tagged version. The cells were then stably transduced with a “hook” construct, consisting of streptavidin with a KDEL sequence for ER retention, and one or more candidate cargo constructs, containing streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) to keep the constructs in the ER until the addition of biotin. Most of these constructs were also tagged with GFP, so that their appearance at the plasma membrane and subsequent endocytosis could be monitored with an anti-GFP nanobody. <bold>(B)</bold> Western blot of cells shown schematically in <bold>(A)</bold>, in which the SBP- and GFP-tagged cargo protein was the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR). Addition of biotin causes a shift in the mobility of SBP-GFP-CDMPR (visualised with anti-GFP) as it moves through the Golgi apparatus. HaloTag-conjugated nanobody was added to all the cells for the final 30 minutes, and it starts to show a clear increase above background levels (which are most likely due to fluid-phase uptake) after 40 minutes in biotin. The AP-1 γ subunit is expressed at similar levels in the wild-type and transduced cells, but it has different mobilities (asterisks) because of the presence or absence of the mRuby2 tag. Clathrin heavy chain (CHC17) was used as a loading control. <bold>(C)</bold> Fluorescent images of the cells shown in <bold>(B)</bold>. After 15 minutes in biotin, most of the SBP-GFP-CDMPR has moved from the ER to the Golgi region, and it stays mostly Golgi-localised until after 40 minutes.

A CCV-enriched fraction is prepared from stably transduced cells and aliquoted onto slides that were pre-coated with100-nm beads. The beads fluoresce in four wavelengths and are used as fiducial markers for channel alignment. Widefield images are collected in four channels and analysed using a newly written script. The analysis includes channel alignment, quantification of fluorescence in each spot, and elimination of the beads, which are the only particles that fluoresce in Channel 4. Data are plotted as the percentage of AP-1-containing spots (Channel 1) that also contain another protein or proteins. <bold>(B)</bold> A CCV-enriched fraction was prepared from cells co-expressing mRuby2-tagged AP-1 and SBP-GFP-tagged CDMPR, treated with biotin for 2 hours and incubated with HaloTag-conjugated nanobody for the final 30 minutes.

The data represent the means from three independent pooled experiments, with at least 10 images analysed in each experiment for each condition. The error bars indicate the standard deviation. The presence of CDMPR in AP-1 vesicles continues to increase throughout the time course, so that by 2 hours in biotin, about three-quarters of the AP-1 vesicles contain detectable CDMPR, and nearly half of these also contain detectable endocytosed nanobody. There are no vesicles containing nanobody that do not also contain CDMPR, as expected because the nanobody enters the cell by piggybacking on the CDMPR.

These vesicles return to the juxtanuclear TGN. GGAs sort hydrolases and their receptors at the juxtanuclear TGN for trafficking to a later endosome, with an intralumenal pH below 6, and empty receptors are recycled from this compartment by retromer and sorting nexins.
