However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the rate of brain aging and its relationship to cognition. Furthermore, most brain age models are trained and tested on cross-sectional data from primarily Caucasian, adult participants. It is thus unclear how well these models generalize to non-Caucasian participants, especially children. Here, we tested a previously published deep learning model on Singaporean elderly participants (55 – 88 years old) and children (4 – 11 years old). We found that the model directly generalized to the elderly participants, but model finetuning was necessary for children. After finetuning, we found that the rate of change in brain age gap was associated with future executive function performance in both elderly participants and children. We further found that lateral ventricles and frontal areas contributed to brain age prediction in elderly participants, while white matter and posterior brain regions were more important in predicting brain age of children. Taken together, our results suggest that there is potential for generalizing brain age models to diverse populations. Moreover, the longitudinal change in brain age gap reflects developing and aging processes in the brain, relating to future cognitive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>brain age</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>Tl-weighted MRI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The human brain undergoes coordinated, multidimensional anatomical changes throughout the lifespan, which can be measured noninvasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. These anatomical changes occur in parallel with age-related changes to other measurable phenotypes, such as cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Abnormal aging in late life and abnormal development in early life have both been implicated with increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Thus, efforts have been made to quantify the heterogenous effects of aging/development on the brain through the concept of “brain age.” Brain age uses machine learning to predict age from neuroimaging data. A higher brain age suggests more advanced aging/development relative to one’s chronological age. This helps summarize complex patterns into a single number that preserves individual variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Historically, most brain age studies first use specialized software to preprocess MRI data and extract features such as gray matter volume, cortical thickness, or surface area. A machine learning model is then trained to predict age from the extracted features. The model is typically trained using cognitively normal participants, with chronological age acting as the ground truth. The model is then applied to new participants to predict their brain age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P5">More recently, deep learning models have gained popularity over traditional machine learning models for brain age prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Unlike previous machine learning methods, deep learning models can learn relevant features directly from the unprocessed (or minimally processed) MRI scan. This reduces the need for specialized preprocessing to extract features, which is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge, and involves laborious quality control. This also allows deep learning models to train on increasingly numerous and heterogeneous data. Some of these pretrained models have been made publicly available and shown impressive generalization performance on completely unseen test data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, both training and testing data still primarily consist of Caucasian participants, which could bias the models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Deep learning models can use finetuning (i.e. transfer learning) to help overcome this bias and achieve good performance even in small datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. But to our knowledge, previous work has not examined the performance, with and without finetuning, of a Caucasian-centric model on non-Caucasian children and elderly participants, such as Asian children and elderly participants. This generalization is important to establish as the prevalence of developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] are on the rise in Asia.</p><p id="P6">In addition to being able to predict age, predictions made by the model should show utility in relating to other phenotypes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The deviation from expected aging is often quantified as the brain age gap (BAG; also referred to as brainPAD, brainAGE, etc.), which is calculated by subtracting chronological age from brain age. The BAG has shown broad associations with brain disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], and cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], to name a few (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] for recent reviews). However, there are relatively few longitudinal studies in healthy participants. Previous work found associations with early life or cross-sectional measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], but there was only a weak link to future age-related cognitive decline, which did not survive multiple comparison correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Notably, these studies only used brain age measured at one time point. There is evidence that cross-sectional and longitudinal brain measures may reflect different factors and predispositions of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], suggesting combining them could provide more predictive power. However, to our knowledge, the additional utility of longitudinal changes in brain age has not been tested in healthy participants.</p><p id="P7">Thus, in this work, we leverage a state-of-the-art deep learning brain age model trained on over 30,000 individuals across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] to test generalizability to Asian elderly participants and children. We also finetune the model to explore how much predictions improve. We then examine the longitudinal utility of brain age in associating with future cognition. Finally, we investigate model interpretability using guided backpropagation. Our findings provide insight into the generalizability of brain age models and the importance of longitudinal measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><p id="P8"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the study design. For the brain age model, we used the publicly available Simple Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN) pretrained on 34,285 T1 MRI scans from 21 non-overlapping datasets across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. This pretrained model (a.k.a. pyment) was found to have the highest accuracy and test-retest reliability in a recent comparison of publicly available brain age models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. While featuring an unusually large and heterogenous training set for brain age prediction, there was still a relative lack of training data from very young and/or non-Caucasian participants.</p><p id="P9">Thus, to test generalizability to Asian elderly participants and children, we used three datasets from Singapore: 1) the cross-sectional Epidemiology of Dementia in Singapore (EDIS) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], consisting of 694 non-demented elderly (226 with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and 468 with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND)); 2) the longitudinal Singapore Longitudinal Aging Brain Study (SLABS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], consisting of 215 healthy elderly participants; and 3) the longitudinal Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], consisting of 678 healthy children. These datasets are detailed in the Methods (Section 5). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> summarize the participant demographic and cognitive characteristics.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>The pretrained brain age model performs well in older adults, while the finetuned model performs well in both older adults and children</title><p id="P10">We first input minimally preprocessed T1 scans directly to the pretrained model (all baseline and follow-up data).

After finetuning, correlations and MAEs slightly improved (r = 0.7445 for EDIS and r = 0.8138 for SLABS; MAE = 3.3232 for EDIS and MAE = 3.2653 for SLABS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, first two rows), but the predictions were generally similar to those made by the pretrained model (correlation between finetuned and pretrained predictions = 0.9143 for EDIS and 0.9231 for SLABS).</p><p id="P12">In contrast, the pretrained model did not perform as well in GUSTO (children). The MAE was lower than in elderly (MAE = 2.57), but the age range of GUSTO was also much smaller.

After finetuning, the correlation and MAE drastically improved (r = 0.9411; MAE = 0.6286; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, last row). The variance in predicted ages also increased as chronological age increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).

The association was not significant for attention (<italic>β</italic> = –0.0404, <italic>p<sub>corr</sub></italic> = 0.2461). These results were consistent after finetuning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A and Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Similar broad negative associations were also observed in SLABS at baseline (N = 212), but these were not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables S6 &amp; S7</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To investigate longitudinal utility of brain age in healthy elderly, we tested associations in a longitudinal subset of SLABS (N = 81) using similar multiple linear regression models. We first related baseline BAG and early change in BAG to long-term cognitive change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; Methods Section 5.3). Baseline BAG generally failed to show associations with longitudinal cognitive changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). While higher baseline BAG was associated with faster long-term decline in executive function, it was not significant after multiple comparison correction (<italic>β</italic> = –0.2477, p = 0.0406, <italic>p<sub>corr</sub></italic> = 0.2433, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Notably, these associations were independent of baseline BAG, chronological age, sex, and years of education.

Since longitudinal cognitive data was not available for GUSTO, we used the cognitive scores themselves instead of the change. Furthermore, since finetuning the model drastically improved prediction accuracy in GUSTO, we used the finetuned predictions for our main analyses. We did not find a significant association between baseline BAG and baseline IQ score (<italic>β</italic> = −0.0618, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3809, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). Similarly, we did not find significant associations between baseline BAG and future cognitive scores (at 8.5 years old; |<italic>β</italic>| ≤ 0.0829, p ≥ 0.4086, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S13</xref>). However, the early rate of BAG change (from 4.5 to 7. years old) was positively associated with future inhibition (at 8.5 years old; <italic>β</italic> = 0.2006, p = 0.0103, <italic>p<sub>corr</sub></italic> = 0.0411, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

These associations were independent of baseline BAG, chronological age, and sex. Notably, in contrast to older adults, the direction of association was now positive, meaning increased early rate of BAG change was associated with better future executive function performance. There were no significant associations using the pretrained model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S3A &amp; S4 and Supplementary Tables S12 &amp; S14</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Finetuned brain age models focus on distinct features in children and elderly participants</title><p id="P16">Finally, to investigate model interpretability, we used guided backpropagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] to derive group-level saliency maps for brain age prediction (Methods Section 5.4). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows the top 10% of contributing voxels to age prediction in four representative slices (left) for all datasets.

Substantial contributions can also be seen in frontal/association areas corresponding to the default mode, control, and salience/ventral attention networks. Areas near the hippocampus/fornix, thalamus, and somatomotor network also contribute. These findings are consistent when using the pretrained model for EDIS and SLABS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5A&amp;B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In contrast, with the children of GUSTO, notable differences can be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). While the fornix is still the strongest contributor, it and other anterior areas near the ventricles (genu and body of corpus callosum, caudate) do not contribute as much. The overall prominence of white matter is also increased, especially in the brainstem (corticospinal tract and pontine crossing tract) and posterior regions (sagittal stratum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and posterior limb of internal capsule). Furthermore, gray matter networks generally decrease in prominence, except the visual and limbic networks, which increase in prominence. The hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus continue to make substantial contributions. Unlike in elderly, these features are not consistent when using the pretrained model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Our findings are the first, to our knowledge, to show the age-dependent generalizability of a pretrained brain age model to non-Caucasian participants - specifically Singaporean children and elderly. We also present novel results on the informativeness of longitudinal changes in brain age, independent of baseline brain age, to future executive function in healthy participants. Finally, we show that accurate models focus on distinct features in elderly and children, suggesting that the brain age model can extract relevant age-related information.</p><sec id="S8"><label>3.1</label><title>Generalizability of pretrained brain age models to local datasets may be age-dependent</title><p id="P20">Overall, our results suggest the pretrained SFCN model could be directly applied to Singaporean elderly participants, but it needed to be finetuned for Singaporean children. Previous work with the SLABS dataset showed that aging-related changes in Chinese Singaporean elderly were comparable to previous studies conducted with primarily Caucasian participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. However, it was not initially clear whether this would carry over to a multidimensional index like brain age or to elderly datasets that better reflect the ethnic diversity of Singapore. Encouragingly, we found high accuracy in predicting age (i.e. low MAE and high correlation) in both EDIS (Chinese, Malay, and Indian participants) and SLABS (Chinese participants only) using the pretrained model. Furthermore, our results after finetuning were generally consistent with the original findings in elderly. This suggests that similarities were not specific to the SLABS sample, but could generalize to Singaporean elderly as a whole. In addition to similar aging patterns, the success of the pretrained model in this age range can be attributed to the abundance of training data around 60 – 80 years old, mostly from UKBiobank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P21">However, we found the pretrained model did not perform as well in children (i.e. low correlation). While the MAE was actually lower in children than elderly, this was likely due to the smaller age range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. After finetuning, the MAE reduced dramatically, further demonstrating the inadequacy of the pretrained model in this case. Previous work has indicated that brain structural differences between Chinese Singaporeans and non-Asian Americans may be more pronounced in young adults than elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This could conceivably extend to childhood and other ethnicities. However, another important factor is the model training age distribution, which only included 147 participants 5 years old or younger and had its earliest (and smallest) peak around 10 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Notably, the pretrained model tended to predict all GUSTO ages around 10 years old, suggesting it may have been impacted by this imbalanced distribution.</p><p id="P22">Fortunately, finetuning the model produced distinct age groups, along with higher correlation and lower MAE. As discussed below, finetuning the model in children also shifted feature saliency and revealed a significant association with future executive function that was not found using the pretrained model. This suggests the model underwent a greater change in children, compared to elderly, to become both more accurate and meaningful. Furthermore, we found that the variance of finetuned predictions was the lowest at 4.5 years old and increased steadily with age, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. This implies the “brain maintenance” account of aging, where individuals start with the same or similar offsets, and different slopes result in increased variability over the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. This also suggests that the variance in brain age predictions at later ages is likely due to stable, lifelong factors as well as ongoing changes. Thus, looking at longitudinal changes in brain age could help separate these influences.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>3.2</label><title>Longitudinal changes in brain age are informative of future executive function</title><p id="P23">Our results with baseline BAG were largely consistent with previous work in elderly. With a large sample of community-dwelling, non-demented participants from EDIS, we found significant associations with baseline cognition across multiple cognitive domains, consistent with a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, with a smaller longitudinal sample of healthy participants from SLABS, we matched previous work finding an association with future decline in cognition, despite being not significant after multiple comparison correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In GUSTO children, we did not find a significant association between baseline BAG and baseline cognition at 4.5 years old or future cognition at 8.5 years old. To our knowledge, while brain age associations with cognition have been reported in samples spanning 3 – 22 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], they have not been explored around the early age of 4.5 years old specifically. This is notable since our generalization analyses revealed that, after finetuning, brain age variability is lowest at this age and increases with age. Thus, cross-sectional associations with cognition may only occur at later ages, when there is more variability in brain age. Alternatively, more complex models may be needed to reveal cross-sectional structure-cognition association at such young ages.</p><p id="P24">Although we generally did not find associations between baseline BAG and future cognition in healthy participants, the story was different when including the early rate of change in BAG. Due to the lack of available longitudinal cognitive data in GUSTO, we could only look at future cognition at a single time point instead of the rate of change. This likely introduced noise into our analyses as it did not account for the initial variation in cognition. The future cognitive scores in GUSTO were also all related to executive function, so we could not investigate other cognitive domains in children. Interestingly, within subdomains of executive function in children, we found the strongest association with inhibition, which has been proposed as a primary driver of domain-general executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Thus, we found that early longitudinal changes in BAG associated with future executive function performance in both children and elderly, independent of baseline BAG. This is notable in light of recent evidence that early-life factors may affect cross-sectional brain measurements, but not longitudinal changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. While the association was specific to executive function in elderly, it is presently not clear whether this was biased by the modest sample size of 6- to 10-year longitudinal data or whether brain age is particularly sensitive to this domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Previous work found associations between early- or mid-life factors and cross-sectional brain age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], but associations with the longitudinal change of brain age were not investigated.</p><p id="P25">Our findings thus suggest that early-life factors could influence the cross-sectional brain age, but they are not the only influence throughout the lifespan. Early life factors may dominate the (relatively low) inter-individual variability in brain age at 4.5 years old. However, as normal development occurs in the next several years, children mature at different rates, leading to increasing variability in brain age predictions. This variance is also related to individual differences in executive function. In late life, these changes have accumulated to produce more variable brain age predictions. However, baseline brain age predictions do not associate with future cognitive performance, possibly since they reflect past factors. Information about ongoing changes in brain aging is needed to reveal associations with future rates of executive function decline. Taken together, these findings suggest that brain age, when measured longitudinally, can capture ongoing processes of healthy aging.</p><p id="P27">While early longitudinal changes in BAG associated with future executive function performance in both elderly and children, one notable difference lies in the direction of association. In elderly, increases in BAG were associated with worse executive function decline. In children, increases in BAG were associated with better future inhibitory performance. There have been somewhat conflicting reports on the direction of association between BAG and cognition in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. However, our results are unique in examining the longitudinal change in BAG rather than the cross-sectional BAG. Thus, our results could reflect previously reported cognitive decline with increasing age in late life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and cognitive gains with increasing age in early life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. One of the few longitudinal studies in development related white matter and executive function development, and found that white matter growth in adolescence was associated with better inhibitory control, while growth in adulthood was associated with worse performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Our brain age paradigm, based on multivariate features of the brain, further support these findings in children and elderly. Specifically, a faster increase in BAG may imply that a child is developing ahead of schedule, resulting in more rapidly maturing cognitive functioning. Conversely, a slower increase in BAG at an older age may reflect mechanisms of brain maintenance at work, prolonging a more “youthful” brain and sustained optimal cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>3.3</label><title>Salient features of the brain age model differ between elderly and children</title><p id="P28">Our work builds on recent efforts to interpret deep learning brain age models in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. While the datasets, brain age models, and interpretability methods all differed among these studies, the most consistent finding was the importance of the lateral ventricles in elderly. This was evident in our models as well. Like other popular methods for extracting feature importance from deep learning models, our guided backpropagation method tended to highlight boundaries between regions and tissue types (i.e. edges). Thus, strong contributions from white matter areas such as the fornix and corpus callosum were likely at least partly due to the size of the lateral ventricles. These regions all ranked highly in elderly, suggesting the overall importance of the lateral ventricles.</p><p id="P29">Our other findings in elderly also broadly align with prior research in aging. We find important contributions around subcortical regions and frontal/association areas that are observed to degenerate more prominently in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Among areas near the lateral ventricles, the fornix particularly stands out as the strongest contributor. This could be due to its connections with the hippocampus, suggesting fornix contributions may also reflect age-related hippocampus atrophy. Fornix was previously the strongest contributor in brain age models focused on white matter derived from diffusion MRI, and it showed the highest absolute correlations with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Corpus callosum and cerebellar peduncle were also found to strongly contribute in a separate white matter brain age model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Additionally, the importance of the thalamus, putamen and caudate, ventral attention network, and somatomotor network could indicate the importance of frontostriatal circuits. Frontostriatal changes have been proposed as a hallmark of healthy aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], and the role of these and related regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] in supporting executive function could underlie the observed association between BAG and executive function.</p><p id="P30">We also show clear differences in feature importance between elderly and children, in line with prior research in development. The consistency between elderly datasets reinforces that these differences are not simply artefacts of using a different dataset. Most strikingly, we find evidence of a posterior to anterior pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] going from childhood to elderly. For instance, posterior areas near the lateral ventricles (tapetum and splenium of corpus callosum) continue to rank highly, while more anterior areas decrease in prominence. We also find a general increase in the relative importance of white matter, with greater increases in posterior regions. This is in line with a previous brain age model showing stronger contributions of white matter relative to gray matter in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The focus on the development of white matter could also underlie the observed association with executive function development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>].

While we find encouraging signs that the model generalizes to Singaporean elderly, we can not completely rule out more subtle issues that may have arisen from applying the model to these participants. For instance, finetuning the model slightly increased prediction accuracy and generally strengthened associations with cognition in elderly, suggesting the pretrained model may not have performed optimally. Furthermore, we have not tested the model in other non-Caucasian participants, which would be needed for a more comprehensive test of generalizability. The current study also only includes participants from very early and late life. Thus, future work would be needed to extend our results across the lifespan, with more participants and even longer follow up times, in order to achieve a more complete picture.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P32">Here, we used a previously published brain age model to reveal age-dependent generalization to Asian participants, as well as age-dependent associations and interpretability of brain age.

Furthermore, longitudinal changes in brain age were related to future executive function in both children and elderly participants. However, the direction of association was positive in children and negative in elderly. Combined with the identified salient features for brain age prediction, we conclude that increased brain age in early life could indicate more mature development, especially in white matter and posterior areas.

Next, again for each cognitive domain, we related early rate of BAG change (calculated from the first three phases) to long-term rate of cognitive change (calculated from all five phases). If this relation was significant for a domain, we lastly related early rate of BAG change (calculated from the first three phases) to future rate of cognitive change (calculated from the last measurement of BAG onwards). All models included chronological age, sex, and years of education as covariates. Models with rate of BAG change also included baseline BAG as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Children</title><p id="P52">For cross-sectional analyses, we related baseline BAG to baseline cognition, both at 4.5 years old. For longitudinal analyses, we again calculated annual rates of change in BAG using linear regressions with time for each participant. We then related baseline BAG to future cognition and early rate of change in BAG to future cognition. Here, early rate of BAG change was calculated from 4.5 to 7.5 years, while future cognition was measured at 8.5 years. Chronological age and sex were included as covariates in all models. Models with rate of BAG change also included baseline BAG as a covariate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><label>5.4</label><title>Model interpretability</title><p id="P53">For each dataset, we investigated model interpretability using all scans from the same participants as the associations with cognition. Guided backpropagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] was used to compute individual saliency maps for both the pretrained and finetuned models. Guided backpropagation was previously shown to give similar results as occlusion for a brain age model, at a higher resolution and lower computational cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. For finetuned models, the fold where the participant was included in the test set was used. Maps were registered to a common space using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Specifically, for each participant, input (minimally preprocessed) images were nonlinearly registered to MNI 152 space using the default parameters. This transformation was then applied to each participants’ saliency maps.</p><p id="P54">To identify brain features that contributed the most to brain age predictions, we first averaged saliency maps over all participants in a study. We then retained the top 10% of voxels and calculated gray and white matter network/regional contributions. We used the 400-area Schaefer parcellation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] assigned to 7 functional networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] for cortical gray matter. We averaged over all voxels in all parcels for each network. For subcortical gray matter, we used the automated anatomical labelling atlas 3 (AAL3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] to identify regions containing the hippocampus and amygdala, the putamen and caudate, and the thalamus. For white matter, we used the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] with 48 ROIs. For all regions, we averaged over all voxels in both hemispheres. Contributions were normalized to sum to 1, giving the relative contribution. To visualize saliency maps in 2D, we set the maximum value to the 99th percentile and overlaid select slices (x = 97, z = 68, z = 89, z = 135) over a MNI 152 template brain. Full 3D saliency maps will be made available online.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191852-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all participants and the research teams of GUSTO, EDIS, and SLABS for their contributions.
