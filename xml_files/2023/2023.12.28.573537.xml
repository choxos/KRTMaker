The assay normally allows quantification of trace amounts of both oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) by enzymatic cycling, but we now show that the NAD analog 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyrAD) also acts as a substrate. In fact, AcPyrAD generates amplification signals of larger amplitude than those obtained with NAD. We exploited this finding to devise and validate a novel method for assaying the base exchange activity of SARM1 in reactions containing NAD and an excess of the free base 3-acetylpyridine (AcPyr), where AcPyrAD is the product. We also propose an application of this method based on competition between AcPyr and other free bases to rank their preference for SARM1. This has significant advantages over traditional methods for assaying SARM1 base exchange as it is rapid, sensitive, cost-effective, and easily scalable. This could represent a useful tool given current interest in the role of SARM1 base exchange in programmed axon death and related human disorders. It may also be applicable to other multifunctional NAD glycohydrolases (EC 3.2.2.6) that possess similar base exchange activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Enzyme assay</kwd><kwd>SARM1</kwd><kwd>NAD(P)ase</kwd><kwd>base exchange</kwd><kwd>pyridine bases</kwd><kwd>acetylpyridine</kwd><kwd>isoquinoline</kwd><kwd>pyridine dinucleotides</kwd><kwd>acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>AcPyr</term><def><p id="P2">3-acetylpiridine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AcPyrAD</term><def><p id="P3">oxidized 3-acetylpiridine adenine dinucleotide, used in place of AcPyrAD<sup>+</sup></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADPR &amp; ADPRP</term><def><p id="P4">adenosine 5’-diphosphoribose &amp; its 2’-phosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARM</term><def><p id="P5">armadillo/HEAT motif</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>isoQ</term><def><p id="P6">isoquinoline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>isoQAD</term><def><p id="P7">isoquinoline adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Na</term><def><p id="P8">nicotinic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAD &amp; NADP</term><def><p id="P9">oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide &amp; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, used throughout the manuscript in place of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAD(P)ase</term><def><p id="P10">NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>-glycohydrolase multifunctional enzyme belonging to EC 3.2.2.6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Nam</term><def><p id="P11">nicotinamide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMN</term><def><p id="P12">nicotinamide mononucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Vacor</term><def><p id="P13">pyrinuron (1-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)urea)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARM1</term><def><p id="P14">sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIR</term><def><p id="P15">Toll/interleukin-1 receptor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P16">SARM1 is a protein adapter of Toll-like receptors that plays a key role in programmed axon death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and is currently recognized as a potential therapeutic target for a number of neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. SARM1 is a multifunctional NAD(P) glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6) generating Nam and, depending on the activity, either ADPR or ADPRP (hydrolysis), cyclic ADPR or cyclic ADPRP (cyclization), or potentially any NAD or NADP analog when free pyridine bases other than Nam are available (transglycosidation, or “base exchange”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P17">Induction of SARM1 glycohydrolase activity is a central step for executing programmed axon death, and this is triggered by a combination of increasing axonal levels of the key NAD-synthesis intermediate NMN, or analogues, and decreases of NAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In current models, NMN and NAD compete for binding to a site within the inhibitory ARM domains of SARM1 octamers: SARM1 activity is normally suppressed while NAD is bound but its displacement by NMN triggers a conformational change in the whole protein that facilitates oligomerization of the catalytic TIR domains to generate a more active form of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Remarkably, the positive allosteric regulation exerted by NMN on ARM domains applies equally to all of the SARM1 enzymatic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P18">While there has been much focus on SARM1 NAD hydrolase activity as the driver of programmed axon death, the role of its base exchange activity has until recently received less attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Uniquely among the mammalian enzymes with transglycosidase activity, base exchange by SARM1 can occur at physiological pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], depending on free pyridine bases available to exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. SARM1 is thus expected to catalyse the majority of NAD transglycosidation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, calcium mobilization plays a crucial role in axon degeneration and the potent calcium mobilizer, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, can be formed by SARM1 base exchange from nicotinic acid (Na) and NADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. This represents one way that SARM1 base exchange might contribute to degeneration, although this has not yet been confirmed.</p><p id="P19">The work described here was initiated after we found that SARM1-mediated consumption of NAD in reactions containing excess AcPyr resulted in an increased luminescence/signal by NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay rather than the expected reduction. Under these conditions SARM1 almost exclusively catalyzes base exchange to produce AcPyrAD from NAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and so we hypothesized that, given the close similarity between Nam and AcPyr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), AcPyrAD might represent an alternative, and better, substrate for the cycling enzymes in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay to account for the enhanced signal in these reactions. This allowed us to devise a new method for assaying the 3-acetylpyridine exchange reaction on NAD catalyzed by SARM1.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Luminescence emission in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay &amp; derived calculations</title><p id="P20">The NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit uses two highly selective but undisclosed enzymes, an “NAD Cycling Enzyme” plus a “Reductase”, to reduce proluciferin into luciferin. Light is generated from a “Luciferase” in the presence of ATP that is proportional to the amount of NAD/NADH within a range from 10 nM to 400 nM with measurements typically taken between 30 and 60 min. Notably, temperature may change the rate of light generation due to effects on the enzyme rates.</p><p id="P21">We obtained experimental RLU measures, at 25 °C, from a standard curve of pure NAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) from 1 pmol to 100 pmol, equivalent to 10 nM to 1000 nM in solution, thus purposefully exceeding the linearity of the assay. As a result, the luminescence profiles generated were parabolic rather than linear, albeit linearity could be seen after an initial short lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Most curves then showed a general pattern of plateauing followed by a gradual decline (likely as some of the reagents become limiting). Curve amplitudes increased with increasing NAD concentration amounts with an earlier plateau and decline phase. From this data set, we calculated RLU/min from best linear fitting of each curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>) and plotted slopes versus corresponding NAD amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Linearity in this case was seen up to 20-40 pmol of NAD (200-400 nM in solution), thus close to the upper threshold limit of the kit. Conversely, when light emission was taken from the initial ramp of each curve and, after a derivative calculation and plotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>, and see Methods), reported and plotted as RLU/min<sup>2</sup>, we could see improved linearity up to 100 pmol of NAD at least (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). As such, this latter calculation was used in all subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cycling amplification of AcPyrAD in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay</title><p id="P22">Early testing revealed that purified AcPyrAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) is a substrate for cycling in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay, with the curves acquired being similar to those obtained for NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). In fact, AcPyrAD (alone) resulted in more intense light production compared to NAD with signal amplitudes about 3.5-fold higher at 25 °C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref> and the RLU/min<sup>2</sup> per pmol of 3.36 for AcPyrAD compared to 0.96 for NAD). On the other hand, AcPyrAD was not cycled in the NADP/NADPH-Glo™ Assay (not shown), indicating specificity for the NAD/NADH-Glo™ kit.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Quantification of AcPyrAD when mixed with NAD</title><p id="P23">We next assessed the linearity and the amplitude of emitted signals when AcPyrAD and NAD were mixed at various ratios for three different total amounts (1, 2 and 5 pmol). We found a linear relationship for our specific test conditions as light emission (reported as RLU/min<sup>2</sup>) increased proportional to the relative amount of AcPyrAD in the mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>), with the gradients of the curves being equivalent to each other for the three fixed total amounts of AcPyrAD plus NAD tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Re-plotting of the data established that AcPyrAD increased the luminescence signal emitted 248.9 % ± 10.7 when displacing the equivalent amount of NAD from the mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). This is also seemingly independent of temperature as similar linearity is obtained when the cycling assay is performed at 35 °C, despite much greater luminescence emitted by both individual NAD and AcPyrAD standards under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). Based on this information we provide details in the Methods of calculations that can be used to determine relative amounts of NAD and AcPyrAD in mixtures. Our quantification as proposed requires that NAD consumed equals the AcPyrAD formed in the solution. Whenever this is not the case, only relative measures on AcPyr base exchange by SARM1 can be achieved (see next paragraph &amp; Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Using the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay to assay AcPyr base exchange on NAD by SARM1</title><p id="P24">The ability to quantify the relative contributions of each nucleotide to light emission in NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay in a mixture of NAD and AcPyrAD, as described above, provides a means to assess a change in the NAD / AcPyrAD composition of a reaction mixture. We previously showed that base exchange on NAD (or NADP) is the major activity <italic>in vitro</italic> when SARM1 is co-incubated with a ~10-fold excess of AcPyr (the hydrolysis and cyclization reactions are both negligible under these conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. We thus reasoned that our modified NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay could be used to monitor SARM1 base exchange with AcPyr. We initially incubated full length wild type SARM1 with 50 μM NAD, plus or minus 2 mM AcPyr free base. Reactions were stopped at multiple time intervals and analyzed using the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit, with each reaction stop corresponding to 2 pmol of NAD in the original reaction, which is within the linear range in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> for the NAD/NADH-Glo™ assay. In parallel, to validate the NAD/NADH-Glo™ results, we performed HPLC analysis on the same samples. Comparable product quantifications and final rate values were obtained for both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), thereby validating our modified NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay method. Indeed, using a one hour incubation to set the initial velocity, we calculated rates of 9.1 milliU/mg for NAD consumption and of 16 milliU/mg for AcPyrAD accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>) using our method that were fully equivalent to recalculations by HPLC based on overall products formed by SARM1 of 8.6 milliU/mg and 13 milliU/mg, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). In absolute terms, an NAD consumption rate that is about half of the reported <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of ~22 milliU/mg is expected from such a SARM1 given the limiting concentration of NAD used (50 μM is close to the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of ~30 μM), as well as the approximately two fold increased rate of AcPyr base exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Remarkably, these data were fully replicated at both 25 °C and 35 °C (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B &amp; S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">AcPyr is also exchanged efficiently by SARM1 on NADP to form AcPyrAD phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], so we tested this using the NADP/NADPH-Glo™ Assay specific for NADP. We saw a time-dependent decrease of luminescence in parallel assays containing NADP with or without AcPyr consistent with comparable NADP consumption and no amplification arising from the AcPyrAD phosphate product formed by SARM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Additional free pyridine bases can affect AcPyr base exchange on NAD by SARM1</title><p id="P26">We next used our method to further investigate SARM1 base exchange. We previously showed that multiple free bases may be exchanged by SARM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and so we selected the free pyridine bases isoquinoline (isoQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], vacor (1-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)urea) and nicotinic acid (Na) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and tested them in competition with AcPyr for effects on the transglycosidation of NAD. Preliminary tests showed that the free bases did not interfere with enzymatic cycling in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay (not shown).</p><p id="P27">NAD consumption was first evaluated by the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay in SARM1 reaction mixtures containing each free base alone, <italic>e.g</italic>. 0.5 mM isoQ, or 0.5 mM vacor, or 5 mM Na. All rates were similar to the NAD alone control at ~10 milliU/mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>, left black lines &amp; right blue lines). HPLC analysis in parallel (not shown) confirmed this rate value, and also that isoQ exchange represented nearly 100% of the activity, as with AcPyr, while Vacor exchange was close to 40%, and Na exchange was less than 3%, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, there were no changes to the total rate of NAD loss under these conditions when SARM1 activity was switched to varying extents from NAD hydrolysis/cyclization to the synthesis of the corresponding dinucleotides isoquinoline adenine dinucleotide, vacor adenine dinucleotide, or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide by base exchange. Importantly, and in contrast to AcPyrAD, these dinucleotides did not act as alternative substrates to NAD in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay.</p><p id="P28">Next, addition of AcPyr 2 mM to reaction mixtures, as above, allowed us to evaluate the individual contributions of each free base to base exchange by SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>, left red lines &amp; right brown lines). We saw the expected rise in light emission with AcPyr alone resulting from AcPyrAD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref> compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), but this was completely blocked by 0.5 mM isoQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, the same concentration of vacor had no affect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). The relatively more water-soluble Na, at a ten times higher concentration of 5 mM, caused only a small and not statistically significant reduction of AcPyrAD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). These data suggest that isoQ is a much better substrate for base exchange than AcPyr, while vacor and Na are not as good. Such a difference arises logically from different affinities in binding to the catalytic pocket of SARM1. Therefore, on this basis, the order of preferential use of these bases for exchange by SARM1 is: isoQ &gt; AcPyr &gt; vacor / Na.</p><p id="P29">Remarkably, this assay could screen likewise any other pyridine base, and assess dose-dependence via titration, provided that no interference exists with amplification by the kit from the base itself or after its conversion into a dinucleotide product.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">In this study, we have developed a novel method for assaying the base exchange activity of SARM1. This method originated from an unexpected observation when utilizing the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay, a commercial kit, to investigate the impact of effectors on NAD consumption by SARM1. Notably, our assay is applicable to all NAD(P)ases which may catalyse exchange reactions with AcPyr, such as CD38 and <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> ADP ribosyl cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. We have subsequently validated our method through HPLC and demonstrated its potential for future adaptations, such as rapid screening using a microplate assay, which offers greater sensitivity and efficiency compared to HPLC. As such, it holds the potential to assess also multiple free pyridine bases in comparison with AcPyr for their efficiency on being exchanged by SARM1.</p><p id="P31">Crucially, the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit employes enzymatic cycling to generate a bioluminescence signal corresponding to the NAD/NADH levels in solution. We proved that acceleration in appearance of this signal at early stages of cycling, rather than the rate of appearance, exhibits linearity over a broader range of NAD amounts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Although the kit manufacturer does not specify the enzymatic mechanism behind this phenomenon, it could potentially stem from a luciferin recycling process occurring at each amplification cycle before triggering a new emission of light. Such a luciferin-regenerating system is known to occur in nature working in the presence of D-cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, our method remains valid regardless of how luminescence is generated or processed, as long as quantification is conducted within established and verified parameters.</p><p id="P32">Our calculation of mixed quantities of NAD and AcPyrAD stems from the differential efficiency of each as substrates for the enzymes involved in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit’s cycling process. This results in 3-4 times greater amplification with AcPyrAD compared to NAD. Under these circumstances, an increase in luminescence corresponds proportionally to the NAD-to-AcPyrAD conversion in mixture, at least within verified limits (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). Additionally, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, this signal changes relative to the molar fraction of the two mixed dinucleotides in solution. This conceptually resembles Raoult’s law for ideal binary solutions of liquids, albeit in our case, the total vapor pressure is replaced by the luminescence emitted during cycling.</p><p id="P33">Our quantification process relies on achieving precise stoichiometry in the conversion of NAD into AcPyrAD. This is not straightforward for multifunctional NAD(P)ases like SARM1, which may catalyze both NAD hydrolysis and cyclization concurrently, thereby generating additional products alongside the exchanged dinucleotide. These additional products, unidentified by the cycling assay, hinder an accurate quantification of the NAD decline solely attributable to base exchange, and thus limit our calculation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Furthermore, when NAD(P)ases exchange multiple free bases simultaneously, the complexity of formed products increases. Ultimately, quantification is feasible only under certain conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. This is a pivotal aspect of this assay method and any future development stemming from it. Other requirements are instead analytical, aimed at minimizing errors. These include controlling the amount of material cycled and ensuring the appropriate temperature for amplification. In our case, a range between 0 and 5 pmol cycled and cycling at 25 °C or 35 °C both proved to be effective.</p><p id="P34">Despite these challenges, our method still allows for relative measurements, which are valuable too. For example, we tailored our SARM1 assay towards a competition between the free AcPyr base and other pyridines. Due to formation of extra dinucleotide products under these conditions, the quantification of AcPyrAD was only relative, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, but still useful in establishing SARM1’s preference for each pyridine base tested. Importantly, these bases could be assayed by this means because they have no direct or indirect effects on enzymatic cycling by the kit. This verification needs to be carried out on a case-by-case basis when testing new compounds. However, it is reasonable to assume that most free pyridine bases, including many current drugs belonging to this class, could function similarly. Even in cases where interference may arise, it may be possible to exploit this in the same way as we have with AcPyr/AcPyrAD, and even if the NAD-analog dinucleotide exhibits lower amplification efficiency compared to NAD in the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay. Interestingly, all these scenarios could potentially expand the functionality of this assay kit for novel applications on base exchanges by SARM1 or similar NAD(P)ases. In this regard, we also reported preliminary evidence that a related Promega kit, the NADP/NADPH-Glo™ Assay, is not exploitable in a similar way as both AcPyrAD and its phosphorylated NADP analog do not act as substrates.</p><p id="P35">Our finding that SARM1 efficiently exchanges isoQ appears surprising given that isoquinoline derivatives are known as potent inhibitors of SARM1 NAD(P)ase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The isoQ derivative, 5-iodo-isoquinoline, inhibits SARM1 strongly, but only after a SARM1-dependent formation of the corresponding NAD-analog dinucleotide, 5-iodo-isoQAD, by base exchange as the effector of that inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Therefore, while the precursor isoQ is an high affinity substrate for SARM1 base exchange, simultaneously reducing both hydrolysis and cyclization reactions without altering the overall rate of NAD consumption ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and unpublished data), isoQAD does not appear to inhibit SARM1 activity in the same way as its iodinated derivative.</p><p id="P36">Finally, the predicted displacement of AcPyr by isoQ from the SARM1 catalytic site, and by extension displacement of vacor, may have clinical implications. Both vacor and AcPyr are well-known neurotoxins that activate SARM1 via their mononucleotides formed <italic>in vivo</italic> by NAMPT, but which are also converted to corresponding dinucleotides by SARM1 base exchange activity <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The potential effects of such dinucleotides on living cells remain unknown but reducing their levels via isoQ supplementation could provide important further insight into the mechanism of AcPyr and vacor neurotoxicity.</p><p id="P37">In summary, the method developed here holds particular promise for investigating the mechanism of action of SARM1 in neurodegeneration with potential applications in the development of therapies for SARM1-related neurological disorders. It may also facilitate future studies on NAD transglycosidation in cells and the NAD analogs generated through base exchange reactions, as well as facilitating the discovery of new substrates or effectors of the SARM1 base exchange activity. The pressing need for assay methods tailored to pyridine bases exchanges underscores the significance of this tool, which may undergo further refinements and enhancements in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P38">The NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit (#G9071, LOT: 0000469987) and the NADP/NADPH-Glo™ Assay kit (#G9081, LOT: 0000472344) were purchased from Promega.

Other chemicals were from Merck (at the highest purity) and used without additional treatment, except for NAD (Merck N1511) and AcPyrAD (Merck A5251) that were both purified by FPLC ion exchange chromatography (IEC). Briefly, a TSK DEAE column (Tosoh, 4.6 x 250mm) was equilibrated at 1 ml/min (see buffers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>), then loaded with each dinucleotide above dissolved in water (0.3-2 micromoles per run) followed by a salt gradient elution. The peaks corresponding to NAD or AcPyrAD were pooled from multiple runs, quantified by UV absorption (ε260nm of 18 mM-1 cm-1 or 16.4 mM-1 cm-1), frozen, and lyophilized. Once resuspended, they were confirmed as 100 % pure by C18-HPLC analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). They were stored at -80 °C until use.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Enzyme preparation</title><p id="P39">Full length human SARM1 (wild type) was expressed in HEK cells, purified on magnetic beads, and quantified by immunoblotting as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].

Luminescence readings were recorded using a Sinergy HT microplate at sensitivity 100, under shaking intensity of 4 (2 sec before every reading), and using a top probe vertical offset of 1 mm. No temperature control was set (so 25 °C) except when specified. Luminescence emitted (RLU) was monitored and recorded typically for 2 hours, then the light outputs were processed by Excel to calculate first derivatives (delta RLU increments per min), usually within the initial ramp of each curve (2-25 min of records).</p><p id="P41">The RLU increments were plotted versus time and linearized. Slopes from best linear segments obtained (RLU/min<sup>2</sup>), for long as possible (&gt;5 min at least), were plotted against pmol of NAD or AcPyrAD or the two of them mixed at different ratios. In some cases, luminescence was referred to as relative percentage of the initial NAD concentration arbitrarily fixed to 100 %.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Enzyme assay &amp; rate calculation</title><p id="P42">Control assay mixtures for NADase were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mM Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 7.5-12 ng/μL full length, wild type SARM1 and 50 μM NAD (or NADP). Assay mixtures for base exchange were set in parallel by further adding 2 mM AcPyr and/or 0.5 mM to 5 mM of other free pyridine bases as indicated in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Reactions were stopped at 1 h intervals (10 μL each) and mixed with ice-cold 1.2 M HClO<sub>4</sub> (+5 μl each to reach 0.4 M final), then centrifuged, diluted to 1:100 in water, and frozen. Subsequent analyses were done by cycling as above or, when needed to validate the proposed assay procedure, by HPLC. So, 4 μl aliquots of each diluted reaction stop (2 pmol of original NAD(P) in mixture) were thawed and cycled, or 400 μl aliquots (200 pmol original NAD) were loaded for C18-HPLC. HPLC data were calculated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] while calculations from cycling were as follows. Pure standards of NAD and AcPyrAD were cycled together with reaction stops (thus under same temperature conditions) and used for converting their luminescence signals.

Indeed, the t0 stop from AcPyr exchanging reactions is used twice, first to get initial NAD concentration in mixture (from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">equation 1</xref>), then to calculate any amount of AcPyrAD formed at subsequent time stops (from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">equation 2</xref>). Worth mentioning, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">equation 2</xref> above allows correct quantification only when no other products than AcPyrAD are formed by the NAD(P)ase in parallel, and this depends essentially on assay conditions, substrates used, etc. Furthermore, in AcPyr exchanging reaction mixtures, once AcPyrAD formed amounts are set from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">equation 2</xref>, corresponding NAD amounts are calculated by difference between initial NAD and formed AcPyrAD. All enzyme rates are referred to the Unit (U) of activity that corresponds to 1 μmol/min of substrate consumed or of all products formed by SARM1 at 25 °C.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P44">Data linearization and R-squared analysis were performed using the Microsoft Excel software.

Additionally, SARM1 products such as ADPR and cADPR are not measured by the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay kit and this impairs both stoichiometry and quantification. As a result, precise measurement of the rate is only attainable when base exchange overwhelmingly dominates the catalytic process. Equally crucial for precision is to ensure that reactions for amplification of standards and samples occur at the same temperature.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref

(<bold>C</bold>) Replotting of panel B data versus absolute amounts of AcPyrAD in each set. This shows linearity of the luminescence emitted and invariability of the slopes obtained by amplifying different total amounts of NAD plus AcPyrAD (thus 1, 2, or 5 pmol). (<bold>D</bold>) Replotting of panel B data after conversion into relative percentages of initial NAD values (thus 1, 2, or 5 pmol, each fixed to 100%) versus relative percentages of AcPyrAD. Linearization highlights a value of approximately 250 % that corresponds to the relative increase of the luminescence signal emitted by cycling reactions at 25 °C for any amount of AcPyrAD ≤ 5 pmol when directly replacing NAD in the mixture. Blue lines graphically illustrate the parameters and the rational of the method employed for rate calculation (fully detailed in Methods and Discussion). Data in B, C and D are color-coded and show R<sup>2</sup> values ≥ 0.99 in all cases after linearization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193137-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>A typical reaction of AcPyr base exchange on NAD catalysed by SARM1 evaluated by NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay at 25 °C and C18-HPLC in comparison</title><p>Reactions containing recombinant SARM1 and 50 μM NAD with or without 2 mM AcPyr were set, incubated, and processed as reported in Methods. Thereafter, 4 μl aliquots of reaction stops, diluted 1:100, were analysed by cycling at 25 °C at the timepoints indicated (<bold>A</bold>), together with parallel analysis by C18-HPLC of 400 μl aliquots of the same diluted samples (<bold>B</bold>). Luminescence (RLU) recorded after cycling was processed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> to calculate RLU/min<sup>2</sup> values and then the levels of NAD consumed in the control (A right, continuous blue line) or of AcPyrAD formed in the mix with NAD plus AcPyr (A right, brown line). Calculations were made using formulas in Methods and the indicated standard slopes A and B. NAD amounts in the mix with NAD plus AcPyr (A right, dotted blue line) were calculated by difference (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) given the whole SARM1 rate here represented by AcPyr base exchange only under these conditions. Alternatively, for panels in B, substrates and products were separated by C18-HPLC and quantified from their peak areas using the standard values as indicated. This led to independent calculation of final concentrations in both original mixtures (B right panels) to make a comparison. The rates for full-length wild type SARM1 were calculated from NAD consumed or the indicated products formed within the first one hour of incubation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193137-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>AcPyr base exchange on NAD by SARM1 in the presence of isoquinoline, vacor, and nicotinic acid</title><p>Reaction mixtures containing recombinant SARM1 and 50 μM of NAD alone (<bold>A</bold>) or plus 0.5mM isoquinoline (<bold>B</bold>) or plus 0.5 mM vacor (<bold>C</bold>) or plus 5 mM nicotinic acid (<bold>D</bold>) were set. Each mixture was duplicated with and without 2 mM AcPyr. Reaction stops at the timepoints indicated were cycled at ~27 °C and the RLU plots processed to get RLU/min<sup>2</sup> values. Then, NAD amounts in (-) AcPyr mixtures and AcPyrAD amounts in (+) AcPyr mixtures were calculated, respectively, from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">2</xref> in Methods, using the indicated standard slopes A and B. Note that NAD levels in (+) AcPyr mixtures are shown in A (dotted blue line) but missing in other panels where extra formed products are present and not measured by this assay; consequently, AcPyrAD levels in B, C, and D are only relative measures (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Data are from two independent experiments (mean ± SD; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01). Rates of full-length wild type SARM1 were calculated from NAD consumed, or AcPyrAD formed in A, within selected time windows as shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193137-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
