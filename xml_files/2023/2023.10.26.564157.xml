This is under the control of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase that is regulated by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). The Checkpoint prevents the APC/C from recognizing Cyclin B1, the essential anaphase and cytokinesis inhibitor, until all chromosomes are attached to the spindle. Once chromosomes are attached, Cyclin B1 is rapidly degraded to enable chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. We have a good understanding of how the SAC inhibits the APC/C, but relatively little is known about how the APC/C recognises Cyclin B1 as soon as the SAC is turned off. Here, by combining live cell imaging, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution, biochemistry, and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy, we provide evidence that the rapid recognition of Cyclin B1 in metaphase requires spatial regulation of the APC/C. Using fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, we find that Cyclin B1 and the APC/C primarily interact at the mitotic apparatus. We further show that this is because Cyclin B1, like the APC/C, binds to nucleosomes, and identify an ‘arginine-anchor’ in the N-terminus as necessary and sufficient for binding to the nucleosome. Mutating the nucleosome binding motif on Cyclin B1 reduces its interaction with APC/C and delays its degradation, and cells with the mutant, non-nucleosome-binding Cyclin B1 become aneuploid, demonstrating the physiological relevance of our findings. Together, our data demonstrate that mitotic chromosomes constitute a platform to promote the efficient interaction between Cyclin B1 and APC/C and ensure the timely degradation of Cyclin B1 and genomic stability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Protein degradation imposes unidirectionality on the cell cycle through the rapid degradation of key mitotic regulators (e.g. Cyclin B and Securin) in metaphase. This ensures that chromosome segregation and mitotic exit are rapid and effectively irreversible, but the corollary is that to maintain genome stability, degradation must be coordinated with chromosome attachment to the mitotic apparatus. To achieve this, the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) monitors kinetochore attachment to microtubules and prevents the Anaphase Promoting Complex / Cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase from recognising Cyclin B and Securin until all chromosomes have attached to the spindle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alfieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Once all the chromosomes have attached to the spindle, the APC/C rapidly recognises Cyclin B1 and Securin to drive sister chromatid separation and exit from mitosis. Although we know many of the components of the machinery and their molecular structures, we do not understand how they interact in living cells to generate rapid and responsive pathways.</p><p id="P4">The APC/C is activated at nuclear envelope breakdown by the phosphorylation of the APC/C subunits Apc1 and Apc3 and dephosphorylation of its co-activator, CDC20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fujimitsu and Yamano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Steen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yamano, 2019</xref>). These enable CDC20 to bind and activate the apo-APC/C, but it is then kept in check by the SAC. The SAC inhibits the APC/C by generating the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">McAinsh and Kops, 2023</xref>), that binds tightly to the APC/C as a pseudo-substrate inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">2011</xref>). When bound to the MCC, APC/C is unable to recognise and ubiquitinate Cyclin B1 and Securin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thornton and Toczyski, 2003</xref>) although it is still able to recognise early targets such as Cyclin A2 and Nek2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alfieri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">den Elzen and Pines, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Di Fiore and Pines, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Geley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Once all chromosomes are properly attached to spindle microtubules the SAC is silenced and the APC/C can ubiquitylate Cyclin B1 and Securin, whose proteolysis by the 26S proteasome activates the Separase protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holland and Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Stemmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) to cleave cohesin and allow sister chromatids to separate.</p><p id="P5">Strict temporal inhibition of the APC/C is necessary to prevent premature chromosome separation that may lead to the gain or loss of chromosomes by the daughter cells, but single-cell imaging has shown that Cyclin B1 rapidly begins to be degraded as soon as all the chromosomes are attached to the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jackman et al., 2020</xref>), which ensures the rapid exit from mitosis and could conceivably be required for the fidelity of chromosome segregation. But how the APC/C rapidly recognises its substrates when the SAC is silenced is not understood. One potential clue comes from our previous work showing that Cyclin B1-GFP disappears first from chromosomes and centrosomes compared with the cytoplasm in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>). Moreover, fractionation experiments on HeLa cells show that the APC/C may be more active on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sivakumar et al., 2014</xref>). In Drosophila, Cyclin B1-GFP first disappeared from centrosomes and then from the spindle and the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huang and Raff, 1999</xref>). These observations indicate that the APC/C might be spatially regulated in mitosis, which could ensure that Cyclin B1 is removed first from specific locations to coordinate the events of anaphase and mitotic exit. Yet despite these indications, direct evidence for spatial regulation of the APC/C has been missing.</p><p id="P6">Here, we provide direct evidence for the spatial control of APC/C activity. Using live cell imaging and fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) we have assayed the binding between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C and found that the pattern of their interaction correlates with that of Cyclin B1 degradation. Moreover, we have identified the molecular mechanism promoting this localised interaction: we found that the N-terminal of Cyclin B1 contains a nucleosome-binding motif that regulates Cyclin B1 chromatin localisation. Preventing Cyclin B1 from binding to chromatin delays its degradation and cells become aneuploid; timely degradation can be restored by recruiting a non-nucleosome-binding Cyclin B1 mutant back to the chromatin. Our data indicate that nucleosomes facilitate the interaction between Cyclin B1 and APC/C to promote the rapid degradation of Cyclin B1 during metaphase and safeguard genomic stability.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cyclin B1 degradation is spatially regulated during metaphase</title><p id="P7">We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to tag both alleles of Cyclin B1 in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells with the mEmerald fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barbiero et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Cubitt et al., 1998</xref>).

In agreement with our previous results using ectopically expressed Cyclin B1-FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>), measuring the fluorescence intensity of Cyclin B1 at different subcellular locations showed that Cyclin B1 disappeared first from the chromosomes, spindle and centrosomes and only later in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Two non-exclusive mechanisms could account for the faster disappearance of Cyclin B1 in specific places: Cyclin B1 could be rapidly displaced, or it could be proteolysed <italic>in situ</italic>. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the disappearance Cyclin B1 fluorescence in cells treated either with MG132 to inhibit the proteasome or with a combination of the APC/C inhibitors APCin and proTame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sackton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Verma et al., 2004</xref>) to inhibit ubiquitylation.

This indicated that the pattern of Cyclin B1 disappearance in metaphase is linked to its degradation and not to its rapid displacement.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Analysing Cyclin B1-APC/C interaction by Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy</title><p id="P9">Our results indicated that the proteolysis of endogenous Cyclin B1 is spatially regulated, therefore we set out to determine the mechanism responsible. This could originate from the differential activity of either the APC/C or the proteasome, or both. The APC/C was previously reported to be more active at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>) or chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sivakumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Topper et al., 2002</xref>), although these studies came to contradictory conclusions; therefore, we focused first on the interaction between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C. To measure protein-protein interactions with subcellular resolution in living cells, we turned to fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), which we recently validated as a tool to study the cell cycle machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barbiero et al., 2022</xref>). FCCS requires that the whole population of proteins under investigation be fluorescently tagged, therefore we used CRISPR/Cas9<sup>D10A</sup> gene-editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) to introduce the mScarlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>) fluorescent protein into both alleles of the APC/C subunit APC8 in our RPE-1 CCNB1-mEmerald<sup>+/+</sup> cells and the parental RPE-1 cells. PCR and sequencing confirmed biallelic insertion in three independent clones of both the parental RPE-1 cells and RPE-1 CCNB1-mEmerald<sup>+/+</sup> cells (data not shown).</p><p id="P10">We first characterised the APC8-mScarlet cells to determine whether the tag perturbed APC/C function. APC8-mScarlet was enriched in the nucleus of interphase cells; during mitosis it was weakly enriched at centrosomes but otherwise homogeneous throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A, B</xref>), in agreement with previous immunofluorescence data of other APC/C subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Acquaviva and Pines, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Huang and Raff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Tischer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Tugendreich et al., 1995</xref>). The mScarlet tag did not significantly alter mitotic timing in either unperturbed mitosis or in cells treated with low doses of the microtubule poison paclitaxel to prolong the SAC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Collin et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, tagging APC8 had no significant effect on cell growth rate or ploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Although immunoblotting indicated that the protein levels of APC8-mScarlet were about 70% lower than wild type APC8 in parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 E, F</xref>) this did not significantly affect the rate of Cyclin B1-mEmerald degradation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>). To assess APC8 incorporation into the APC/C, we immunodepleted APC4 and measured how much APC8 was not co-immunoprecipitated and found there was no difference between APC8 and APC8-mScarlet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, F</xref>). This indicated that the mScarlet tag did not interfere with APC8 incorporation into the APC/C. In agreement with this, FCS analysis of APC8-mScarlet in interphase and mitosis indicated that APC8-mScarlet behaved as a single, slow diffusing species with a diffusion coefficient of 6.435 ± 1.789 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (Mean ± SD) and hydrodynamic radius of ∼ 14 nm which is comparable to the theoretical hydrodynamic radius of APC/C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>).

In agreement with its SAC-dependent degradation there was no cross-correlation between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C in G2 phase cells but there was a strong interaction in metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). We used these data to calculate the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) between Cyclin B1-mEmerald and APC8-mScarlet at different subcellular locations and found that the interaction between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C had lower K<sub>D</sub> at the chromatin, spindle and spindle poles than in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B, C</xref>). We obtained similar results in cells arrested in metaphase with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>). To validate our FCCS assay we measured cross correlation in the presence of the small molecule inhibitors APCin and proTAME that impair CDC20 substrate recognition and CDC20 binding to the APC/C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sackton et al. 2014</xref>). In the presence of APCin and proTAME, the K<sub>D</sub> between Cyclin B1-mEmerald and APC8-mScarlet in the spindle, on chromosomes and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) increased to a level similar to that found in the cytoplasm of either treated or untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The residual cross-correlation in the presence of APCin and proTAME indicated that there was a second, lower affinity mode of binding between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C, which was consistent with Cyclin B1-Cdk1-Cks binding to phospho-APC/C through the Cks protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Patra and Dunphy, 1996</xref>; Rudner and Murray, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shteinberg and Hershko, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Sudakin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">van Zon et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with this, there was low level cross-correlation between Cyclin B1-mEmerald and APC8-mScarlet in prometaphase cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2E, F</xref>), and this interaction was independent of the Cyclin B1 D-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2G</xref>) and unaffected by treatment with a combination of APCin and proTAME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We concluded that FCCS revealed two major modes of binding between Cyclin B1 and APC/C in dividing RPE-1 cells: a high affinity, D-box-dependent interaction that was spatially constrained to the spindle and chromosomes, and temporally restricted to metaphase; plus a second, D box-independent, lower affinity interaction in both prometaphase and metaphase cells that was likely dependent on Cks.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Chromatin is the major site of Cyclin B1 degradation in human cells</title><p id="P14">Our data indicated that Cyclin B1 degradation and its interaction with the APC/C was favoured on the chromosomes, spindle and centrosomes, but the relative contribution of each subcellular location to Cyclin B1 degradation was unclear. To answer this, we asked whether Cyclin B1 would disappear faster on chromosomes spatially separated from the metaphase plate. We generated cells in which some chromosomes remained at the spindle poles by inhibiting the CENP-E (Centromeric Protein E) kinesin motor protein that is required for these chromosomes to congress to the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bennett et al., 2015</xref>). If individual chromosomes are important for Cyclin B1 degradation, then the degradation of Cyclin B1 should be faster on polar chromosomes than in the surrounding cytoplasm. Cells treated with a CENP-E inhibitor arrested in mitosis with polar chromosomes and stable levels of Cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). When we treated CENP-E inhibited cells with the MPS1 inhibitor Reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) to inactivate the SAC, Cyclin B1 disappeared earlier from polar chromosomes than it did from the surrounding cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

We tested whether APC/C could bind nucleosomes using an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay with recombinantly reconstituted APC/C-CDC20 and Nucleosome Core Particles (NCP). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), increasing concentrations of APC/C-CDC20 with an N-terminal fragment of Cyclin B1 (Cyclin B1<sup>NTD</sup>) shift the NCP, indicative of the formation of an APC/C-CDC20:NCP complex.

Twenty years ago, we and others first showed that Cyclin B1 degradation is not homogeneous across the cell: in human cells it disappears earlier from chromosomes, spindle, and centrosomes than from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>). Here, we have elucidated the mechanism behind this. We have found that the pattern of Cyclin B1 degradation depends upon it binding to the acidic patch on nucleosomes through its N-terminal arginine anchor, and this cooperates with the Destruction box to enhance Cyclin B1 ubiquitylation by the APC/C and timely degradation in metaphase.</p><p id="P34">Combining CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with FCCS has enabled us to measure dissociation constants <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, for the first time to our knowledge, we have measured the <italic>in-vivo</italic> dissociation constant between Cyclin B1 and APC/C. This varies between 140 nM at the centrosomes, and 60 nM in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Although these values are likely to be slightly lower than the actual dissociation constant due to technical limitations of FCCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barbiero et al., 2022</xref>), they are close to the estimated 63 nM obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> using sea urchin Cyclin B1 and fission yeast APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Carroll and Morgan, 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Our conclusion that binding between Cyclin B1 and the APC/C is promoted by nucleosomes is consistent with previous data in human cell lysates showing that APC/C ubiquitination activity toward Cyclin B1 is enhanced in chromatin fractions compared to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sivakumar et al., 2014</xref>), and that DNA and other polyanions may act as a selectivity barrier facilitating the ubiquitination of D-box-containing substrates over lower-affinity substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mizrak and Morgan, 2019</xref>). Our data provide support for the idea that nucleosomes themselves act as a scaffold to bring together APC/C and Cyclin B1. Although APC/C and Cyclin B1 both bind the acidic patch, they are unlikely to compete <italic>in vivo</italic> given the abundance of nucleosomes (∼ 6.23 µM) when compared to the much lower concentrations of both Cyclin B1 and APC/C (about 100 nM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beck et al., 2011</xref>). Our data indicate that nucleosome binding is important for the APC/C to bind productively to Cyclin B1 as soon as the SAC is turned off. We find that a Cyclin B1 mutant that is unable to bind nucleosomes still localises to the spindle and centrosomes but fails to engage APC/C in a D-box dependent manner and its degradation is delayed. Thus, an intriguing possibility is that binding to nucleosomes might expose or optimally present the D-box to the substrate binding site of the APC/C. The D-box itself must have some role in interacting with chromosomes because R42 of the D-box also contributes to chromosome localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pfaff and King, 2013</xref>), our unpublished observation); for example, it is possible that R42 is important to bridge nucleosome-bound Cyclin B1 with nucleosome-bound APC/C.</p><p id="P36">An alternative hypothesis to explain the role of chromatin in Cyclin B1 degradation would be that nucleosomes increase the local concentration of Cyclin B1 and APC/C to enhance the kinetics of Cyclin B1 ubiquitylation. Congruent with this idea, we observed that recruiting Securin to the chromatin is sufficient to enhance its degradation and changing the topology of the interaction between Cyclin B1 and nucleosomes (by moving the LANA peptide from N- to C-terminus) has no evident effect on Cyclin B1 degradation.</p><p id="P37">We do not know whether nucleosome binding is a conserved mechanism to mediate APC/C interaction with Cyclin B1. The N-terminal sequence of Cyclin B1 diverges in non-vertebrates and plants but it is generally arginine-rich, which could mean that nucleosome binding is also conserved. One exception is Drosophila, where the N-terminal arginines of Cyclin B1 are not conserved and it is notable that Drosophila Cyclin B1 first disappears on the spindle poles and only later on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huang and Raff, 1999</xref>). Although we did not directly investigate the role of spindle and centrosome localization of Cyclin B1 in its degradation, we found that removing Cyclin B1 from the chromatin delays its degradation throughout the cell, arguing that chromatin is the major site of Cyclin B1 degradation in human cells. This raises the question why Cyclin B1 also appears to be degraded faster at the centrosomes and spindle. A possible explanation is fast diffusion of Cyclin B1 between centrosomes, spindle and chromosomes, such that Cyclin B1 could be rapidly ubiquitylated by a chromosome-bound pool of APC/C and then degraded anywhere between the chromatin and the spindle apparatus. Our FCCS data, however, show that Cyclin B1-APC/C complexes are present at centrosomes and spindle. Thus, we favour an alternative model for Cyclin B1 degradation where nucleosomes promote the formation of a Cyclin B1-APC/C complex that can diffuse to other subcellular locations.</p><p id="P38">Although an arginine anchor is not present in other cyclins, nor in securin and NEK2A, other APC/C substrates such as KIFC1 (Kinesin-like protein KIFC1), BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1), TPX2 (Targeting protein for Xklp2), and ZC3HC1 (Zinc finger C3HC-type protein 1), are known to bind the nucleosome acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Skrajna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Song and Rape, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Stewart and Fang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">von Klitzing et al., 2011</xref>), which raises the possibility that they share an APC/C interaction mechanism similar to that of Cyclin B1. The APC/C also has an important role in G1 phase and in neurodifferentiation, where nucleosome-binding could be important to target chromatin-associated proteins such as Ki67 (Antigen Kiel 67), Top2a (DNA topoisomerase IIα) and the chromosomal passenger complex that accumulate in the cerebellum of APC/C mutant mice and G1 phase of CDH1-mutant RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ledvin et al., 2023</xref>). Multiple mechanisms for chromatin recruitment of the APC/C may exist, however: Oh and colleagues reported that APC/C binding to promoters of ES cells depends on WDR5 to regulate G1 transcription in human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Oh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P39">We found that mutating the arginine anchor of Cyclin B1 results in aneuploidy in otherwise genomically stable RPE-1 cells. That we were not able to introduce the mutation in cells with p53 further indicates that the Cyclin B1 arginine anchor is important for genome stability. Although we cannot formally exclude that aneuploidy originates from lower levels of Cyclin B1 in these cells, it is likely that the reduced levels of Cyclin B1 may be a compensatory mechanism rather than the root cause of aneuploidy. In early mitosis, securin and Cyclin B1 prevent the premature segregation of chromosome by directly binding and inhibiting separase; therefore, lowering the overall levels of Cyclin B1 would guarantee low Cdk1 activity during mitotic exit despite delayed degradation of Cyclin B1. At the end of metaphase, separase must quickly cleave the cohesin ring that holds chromatids together to ensure chromosome segregation is synchronised with mitotic exit. If Cyclin B1 degradation is delayed this will prolong separase inhibition by Cyclin B1, which would result in chromosome segregation defects and consequent aneuploidy.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Cell culture and drug treatment</title><p id="P40">hTERT RPE-1 FRT/TO cells were cultured in F12/DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) medium supplemented with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (Gibco), 0.35% sodium bicarbonate, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and Fungizone (0.5 µ/ml).
