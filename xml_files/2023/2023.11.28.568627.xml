Targeting TAMs holds potential against solid tumors, but effective immunotherapies require testing on immunocompetent human models prior to clinical trials. Here, we develop an in vitro model of microvascular networks that incorporates tumor spheroids or patient tissues. By perfusing the vasculature with human monocytes, we investigate monocyte trafficking into the tumor and evaluate immunotherapies targeting the human tumor microenvironment. Our findings demonstrate that macrophages in vascularized breast and lung tumor models can enhance monocyte recruitment via TAM-produced CCL7 and CCL2, mediated by CSF-1R. Additionally, we assess a novel multispecific antibody targeting CCR2, CSF-1R, and neutralizing TGF-β, referred to as CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab, on monocytes and macrophages using our 3D models. This antibody repolarizes TAMs towards an anti-tumoral M1-like phenotype, reduces monocyte chemoattractant protein secretion, and effectively blocks monocyte migration. Finally, we show that the CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab inhibits monocyte recruitment in patient-specific vascularized tumor models. Overall, this vascularized tumor model offers valuable insights into monocyte recruitment and enables functional testing of innovative therapeutic antibodies targeting TAMs in the tumor microenvironment (TME).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Immunotherapies constitute an expanding therapeutic armamentarium against cancer by harnessing the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, not all cancer patients can benefit from immunotherapy for various reasons, one of which is that the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) impedes the infiltration of effector T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a myeloid cell population that is prominent in the TME in various kinds of solid tumors including but not limited to breast, lung carcinoma, and melanoma, and they are associated with a poor patient outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. TAMs regulate several early cancer metastasis processes, including invasion, angiogenesis and intravasation by secreting various inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8), as well as angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TAMs also help tumor cells (TCs) evade immune responses by suppressing infiltrating immune cells such as T lymphocytes by secreting transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Initially, TAMs were considered to originate from bone-marrow derived monocytes and recruited through the vasculature but the mechanisms regulating this process are not clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. It has been shown that blocking the (CC-motif) ligand 2/CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCL2/CCR2) axis, which regulates monocyte chemotaxis, does not deplete TAMs completely, suggesting that other mechanisms also regulate monocyte recruitment. Several cancer treatments that target macrophage recruitment have recently been tested, such as the neutralization of the CCR2 receptor governing monocyte chemotaxis, re-education of macrophages (MØs) from a pro-tumoral M2-like to anti-tumoral M1-like phenotype, as well as targeting the CD47-“eat me not” switch, which enhances tumor cell phagocytosis by MØs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Several reports show that the overall survival of animals or patients is improved with treatments targeting TAMs in combination with immune checkpoint blockade, such as anti-programmed death-ligand 1/ Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1/PD-1) or anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In the age of immunotherapy, finding preclinical models that recapitulate human immune systems and the immunogenicity pathways that regulate tumor survival are key to developing and validating novel therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, due to the complex mechanism of therapeutic antibodies and immune response, transgenic humanized animal models or conventional 2-dimensional (2D) human cell cultures are not sufficient to predict patient drug efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, high-throughput, image-based, real-time analysis of immune cell infiltration and immune-vascular-tumor cell interactions in real-time is challenging with animal models, while 2D cell cultures often oversimplify the biological systems and cannot mimic human physiology accurately. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) have been developed to overcome these limitations, enabling the development of 3-dimensional (3D) cultures of different cell types and allowing detailed characterization of critical biological interactions within microfluidic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In particular, MPSs can allow for the incorporation of engineered vasculature to mimic the natural blood vessel networks found in living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In cancer research, these vasculature-on-a-chip models have been used previously to study angiogenesis and tumor-vasculature interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and to evaluate drug efficacy and toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, interaction between immune and TCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, or cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In order to study human immune cell recruitment and evaluate candidate immunotherapies, it is crucial to create perfusable microvascular networks (μVNs) that enable more physiologic immune cell trafficking. Previous microfluidic-based μVNs have been developed to deliver compounds and immune cells using microfluidic flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Compared to other in vitro vasculature models, self-assembled μVNs are capable of creating smaller vessels with a typical diameter of 40 μm, allowing them to create a confined environment closer to what immune cells experience in vivo and exhibit barrier properties that better mimic physiological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These devices have been used to study vascular biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, tumor metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, tumor-vasculature interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and immune cell transendothelial migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Integration of tumor spheroids and organoids within vascular networks adds to the physiological complexity of a system and allows the recapitulation of the TME. However, challenges arise when tumor and endothelial cells are seeded together within the same gel. The formation of μVNs in the presence of tumor cells often leads to thinner, non-perfusable vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Previous approaches have grafted tumor spheroids on top of vascular beds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, the vascular bed has a typical thickness of 100-1000 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which limits the capability to image cellular events at the interface between the vasculature and the tumor spheroid using confocal microscopy due to light scattering inside the 3D culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Thus far, no study has demonstrated grafting patient’s tumoral tissues or tumor spheroids within a well encircled by preformed vasculatures, rather than atop them. This arrangement would enable co-culturing of microvasculature networks and large tumor spheroids (approximately 800 μm-1 mm in diameter) while also facilitating both 3D spatial and temporal imaging using confocal microscopy. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study has recapitulated the full cascade of immune cell recruitment, including immune cell extravasation and directional migration of extravasated immune cells toward a tumor in vitro. To date, dozens of therapies have been proposed to target human immune cell trafficking pathways in solid tumors and such a pre-clinical human model is needed to validate these before embarking on time consuming and costly clinical trials.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we address the need for advanced in vitro models that accurately recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment and capture immune-vasculature-tumor cell interactions. We hypothesize that by using a novel vascularized 3D human TME model containing TAMs, we can recapitulate monocyte recruitment from the vasculature through a chemotaxis-dependent process and test novel therapeutics targeting these pathways. To overcome the challenges of integrating fully formed networks and tumor spheroids, we employ an open-top device called an integrative vascular bed (iVas), which provides a preformed perfusable microvasculature with a defined hollow space for spheroid or tissue sample insertion. We develop a new quantification method to characterize cell migration from the vasculature and utilize this platform to study the impact of TCs on macrophage polarization and monocyte recruitment using breast and lung cancer cell line-based tumor models. Finally, we conduct antibody (Ab) treatment screening on this platform and confirm the efficacy of a multispecific monoclonal antibody that has branches targeting CCR2 and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) on MØs, in blocking monocyte recruitment by patients’ tumoral tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tri-culture spheroids containing macrophages (MØs) recruit monocytes extravasating from the vasculatures</title><p id="P7">To create a vascularized tumor model for a monocyte recruitment study, endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts (FBs) were seeded inside fibrin gels within a microfluidic chamber that had an open-top channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). A meniscus trap method employing surface tension was used to create an empty well within the gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), allowing self-assembled μVNs to form around it without growing into it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Immune cells were then perfused into the device through the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>), and a tumor spheroid composed of TCs, FBs and MØs (TFM spheroids) was inserted into the well. The viability of cells inside the tumor spheroids on the day of insertion ranged from 60 to 80%, depending on the cell lines, as was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of dissociated spheroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 A-D</xref>). The mean diameter of a random sampling of TFM spheroids for all 5 cell lines used was 844+/-127 μm, N=20.</p><p id="P8">The vasculature remained functional for at least 2 days after adding a tumor spheroid, confirmed by 10kDa blue Dextran perfusion on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Notably, in devices with a triculture tumor spheroid with MDA-MB-231, FBs, and MØs at day 2 (231 TFM), we observed an increasing number of monocytes migrating from the vasculatures to the spheroid compartment over days 1 to 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), while in control devices with no tumor spheroid in the center well, the number of monocytes increased more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Importantly, spheroids without MØs (231 TF) recruited fewer monocytes compared to those with MØs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We next set out to determine the timing of monocyte recruitment to tumors within our human iVas TFM model. Using a lab-generated FIJI image processing plugin, we counted on days 1, 2, and 3 for the number of monocytes in each of the three compartments: 1) Luminal: those that were still inside the vascular lumens, 2) Extravasated: those had extravasated from the vasculature into the ECM, and 3) Recruited: those that had migrated into the tumor compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Analysis of monocyte distribution and counts showed a decrease in “luminal” and an increase in “extravasated” and “recruited” compartments over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, H, I</xref>). We observed that the total number of recruited monocytes in the 231 TFM devices was higher than in the control devices and 231 TF devices on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Overall, the distribution analysis suggests that the presence of TAMs in the 231 TFM devices increased the recruitment of monocytes from the microvasculature between day 1 and 2 but did not influence the early presence of monocytes within the vascular lumen or their ability to extravasate from the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TAMs express M2-marker CD163 and secrete CCL2 and CCL7 via a CSF-1R-dependent pathway</title><p id="P10">We hypothesized that MØs in the 231 TFM tri-culture adopt a TAM phenotype and release chemokines to attract monocytes from the vasculature towards the TCs. Previous studies have shown that TAMs exhibit increased expression of M2 markers, and targeting CSF-1R could reprogram TAMs toward an M1-like phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated MØs from 231 TFM spheroids and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell and macrophage aggregates (231 TM) confirmed higher expression of the M2 surface marker CD163 compared to control M0 MØs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6, A and B</xref>). Additionally, MØs in 231 TFM exhibit higher CD206 and CD163 expression compared to other TFM co-cultures with breast (MDA-MB-468) or lung cell lines (H2009, A-427, A-594) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6, D and E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To explore the role of CSF-1R, we treated 231 TFM spheroids with anti CSF-1R Ab, CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 or multispecific CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab (anti-CSF-1R, anti-CCR2 bispecific Ab, with TFG-β trap) led to a decrease in CD163 expression in TAMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6, Dii and Eii</xref>). Furthermore, qPCR data revealed elevated M-CSF expression in MDA-MB-231 TCs and M0 MØs treated with MDA-MB-231 culture media (231 TCM MØ) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>). CSF-1R is predominantly expressed by M0 MØs and TAMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S7C</xref>). Overall, MØs in 231 TFM exhibit an M2-like TAM phenotype expressing CD163, which can be influenced by targeting CSF-1R.</p><p id="P12">Given that 231 TFM tumor spheroids recruit more monocytes than 231 TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>), we hypothesized that TAMs play a unique role in the release of monocyte chemoattractants. To investigate this, we performed qPCR on sorted TCs, FBs, and MØs from the tri-culture tumor spheroids to examine the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, and CCL13) known to induce monocyte chemotaxis through the CCR2 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Ai</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. MØs in the 231 TFM spheroids showed significantly higher expression of these monocyte-chemoattractant proteins, particularly CCL2 and CCL7, compared to TCs and FBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2Bi-iv</xref>). Furthermore, normalization of gene expression revealed that 231 TFM MØs express more CCL7 and have a phenotype closer to M0 and M2 MØs (IL4, IL10) than M1 MØs (IFN<italic>γ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Moreover, treatment of 231 TFM spheroids with CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 or CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Aii</xref>) resulted in the repolarization of MØs to an M1-like phenotype characterized by higher expression of CD80, and reduced CCL2 and CCL7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Conversely, MØs in MDA-MB-468 TFM triculture (468 TFM) displayed decreased expression of various CC-chemokines compared to the M0 and 231 TFM MØs, along with some M1 marker expression such as CD80 or IL-1β, suggesting that the heterogeneity of TCs could affect MØ heterogeneity and chemokine secretion through CSF-1R.</p><p id="P13">To investigate the impact of different TC types on CCL2 and CCL7 secretion specifically by MØs, we conducted experiments using M0 MØs from multiple healthy donors treated with tumor cell-conditioned media (TCM) derived from MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, A-549, H2009, and A-427, with or without various CSF-1R-targeting molecules, including BLZ945, CSF-1R Ab, and CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab for the MDA-MB-231 cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Aiii</xref>). We observed higher expression levels of CCL2 and CCL7 in MDA-MB-231-TCM-treated MØs (231_TCM_MØs) than MDA-MB-468 (468_TCM_MØs), A-427 (427_TCM_MØs), A-549 (549_TCM_MØs) and H2009 TCM MØs (549_TCM_MØs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Di and ii</xref>). Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CCL7 are decreased in 231_TCM_MØs treated with BLZ945, CSF-1R Ab, and CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab. Meso scale discovery (MSD) assays also confirmed high CCL2 protein levels in 231 TCM MØ culture media compared to other conditions in 2D well plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). The presence of a higher concentration of CCL2 in the 3D spheroid culture media from 231 TFM compared to other cell line cultures or CSF-1R treatment conditions was confirmed by MSD assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). To verify whether CCL2 and CCL7 are the main CC-chemokines responsible for monocyte recruitment, protein secretion profiles of co-culture 231 TF, 231 TFM, and 468 TFM spheroids were characterized by using 71-plex Luminex® assays. We found that when compared to 231 TF and 468 TFM, 231 TFM spheroids secrete more CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL5 than 231 TF or 468 TFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). However, monocytes express CCR2 (receptor of CCL2 and CCL7) and not CXCR2 (receptor to CXCL5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). Therefore, CCL2 and CCL7 are the main CC chemokines secreted by the 231 TFM tumor spheroids that induce monocyte recruitment from the vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Endothelial cells and TAMs increase monocyte migration in microfluidic chemotaxis assays</title><p id="P14">To determine the source of chemotactic factors responsible for monocyte recruitment from the vasculature, we conducted experiments using a simplified setup that allowed us to quantify chemotaxis. We utilized a three-channel microfluidic device (AIM Biotech, Inc.) that enables us to quantify unidirectional monocyte migration from one media channel into a central gel region, both with and without an endothelial monolayer at the gel and media channel interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). We measured monocyte migration into the gel for the following conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Ai-vi</xref>): i) without an endothelial monolayer in the absence of chemoattractant, ii) with an endothelial monolayer in the absence of chemoattractant, iii) with 231_TCM_MØ conditioned media (MCM) in the opposite channel, iv) with MCM on both sides of the gel, v) with either M0 or 231_TCM_MØs in the channel opposite from monocytes and vasculature, vi) with 231_TCM_MØs in a similar configuration than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Av</xref> with the addition of the CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab, anti-CCR2 Ab or chemical CCR2 antagonist to examine their effects on monocyte migration.</p><p id="P15">Our experiments effectively simulate both transendothelial migration and chemotaxis. Here, the presence of the EC monolayer is pivotal in aiding the differentiation of monocytes to MØs and in enhancing their motility. To compare monocyte migration in devices with and without an EC monolayer, we analyzed the positions of monocytes within the gel channel in all devices, combining them into a single image. We observed that in devices without EC monolayers, monocytes were mostly confined to the interface region between the media and gel channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3Bi</xref>). In contrast, in devices with endothelium, monocytes were located further away from the interface.</p><p id="P16">To quantify monocyte migration from one channel to the other within the same device on day 2, we calculated the percentage of migrating monocytes. The device with an endothelial monolayer exhibited a higher percentage of migrating monocytes in the opposite channel compared to the device without an endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3Bii</xref>). We confirmed the essential role of EC monolayers to activate monocytes and promote their migratory behavior using conventional transwell assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Additionally, we examined changes in surface expression after transmigration and found that the expression of CD206, a macrophage marker, was higher in monocytes migrating into a fibrin gel coated with an endothelial monolayer compared to cells migrating into a fibrin gel alone or the original monocyte population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). These models reveal that ECs not only enhance monocyte migration but also accelerate their phenotypic changes during transmigration. This underscores the significance of incorporating an EC barrier in in vitro monocyte chemotaxis experiments.</p><p id="P17">To determine the impact of TAMs on monocyte migration, we added MCM in both media channels or the opposite channel to create a chemotactic gradient. We observed that the percentage of migrating monocytes in the condition with a TAM CM gradient was significantly higher compared to the control device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Besides monocytes’ chemotaxis caused by a chemoattractant gradient, another potential reason for the increased migration could be an overall enhanced multi-directional monocyte motility, commonly termed chemokinesis. To discern whether there was an increase in random motility due to chemokinesis, we compared the percentage of migrating monocytes in the conditions where both channels of the same device had TAM CM and where there was a TAM CM gradient. The results showed a higher percentage of migrating monocytes in the setup with the TAM CM gradient, confirming that monocyte migration from the endothelium is governed by chemotaxis along a chemoattractant gradient, rather than chemokinesis. Consequently, the random motility coefficient D of monocytes in the control device without TAM CM or MØs is apparently relatively independent of the concentration of chemoattractants. We could thus calculate a chemotaxis coefficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">equation E.S8</xref>) in devices having a chemoattractant source, such as TAMs, using the mean value of D calculated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">equation E.S7</xref> for monocytes in the control device. When chemotaxis coefficients are close to 0, the monocyte migration profile is similar to that caused by random motility in the absence of chemoattractant. We found that in 231_TCM_MØ devices, monocytes exhibited a higher chemotaxis coefficient compared to monocytes in control devices or devices with M0 MØs or 231_TCM_MØ devices treated with various Ab drugs that block CCR2 receptors on monocytes, including CCR2 chemical antagonist, CCR2 Ab and CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).

These fragments were then grafted onto the iVas device via the open-top well. In monocyte recruitment assays using vascularized devices containing S1 patient tissue fragments of different amounts (0.1 or 0.01 mg) in the central hole, both 0.1 mg and 0.01 mg S1 tissues recruited significantly more monocytes compared to the control. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the recruitment capability between the 0.01 mg and 0.1 mg tissues from the same patient tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

PDOTS are primarily composed of TCs expressing EpCAM or panCK, along with some immune cells expressing CD45, including MØs marked by CD68+ and a minimal presence of fibroblasts marked by Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The cytokine profiles secreted by different NSCLC patient tissue samples in off-chip culture media demonstrated similarities to triculture TFM spheroid models, with high expression of M-CSF and CCL2 from most samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Remarkably, although we demonstrated previously that these NSCLC tumor cells do not directly mediate MØ overexpression of CCL2 or CCL7 directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), the TFM tri-culture spheroids still secrete M-CSF, CCL2, and CCL7 and induce monocyte recruitment, suggesting that depending on the tumor cell lines used, the tri-culture can potentially support monocyte recruitment through various alternative mechanisms. Furthermore, samples from patients 1 and 3 samples, which respectively displayed no recruitment (non-responsive) and active recruitment (responsive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), exhibited distinct inflammatory cytokine profiles, particularly in terms of M-CSF and CCL2.

Together our results suggest that our human pre-clinical iVas model can recapitulate complex tumor microenvironments from patient tumors to determine the therapeutic potential of novel interventions targeting monocyte recruitment, which is a key step in replenishing growing tumor TAM populations and a determinant of poor clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">We describe here a microfluidic-based tissue model, termed iVas, that incorporates a functional perfusable vasculature surrounding a hollow space. This unique design allows for the integration of tumor spheroids or organoids suspended in a matrix of choice, which enables the study of immune cell recruitment to tumors from perfused vasculature and the screening of new immunotherapies targeting this process. Unlike previous vascularized tissue models that employed an open-top for tumoroid insertion, our system utilizes surface tension during gel loading to create an empty space surrounded by fully-formed perfusable μVNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This approach ensures the perfusability of μVNs before co-culturing them with tumor samples, preventing competition for local nutrients that could otherwise occur and enables high-resolution 4D imaging (both spatial and temporal) of the tumor samples, vasculature, and immune cell interactions. This innovation distinguishes iVas-based tumor models from existing models and enhances its capacity for incorporating human tissues into well-surrounded, fully-formed perfusable μVNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Perfusable networks surrounding tumor tissues enable natural introduction of immune cells to extravasate and migrate toward the tumor. Confocal imaging provides real-time 3D visualization of the vasculature, tumor, and migrating immune cells, allowing quantification of their trafficking and migration across blood vessels towards the tumor. Using this system, we observed the activation of monocytes after extravasation, which aligns with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. After transendothelial migration, monocytes acquire a macrophage phenotype. This transformation increases their motility and migration towards a chemotaxis source. Importantly, we could recapitulate a mechanism by which TAMs are recruited to a tumor. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, we propose secrete cytokines such as M-CSF that bind to CSF-1R, resulting in the expression of an M2-marker CD163 by monocyte-derived resident MØs. These MØs then secrete CCL2 and CCL7, attracting newly-extravasated monocytes from the vasculature. Although CD163+ MØs, CCL2 and CCL7 are associated with cancer metastasis and poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and high CCL2 levels are found in various cancer types, including breast cancer and some NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, blocking the CCL2/CCR2 axis alone does not impede tumors from recruiting monocyte-origin resident MØs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Using this immunocompetent, vascularized tumor-on-a-chip platform, we demonstrate the effect of a novel Ab drug that targets human monocyte recruitment. This multispecific Ab, binding to CSF-1R and CCR2, effectively reduces monocyte migration by targeting monocyte chemotaxis through the CCR2 axis and by blocking TAMs from secreting monocyte-chemoattractant proteins. Previous in vivo studies have shown that TAM recruitment is dependent on the CCL2/CCR2 or CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, the interplay between these two axes in the human TME has not been extensively explored. Targeting both CCL2/CCR2 and CSF-1/CSF-1R axis is therefore relevant to a tumor that overexpresses M-CSF, CCL2 and other chemokines that bind to CCR2 such as CCL7. Finally, our results from different patient tumor samples and cell lines exhibit distinct monocyte recruitment patterns and corresponding cytokine profiles, which emphasizes the potential of this vascularized tumor model to characterize the tumor microenvironment more accurately across heterogeneous patient populations. These findings highlight the potential to personalize immunotherapies targeting MØs and monocyte-recruitment based on the specific characteristics of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="P25">Tumor cells, MØs, and fibroblasts can release TGF-β into the microenvironment.

Afterward, the device was returned to a horizontal position during gelification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1.4</xref>).

Once filled, the device had an empty central well region that was used later to introduce TCs to the system. The gel solution remaining in the central well after the initial injection formed a thin layer of gel on the bottom of the well. We let the liquid in the central holes evaporate for 5 minutes inside a biosafety cabinet, then 5 minutes inside an incubator. Hence, owing to the hydrophobic nature of fibrin, the mesh structure of the matrix establishes an interface between air and liquid. This interface effectively serves as a barrier, preventing liquid from entering the hole and inhibiting the formation of microvasculature openings in the gel surface surrounding the well. Any cells remaining inside the well died afterward as they did not receive any media. Different amounts of media, 160 μl on one side and 40 μl on the other side, were added to the side channels to generate an interstitial flow across the gel to accelerate network formation. Due to the surface tension of the gel-air interface, the medium was prevented from filling the central well. Therefore, the vascular networks formed around but not into the well. One day later, EC suspension (1 M/ml) was added to the two media channels and the device was tilted so that the cells could be deposited on the sidewall of the gel.

First, we filled the gel channel with fibrin gel. Next, after obtaining M0 MØs by differentiating monocytes by M-CSF as described previously (vide supra), we generated tumor-conditioned MØs by culturing M0 MØs in MDA-MB-231 cell culture media for 1 day. The MDA-MB-231 tumor cell culture media (TCM) was obtained by culturing a confluent T150 flask of MDA-MB-231 in 20ml serum-free RPMI for one day and reconstituted with 10% FBS before use. Either M0, M2 (IL4, IL10-treated) or TCM-treated MØs were suspended in 20 μl RPMI 10% FBS with a concentration of 3.33×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml and perfused into one side of a device. The next day, on the other side of the device, we created a GFP-EC monolayer by seeding ECs suspended in 20 μl Vasculife (2M cells/ml). The device was tilted so ECs can accumulate on the gel-media channel interface. Freshly isolated, CellTracker™ Deep Red dye (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) -labeled monocytes were suspended in Vasculife supplemented with 10% FBS (10% FBS VCL) at 3.2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and perfused in the EC-coated channel one day later and allowed to accumulate on the gel-media channel interface by tilting the device. After 2 hour incubation, 100 μl of 10% FBS VCL media are then added to the device. To check whether monocytes are more migratory due to chemotaxis or chemokinesis, in an IdenTx-3 device, we performed chemotaxis assays of monocyte migrating from an endothelial monolayer-coated media channel under a gradient of TAM culture media (CM) or having a constant concentration of TAM CM everywhere in the device or a control device without TAM CM. We defined migrating monocyte percentage as the percentage of monocytes that migrate to the other half of the device from the side where monocytes were first introduced over the total of cells in the gel channel. Each AIM device has 5 region of interests (ROIs). Data were computed from all ROIs in all studied devices.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Calculation of chemotaxis coefficient</title><p id="P40">A detailed description of our chemotaxis coefficient calculation can be found in the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI S2</xref>). Briefly, we apply the Keller and Segel (1971) chemotaxis model to our device geometry and calculate the diffusion coefficient in the absence of a chemoattractant source and chemotaxis coefficients of each condition with a chemoattractant source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P41">To evaluate monocyte migration within fibrin gel with and without transendothelial migration, fibrin gel was introduced into the gel channel of IdenTx-3 chips, with the option to include or exclude an endothelial monolayer. Monocytes were then perfused from a single media side channel, where they adhered to the side wall and subsequently migrated into the fibrin gel. We overlapped 15 regions of interest (1.3mm×2.2mm) from 3 devices, picturing the positions of monocytes within the gel channel. Next, we compared the chemotaxis coefficients of monocytes in devices that have EC monolayer with or without MØs or Ab drugs. First, from the Keller and Segel equation of chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Equation E.S1</xref>), we subtracted the contribution of random mobility obtained from the control device with EC monolayer, and we obtained the chemotaxis coefficient of monocytes in different devices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Equation E.S8</xref>). The random mobility was supposed to be constant in all devices, following the characterization of chemokinetic contribution in the random mobility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Equation E.S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Image acquisition, image processing and analysis</title><p id="P42">The 3mmx3mm region of interest of the tumor spheroid and the surrounding microvasculature were acquired using FV1000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Olympus, PA, USA). 4x, or 20x objective lens (Olympus) were used to image devices via FluoView v4.1 software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). A Fiji plugin was used to count the number of monocytes in the device. For devices with vasculature networks, we quantified the number of total cells within the region of interest (a square region 3mmx3mm with the gel cavity in the middle). We also counted the number of monocytes within the spheroid/tissue compartment at the central hole using image processing and normalized it to the total number of cells in the region of interest of 3mmx3mm.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Quantification of monocyte recruitment</title><p id="P43">To characterize the recruitment percentage of monocytes from the vasculatures into the hole of an example Z-stack image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A and S3B</xref>), we collapsed the z-stack (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>) and used the vasculature channel to classify the area of the hole. We performed the same number of dilate and erode operations erode of ImageJ software on the collapsed z-stack thresholded image of the vasculatures to close all small dark areas representing the extracellular matrix between vasculatures, without closing the central hole that has a larger size, then inverted the resulting image to obtain the approximated area of the central hole. Afterward, we dilated the central hole area and overlapped it with the original thresholded vasculature mask using the operation AND to obtain the area of the hole surrounded by the vasculatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). Monocytes were detected using ImageJ Find Maxima plugin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>) and the recruited monocytes were obtained by applying the operation AND on the hole and monocyte binary images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Protein analysis</title><p id="P44">We analyzed chemokine secretion by the tumor spheroids using either Human Cytokine/Chemokine 48-Plex or 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Luminex assay performed by Eve Technologies (Alberta, Canada) or Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD, MD, USA) assays in-house. 1 day after making spheroids by seeding 13K MDA-MB-231 TCs, 40K FBs, and 13K M0 MØs together (TFM) in a low-adhesion 96-well plate, RPMI 10% FBS was changed for all wells.

These TAMs, characterized by the expression of CD163, then express autocrine M-CSF along with cytokines such as CCL2 and CCL7. Upon extravasation, monocytes are activated by endothelial cells, leading to increased motility and expression of the macrophage marker CD206. These activated monocytes respond to chemotactic signals released by TAMs and migrate into the tumor microenvironment. This process contributes to the establishment of a vicious cycle of myeloid recruitment supporting tumor cell growth and facilitating later metastasis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191876-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
