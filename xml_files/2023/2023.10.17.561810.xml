High-resolution imaging has been attempted to explore the dynamics of these processes and, recently, multiplexed imaging has profiled cell states by achieving a comprehensive acquisition of spatial protein information from cells. However, the specificity of antibodies is still compromised when visualizing activated signals. Here, we developed Precise Emission Canceling Antibodies (PECAbs) that have cleavable fluorescent labeling. PECAbs enable high-specificity sequential imaging using hundreds of antibodies, allowing for reconstruction of the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling pathways. Additionally, combining this approach with seq-smFISH can effectively classify cells and identify their signal activation states in human tissue. Overall, the PECAb system can serve as a comprehensive platform for analyzing complex cell processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cell states are dependent on various extrinsic factors for activating signal transduction. To understand cell states, responsive signaling pathways in cells have been profiled by analyzing post-translational modification of each signaling molecule. The approach to track individual cell responses to extrinsic factors, such as secreted proteins and intercellular interactions, has been to use imaging-based techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, these techniques have limitations when simultaneously measuring the full spectrum of activated signaling pathways. Recent advances in single-cell omics technologies, such as single-cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis can predict the responsive signaling pathway responses by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, extracting the dynamics of multiple signal activation in a cell is still challenging.</p><p id="P3">Multiplexed immunofluorescence has been developed to acquire information from multiple proteins and it has the potential to visualize signal activation in processes such as nuclear transport and post-translational modification of proteins. Several techniques have been established that involve the stripping or quenching of directly labeled fluorescent antibodies, followed by repeated staining with different antibodies. For instance, the methods of Ranjan et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and Sequential Indirect Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) strip antibodies after indirect immunofluorescence, while Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CycIF) achieves sequential staining by inactivating fluorescent dyes using reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Notably, 4i and CycIF can detect activated signaling molecules. However, these methods use harsh conditions to remove fluorescence derived from fluorescence-labeled antibodies, which can potentially damage samples. This makes it difficult to achieve sufficient multiplexity to analyze cell states. Recently, antibodies conjugated with single-stranded DNA oligos that are detected them with complementary single-stranded DNA probes in a fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH)-based method have been established and widely adopted. After reacting a cocktail of oligo DNA-labeled antibodies with a sample, sequential staining is achieved by sequentially reacting and stripping fluorescent DNA probes that are complementary to the sequence on each antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) However, the oligo DNA probes often non- specifically interact with nuclear proteins making it necessary to find optimal combinations of antibodies and oligo DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Therefore, oligo DNA-labeled antibodies have been limited to the detection of cell surface antigens or the use of highly specific antibodies. Challenges therefore remain in the development of high-resolution, sequential staining techniques for visualizing signal transduction.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we developed novel fluorescent-dye-labeled antibodies. The antibodies detected activated signals and nuclear proteins with specificity, and high multiplexity was achieved by gentle cleaving conditions that maintain the quality of the sample. Furthermore, through a reconstructive approach of single-cell analysis with automation, the activation of signaling pathways and changes in cell states were elucidated, enabling tissue-specific abnormalities to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of Precise Emission-Canceling Antibodies: PECAbs</title><p id="P5">To achieve sequential immunofluorescence with specificity, we designed an antibody attached to a fluorescent dye via a linker containing a disulfide bond (SS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). Antibodies were reacted with DBCO-SS-NHS ester and then with azide-modified fluorescent dyes to label the antibodies through the SS linker. We investigated the feasibility of cleaving fluorescent signals using antibodies against histone H3, an abundant basic nuclear protein. Anti-histone H3.1 primary antibodies were labeled with Alexa488 via an SS linker (SS-488) as described above. Specific staining patterns were observed in nuclei of IMR90 human diploid fibroblasts. The fluorescence was erased after treatment for 30 minutes with the reducing agent, TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine], in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). The loss of fluorescence is attributed to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds in the linker and in the antibody molecules. To evaluate the efficiency of SS cleavage, we compared signals of anti-H3.1 antibodies directly labeled with Alexa 488 and with SS-488. TCEP treatment (10 mM) after immunofluorescence, decreased the fluorescence of SS-488 labeled antibodies to unstained levels, but no significant reduction in directly labeled antibodies was observed. These results indicate that fluorescence labeling of antibodies via SS linkers enables efficient cleaving of the fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). These antibodies were named “Precise Emission Canceling Antibody” or PECAb. Oligo-DNA-labeled antibodies bind non-specifically in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>); therefore, we verified whether SS-fluorescent dye labeling affected these non-specific reactions. Comparison of the staining patterns was performed using PECAb and oligo DNA-labeled antibodies. Both aTubulin for cytoplasmic fiber structures and pAKT for signal transduction were immunostained by using PECAb as secondary antibody. Conversely, oligo DNA-labeled Fab and read-out probe alone showed non-specific signals in the nuclei, whereas it was minimum on the PECAb-Fab stained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). These results indicate that PECAb-based staining offers an advantage for high-specificity analysis of nuclear and signal transduction proteins. However, in multiplexed immunofluorescence, residual PECAbs might interfere with the detection of proteins aggregating within fine structures. To evaluate the specificity of PECAbs, we evaluated staining of the distinct nuclear structure, senescence- associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). SAHFs are 1–2 μm microstructures that can be detected in the nucleus of IMR90 ER:Ras cells following treatment with 4OHT for 6 days to induce senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). SAHF exhibits a hierarchical heterochromatin structure of core H3K9me3 surrounded by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Therefore, we validated the simultaneous detection of these layered structures through Sequential Immunostaining (SeqIS) with PECAb using 23 antibodies, including 21 against histone modifications and two against PolII post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). We observed hierarchical staining patterns of histone modifications within Hoechst-dense regions in senescent cells that were not observed in proliferative cells without RasG12V induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S1</xref>). Clear signals were detected for all 23 antibodies, with H3K9me3 positioned at the SAHF core detected in the 4<sup>th</sup> cycle, surrounded by H3K27me3 detected in the 5<sup>th</sup> cycle, and H3K36me3, an euchromatin marker, detected in the 12<sup>th</sup> cycle, consistent with the previously reported pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In addition, subnuclear quantitative analyses revealed four chromatin domain types based on epigenetic profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S2</xref>). We profiled the structures to confirm their applicability to high-resolution analysis. Selecting five nuclei each from proliferative and senescence IMR90 cells, we defined Hoechst-dense regions as domains divided into three layers, and quantified signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S2A</xref>). The quantified results were projected on the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S2B</xref>). Each point indicates a single domain. Domain profiles were grouped into four clusters, with Cluster 1 being enriched in chromatin domains derived from senescent cells. Variations were further observed within Cluster 1, and by comparing chromatin domain images with distant UMAP distances within Cluster 1, significant differences were observed, particularly in the aggregation of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">D</xref>). These observations indicate minimal interference among antibodies. Taken together, these results indicate that the PECAbs can be used for a multiplexed immunofluorescence with higher specificity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Construction of sequential staining system using PECAbs</title><p id="P6">In sequential staining, data are acquired through multiple rounds of immunofluorescence and erasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). To minimize processing differences among samples during a high number of rounds, we established an automated fluidics device, which enables the simultaneous processing of multiple samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To evaluate the staining efficacy and reproducibility of PECAbs on the device, duplicated IMR90 ER:Ras cells were independently cultured and separately seeded onto the same chip. SeqIS was performed for 21 cycles, resulting in the acquisition of 56-plex stained images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S3B</xref>). The images indicated the following localization patterns: LaminB1 on the nuclear envelope, aTubulin on cytoplasmic fiber structures, TOM20 on cytoplasmic mitochondrial structures, PML on nuclear spots, and GOLIM4 on the Golgi apparatus. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>). This result demonstrated the functionality of sequential staining with PECAbs using the automated device.</p><p id="P8">Quantitative analysis was performed to assess the technical reproducibility of SeqIS. Images were aligned using Hoechst staining as the reference, and erased images were used to subtract from stained images of the same cell for each cycle to compensate for the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S3C</xref>). Accumulation of background was not observed across the 21 cycles of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S3D</xref>). Data were acquired from 1,531 and 1,520 cells for each replicate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S2E</xref>), and comparison of the median between replicates revealed a remarkably high correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2F</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) indicated consistent clustering between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2G</xref>). These results demonstrated that SeqIS on the automated device produced a dataset with high reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Profiling Cell State Dynamics Using Quantitative Data from SeqIS</title><p id="P9">Single-cell data of sufficient throughput and depth allows cell states to be classified and dynamics to be extracted. Therefore, we assessed whether the cell state dynamics can be visualized using quantitative SeqIS. The IMR90 oncogene-induced senescence model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>), involves dynamic changes in the cell state and signal transduction. The cells were fixed in the following time-points after RasG12V induction: “Proliferative: day 0”, “Transition: day 3”, and “Senescent: day 6” and used for the SeqIS staining. We employed 206 antibodies to analyze the DNA damage response, apoptosis, senescence, and signaling related to senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S4A</xref>). To assess whether the sequential staining with 206 antibodies captured changes in cell states, representative plex staining images for 56 of the antibodies were visually inspected at day 0 and day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>). Comparison of images from day 0 and day 6 samples indicated the features of senescence, such as increased HMGA1 and decreased LaminB1 staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Furthermore, cytoplasmic compartmentalization of autophagy-related protein, SQSTM1, and nuclear localization of pATF2 were observed on day 6, revealing changes in other proteins associated with senescence.</p><p id="P10">Next, images were quantified to classify cell states. We assessed 9,002 cells from duplicate datasets on days 0, 3 and 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S4B</xref>). Although background signals were accumulated beyond 20 cycles in channels 488 and 594 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S4C</xref>), the data were quantified and offset using erased data. To evaluate the effect of accumulated antibodies on staining in later cycles, staining images of LMNA in the 56<sup>th</sup> cycle, H3.1 in the 54<sup>th</sup> cycle, and aTubulin in the 73<sup>rd</sup> cycle were compared with their 1st cycle images. In this 73-cycle experiment, antibody accumulation did not prevent the detection of structural features of these proteins in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig. S4D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The staining signals were quantified to profile cell states. Comparison of quantitative data for days 0, 3, and 6, showed different protein patterns for each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S4E</xref>). Moreover, UMAP revealed a clear separation of cell states for days 0, 3, and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), with reproducibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S4F</xref>). These results show that quantitative values from SeqIS images can effectively separate cell states.</p><p id="P12">To examine the viability of using 206 antibodies to classify the cell state, the influence of antibody number on separation performance was assessed. Silhouette coefficients were calculated to compare the number of antibodies and cohesion within clusters. The results indicated that an increase in coefficients was dependent on the number of antibodies for all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Additionally, randomly selected antibody sets of 25, 50, and 100 antibodies were created, and silhouette coefficients were calculated 100 times. Analysis of Day 0 and 3 samples individually using 25 antibodies demonstrated separation performance exceeded that of the 206-plex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, when days 0, 3, and 6 were analyzed together, the 100 antibodies surpassed the score of 206-plex in only 3 out of 100 trials. These results show that a smaller number of antibodies can separate cell states by selection, but that antibodies above 200 can provide stable separation to unbiased.</p><p id="P13">To evaluate the dynamics of state changes, pseudotime was constructed by using the quantified dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3 F and G</xref>). Senescence markers were then plotted along the pseudotime. Factors with low quantitative values and exaggerated variability because of scaling were removed by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig.S3E</xref>). With the progression of pseudotime, characteristic features of senescence were observed, including decreased levels of LMNB1 and increased levels of p21 and HMGA1. This demonstrated that pseudotime reconstructed from the data reproduced the temporal changes of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p><p id="P14">With pseudotime accurately representing temporal changes in cell states, the possibility of visualizing the signal dynamics was explored by plotting signaling molecules along pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3I</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), NOTCH1 was decreased around pseudotime 0.7, corresponding to the peak of day 3 cells. This was accompanied by a decrease in the level of pSMAD3, a downstream component of TGFβ signaling. Conversely, upon NOTCH reduction, transient activation of ATM and AKT was observed. NOTCH1 signaling has been reported to directly suppress the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>); therefore, we analyzed spatial correlation of NOTCH1 and pATM. NOTCH1 and pATM were spatially exclusive on day 3 and day 6 but not on day 0, and the correlation between pATM and senescence marker, p21, increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3H</xref>). This suggests that the reduction of NOTCH might be associated with pATM activation during senescence. Taken together, these results demonstrated that analysis of signal transduction dynamics involved in cell state changes can be conducted using pseudotime reconstructed from SeqIS staining data.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Signal Transduction Activation by Tracking the Dynamic Changes</title><p id="P15">We assessed time resolution of cell state dynamics using SeqIS, which simultaneously acquires information about cell state and activation of signal transduction. We employed an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) system using A549 cells, where signal transduction is rapidly activated by adding the ligand TGFß(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Initially, to examine the time point of altered gene expressions during EMT, A549 cells were treated with TGFβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). Cells were obtained at 0, 0.5, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours, and then analyzed by scRNAseq. Based on bulk correlation and single-cell analysis using UMAP, gene expressions changed from 12 hours after TGFβ treatment. Cells treated with TGFβ for 0.5 hours showed weak genome-wide transcriptional changes that were little different from transcription at 0 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4B</xref>). SeqIS was then performed for samples at 0, 0.5, 24 and 96 hours using a 27-plex PECAb set that included signaling activation and EMT markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C</xref>). Representative staining images from 13/27 plex were then visually inspected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D</xref>). The 0.5-hour sample exhibited increased downstream pSMAD3 staining compared with that at 0 hours, capturing signal transduction activation. Furthermore, compared with levels at 0 hours, decreased levels of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased levels of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin, VIM, and FN1, were observed at 24 and 96 hours, indicating that sequential staining images captured the process of signal transduction activation in EMT. Subsequently, images were quantified to separate cell states. Duplicate data from 0, 0.5, 24, and 96 hours resulted in the detection of 5,274 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S5A</xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">B</xref>). Phosphorylated proteins indicating signal transduction activation were increased at 0.5 hours, along with pSMAD3 activation. Non-phosphorylated protein values, such as those for EMT markers, showed changes after 24 hours. Furthermore, clustering by UMAP separated cell states at 0, 24, and 96 hours, with 0 hours and 0.5 hours also being distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results were consistent with the Silhouette results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref> and demonstrated that selection of antibody sets that detect signal transduction activation allows for the separation of short-term cell state changes, which is challenging using conventional protein or RNA datasets. Following the separation of cell states between 0 and 0.5 hours, the ability to visualize their dynamic changes using the reconstructed data system was verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4G</xref>). With cells aligned to pseudotime, peaks of the cell populations at 0 and 0.5 hours were observed around pseudotime 0.4 and 0.6–0.7, respectively, indicating that pseudotime reflected actual sampling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4H</xref>). To further analyze the dynamics of signal transduction before cell state changes, activated signal transduction molecules were plotted against the pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4I</xref>). Factors with low quantitative values and exaggerated variability because of scaling were removed through visual inspection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S5C and D</xref>). Following the addition of TGFβ, an increase in downstream pSMAD3 along with pseudotime progression was observed. Furthermore, an increase in the level of pSMAD1/5 after the increase in pSMAD3 level, activation of pERK and pFAK, and an early transient decrease in the level of pELF2a were observed.

To address this, we established a multimodal approach by combining the SeqIS with single-cell spatial transcriptomics single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (Seq-smFISH).</p><p id="P17">Sequential staining requires the strategy of staining followed by cleaving with a reducing agent. This may cause sample damage and loss of RNA. To address this, we first evaluated sample preservation through repeated cleaving treatment using the IMR90 cell line. Cleaving with TCEP allowed for the preservation of 90% of cells after 50 rounds of cleaving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>). Under the quenching conditions used for CycIF (using H2O2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), 34% of cells remained, while the antibody stripping conditions used for 4i (3 M GCUrea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>)resulted in the preservation of 9% of cells. These results showed that cleaving using TCEP preserved the cells better than other canceling methods. The effect of canceling on cell structures was evaluated using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>). Samples subjected to repeated TCEP cleaving showed clear nuclear and mitochondrial structures similar to samples subjected to repeated PBS treatment, whereas samples subjected to repeated H2O2 quenching resulted in the loss of organelle structures. The 3 M GCUrea-treated cells could not be prepared for an electron microscopy sample because the cells were degraded. TCEP cleaving preserved over 70% of RNA in cells compared with that preserved after PBS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). To assess the detectability of RNA remaining after cleaving, Seq-smFISH was performed on IMR90 cells subjected to 50 rounds of TCEP cleaving. The RNA spot counts for <italic>EHF1, HEY1,</italic> and <italic>ITGB1BP2</italic> were significantly reduced after 50 rounds of TCEP cleaving, but over 70% of spot numbers were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5D</xref>) (<italic>EHF1:</italic> 77%, <italic>HEY1:</italic> 82%, <italic>ITGB1BP2:</italic> 70%), consistent with the reduction in RNA levels after erasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>). These results indicate that repeated TCEP cleaving exhibited RNA preservation compared with other quenching conditions.</p><p id="P18">Next, Seq-smFISH was performed after SeqIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>). To reduce background signals stronger than single-molecule RNA spots, which were observed in IMR90 cells and several tissues, protein clearing was necessary after the SeqIS. However, retrieving samples from the microfluidics chip is required to perform protein-clearing experiments after the sequential staining. To overcome this, we fixed a detachable thin film to the chip spacer, allowing samples to be peeled off the chip after sequential staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5F</xref>). The detached samples can be adhered to coverslips again using double-sided tape and subjected to Seq-smFISH. On an automated device, two IMR90 cell samples were cultured independently on the detachable chip. SeqIS was repeated for three rounds (9- plex), followed by 17 rounds of Seq-smFISH to detect the expression of 34 genes. Visual inspection of the acquired images revealed characteristic signal patterns, such as strong signals at the nuclear membrane indicative of H3K9me3, signals from inactivated X chromosomes representative of H3K27me3, and fiber structures associated with FN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5G</xref>). Subsequently, Seq-smFISH was performed to detect RNA spots. This revealed different patterns of spots for the detected genes and demonstrated the acquisition of protein and RNA data from the same sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5H</xref>). UMAP projection was applied to the simultaneously acquired immunofluorescence and FISH data, showing one cell populations both in immunofluorescence and FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5I</xref>), indicating both immunofluorescence and FISH showed reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5I</xref>). Based on these results, the integration of SeqIS and Seq-smFISH demonstrated that factors not detected by antibodies could be simultaneously analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Detection of Cell Activation States in Tissues</title><p id="P19">To demonstrate the ability to detect cell state changes at the single-cell level in tissues, we evaluated a spatial multimodal approach combining SeqIS with Seq-smFISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). A uterine carcinosarcoma, composed of mixed carcinoma and sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), was chosen for analysis. To investigate differences between the carcinoma and sarcoma components of the tissue, samples with different ratios of carcinoma and sarcoma cells (carcinoma:sarcoma = 30:70, 10:90, and 0:100) were first analyzed by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6B</xref>). Correlation between samples based on gene expression profiling was decreased depending on the ratio of carcinoma components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6C</xref>). Samples with 30% and 0% carcinoma components were then selected to extract the differentially expressed genes, and 220 genes for which Seq-smFISH probes can be designed, were extracted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S6A</xref>). Using these gene sets, GSEA was performed using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to interpret their biological roles. This revealed a prominent EMT signature (adjusted P value = 0.003241) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">figS6B</xref>), indicating EMT in the carcinosarcoma tissue. Subsequently, Seq-smFISH was performed for carcinoma 30%/sarcoma 70% samples using the identified gene set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S6C</xref>). Based on the quantitative Seq-smFISH data, cells were classified cells into five states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6E</xref>). To examine the spatial localization by state, clustered cells were mapped in space using tissue coordinates. Clusters 1 and 2 showed a tendency for localized cell aggregation within each cluster, and these clusters exhibited adjacent spatial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6F</xref>). Clusters 3, 4, and 5 did not exhibit localized cell concentration and were spatially excluded from Cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6F</xref>). Comparing the spatial expression of EMT-related gene sets with the classified clusters, only <italic>EFEMP2</italic> exhibited similar distribution patterns with Cluster 2; no other genes had distinctive distribution of spatial expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6G</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To examine in detail the characteristics of the separated clusters, SeqIS was performed using markers for epithelial and mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S6C</xref>) and with activated signal transductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6H</xref>). Cluster 2 exhibited high levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, while Clusters 3, 4, and 5 showed high levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, FN1, and VIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6I</xref>). Cluster 1 exhibited lower E-cadherin levels compared with Cluster 2 and showed activation of signal transduction pathways that induce EMT, including pSMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6I</xref>). The proximity of Cluster 1 to Cluster 2 suggested that EMT was activated in Cluster 1. Based on these results, we classified Cluster 2 as epithelial, Clusters 3, 4, and 5 as mesenchymal, and Cluster 1 as an EMT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S6D</xref>). The expression of signal transduction and epithelial and mesenchymal markers was profiled in regions with high occupancy of Clusters l and 2 (dashed white outline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6J</xref>). In Cluster 1, regions with activated signal transduction, such as pSMAD1/5, pSTAT3, and p-p38, exhibited activation in areas with E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig.S6E</xref>). The levels of ZEB1, a transcription factor that activates EMT, were higher in the regions with activated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6L</xref>). EMT induction suppresses apoptosis, but the expression of the apoptosis-related gene, DAP3, was low in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6L</xref>). These results indicate EMT is activated in Cluster 1 adjacent to the epithelial cell Cluster 2. Collectively, the spatial multi-omics integration of SeqIS and Seq-smFISH detected activated cell state changes in tissue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we developed PECAbs, antibodies labeled with fluorescent molecules via SS linkers that can be efficiently cleaved of their fluorescent signals. By minimizing nonspecific binding within the nucleus and sample damage, we achieved high-specificity and high-multiplexed imaging of molecules, including signal transduction components, in cell lines and tissues. With our automated system, the PECAb system has the potential to become a standard technology in the evolving field of spatial omics.</p><p id="P22">PECAb labeling presented issues similar to conventional fluorescence labeling of antibodies. In our approach, a two-step crosslinking procedure was performed to add fluorescent molecules using commercially available reagents. The addition of excessive crosslinkers led to loss of antibody specificity resulting from denaturation. However, we prepared PECAbs without optimizing crosslinking conditions for each antibody. Approximately 1-2 fluorescent molecules were bound to each IgG. While this resulted in weaker signals during imaging compared with indirect immunofluorescence that allows signal amplification, it likely helped to circumvent antibody denaturation. Further improvement in detection sensitivity can be achieved by optimizing various parameters, such as increasing the number of fluorescent molecules per labeling site or using brighter fluorophores.</p><p id="P23">We performed sequential staining using up to 206 PECAbs. This highly-multiplexed staining approach has the potential for antibody interference with subsequent sample epitopes. Other approaches to highly multiplexed staining, in which all antibodies react together, such as CODEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) or ImmunoSABER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), may lead to different types of interference compared with sequential staining methods. Interference in the PECAb system may be caused by antibody accumulation in later staining cycles. Therefore, we carefully chose the antibody staining order with low staining efficiency antibodies for the initial cycles and high efficiency antibodies for the latter cycles to enable sequential detection of specific staining patterns. For example, a-Tubulin staining in the 73<sup>rd</sup> cycle showed the same fiber-like structure as in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">fig. S4D</xref>). While interference from individual immunofluorescence may occur with similar frequencies across cells and targeted molecules, this would have minimal effect on the relative quantitation-based analysis conducted in this study. However, to obtain absolute quantitative data, alternative approaches such as efficiently removing antibodies, in addition to cleaving fluorophores, might be necessary.</p><p id="P24">In this study, we used antibody panels that mainly represented signal transduction activations; however, direct measurements of cell-cell interactions will require an expanded variety of antibodies targeting ligands and receptors. Current spatial omics technologies determine cell types and analyze their spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), while methods for direct analysis of cell-cell interactions are primarily based on the expression patterns of ligand and receptor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Measurements of actual cell-cell communication remain challenging. While the PECAb-based system enables specific and potentially direct measurements, higher-resolution imaging in the current system may lead to prolonged imaging times and reduced throughput. We expect that improvements in imaging technology will help overcome this limitation.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P25">Antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P26">IMR90 ER:RAS (oncogene HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> fused to the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain; ER:RAS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) were kindly provided by Masashi Narita (CRUK-CI).

Then 0.4 μL of the secondary-readout (S-RO) complex was diluted in 200 μL EC buffer [10% ethylene carbonate (Sigma E26258), 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma D4911), in 4 × SSC]. These complexes were prepared for the number of target RNAs to be detected. The S-RO hybridization solution, 4 × SSC, wash buffer (12.5% formamide, 0.1% TritonX100 in 2 × SSC), Hoechst buffer (0.1% TritonX100, 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33343 in 4 × SSC), stripping buffer (55% formamide, 0.1% TritonX100 in 2 × SSC), anti-bleaching buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM Trolox (Sigma 238813), 0.8% D-glucose (Nacalai Tesque 168060-25), 0.04 mg/mL catalase (Nacalai Tesque 07444-74) were all transferred into a 96-well plate and placed in the autosampler. The samples were first incubated with S-RO hybridization solution for 20 min at room temperature. After hybridization, samples were washed with 4 × SSC for 30 seconds, then wash buffer was added and incubated for 30 seconds to remove excess and non-specific binding probes. Then, the samples were washed once with 4 × SSC for 30 seconds, once with Hoechst buffer for 30 seconds, and then anti-bleaching buffer was added. Images were acquired at 1 μm thickness with 0.2 μm z-steps × 6 for the same ROI as the Seq-PECAb-IF imaging. After imaging, samples were incubated with stripping buffer for 1 min twice, washed with 4 × SSC for 30 seconds, and moved the next imaging cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="S33"><title>Image Alignment</title><p id="P49">SeqIS and Seq-smFISH images often exhibit misalignment because a few mm misalignment occurs when the microscope stage returns to the original position after imaging. To quantify each cell in the same region of interest (ROI), image alignment was performed. Hoechst (nucleus staining) was always added in the 4-channel imaging to align the produced images in each cycle. Since there is no misalignment within a single staining, image alignment was performed based on the Hoechst image. The alignment method employed a parallel translation alignment technique based on brightness similarity. Specifically, the images were shifted while calculating the similarity between images, and alignment was achieved by identifying the location where the similarity was highest. This process was repeated to achieve alignment for all consecutive immunostaining images.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Nucleus Region Detection</title><p id="P50">To obtain the regions for quantification, nucleus detection was performed on the Hoechst images. In this experiment, we utilized ellipse fitting to detect individual cell nuclei. Specifically, we employed a simplified version of the method proposed by Bise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) to segment individual nucleus regions and applied ellipse fitting. The region segmentation was performed using a multi-thresholding method to extract candidate regions and represent their relationships in a tree structure. While using machine learning to compute a likelihood score and optimization to select the final segmentation results from candidate regions, in this experiment, we employed a rule-based selection method. Specifically, we selected the region with the maximum size among candidates that met predefined criteria for region size, maximum intensity within the region, and circularity. We used a tree structure to remove conflicting regions. The minimum region size was set to 1,200 pixels, the maximum region size was set to 12,000 pixels, and the circularity threshold was set to 0.8. The brightness threshold was automatically determined based on the image. Ellipse fitting was performed using the <italic>regionprops</italic> function in MATLAB. For the obtained nucleus regions (N), we expanded the regions outward by 25 pixels in the major axis direction and 15 pixels in the minor axis direction to obtain the cytosol regions (C) outside the nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Metric for SeqIS</title><p id="P51">The metric was obtained for the nucleus cell i using the nucleus region N_i and the cytosol region C_i obtained in the previous step. For the aligned images, quantification metrics were computed for each channel within the same regions. To eliminate background fluctuations, background images were acquired for each staining image, and these background images were subtracted from the staining images in each channel to create foreground images. The quantification metrics recorded included the average brightness values within the nucleus region N_i and the cytosol region C_i.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Metric for Seq-smFISH</title><p id="P52">Similar to the aforementioned SeqIS, the only difference lies in the metric calculation. Bright spots indicating single molecule RNA were detected with the same method as nucleus detection with different hyper-parameters. After extracting candidate regions, we detected bright spots as those satisfying the following conditions: within a predefined size range and having a maximum brightness value within the region exceeding a specified threshold. The minimum region size was set to 30 pixels, the maximum region size was set to 500 pixels, and the threshold for the maximum intensity was 0.2. For each cell nucleus, the numbers of bright spots in N and C were used as the metric.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Metric for Chromatin Domain</title><p id="P53">The Metric calculation method is different from SeqIS and Seq-smFISH. For the aligned images, the chromatin domains were detected and separated to 3 layered regions as S1, S2, and S3, then quantification metrics were computed for each channel within the same regions as described in <italic>‘Metric for SeqIS’</italic> The quantification metrics recorded included the average brightness values within the S1, S2, and S3 regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S38"><title>RNA sequence</title><sec id="S39"><title>scRNAseq</title><p id="P54">CEL-Seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) was used for amplification and library preparation except that Maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for first- strand cDNA synthesis and Second Strand Synthesis Module (NEB) was used for double-strand cDNA synthesis. Individual propidium iodide negative cells were sorted into 384 wells. After 1st strand synthesis, all 384 wells were pooled and purified with two DCC-5 columns (Zymo Research). Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 system (Illumina) and the following quantitative analysis was performed using 19 bp cell barcode reads (Read 1: NNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCC, N = UMI and C = Cell Barcode) and 81 bp insert reads (Read 2). Adaptor sequence and low-quality sequences of Read 2 were removed and reads of less than 20 bp were discarded using Trim Galore (ver.0.6.10). Insert reads were mapped to the GRCh38 reference using HISAT2 (ver. 2.2.1). Read counts for each gene were obtained by featureCounts (ver.2.0.4) and UMI duplications were removed by UMI-tools (ver. 1.1.4). Single-cell data visualization was performed using Seurat package (R version 4.2.1, Seurat_4.3.0.1). Wells with read counts lower than 100 or higher than 40,000, detected gene counts lower than 2,000 and higher than 7,000, and mitochondrial gene detection higher than 35% were filtered out. In total 1,916 cells and protein-coding genes were used for further analysis. Read counts were log normalized and the most variable 2000 genes were identified.
