Yet despite evidence of its role in evolution, pathogenesis, and oncogenic transformation, the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 alters the consequences of mutations remain vigorously debated. Here we exploit the power of nucleotide-resolution genetic mapping in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to uncover more than 1,000 natural variant-to-phenotype associations governed by this molecular chaperone. Strikingly, Hsp90 more frequently modified the phenotypic effects of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation than variants that altered protein sequence. Moreover, these interactions made the largest contribution to Hsp90-dependent heredity. Nearly all interacting variants—both regulatory and protein-coding—fell within clients of Hsp90 or targets of its direct binding partners. Hsp90 activity affected mutations in evolutionarily young genes, segmental deletions, and heterozygotes, highlighting its influence on variation central to evolutionary novelty. Reconciling the diverse epistatic effects of this chaperone, synthetic transcriptional regulation and reconstructions of natural alleles by genome editing revealed a central role for Hsp90 in regulating the fundamental relationship between activity and phenotype. Our findings establish that non-coding variation is a core driver of Hsp90’s influence on heredity, offering a mechanistic explanation for the chaperone’s strong effects on evolution and development across species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The genotype-to-phenotype map is constantly remodeled by the environment and in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, with strong impacts on development as well as in disease and evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The Heat Shock Protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) chaperone has attracted keen interest as a candidate to enact such modifications of the relationship between genotype and phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Hsp90 is a ‘hub of hubs’ with very high genetic and physical connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>; its clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, enriched in kinases, ubiquitin ligases, and other signaling factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, are likewise highly connected nodes of regulatory networks. As a consequence, Hsp90 influences diverse properties of its client proteins, including protein turnover, steady-state levels, and localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Remarkably given its connectivity, the abundance and activity of Hsp90 varies substantially across environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These features endow Hsp90 with the capacity to control the relationship between activity and environmental stress for a network of functionally diverse regulatory proteins.</p><p id="P3">Hsp90 has profound impacts on the manifestation of the phenotypic effects of genetic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>: modest impairment of Hsp90 function during development in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> results in pronounced changes to wings, eyes, and legs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The lineage specificity of these developmental phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, as well as those observed in other organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, suggests that natural polymorphisms determine how Hsp90 shapes the developmental program. Multiple oncogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and drug-resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> mutations, as well as other heritable traits in the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, depend on Hsp90.</p><p id="P4">Despite considerable interest and study, how Hsp90 exerts such diverse effects remains uncertain. Prior studies have examined the interactions between Hsp90 and, variously, precise gene deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, naturally segregating haplotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, Fanconi anemia mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, variants underlying Mendelian disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and genotypes harboring small numbers of nearly random mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The underlying mutations whose effects are modified by Hsp90 have remained obscure in all but a handful of instances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, because of Hsp90’s role as a molecular chaperone, studies that focused on individual variants made the pragmatic assumption that chaperone inhibition primarily impacted coding variation. This gap in knowledge has left a wide gulf between examples of Hsp90’s influence on the capacity of genetic variation to produce phenotypes and scant molecular understanding of how its chaperone activity is linked to these outcomes.</p><p id="P5">The molecular activity and clientele of Hsp90 are deeply conserved throughout Eukarya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The advent of genetic mapping approaches in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that dissect complex traits to their underlying causal variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> thus presents a newfound opportunity to understand the influence of Hsp90 on heredity. Diverse collections of wild isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, precision genome engineering tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and comprehensive knowledge of the genetic and physical interactors of Hsp90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, as well as the targets of key clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, make this an ideal venue to understand the mechanisms by which the chaperone network reshapes the genotype-to-phenotype map.</p><p id="P6">Here, we harness this system to identify thousands of natural polymorphisms throughout the genome whose effects depended strongly on Hsp90 function. Even though Hsp90 is a protein chaperone, these effects were most pronounced for non-coding variation. Nearly all interacting polymorphisms occurred in genes encoding Hsp90 client proteins, clients of co-chaperones, or the targets of regulatory proteins that depend upon Hsp90 to function. We also find evidence for potent modification of evolutionary trajectories by Hsp90: its inhibition altered the phenotypic effects of heterozygous mutations, natural segmental deletions, and mutations in evolutionarily young genes. Our results show that the Hsp90 chaperone network exerts a profound influence on the relationship between activity and phenotype, providing a mechanistic explanation for its potent impact on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants and for the ubiquity of Hsp90-dependent phenotypes under stress and in development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Nucleotide-resolution mapping of Hsp90-dependent phenotypes</title><p id="P7">To enable genetic mapping with high resolution and sensitivity, we employed ∼15,000 fully genotyped progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> from a cross between two wild <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> parents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>: RM11, isolated from a California vineyard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and YJM975, isolated from an immunocompromised patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The paralogous genes encoding Hsp90—<italic>HSC82</italic> and <italic>HSP82</italic>—are not polymorphic in the mapping panel (mutations in these genes could confound mapping). To assess the chaperone’s impact on the effects of natural variants [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>], we used a potent and specific natural product inhibitor, radicicol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, at a dose that reduced but did not eliminate Hsp90 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1A</xref>]. This degree of Hsp90 inhibition did not perturb growth in the absence of stress [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1B</xref>] nor induce a bounce-back heat shock response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1CD</xref>].</p><p id="P8">We examined the growth of the 15,000-isolate panel in response to diverse environmental perturbations (including alternate carbon sources, toxic metal ions, and DNA-damaging agents, as well as antifungal drugs used clinically and in agriculture) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table S1</xref>]. Parallel experiments in the presence of radicicol revealed that Hsp90 inhibition dramatically altered the growth of many F<sub>6</sub> diploid progeny [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>] and, moreover, did so in a manner that was highly specific to the environment [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1E</xref>]. Coarse genetic mapping readily identify loci with Hsp90-dependent phenotypic effects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>], including the rapamycin-resistance phenotype of a locus centered about the <italic>AVO3</italic> (<italic>TSC11</italic>/RICTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>) gene [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>].</p><p id="P9">To pinpoint the polymorphisms responsible for Hsp90-dependent traits, we performed high-resolution genetic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> of the change in growth upon chaperone inhibition. Based on over 1,000,000 growth measurements and a multivariate coarse- and fine-mapping procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we identified 1,154 Hsp90-dependent loci throughout the genome that could be resolved to a single variant, exceeding the number previously identified by orders of magnitude [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File S1</xref>]. In total, 806 genes were implicated in at least one interaction between a variant and Hsp90 inhibition. Although Hsp90 generally influenced homozygotes more strongly, we also observed 567 cases in which the chaperone affected a variant’s dominance. Because most mutations originate as heterozygotes, this behavior, too, is likely an important facet of Hsp90’s influence on natural genetic variation. More broadly, considering the modest number of conditions we surveyed in our experiments, the involvement of more than 10% of genes in Hsp90-dependent phenotypes emphasizes the widespread influence of Hsp90 on heredity.</p><p id="P10">We next classified interactions into two broad categories: buffering interactions, in which the phenotypic effect of an allele was masked by Hsp90 and <italic>increased</italic> upon radicicol treatment (decanalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> or the release of cryptic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>); and potentiation interactions, in which the phenotypic effect of a variant was <italic>reduced</italic> when Hsp90 was inhibited (as with the transforming kinase v-Src<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1F</xref>]. Both types of interactions were common; buffering interactions were somewhat stronger than potentiations (median 15% larger; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1G</xref>]. In addition to buffering and potentiation, we noted that several Hsp90-dependent effects <italic>inverted</italic> a variant’s fitness. Although constituting a minority of the interactions we observed, the average effect size of such inversions was large [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1H</xref>] and may explain the ‘line-crossing’ Hsp90 dependence observed for randomly accumulated mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Remarkably, Hsp90’s impact on individual variants was comparable to the phenotypic contributions of the variants themselves [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1I</xref>]; all these effects were large relative to the threshold for selection in this organism (<italic>s</italic> ∼ 10<sup>-5</sup> - 10<sup>-4</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, suggesting that Hsp90 is poised to impact the evolutionary fate of a broad swath of natural genetic variation.</p><p id="P11">To confirm our statistical findings, we used genome editing to reconstruct the SNP in Avo3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> linked to Hsp90-dependent rapamycin resistance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>]. Examining the AlphaFold model of this Hsp90 client<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we noted that the polymorphic Lys1342 residue lay in the Avo3 C-terminus, which protects Tor2 from rapamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and is positioned to form a salt bridge likely disrupted by the Thr1342 substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, the alternate Thr1342 allele found in the RM11 vineyard isolate conferred a pronounced fitness defect in rapamycin that was attenuated by radicicol treatment, whereas the Lys1342 allele found in the clinical isolate conferred potentiated resistance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>]. Neither variant strongly influenced growth in the absence of rapamycin [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1J</xref>] and we obtained similar results with the chemically distinct Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, confirming that these phenotypes were transformed by Hsp90 activity.</p><p id="P12">To determine whether the effects of this variant were unique to these genetic backgrounds, we assessed the growth of 1,000 wild yeast isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> under rapamycin treatment with and without Hsp90 inhibition. More than 100 of the wild strains bore the alternate Thr1342 allele, and the Hsp90-dependent effect of the polymorphism was apparent across this panel despite the presence of variation at more than one million other loci [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>]. These data establish that, despite genetic background effects, results from our focused cross could be translated species-wide.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Hsp90 controls the phenotypic effects of regulatory variation</title><p id="P13">Although the Avo3 variant altered protein sequence, closer inspection of our mapping data revealed that nearly half (542 of 1,154) of the fine-mapped variants were outside of annotated open reading frames. Indeed, regulatory variants accounted for more Hsp90-dependent heredity than protein-altering variants [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1K</xref>], even though only 30% of the yeast genome is noncoding. To better understand this surprising enrichment, we first investigated a T&gt;C variant 206 base pairs upstream of the <italic>ERG11</italic> transcription start site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>] linked to Hsp90-buffered resistance to the antifungal drugs tebuconazole and fluconazole, which inhibit Erg11 and are widely used in agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Genomic reconstruction of the regulatory SNP recapitulated its buffered fitness effect [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2A</xref>]; the mutation had a negligible effect on growth in the absence of drug, regardless of Hsp90 activity [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2B</xref>]. These data establish that the buffered azole resistance was due to a regulatory variant rather than linked coding mutations.</p><p id="P14">We next examined the position of regulatory variants affected by Hsp90 relative to the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of the nearest genes. The largest and most frequent effects arose from variants immediately upstream of the TSS, consistent with altered transcription factor recruitment or transcription initiation. 123 Hsp90-dependent variants, however, were in the predicted 3’ UTR of mRNAs and 55 in the 5’ UTR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>], suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional regulation. Indeed, numerous Hsp90-dependent phenotypes arose from the 3’ UTR of the cysteine desulfurase gene <italic>NFS1</italic>, which exhibits nutrient-dependent RBP binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Introducing a G&gt;A polymorphism 61 base pairs downstream of <italic>NFS1</italic> into the YJM975 genetic background conferred pronounced buffered sensitivity to fluconazole and concomitant buffered resistance to the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin, confirming the role of this 3’ UTR in chaperone-dependent heredity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>]. Interestingly, we previously implicated coding variation at <italic>NFS1</italic> in buffered rapamycin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, suggesting that Hsp90-dependence may be a general property of variation at this gene. More broadly, our data demonstrate that the fitness effects of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variation alone can be potently controlled by the Hsp90 foldase.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Allelic imbalance is invariant to Hsp90 activity</title><p id="P15">To better understand the molecular origins of the phenotypic interactions between Hsp90 and natural regulatory variants, we performed allele-specific mRNA sequencing of the heterozygous diploid parent of our genetic mapping panel. This approach capitalizes on polymorphisms in transcribed regions that ‘tag’ transcripts as originating from either the RM11 or YJM975 parental chromosomes [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2C</xref>]; a predominance of one haplotype over the other indicates the presence of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory variant at that gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Of the 451 phenotypic interactions between non-coding variants and Hsp90 in our mapping experiments, 107 (26%) exhibited significant allele-specific expression (ASE) under radicicol treatment (Bonferroni-corrected <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05; see <bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary File S2</xref> for details and power calculations). We first hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibition might alter effects of these interacting SNPs on mRNA levels, causing their phenotypic effects to change. Yet to our surprise, allelic ratios were largely unchanged by Hsp90 inhibition across all segregating polymorphisms, whether or not their phenotypic effects depended on the chaperone [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2E</xref>]. The buffered variant at <italic>ERG11</italic>, for instance, showed pronounced RM11-biased expression (mean RM:YJM allelic ratio = 1.78), consistent with our observation that the RM11 allele conferred azole resistance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>], but this ratio was unchanged when Hsp90 was inhibited.</p><p id="P16">We did note, however, that the overall level of <italic>ERG11</italic> expression was markedly decreased by radicicol treatment. This observation led us to hypothesize that Hsp90 might control allele-specific fitness consequences without impacting the mRNA allelic ratio simply by altering the amount of folded, active protein in <italic>trans</italic>. Such a model would predict that Hsp90 would have a larger phenotypic effect on variants with greater allelic imbalance. Indeed, despite having little effect on mRNA ASE itself, Hsp90 more strongly impacted the consequences of variants with significant allelic imbalances (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2F</xref>]. Moreover, if most proteins are present at levels that do not limit growth under most conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, then we might expect such interactions to be predominantly buffered; buffering interactions were stronger than potentiations for variants associated with mRNA <italic>cis</italic>-regulation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2G</xref>]. Studies in diverse organisms have illustrated the potential for Hsp90 to have profound and lineage-specific consequences for development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, often resulting in the release of cryptic phenotypic variation. Our results suggest that these interactions could arise from the confluence of <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants with <italic>trans</italic> effects that depend on Hsp90 activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Hsp90 modifies variation in direct clients and their targets</title><p id="P17">Our observation that coding and non-coding variants drove Hsp90-dependent phenotypes led us to ask whether either were linked directly to Hsp90’s well-characterized chaperone activity or instead were connected by effects that percolated through the protein-protein interaction network. Strikingly, modified alleles were much more like to occur in genes encoding Hsp90 clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0007 for both Hsp82 and Hsc82) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Because multiple chaperones are often involved in folding, we also searched the clientele of the Hsp70 family of chaperones, which collaborate with Hsp90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>; these clients were also enriched for modified alleles (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup> for Ssa1/2; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for Ssa4) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>]. Notably, although the Hsp90-dependent phenotypes we identified were mechanistically diverse and often driven by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation, protein-folding activity directly connected Hsp90 and Hsp70 to the majority (59.8%) of interacting variants.</p><p id="P18">To investigate percolating effects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>], we examined the targets of three classes of regulatory proteins that are prominent amongst Hsp90’s clientele: kinases, transcription factors (TFs), and E3 ubiquitin ligases. We first assessed which kinases might connect Hsp90 inhibition to changes in the effects of natural variants, identifying eighteen kinases whose targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> were enriched for Hsp90-dependent variation (Bonferroni-corrected <italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S3A</xref>]. Twelve interact with Hsc82 or Hsp82<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, indicating a potential mechanism for the modification of variants in their clients. Ninety-two predicted targets of the client MAP kinase Slt2, for example, bore interacting alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. The targets of the eighteen enriched kinases accounted for another 32.2% of the interacting alleles in our experiments. Thus, a total of 92.0% of Hsp90-dependent variants were connected directly <italic>via</italic> chaperone activity or <italic>via</italic> kinases, a deeply conserved class of Hsp90 client proteins.</p><p id="P19">We next asked whether Hsp90’s phenotypic effects might likewise percolate through TFs and ubiquitin E3 ligases. Modified variants were enriched at the targets of five TFs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>; see <bold>Methods</bold>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> but not amongst the physical interactors of E3 ligases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> [see <bold>Methods</bold>], perhaps because the substrate specificity of E3 ligases remains poorly characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. These results suggest that, first, although the influence of Hsp90 on the genotype-to-phenotype map is complex, it is interpretable based on our knowledge of the functional roles of Hsp90, its close collaborator Hsp70, and key categories of client proteins. Second, the position of Hsp90 as a hub of hubs facilitates the simultaneous modification of alleles throughout a complex regulon attributable to both direct and second-order interactions. Indeed, multiple mechanisms may converge on a single protein: many interacting alleles at direct clients were also <italic>trans</italic> targets of client regulators. Finally, the effects of Hsp90 are similarly likely to reach both regulatory and coding variation at the members of this diverse regulon.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The influence of Hsp90 on complex heredity</title><p id="P20">Our mapping approach provided a comprehensive picture of Hsp90-dependent heredity, revealing that up to 90.0% of Hsp90’s effect on fitness was due to changes in the phenotypic effects of genetic variants (median of 55.7% across all traits) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4A</xref>]. Consistent with the widespread reservoir of co-regulated variants under the influence of Hsp90 activity, the Hsp90-dependence of phenotype was often genetically complex—the median trait comprised 142 modified alleles [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4B</xref>]. Hsp90-dependent growth in maltose, for example, depended on three separate large-effect alleles segregating at the <italic>MAL1, MAL3</italic>, and <italic>GAL10</italic> loci. The modified loci at <italic>MAL3</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> included regulatory variants, but a large-effect buffered locus at <italic>MAL1</italic> was due to a deletion encompassing three maltose metabolic genes: <italic>IMA1, MAL11</italic>, and <italic>MAL13</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. The segmental deletion was much more deleterious to growth in maltose when Hsp90 was inhibited [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4C</xref>].</p><p id="P21">These joint interactions resulted in a remarkably environment-specific effect of Hsp90 inhibition on fitness [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4D</xref>]; despite Hsp90’s pronounced impact in maltose, the three loci had negligible Hsp90 dependence in raffinose [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4E</xref>]. This was a general property of Hsp90-dependent heredity in our experiments: the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on the phenotypic consequences of variation was uncorrelated between different stress conditions [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4F</xref>]. To better understand how Hsp90 influenced the concerted effects of multiple variants, we examined how chaperone inhibition impacted the fitness of the eight possible combinations of homozygous genotypes at these three loci. The three simultaneous interactions altered the connectivity of the phenotypic landscape in maltose: several mutational steps were permitted (did not significantly decrease fitness) exclusively when Hsp90 was either fully active or inhibited [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>]. This in turn altered the mutational paths accessible between genotypes without a stepwise decrease in fitness [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>]. Simultaneously, Hsp90 inhibition coarsened the landscape: the effect of single-mutation steps in this mutational neighborhood was increased when Hsp90 was inhibited in maltose, in contrast to the same mutational neighborhood in raffinose [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>]. The same was true under fluconazole treatment, in which variants at <italic>ERG11, PDR1</italic>, and <italic>GRE2</italic> were buffered [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>]. These results illustrate how Hsp90 inhibition under stress can affect polygenic adaptation when the effects of multiple segregating polymorphisms are altered. By opening or foreclosing paths in the mutational space, chaperone activity shapes the tradeoff between metabolic specialization and the accessibility of other phenotypes when the environment changes.</p><p id="P22">The identification of interacting variants not only at the <italic>MAL</italic> but also the <italic>FLO</italic> genes, young, rapidly evolving subtelomeric gene families with highly variable gene content across <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File S1</xref>], prompted us to ask if evolutionarily young genes, as a group, were predisposed to harbor Hsp90-dependent variation. After stratifying all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes by evolutionary age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>], we found that the youngest genes harbored alleles that exhibited the strongest Hsp90-dependent phenotypic effects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>]. Moreover, this enrichment was driven predominantly by regulatory variation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>] and strong buffering interactions [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4G</xref>]. Thus, Hsp90-buffered variation provides a potent reservoir of phenotypic novelty, particularly at genes that contribute to niche-specific adaptation and harbor more condition-specific alleles of large effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A general model for buffering by Hsp90</title><p id="P23">How does Hsp90 simultaneously drive such diverse effects and affect the outcomes of coding and non-coding variation alike? We returned to two observations from genetic mapping: first, that Hsp70 and Hsp90’s direct clients were enriched in interacting genes, and second, that regulatory variation, which does not alter protein sequence, was a driver of Hsp90-dependent heredity. These observations led us to hypothesize that Hsp90-dependence was often an intrinsic property of certain gene products, rather than a property of mutations that led one allele to become Hsp90-dependent.</p><p id="P24">To directly test this idea, we again revisited the buffered <italic>ERG11</italic> regulatory variant. Interestingly, genetic mapping also suggested a role for the neighboring Erg11<sup>Asn433Lys</sup> coding variant in azole resistance when Hsp90 was fully active. We hypothesized that due to a reduction in Erg11 activity upon Hsp90 inhibition, the effects of both variants would be buffered [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5A</xref>]. After constructing strains bearing each variant singly as well as a strain bearing both mutations, we found that, strikingly, the single and double mutants all exhibited buffered resistance to azoles (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5BC</xref>]. Thus, disparate mutations at the <italic>ERG11</italic> locus were similarly labile to Hsp90 perturbation. Moreover, cryptic phenotypes may be attributable to compound alleles at loci that are sensitive to Hsp90 activity.</p><p id="P25">We next sought to explain why the effects of these mutations were suppressed by Hsp90. Building on the observation that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation was frequently buffered, we hypothesized that a nonlinear activity-to-fitness relationship could be responsible [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>]. If many copies of a protein are improperly folded or aberrantly post-translationally modified, or if total expression is decreased, a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variant of constant molecular consequence will exhibit an increased fitness impact due to the increased local slope of the activity-fitness sigmoid. This sigmoidal relationship exists for combinations of mutations in proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and for combinations of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants at different genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, and has two implications: the fitness effects of arbitrary perturbations to Erg11 activity should depend on Hsp90 activity, and reducing Erg11 activity should be buffered.</p><p id="P26">To test these predictions quantitatively, we used synthetic CRISPR interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> to reduce <italic>ERG11</italic> transcription in the YJM975 parent [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>]. As compared to a non-targeting guide RNA, reducing <italic>ERG11</italic> transcription caused a dose-dependent sensitivity to fluconazole [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>]. In turn, Hsp90 inhibition caused a progressively greater sensitivity concomitant with decreasing <italic>ERG11</italic> transcription (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5CD</xref>]; that is, the phenotypic consequences of losing Erg11 activity were systematically buffered by Hsp90, just as we observed for natural variation. Reducing <italic>ERG11</italic> levels had no effect in the absence of azole, regardless of Hsp90 activity [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5D</xref>], and comparable results were obtained in the RM11 parent, indicating that the phenomenon was independent of the <italic>ERG11</italic> genotype [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5E</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Finally, we asked whether we could identify genes with a steep activity-fitness relationship that might be more prone to Hsp90-dependent buffering. We examined haploinsufficient genes— those whose heterozygous mutants affect the diploid—because reducing their expression by approximately one-half leads to an appreciable phenotype [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5F</xref>]. Indeed, mutations in these genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> had stronger Hsp90-dependent effects [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5G</xref>]. This did not arise simply because many haploinsufficient genes are also essential: essential genes that are not haploinsufficient did not exhibit this trend. Moreover, in concordance with our model, these enrichments arose exclusively amongst buffering interactions [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>]. Intriguingly, human genes scored as more essential (based on the frequency of predicted loss-of-function mutants in gnomAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>) and human genes found to be haploinsufficient in embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> are also enriched for known Hsp90 interactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>]. These genes may likewise be candidates to harbor Hsp90-buffered genetic variation arising from a sigmoidal activity-fitness relationship.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The influence of Hsp90 on the developmental and adaptive consequences of genetic variation has long been appreciated. However, aside from a handful of examples of mutations in client proteins, the molecular underpinnings of these effects have remained enigmatic. Here, our nucleotide-resolution approach revealed a surprise: <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variants, which by definition do not alter protein stability, emerged as a driver of nearly half of Hsp90-dependent phenotypes. This behavior arose naturally from the chaperone’s pervasive influence on activity-fitness relationships <italic>via</italic> direct clients and core regulatory proteins. Buffering interactions, which are enriched amongst these relationships, position Hsp90 to govern the release of cryptic, potentially adaptive variation in this regulatory circuitry. This mechanism combines the evolutionary advantages of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variation, which enables sophisticated spatiotemporal programming, with exquisite stress-dependent regulation of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery to release adaptive phenotypes under stress.</p><p id="P29">The preponderance of this behavior in the concise budding yeast genome suggests that interactions between Hsp90 and regulatory variation may be even more prominent in organisms with more elaborate regulatory architectures. Indeed, the pragmatic need for a low density of polymorphisms in our panel means that our results likely represent a lower bound on the prevalence of this phenomenon, even in yeast. Significant technical advances are still needed to understand Hsp90-dependent alleles of small effect and Hsp90-dependent genetic epistasis, both of which may play a role in Hsp90-dependent heredity. Nonetheless, even generous estimates of the contribution of epistasis suggest that, for some phenotypic transformations driven by the chaperone, other heritable variation that depends on Hsp90 activity (<italic>e.g.</italic> prions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> or long-lived chromatin modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>) may play an important role.</p><p id="P30">Our experiments identified numerous instances in which the impact of Hsp90 activity on fixed natural polymorphisms was as large as the effect of the variant alone. These were widespread throughout the genome, and although it is not straightforward to directly infer <italic>s</italic> from genetic mapping experiments, the effects we observed likely exceed the threshold for effective selection by multiple orders of magnitude. That many Hsp90-contingent effects were buffered and highly condition-specific further suggests a role in adaptation, particularly in rapidly changing environments. The environmental specificity of these interactions means that buffered variation can accumulate under normal conditions without compromising fitness. At the same time, this variation is shaped by repeated selection that is only engaged when Hsp90 activity is compromised. This allows a greater diversity of genetic variation to persist in the population, broadening the accessible adaptive trajectories under stress. Moreover, by virtue of repeated cycles of selection, this reservoir of genetic potential may be predisposed to drive adaptive phenotypes.</p><p id="P31">Our results may also explain why Hsp90 inhibition has profound consequences for development, as the revelation of phenotypes due to <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation are likely to have especially potent consequences in this context. Moreover, our observation that such variants were enriched in direct clients of Hsp90 and Hsp70, as well as their targets, suggests that these classes of proteins will be fertile ground to identify such interactions. Indeed, our data indicate that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants controlling proteins already well-known to interact with Hsp90 may be especially profitable to explore.</p><p id="P32">Understanding how environmental change shapes Hsp90’s clientele and the regulatory circuitry under its control is an intriguing area for future study. Nonetheless, our results suggest multiple potential advantages to an Hsp90-dependent activity-fitness relationship that incorporates regimes with varying slopes. This relationship buffers modest perturbations to activity but enhances the phenotypic consequences of large excursions; indeed, haploinsufficient genes may preferentially harbor buffered <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effects. Our approach opens a path to ask whether other cellular components that are ‘hubs of hubs’ might also play important roles in the expression of genetic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and to characterize the spectrum of natural variants controlled by these factors.</p><p id="P33">Prior studies have indicated that Hsp90 facilitates the accumulation of coding variation in clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, accelerating their evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that the chaperone enables the accumulation of cryptic regulatory variation at these genes at least as strongly, providing an unappreciated and appealing potential mechanism for the influence of Hsp90 on developmental evolution in diverse systems from fruit flies to Mexican cavefish. Likewise, in cancer and in pathogens, the buffering of drug-resistant regulatory mutations by Hsp90 may allow their accumulation, subsequently being enriched amongst the surviving cells following treatment and promoting future drug-resistance. This, in turn, suggests that a paradigm that favors therapeutic Hsp90 inhibition, predicated on the Hsp90-addicted v-Src kinase, may be counterproductive if cryptic, buffered resistance is revealed and enriched. Distinguishing cases in which Hsp90 inhibition is helpful or deleterious to treatment is an important question for future investigation, as is the relationship of an individual’s reservoir of Hsp90-dependent buffering capacity with their polygenic risk for genetic disease. The decline of this buffering reservoir throughout lifespan may contribute to the emergence of pathologies with age.</p><p id="P34">Our findings address long-standing mechanistic questions surrounding the role of Hsp90 in transmuting genetic variation into selectable phenotypes. Hsp90’s activity and connectivity with an expansive regulon of client proteins position it to control activity-fitness relationships throughout the core eukaryotic regulatory circuitry. In turn, the effects of numerous coding and regulatory variants simultaneously depend strongly on its stress-regulated activity. Finally, the acute environmental specificity of these buffered fitness effects facilitates their accumulation in advance of stress. Together, these features render Hsp90 a central governor of the critical evolutionary tradeoff between robustness and adaptability in the face of a changing environment, when diversification is most crucial.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Yeast strains</title><p id="P35">The construction and genotypes of the parents of the F<sub>6</sub> haploid collection, RM11 and YJM975, are described in She and Jarosz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.
