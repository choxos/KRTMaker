The SASP is dependent on NF-κB but the initial trigger, and links with nucleoli, are unclear. Using multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we show that an early response to oncogene- and therapy-induced senescence (OIS and TIS) is nuclear/nucleolar accumulation of the PolI complex component, TIF-IA. This accumulation is essential for nucleolar fusion, the SASP and senescence, independent of rDNA transcription. We show that in steady state, TIF-IA is targeted for autophagic degradation by the p62 cargo receptor and that accumulation in senescence occurs as a consequence of ATM activation, which disrupts the p62-TIF-IA interaction. In mice, TIF-IA accumulates in colonic mucosa with age, which is further enhanced in the <italic>nfkb1-/-</italic> model of accelerated ageing. Together, these results reveal a p62-TIF-IA nucleolar stress axis that regulates the SASP and senescence, and that warrants further investigation as an anti-ageing target.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Senescence is complex process that is induced by a wide array of stressors including DNA damage, oncogenes and telomere shortening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). It is a natural process that is essential for development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, wound healing and cancer prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, it is a double edge sword as the accumulation of senescent cells in ageing tissue is deleterious to tissue homeostasis, accelerates the ageing process and can promote chronic, age-related diseases including, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In addition to a robust cell cycle arrest, senescence is characterised by secretion of an inflammatory milieu known as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The SASP is a complex and dynamic blend of factors that are key for the initiation and maintenance of cell cycle arrest, paracrine senescence and immunosurveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The chronic inflammatory environment established by the SASP is considered one of the main mechanisms by which senescent cells impact negatively on tissues to promote ageing and disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A master driver of the SASP is the NF-κB transcription factor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). NF-κB accumulates on chromatin during senescence and depletion of component proteins can reverse the SASP, without altering cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Although a number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain continued NF-κB activation in senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and cGAS/Sting identified as an important upstream pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), the initial triggers of NF-κB signalling upon senescence induction, remain unclear.</p><p id="P3">Another striking characteristic of senescent cells is gross morphological changes to nucleoli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The nucleolus is a highly dynamic, membrane-less, nuclear organelle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, it acts as a critical stress sensor, coordinating downstream responses to stress such as altered metabolism, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). While pre-senescent cells generally have multiple small nucleoli, cells triggered to undergo senescence have one single large nucleolus, which is thought to arise through fusion of phase separated nucleolar droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Enlarged nucleolar size is also a hallmark of chronological aging and is observed in patients with the ageing disorder, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). While several studies have demonstrated links between these nucleolar changes, ribosome biogenesis and the cell cycle inhibitory effects of senescence (mediated through the canonical, MDM2-P53 nucleolar stress response pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), the role of nucleoli in the SASP is unknown.</p><p id="P4">Previous work from this lab identified a novel, NF-κB nucleolar stress response pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We demonstrated that upon exposure to multiple stress types, the PolI complex component, TIF-IA (RRN3), is degraded in a proteasome and lysosome-dependent manner. Using multiple chemical and genetic modulators, we demonstrated that this degradation is causally linked to a reduction in nucleolar number, an increase in nucleolar area and activation of the NF-κB pathway. Given the similarity between this phenotype and that of senescent cells, we considered that the TIF-IA-NF-kB nucleolar stress pathway may also play a role in triggering the SASP and senescence.</p><p id="P5">Here we identify TIF-IA as a key regulator of nucleolar fusion and the SASP in senescence. We show that TIF-IA accumulates as an early response to oncogene and therapy induced senescence (OIS and TIS), paralleling nucleolar enlargement and preceding activation of the NF-κB pathway. Inhibiting this accumulation, using siRNA depletion, abrogates nucleolar fusion, the SASP and senescence in OIS and TIS, while overexpression of TIF-IA mimics these effects. We show that normally, TIF-IA is degraded by autophagy in a p62 dependent manner and that during senescence, DNA damage-mediated activation of ATM inhibits the P62-TIF-IA interaction, thereby stabilising TIF-IA. Finally, we demonstrate an association between TIF-IA accumulation and ageing in mice. Together, these data reveal a novel p62-TIF-IA axis that drives nucleolar enlargement, the SASP and senescence. This pathway has significant relevance to ageing and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines and treatments</title><p id="P6">IMR90 human primary fibroblasts stably expressing a 4-hydroxtamoxifen-inducible H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>-fusion protein (ER:Ras) or a negative control vector (ER:Stop) were a kind gift from Professor JC Acosta (IBBTEC, University of Cantabria), and have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).

Firstly, we explored TIF-IA levels and found that there was a significant <italic>increase</italic> in TIF-IA protein three days post RAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction, particularly in the nucleus/nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). This increase occurred as an early response to OIS induction, paralleling nucleolar fusion (as indicated by elongated nucleolar morphology and increased nucleolar area) but, preceding activation of the NF-κB pathway, as determined by transcription of the early NF-κB gene target, NF-κB1A (IκB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1B to D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B and C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To validate these data, we used a model of therapy-induced senescence (TIS) where human IMR90 fibroblasts, or epithelial cancer cells (HCT116), were induced to become senescent by addition of etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor known to induce DNA double-strand breaks. Senescence is observed in this model using 48h treatment with etoposide followed by 6 days standard medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). Similar to OIS, we found that nuclear accumulation of TIF-IA was an early response to TIS, occurring within the first 24h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). Brightfield images clearly demonstrate TIF-IA accumulation is paralleled by nucleolar fusion (elongated structure) at 24h followed by the emergence of a single prominent nucleolus and activation of the NF-κB target genes and SASP factors, IκB (NFkB1A), Il-1α and IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1E to I</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Next, we explored the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our findings using a murine model in which OIS is induced in hepatocytes via hydrodynamic delivery of a mutant Nras<sup>G12V</sup> encoding transposon, along with a sleeping beauty transposase expressing plasmid.

One of the initial events in OIS is hyperproliferation. It occurs within 24h of oncogene induction and is associated with DNA damage and consequently, the SASP. Given TIF-IA is essential for rDNA transcription, we considered that increased TIF-IA may be required for the hyper-proliferative phase of OIS. However, BrDU incorporation assays indicated that depleting TIF-IA prior to senescence induction had no effect on RAS<sup>G12V</sup> – induced hyper-proliferation, or indeed, on the subsequent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similarly, depletion had no effect on the formation of senescence associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which are linked to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, immunocytochemistry, using the nucleolar marker C23, indicated TIF-IA depletion significantly blocked the increase in nucleolar area in OIS. Loss of TIF-IA also inhibited transcription of SASP factors, as indicated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2D and E</xref>) and the reinforcement of senescence, as indicated by reduced β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Similar to OIS, siRNA depletion of TIF-IA abrogated the effects of the therapeutic agent etoposide on nucleolar area, transcription of SASP factors and SA-β-Gal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2 G to I</xref>). We conclude from these data that in response to senescence induction, TIF-IA accumulates in nuclei/nucleoli downstream of DNA damage, which is causally associated with gross morphological changes to nucleoli and transcription of SASP factors. In support of this conclusion, overexpression of TIF-IA in IMR90 fibroblasts caused an increase in nucleolar area, which was further enhanced by RAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). It also caused an increase in expression of IκB and SASP factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>The role of TIF-IA in OIS and TIS is independent of rDNA transcription</title><p id="P22">The relationship between senescence, ribosome biogenesis and downstream effector pathways is complex and remains controversial.

These alterations in ribosome biogenesis have been linked to p53 stabilisation and cell cycle arrest. However, few studies have explored links to the SASP. Therefore, we next considered whether accumulation of TIF-IA induces the SASP and senescence by modulating rDNA transcription.</p><p id="P23">qPCR for the 47S pre-RNA transcript demonstrated that the accumulation of TIF-IA post ER:RAS induction, and the subsequent activation of NF-κB, is actually associated with a significant reduction in 47S rDNA transcription, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Mimicking this reduction, using siRNA to TIF-IA, did not mimic effects of OIS on the SASP or SA-β-Gal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Similarly, etoposide treatment of IMR90 cells caused TIF-IA accumulation and nucleolar enlargement alongside decreased 47S transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>).

Together, these data would suggest that the effects of senescence induction on 47S transcription are context dependent. They also suggest that while nucleolar fusion and induction of the SASP in OIS and TIS is dependent on TIF-IA accumulation, there is no link with rDNA transcription. At this point we cannot rule out links to altered rRNA processing.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>P62-mediated autophagic degradation of TIF-IA prevents senescence</title><p id="P24">OIS and TIS induction had a minimal effect on TIF-IA mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>), suggesting that the early accumulation in pre-senescence is due to protein stabilisation. Given the importance of this accumulation in nucleolar fusion and the SASP, we set out to understand the mechanisms involved in regulating TIF-IA stability to prevent senescence, and the pathways triggered to induce it.</p><p id="P25">Firstly, pull down assays and quantitative mass spectrometry were employed to identify TIF-IA binding proteins in control cells, and during TIS initiation. HCT116 cells were treated with DMSO (control) or etoposide (100uM. 8h). TIF-IA antibody or IgG control were used to pull TIF-IA protein complexes out of total cell lysates, then complexes analysed by mass spectrometry. The 8h time point was chosen as it was the earliest at which TIF-IA accumulation was evident, and preceded NF-κB pathway activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A and B</xref>). Analysis of these mass spectrometry data revealed that one of the top TIF-IA interacting proteins was the autophagy cargo receptor, SQSTM1 (P62) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). TIF-IA was the top interacting protein, confirming the validity of the methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The detailed results of the interactome studies are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. The interaction with P62 was of particular interest in terms of TIF-IA stability and so, we investigated this further.</p><p id="P26">Immunocytochemistry confirmed that TIF-IA co-localised with p62 in cytoplasmic puncti in IMR90 fibroblasts, and that levels of TIF-IA increased in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor known to block autophagy: bafilomycin A1 (a selective inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+–adenosine triphosphatase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4C and D</xref>). Similarly, TIF-IA co-localised with p62 in discrete cytoplasmic foci in wild type A549 cells, which was significantly enhanced by deletion of the autophagy component, ATG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). Total cell levels of TIF-IA were elevated in ATG5 deleted cells and in cells in which p62 was depleted using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4F and G</xref>). Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that TIF-IA binds to p62 in control cells, and that the levels of TIF-IA, and the TIF-IA-p62 interaction, are enhanced by autophagy inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Further mapping of the p62-TIF-IA interaction revealed wild type p62 binds to both a native and a high molecular weight (HMW) form of TIF-IA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). Binding to both forms is lost upon deletion of the p62 PB1 domain (which is responsible for homodimerization and PKCa binding) while binding to HMW TIF-IA is lost upon deletion of the ubiquitin binding domain (UBA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). Together our data suggest that under basal conditions, TIF-IA is targeted for autophagosomal degradation by p62 in a manner dependent on ubiquitin binding, and that this degradation prevents senescence.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>P62-TIF-IA binding is lost in senescence in a manner dependent on the DNA damage response kinase, ATM</title><p id="P27">Senescence is generally associated with increased autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Given that we observed an increase in TIF-IA protein in OIS and TIS, rather than a decrease, we speculated that the p62-TIF-IA interaction is lost upon senescence induction. Indeed, immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced p62-TIF-IA binding as an early response to TIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). As expected, there was a reduction in P62 levels when TIS was triggered, in keeping with enhanced autophagy. However, quantification of IP and input immunoblots demonstrated the reduction in p62-TIF-IA binding was more pronounced than the reduction in input p62 alone, suggesting reduced binding was not merely a consequence of reduced p62 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Etoposide did not appear to alter P62-TIF-IA binding in the interactome studies, which may be explained by the earlier time point used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is a DNA damage response (DDR) kinase that is activated upon induction of TIS and OIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Of all the DDR kinases, ATM appears to be particularly important for the SASP and senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Although ATM activation contributes to increased autophagy in senescence, it can also inhibit autophagic degradation of specific proteins following senescence induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Using the KU55933 ATM inhibitor (ATMi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), we explored the role of this kinase in TIF-IA degradation. Immunoblot and immunocytochemical analysis indicated that ATMi caused a significant reduction in cellular levels of TIF-IA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C and D</xref>). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays and IHC demonstrated an increase in TIF-IA-P62 binding and co-localisation of the two proteins in distinct cytoplasmic foci upon ATM inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5D and E</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates TIF-IA on serine 44, is a direct target of the ATM kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). This is of interest as we have previously shown that TIF-IA protein accumulates upon exposure to the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We have also demonstrated that mutating S44 of TIF-IA to the phospho-mimetic, aspartic acid (S44D), completely blocks stress-mediated degradation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Based on these data, we considered that S44 dephosphorylation is required for TIF-IA-p62 binding, which is inhibited downstream of ATM activation. Indeed, immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the TIF-IA S44D mutant is unable to bind p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Further deletion studies revealed that amino acid residues 94-204 of TIF-IA are sufficient for the p62 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Based on the above and previous data, we propose a model whereby under normal conditions, TIF-IA is targeted for autophagic degradation through its association with p62. However, during senescence, ATM-mediated inhibition of PP2A causes an accumulation of TIF-IA phosphorylated at S44. This in turn causes loss of p62 binding, translocation of the protein to the nucleus/nucleolus and consequently, nucleolar fusion, stimulation of the NF-κB pathway and transcription of SASP genes. Defining the mechanism by which TIF-IA accumulation causes nucleolar fusion and NF-κB pathway activation is of incredible interest, but is out with the scope of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>TIF-IA accumulates in colonic tissue during mouse ageing</title><p id="P31">Loss of the Nfkb1 (p50) gene in mice leads to early onset ageing and a reduction in overall lifespan(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).

Senescent cells, that accumulate in ageing tissue contribute to this chronic inflammatory state by secreting a cocktail of cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory factors (the SASP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). NF-κB is a key driver of the SASP and is also the transcription factor most closely associated with ageing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). While progress has been made in understanding SASP reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), the initial triggers of the NF-κB pathway in senescence are not fully understood. Another hallmark of ageing is enlarged nucleoli. In senescent cells, this enlargement is caused by nucleolar fusion. However, the impact of this fusion on ageing, inflammation and disease is also poorly characterised.</p><p id="P35">In this paper, we demonstrate that TIF-IA is required for both nucleolar fusion and the SASP in OIS and TIS. One possible explanation for our data is that the protein independently regulates these two hallmarks of senescence. However, in this and previous studies we have shown that in all contexts associated with nucleolar fusion (oncogene and DNA-damaged induced senescence, exposure to stress, ceramide, CDK4 inhibitor, hydrogen peroxide,) the NF-κB pathway is activated, as determined by degradation of IκB and/or transcription of NF-κB target genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We have also shown that early changes in nucleolar morphology precede NF-κB pathway activation in senescence and stress response. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that in stress response, blocking TIF-IA degradation not only blocks nucleolar fusion but also NF-κB pathway activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Similarly, here we show that blocking TIF-IA accumulation in senescence blocks both altered nucleolar morphology and the SASP, while us and others have demonstrated overexpressing TIF-IA causes nucleolar enlargement and transcription of SASP factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Based on these data, we suggest the intriguing possibility that, rather than TIF-IA acting independently on nucleolar fusion and the SASP, TIF-IA-mediated nucleolar fusion lies upstream of NF-κB pathway activation and plays a role in initiating the SASP.</p><p id="P36">The mechanisms by which TIF-IA causes nucleolar fusion, and how this may lead to NF-κB pathway activation, have not yet been explored. Dogma would suggest that nucleolar size is directly linked to the rate of ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, there are many reports suggesting increased nucleolar area following senescence induction is caused by increased rDNA transcription and/or altered processing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). For example, Nishimura et al used TIF-IA overexpression as a tool to accelerate ribosome biogenesis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Similar to our findings, they demonstrated that TIF-IA overexpression caused increased nucleolar area, induction of SASP factors and senescence. They concluded that TIF-IA effects on rDNA transcription led to cell cycle arrest and senescence (they did not address links to the SASP). Here we found that following senescence induction, nuclear/nucleolar accumulation of endogenous TIF-IA has context dependent effects on rDNA transcription. That is, in some cell types/models of senescence, TIF-IA accumulation caused an increase in 47S transcription while in others, it was associated with a decrease. However, in all models we tested, TIF-IA accumulation was causally linked to changes to nucleolar morphology, the SASP and senescence. Similarly, in response to stress we have demonstrated that nucleolar fusion is associated with reduced rDNA transcription and NF-κB pathway activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the mechanism by which TIF-IA controls nucleolar fusion and the SASP is independent of its role in PolI-driven transcription. Caragine et al. recently made the interesting observation that the nucleoplasm has an active (ATP dependent) contribution to nucleolar fusion and that disturbing chromatin dynamics altered nucleolar number and size(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Depletion of components of the nuclear membrane LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex and damage of rDNA have also been shown to regulate nucleolar number and morphology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Future studies will involve exploration of the role of TIF-IA in these alternative pathways to nucleolar fusion. Our findings that degradation and accumulation of TIF-IA have similar effects on nucleoli and NF-κB would suggest that, whatever the mechanism, there is a sweet spot of TIF-IA protein that prevents activation of this pathway.</p><p id="P37">One possibility to explain the link between nucleolar fusion and NF-κB pathway activation is nuclear displacement of the DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). The cGAS-Sting signalling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of NF-κB activity and the SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Although cGAS was originally identified as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, it is now recognised that the majority of the protein resides in the nucleus, tightly bound to nucleosomes in an inactive state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Paradigm indicates that during senescence, genotoxic stress and breakdown of the nuclear membrane allow chromatin fragments to leak into the cytoplasm where they activate cGAS to initiate the SASP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Given the gross chromatin changes associated with senescence and nucleolar fusion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), and the fact that TIF-IA accumulates in the nucleoplasm as an early response to senescence, we suggest that TIF-IA either directly, or indirectly through nucleolar fusion/nuclear membrane breakdown, allows cGAS activation. Another nuclear protein involved in activation of NF-κB in response to DNA damage is IKKγ{Tufan, 2022 #1587} (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). It is now of paramount importance to define the mechanisms that links TIF-IA, nucleoli and NF-κB so that means can be identified to intervene in this pathway to prevent the SASP, chronic inflammation and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>P62 and TIF-IA stability</title><p id="P38">Data presented here on senescence and aging, and elsewhere on apoptosis, indicate that control of TIF-IA protein stability is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Us and others have demonstrated that TIF-IA is degraded via the proteasome and it has been suggested that MDM2 acts as an E3 ligase in this process, ubiquitinating the N-terminal 94 amino acids of the protein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Here we make the novel observation that in steady state, TIF-IA is targeted for autophagosomal degradation by the cargo receptor, p62. Both the PB1 and ubiquitin binding domain of p62 are required for this interaction, suggesting that p62 binds to a ubiquitinated form of the protein. However, the N-terminal 94 amino acids of TIF-IA are not required. Indeed, we found p62 binds to TIF-IA 94-204, suggesting that the ubiquitination site(s) critical for p62 binding is within this minimal domain. We also found that P62 was unable to bind to an S44 phospho-mimetic mutant of TIF-IA. Based on these data, we propose that phosphorylation of S44 blocks ubiquitination within the 94-204 domain, P62 binding and autophagic degradation.</p><p id="P39">Our data indicate that activation of the DNA damage response kinase, ATM, is associated with reduced TIF-IA-p62 binding-TIF-IA accumulation, while ATM inhibition is associated with increased TIF-IA-P62 binding-TIF-IA loss. Mayer et al have previously demonstrated that S44 of TIF-IA is targeted for phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclinE, downstream of mTOR activation, and dephosphorylated by PP2A(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). ATM is known to target both mTOR and CDK2/cyclinE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Therefore, we considered that that ATM activation may cause hyperphosphorylation of S44 and loss of p62 binding through the MTOR pathway. However, we have previously demonstrated that rapamycin, that inhibits mTOR, has no effect on TIF-IA protein levels. In contrast, inhibiting PP2A, which is negatively regulated by ATM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), caused TIF-IA accumulation. Based on these data, we suggest that the mechanism by which ATM alters TIF-IA protein levels is through inhibition of PP2A. However, it is also possible that ATM modulates the TIF-IA ubiquitination machinery. Further understanding of the dynamic flux of TIF-IA between autophagosomal and proteasomal degradation, and the upstream signalling pathways that control ubiquitination/p62 binding, will reveal insight into the regulation of cellular homeostasis/aging and is the focus of future research.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>TIF-IA in ageing and disease</title><p id="P40">Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide and advanced age is one of the most significant risk factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>).

Here we used chronologically aged mice and a genetic model of aging to show that TIF-IA levels increase in the colon with age. Similar to our findings with senescence, we find this accumulation is particularly evident in the nucleus of both stromal and epithelial cells. Senescent cells are rarely observed in tissue in vivo and are difficult to detect(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). One study that quantified β-galactosidase staining in small intestinal tissue from elderly mice found they comprised around 3.3% of cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Here we see TIF-IA levels are raised with age in the majority of colonic epithelial cells. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the DNA damage-induced increase in TIF-IA does not always lead to full senescence, as measured by β-galactosidase activity but that it sensitises to senescence induction. Multiplex immunohistochemistry will help us determine the dynamic relationship between DNA damage, nuclear accumulation of TIF-IA, nucleolar fusion and secretion of SASP factors in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental files</label><media xlink:href="EMS192575-supplement-Supplemental_files.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d160aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Terje Johansen (UIT, Artic University of Norway) for kindly providing the GFP-p62 plasmid.

Right: ImageJ was used to quantify band intensities as in A. (C) Model of suggested TIF-IA senescence pathway. In steady state, TIF-IA shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. PP2A dephosphorylates S44 allowing TIF-IA ubiquitination, P62 binding and autophagic degradation. Upon senescence induction, DNA damage activates ATM which inhibits PP2A activity, TIF-IA S44 dephosphorylation and p62 binding. TIF-IA consequently accumulates which causes nucleolar fusion, NF-κB activation and the SASP. See the discussion for further details Actin acts as a loading control throughout.
