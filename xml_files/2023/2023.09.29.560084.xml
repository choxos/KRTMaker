Strong evidence has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) are important for anti-SARS-Cov-2 immunity through Fc-mediated effector functions. These nnAbs bind to epitopes that could be less subjected to mutations in the emerging variants. When protective, such nnAbs would constitute a more promising alternative to neutralizing mAbs (nAbs). Here, we show that six nnAbs retain binding to Omicron, while two nAbs do not. Furthermore, two of our nnAbs, which are protective <italic>in vivo</italic>, retained binding to XBB, XBB.1.5, and BQ.1.1. They appear to bind to conserved epitopes on the N-terminal and receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively. As a proof of concept, we show that these protective non-neutralizing antibodies retain potent Fc-mediated opsonic function against BQ.1.1 and XBB. We also show that the Fc-mediated function is further enhanced by expressing the antibodies in the IgG3 subclass and combining them into a dual antibody cocktail. Our work suggests that opsonizing nnAbs could be a viable strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Immunology and inflammation</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>IgG3</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide since it first emerged in 2019 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Early in the pandemic, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were successfully used as therapeutics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These antibodies disrupted the ACE2 receptor-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction, thus neutralizing the virus and protecting the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, with the emergence of variants, in particular Omicron the antibodies mostly lost the ability to neutralize the virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. None of the clinically approved antibodies are functionally active against the emerging omicron subvariants XBB and BQ1.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The reason for this loss of function in these neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was primarily the extensive mutations in the RBD present across the Omicron subvariants, at sites that most nAbs target. The emergence of these variants has led researchers to focus on generating pan-neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. It remains to be seen whether this strategy will be successful against future variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P3">Antibodies with potent Fc-mediated function have not been given the same level of attention as neutralizing antibodies. Recently, we have shown that two potent opsonizing antibodies, Ab81 and Ab94, targeting the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), respectively, strongly protect against the Wuhan strain in transgenic K-18 mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Notably, these antibodies are non-neutralizing (nnAbs), mediating their protective effect through Fc-mediated effector functions. Other emerging findings with convalescent sera or neutralizing antibodies with modified Fc-effector functions align with our previous results, showing that Fc-effector functions are crucial for anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The protection granted by vaccines against severe disease by mutated variants like Omicron can be partially explained by intact antibody Fc-effector functions directed against non-RBD sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, a viable strategy complementing the pan-universal neutralizing antibody approach would be to generate opsonic antibodies against conserved epitopes, avoiding the RBD- and NTD-sites targeted by most neutralizing antibodies.</p><p id="P4">To validate the approach of using opsonizing anti-spike antibodies as a potential therapy against Omicrons sub-variants and, in extension, future variants, we tested the reactivity of 8 clones generated against the Wuhan strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We showed that of our 8 antibody clones, generated previously against the Wuhan strain, 6 retain unaltered binding against the Omicron, BA2, BA4, and BA5. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the NTD-binding clone 94 binds to a conserved epitope across spike variants. Only the two nAbs, clones 57 and 59, lost binding against Omicron. We further analyzed the affinity of clones 81 and 94 against the more recent variants XBB, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5, where we observed that they retain nanomolar affinity comparable to the Wuhan spike protein. Finally, we show that both subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 of clones 81 and 94 show strong Fc-mediated phagocytosis against the newer XBB and BQ1.1 variants. Like in our recent work, the cocktail approach of Ab81 and Ab94 in conjunction generated the most potent functional output and is thus a promising candidate as therapeutic against these variants and possibly future variants.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Potent anti-NTD Ab94 binds to a conserved opsonic site unaltered by mutations in current circulating variants</title><p id="P5">In previous work, we established a set of antibodies from B cells of previously SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. Of these, Ab94 binds to the NTD of the Wuhan spike protein, and the other clones bind to the RBD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In terms of neutralizing epitopes in the NTD, five sites are known to be targeted by most anti-NTD nAbs: residues 14-26, 67-79, 141-156, 177-186, and 246-260 (N1-N5 loops)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, residues 14-20, 140-158, and 245-264 have been identified as antigen supersites for anti-NTD nAbs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The spike protein has undergone substantial mutations in the RBD and NTD of the S1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Cross-link data from TX-MS showed that Ab94 binds to an epitope at amino acid residues G35-F43 in the S1 unit of the NTD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> which is a non-neutralizing epitope close to the NTD-loop 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To understand if Ab94’s binding-epitope is conserved, or at least has not been subjected to mutations, we analyzed the mutations in the spike glycoprotein in the variants up to XBB1.5, XBB1.16, XBB1.9, XBB.2.3X, CH1.1, BQ1.1 and compared it to the European original strain B1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Interestingly, although the spike protein has undergone extensive mutations in both the RBD and NTD, the epitope of Ab94 has not been subjected to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). The most proximal alteration is the exchange of Leucine in residue 24 to Serine and deletion of amino acids 25-27, which emerged in the BA.2 and BA.5 variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, BA.2 developed into XBB and added mutations in the NTD with V83A, del144, H146Q, and Q183E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. XBB1.5 added further mutation in G252V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1</xref>). While the BQ.1.1 (developed from BA.5) and CH1.1 (developed from BA.2) both underwent a mutation in G142D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. BQ1.1 had a deletion in amino acid residues 69/70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1</xref>). CH.1.1 exhibited more extensive mutation compared to BQ1.1 with mutations in K147E, W152R, F157L, I210V, V213G and G257S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1</xref>). Though CH1.1 lacked the mutations in V83A, del144, mutation H146Q, and Q183E shown by XBB and XBB.1.5, which in turn lack the mutations K147E, W152R, F157L that CH1.1 has. XBB1.16 has a mutation in E180V, which is not shared by the other XBB sublineages, and XBB2.3 has a unique mutation in D253G. Finally, the latest variant (august 2023) EG.5.1, has a substitution mutation Q52H. Thus, Ab94’s target epitope G35-F43 has not been subjected to any mutation in the variants from Wuhan up to XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB1.19, XBB.1.9.2 XBB.2.3X, CH.1.1 and EG.5.1 respectively. This is contrary to most anti-NTD nAbs that target these neutralizing antigen sites, which have all undergone mutations in the XBB sublineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Since anti-NTD and anti-RBD nAbs target sites that interact with the ACE2-receptor, they are constrained to specific interacting epitopes, which have now undergone extensive mutations. Opsonizing nnAbs, such as Ab94, are seemingly less influenced by this issue since a vast majority of the spike residues are not mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Additionally, while 6 out of 8 mAbs tested are not neutralizing, all eight mediate strong opsonic function, indicating that the requirements for opsonic function are less demanding based on epitope specificity. Finally, our analysis strongly suggests that Ab94 binds a conserved site since it has not undergone mutations in the circulating viral variants during the three years since its identification. Still, the binding and protective function of this nnAb might be lost since mutations in other sites might influence epitopes both proximally and distally due to allosteric changes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Non-neutralizing antibodies retain binding against Omicron and sub-variants up until BQ.1.1, XBB and XBB.1.5</title><p id="P8">To validate our bioinformatic and epitope analysis on the target epitope of Ab94, we assessed its reactivity to the Omicron and BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 sublineages. Although we do not have complete information on the epitope sites for our anti-RBD nnAbs (clones 11, 36, 66, 77, and 81), we wanted to use these as well to test the hypothesis of using nnAbs to target, theoretically, less mutation-prone epitopes. In previous work, we used spike-coated microsphere beads to assess the reactivity of our mAbs against the Wuhan spike protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Here, using the same approach, we incubated spike-coated microsphere beads (coated with Wuhan, Omicron, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 spike protein) with our anti-spike antibodies. We assessed reactivity by adding fluorescent anti-Fab secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>). We analyzed IgG binding to the spike-coated beads with flow cytometry as done previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. All clones were analyzed as IgG3 except for Ab11, which was in the IgG1 subclass since it exhibited diminished affinity in the IgG3 subclass prior. Of the 8 clones, which are strongly reactive to the Wuhan spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), 6 exhibited strong binding to the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Interestingly, only the antibody clones that were neutralizing the Wuhan variant, Ab57 and Ab59, were those that lost binding to the Omicron variant. Contrary to those, the nnAbs 11, 36, 66, 77, 81, and 94 retained strong reactivity. The same result was seen for the Omicron sub-variants BA2, BA4, and BA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-H</xref>), reinforcing that opsonic antibodies can potentially bind to conserved epitopes.</p><p id="P9">To further investigate the binding kinetics of our clones towards the spike variants, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays (SPR) with the multivalent spike trimer as done previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For these assays, we chose to focus on clones 66, 77, 81, and 94 in the IgG3 subclass since these clones were shown to have potent <italic>in vitro</italic> Fc effector functions previously in this subclass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The results showed that the apparent dissociation constant (KD) and association rate constant (kA) are equivalent for all tested clones when comparing the reactivity towards the Wuhan spike protein and the variants Omicron, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The only exception is clone 94 which, interestingly, binds with higher avidity towards all the variants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). We further analyzed the avidity of clones 81 and 94 against the newer variants BQ.1.1 and XBB. We focused on these two clones since they were both shown to be protective against a lethal Wuhan infection in a K18-hACE2 mouse model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These SPR experiments showed that both clones retain a high affinity towards BQ1.1 and XBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). Ab94 binds with similar avidity to XBB as to the Wuhan spike (k<sub>A</sub> and K<sub>D</sub>) but binds 5-fold better to BQ1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the binding ability of clone 81 against the RBD of XBB 1.5 due to its mutation in the RBD site F486P. This experiment showed a similar result that Ab81 has a sub-nanomolar affinity towards even this mutated variant of XBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>) comparable to the affinity to Wuhan RBD measured previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We did not analyze Ab94 for this variant since the difference in mutational profile between it and XBB is identical when the NTD is concerned. Taken together, our results show that our opsonic nnAbs retain strong binding to variants that emerged from Omicron while our nAbs clones did not. Finally, the protective clones Ab81 and Ab94 seemingly bind to epitopes that allow Ab81 to retain nanomolar binding against these heavily mutated spike trimer variants. Ab94 seems to bind even better to the mutated variants, except for XBB, which is comparable to the WT spike. Ab94 is thus seemingly binding to a conserved epitope.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses of clones 81 and 94 show potent Fc-mediated phagocytosis against the BQ1.1 variant</title><p id="P10">Having established our clones’ binding properties, we decided to investigate if this translates to intact <italic>in vitro</italic> effector functions in the form of Fc-mediated phagocytosis. We opted to test their function on BQ.1.1 spike trimer-coated microsphere beads. We have previously shown that our mAbs are opsonic in a flow cytometry-based phagocytosis assay of spike beads with the THP-1 cell line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and that the results are relevant for biological protection <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, we tested the individual mAbs in both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses for clones 81 and 94. We looked at the percentage of cells that were bead-positive and the median signal for beads in this population, which is a metric for bead quantity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3A</xref>). Since the phagocyte-bead interaction is dependent on these metrics, we calculated a phagocytosis score based on the percentage of cells that are bead positive multiplied by the median fluorescence signal (bead signal) of that population, as described in other work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Interestingly, both subclasses of IgG1 and IgG3 for both clones show potent Fc-mediated function compared to the negative control (Xolair, human IgG1 anti-IgE). This was observed in the percentage of cells that are interacting with the BQ1.1 spike-coated beads (bead<sup>+</sup> cells), with all single IgGs showing comparable performance in this metric (ranging from 20-22% bead<sup>+</sup> cells) compared to the negative control (9% bead<sup>+</sup> cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the amount of beads being phagocytosed in cells associated with beads by quantifying the bead signal. In this analysis, IgG3 Ab81 stood out as the most potent opsonin (mean bead signal of 18200), followed by Ab94 IgG3 (15100, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Ab81 and Ab94 IgG1 outperformed the negative control as well with mean bead signals of 13600 and 13000 respectively compared to the negative control (12000). Finally, we analyzed the phagocytosis score to acquire a comprehensive overview of the bead-phagocyte interaction. This analysis shows that Ab81 IgG3 enhanced bead-uptake by the THP1-cells more than 4-fold compared to the negative control (4300 vs 1000) while Ab94 IgG3 showed similar activity with a 3.5-fold enhancement (3500 vs 1030, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). No difference was seen between the IgG subclass controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The IgG1 versions of clones 81 and 94 were 2.7-fold more potent than the negative control, trailing their IgG3 variants (2800 and 2700 respectively). Taken together, the results show that the opsonic clones 81 and 94 have strong Fc-mediated function against the BQ1.1 variant and that the IgG3 versions are, as the case with Wuhan, more potent opsonins.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cocktail of an anti-RBD and an anti-NTD mAb shows potent Fc-mediated phagocytosis in both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses</title><p id="P12">In a previous study, we showed that combining a potent anti-NTD antibody (clone 94) with that of a potent anti-RBD (clone 81) generated a superior opsonic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We named this cocktail DuomAb, and the IgG3 version of these mAbs showed the largest Fc-mediated effector functions against the Wuhan strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Having established potent function in both subclasses (IgG1 and IgG3) of Ab81 and Ab94 against BQ1.1 (the circulating variant in Sweden during the fall of 2022), we set out to test whether their potency could be enhanced by combining them in the same 2-antibody cocktail as done against the Wuhan strain (DuomAb) but against BQ1.1.</p><p id="P13">We performed similar experiments by incubating opsonized spike-beads with THP-1 cells. Only the DuomAb IgG3 outperformed the single mAbs at equivalent concentrations. DuomAb IgG1 and the individual mAbs Ab81 IgG1 and Ab94 IgG1 had very similar associating cells (24.9%, 19.8%, and 20.3% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). There was an increase in association with DuomAb IgG3 (DuomAb IgG3 = 31.3%, Ab81 IgG3 = 22.0%, Ab94 IgG3 = 21.5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). When looking at phagocytosis scores there was a difference for the DuomAb IgG1 vs. single IgG1 (DuomAb IgG1 = 3900, Ab81 IgG1 = 2800 and Ab94 IgG1 = 2700, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly as with percentage of bead<sup>+</sup> cells, Duomab IgG3 had higher phagocytosis score compared to single IgG3 mAbs (DuomAb IgG3 = 5000, Ab81 IgG3 = 4300, Ab94 IgG3 = 3500, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Compared to the negative control, Duomab IgG3 was the most potent opsonin, with a 5-fold higher phagocytosis score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Furthermore, since the ratio of prey (spike-beads in this case) is a known factor influencing phagocytosis outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we decided to vary the ratio of prey to phagocytes, the multiplicity of prey (MOP), as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We plotted the MOP against percentage associating cells and used non-linear regression analysis to generate the MOP<sub>50</sub> value (equivalent to EC<sub>50</sub>) to compare the cocktails vs. single mAbs. A lower MOP<sub>50</sub> value signifies an antibody that mediates more efficient phagocyte-prey interaction and is a more potent mediator of Fc-dependent phagocytosis. We observed that, while Ab81 and Ab94 IgG3 are both more efficient than the control (Ab81 IgG3 MOP<sub>50</sub> = 9, Ab94 IgG3 =8, Control MOP<sub>50</sub> = 48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), they are both most effective when used in conjunction as Duomab IgG3 (MOP<sub>50</sub>= 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Similarly as for the IgG3 variants, the IgG1 single mAbs outperformed the negative control (Ab81 IgG1 MOP<sub>50</sub>= 14, Ab94 IgG1= 12, Control MOP<sub>50</sub> = 48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>) but were less efficient than their IgG3 counterparts. Here, the DuomAb IgG1 cocktail was more effective than both individual IgG1s (MOP<sub>50</sub>= 9). However, although Duomab IgG1 was more potent than its IgG1’s single mAbs, it was not more effective than Ab94 IgG3 and was inferior to both Duomab IgG3 and Ab81 IgG3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H-J</xref>). Further analysis indicates that DuomAb IgG3 exhibits a cooperative function with a Hill-slope constant (n<sub>H</sub>) above 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>). We did not observe such cooperative functions for the individual mAbs nor DuomAb IgG1. Finally, to extend our findings with the potent functions of DuomAb IgG3 compared to IgG1, we performed similar experiments with XBB spike trimer-coated beads. These results reinforced our findings with the Wuhan and BQ1.1 strain, with IgG3 DuomAb being highly opsonic compared to IgG1 DuomAb in terms of association (62.7% vs 43.5) and overall phagocytosis performance (5130 vs 2440) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3L</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Taken together, our results show that both clones Ab81 and Ab94 exhibit potent Fc-mediated function against BQ1.1 and that engineering these clones in the IgG3 subclass and combining them in a 2-antibody cocktail generates even more potent functions against XBB and BQ.1.1. Since these nnAbs have demonstrated strong protectiveness against stringent infection in K18-hACE2 mice, our data suggests they would be promising candidates for therapy against BQ1.1, XBB and other variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Monoclonal antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was successful in the initial phase of the pandemic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Although many neutralizing mAbs generated initially against the Wuhan strain lost binding and function, researchers have successfully developed mAbs that neutralize the variants currently circulating <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, when testing these nAbs against emerging variants, several studies have shown a reduced neutralizing effect (IC<sub>50</sub>) compared to the Wuhan strain in the newer variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It appears likely that the trend will continue and that these nAbs will also eventually lose neutralizing capacity.</p><p id="P17">Neutralizing antibodies constitute a fraction of the adaptive antibody response generated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most antibodies that bind to the spike antigen are not neutralizing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, this does not necessarily imply that they do not serve any protective immune function. In previous work, we showed that all our antibody clones that bind to the spike protein promoted efficient phagocytosis through Fc-effector functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The importance of Fc-mediated effector functions of anti-spike mAbs has for long not been the focus of the scientific community as an important immune mechanism against severe disease by SARS-CoV-2. For other viral pathogens such as adenovirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, West Nile virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, HIV-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, RSV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, Human CMV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and Influenza virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, antibody Fc-mediated effector functions are important for viral clearance. Thus, it is not surprising that more evidence is emerging showing that non-neutralizing antibodies mediate protective Fc-effector function against SARS-CoV-2. The evidence ranges from work with polyclonal antibodies from convalescent patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, modification of amino acids impacting Fc-effector function of neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> to non-neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Here, we show that two nnAbs, Ab81 and Ab94, retain high-affinity binding against variants up to XBB.1.5 and BQ1.1 and have strong Fc-mediated function against BQ1.1 and XBB. Although we do not know which epitope in the RBD-specific clone 81 binds, our experimental data shows that it has not been much influenced by the current mutations in the RBD (up until BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5). Ab94, on the other hand, binds a seemingly conserved epitope since it binds to XBB equivalent to WT spike and 5-fold better to BQ.1.1. In addition, there have not been any mutations in the residues it binds (G35-F43) in any of the current circulating variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Both Ab81 and Ab94 were derived from Swedish patients in March 2020 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, early during the pandemic. No variants of concern had yet surfaced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This means that these antibodies did not arise as a host response to any spike variants and that it is likely that the human immune system has been able to generate such protective nnAbs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections all through the pandemic. This ability is likely common also in response to commonly used spike-based vaccines. The ability to generate protective antibodies against conserved non-neutralizing epitopes contributes to the ability of vaccination using early vaccine variants and prior, early infections to remain relatively effective in preventing serious disease, also following infection with emerging viral variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Of our mAbs tested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, Ab94 IgG3 stood out as the most potent, closely followed by Ab81 IgG3. The location of its binding site could explain Ab94’s potent Fc-mediated effector functions. In a previous study, an anti-NTD neutralizing antibody targeting the antigen supersite 1 (residues 14 to 26) exhibited strong Fc-mediated effector functions, which the authors attribute to a favorable orientation of the Fc relative to Fc-gamma receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We propose that Ab94 also binds in a favorable orientation, enabling efficient crosslinking to Fc-gamma receptors due to the proximity to the antigen supersite 1 on the NTD. This potency is likely further enhanced by the flexibility associated with IgG3’s hinge, promoting more efficient Fc-FcR interactions. Such potent Fc-mediated functions of Ab94 and Ab81 could explain why they show a protective effect <italic>in vivo</italic> while another nnAb did not show this protective effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Not all opsonic nnAbs are necessarily protective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and of our panel of 8 nnAbs, Ab81 and Ab94 stood out as far more potent opsonizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">In our most recent work, Ab94 and Ab81 were both protective against an infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice in a prophylactic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This is even more striking when considering that survival benefits were shown in a model suboptimal for human IgGs effector functions since human IgG (especially IgG3) promotes weaker phagocytosis by mouse phagocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, human IgG3 has a much shorter half-life in mouse circulation than human IgG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The protective effects shown by these two mAbs could, therefore, be underestimated in a human setting. Furthermore, Ab94 was also shown to be protective in a therapeutic model, where it was comparable to clone 59, a potent nAb with IC<sub>50</sub> of 19 ng/mL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This comparison suggests that the protective benefit of nnAbs is comparable to that of nAbs. It is also worth noting that the mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 in both infection models, 10<sup>5</sup> PFU <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This dose is higher than that used in most studies that have shown the protective benefits of nAbs. Most researchers have tested the nAbs protective effect against a dose ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> PFU to 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which are sublethal in comparison <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, not only do Ab81 and Ab94 retain binding and function against the new variants, but their Fc-mediated function has also been shown to be protective against death and weight loss in infection models where mice were challenged with a higher, and lethal viral dose compared to those commonly used to assess nAb protectiveness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Although we recently showed that our opsonic mAbs are protective against the Wuhan strain in an K18-hACE2 mouse model, we did not perform similar experiments with the newer variants in this study. Instead, we showed that these antibodies retained equivalent binding to all variants tested and retained potent immune function by using the BQ1.1 and XBB variants as proof of concept. Taken together, our work with the nnAbs Ab81 and Ab94 shows the promise of using nnAbs as both prophylactic and therapeutic therapy against the current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Combining these nnAbs with potent nAbs could be one promising strategy to increase protective effects in vulnerable patients against the current and future variants.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture and antibody production</title><p id="P23">Expi293F suspension cells were purchased from Gibco (ThermoFisher) and routinely cultured in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (Nalgene) in 30 ml Expi293 medium (Gibco) in an Eppendorf s41i shaker incubator at 37°C, 8 % CO<sub>2</sub>, 120 rpm.

The spike-coated beads were opsonized with anti-spike mAbs. Detection of IgG-positive beads was done by adding an anti-IgG secondary, which was labeled with Alexa Flour 488. The binding of anti-spike mAbs to spike-coated beads was done by flow cytometry. The Y-axis shows the percentage of IgG+ beads. The red-colored antibodies are non-neutralizing (nnAbs), and the blue are neutralizing antibodies (nAbs).
