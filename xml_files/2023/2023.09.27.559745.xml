We found that the diversity of endolysins is unsuspectedly low and dominated by a single structural type in distinct phages that infect <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>. Through X-ray crystallography, we discovered that this type of endolysin contains a highly conserved calcium-binding motif in its cell wall binding domain. Inactivation of the motif in the purified endolysin or in the phage genome revealed its key role in stabilizing the enzyme under conditions that mimic the cheesemaking process, including at elevated temperatures. Fermented dairy products such as yogurt and cheeses are incubated or cooked at higher temperatures and require the addition of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> to drive milk fermentation. It appears that dairy practices have influenced the genetic signatures of streptococcal phages by selecting for thermostable endolysins, which in turn have limited their diversity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacteriophages, also referred to as phages, are bacterial viruses that are found in the same ecological niches as their hosts. They are highly diverse and are now classified into numerous viral families based on their genome composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Phages play a pivotal role in regulating bacterial populations and shaping their evolution through selective pressure and gene transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They can also serve as biocontrol agents to prevent or suppress bacterial infections in plants, animals, and humans and are being actively considered as an alternative or complement to antibiotics in response to multi-drug-resistant infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, for decades, phages have also been considered “enemies” in various industrial processes where they sometimes kill bacteria that play a beneficial role in fermentation or in biotechnology. For instance, phage-induced lysis of starter cultures remains the primary cause of milk fermentation failure in the cheese industry, resulting in low-quality products <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The ability of phages to lyse their bacterial host at the end of their lytic cycle involves the coordinated action of at least two types of viral proteins: holins and endolysins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The holin protein is synthesized intracellularly to generate pores in the bacterial plasma membrane. These pores allow the endolysin, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, to enter the extracytoplasmic space and degrade the cell wall, leading to bacterial lysis and the release of new virions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In some cases, the endolysins may function independently of holins and rely on the host secretory pathway to migrate across the plasma membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Phage endolysins target the bacterial peptidoglycan, a vital structure composed of a complex meshwork of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) glycan strands that are cross-linked by short stem peptides attached to MurNac residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While all phage endolysins have the same function of cleaving peptidoglycan, their structure and mode of action can differ significantly. In general, endolysins that target Gram-positive bacteria have a modular structure that includes one or more enzymatically active domain (EAD) connected to a cell wall-binding domain (CBD) by a short linker <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Based on the peptidoglycan bond they hydrolyze, endolysins are currently classified into four primary groups. These include glucosaminidases and muramidases that hydrolyze glycan chains as well as amidases and endopeptidases that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan stem peptides or interconnecting bridges. The CBD domain provides high bacterial specificity and helps optimally position the enzyme to degrade its peptidoglycan substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Overall, EAD and CBD can be very different, and their various combinations have resulted in a high degree of diversity throughout phage evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The reason for the diversity of endolysins is not yet fully understood, but is likely related to the adaptation of phages to diverse and changing bacterial cell wall compositions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, endolysin domains may have evolved to target essential cell wall factors for host viability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> or as an adaptation to preferred or new phage hosts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In a recent study, we investigated the diversity of endolysins found in phages infecting the Gram-positive dairy bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Our results showed significant diversity, revealing 11 structural types associated with specific phage genera. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this endolysin diversity is a result of host adaptation, rather than being dependent on the type of phage genera. Indeed, endolysin genes could be exchanged between phages from different genera with minimal fitness costs, as long as both the donor and recipient phages infected the same bacterial strain.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we aimed to investigate the diversity of endolysins present in phages infecting <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>, which is considered the second most important dairy bacterial species after <italic>L. lactis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We found that the diversity of endolysins is significantly lower than in lactococcal phages and is not restricted to specific phage genera. In fact, over 90% of the endolysins belonged to only one structural type and it is found in phages belonging to 4 of the 5 known phage genera infecting <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>. Structural analysis revealed that this type of endolysin possesses an N-terminal catalytic amidase_5 domain and a highly conserved calcium binding motif (CaBM) in the CBD. Targeted mutagenesis of CaBM in the purified endolysin or its gene in the phage genome revealed its importance in stabilizing the enzyme at elevated temperatures. Indeed, CaBM increased the thermal stability of the endolysin and its inactivation in the phage genome resulted in temperature-dependent fitness costs and phages could not resume their lytic cycle upon heat shock stress. Several cheeses are produced at elevated temperatures and require thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Humans have domesticated <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> for centuries if not more, a process that has left genetic hallmarks such as the loss of specific bacterial genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. It now appears that practices such as cheese production have also influenced the genetic signatures of streptococcal phages by selecting for thermostable endolysins and limiting their diversity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Endolysins of phages that infect <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> can be classified into five types</title><p id="P7">To assess the diversity of endolysins present in streptococcal phages, we first retrieved all 195 phage genomes infecting <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> from NCBI and analyzed their phylogenetic relatedness and gene conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The phage genomes represented the five phage genera infecting <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, namely, <italic>Moineauvirus</italic> (former <italic>cos</italic>), <italic>Brussowvirus</italic> (former <italic>pac</italic>), <italic>Vansinderenvirus (</italic>former 5093), 987, and P738. Based on HHPred, BLASTP, and AlphaFold, we predicted five types of endolysin structures. Group A endolysins, with an average predicted molecular weight of 30.8 ± 0.3 kDa, were by far the most abundant as they were found in 91% (n = 178) of the phage genomes. They all have a predicted N-terminal catalytic amidase_5 domain that belong to the N1pC/P60 family of cell wall peptidases and a C-terminal region homologous to the target recognition domain of zoocin A, a Zn-metallopeptidase secreted by <italic>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The EAD domain of group A endolysin also belongs to the cysteine/histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase family (CHAP), as the characteristic cysteine (C35) and histidine (H101) residues were conserved in all of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These residues were at a nearly similar position in the amidase_5 domain observed in the pal endolysin (C34 and H99), an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase encoded by the pneumococcal phage Dp-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we found that half of the type A endolysin genes were disrupted by a group IA2 intron, as reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Group B endolysins (2.6%, n = 5, 32.8 ± 1.0 kDa) were predicted to be muramidases containing a glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) catalytic domain and a C-terminal region that lacked homology with known CBDs. Endolysins from group C (4.6%, n = 9, 50.8 ± 0.1 kDa) had the same predicted overall architecture as those in group B but with an additional N-terminal CHAP domain that showed homology with the <italic>Enterococcus</italic> phage endolysin LysIME-EF1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Group D endolysins (1.0%, n = 2, 27.4 ± 0.1 kDa) were rare but also had an N-terminal CHAP domain homologous to LysIME-EF1 endolysins but with a C-terminal domain without homology with known CBDs. Finally, the group E endolysin 0.5%, n = 1, 45.55 kDa) contained only one member, namely the one from the phage CHPC1109. This very rare endolysin was predicted to have a GH25 EAD muramidase and two additional C-terminal LysM domains. AlphaFold structure prediction revealed an additional third domain of unknown function that was not predicted by either Blast or HHpred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We observed no clear correlation between the phylogeny of endolysins and the taxonomy of streptococcal phages, except for group D endolysins, which were exclusively associated to P738-like phages. Type B and C endolysins were shared between <italic>Brussowvirus</italic> and <italic>Moineauvirus</italic>, while type A endolysins were distributed across all phage genera except P738. Notably, type A endolysins were the most prevalent (n=178) among all <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> phage genomes even when compared to other conserved non-structural proteins like holin (n=133), or structural proteins such as major head (n=115), tail (n=114), or portal (n=115) proteins. However, despite the numerical dominance of type A endolysins, the other genes (holin, major head, tail, and portal proteins) appeared to be more functionally constrained, as indicated by their lower ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structural analysis of Lys2972 revealed that it possesses a unique metal-binding motif that is highly conserved among group A endolysins</title><p id="P10">To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics contributing to the prevalence of type A endolysins among streptococcal phages, a structural analysis of the endolysin from phage 2972 (Lys2972) was performed. This endolysin was selected as a representative of type A, and its crystal structure was determined in the C2 space group, with one molecule per asymmetric unit. All residues, except for 235-237 and the final three residues (278-280) at the C-terminal position, were successfully built.</p><p id="P11">Lys2972 (280 amino acids) was found to have two main domains, namely an EAD (residues 1-149) and a CBD (155-280), both of which have a globular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, Lys2972 had a relatively short and rigid linker segment (residues 150-154), leading to significant contacts between the two domains and an overall compact structure. A search conducted using the Dali Server revealed a significant similarity between the EAD domain of Lys2972 and other members of the cell wall peptidase superfamily NlpC/p60. Notably, the bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA from <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (PDB 6B8C) exhibited the highest degree of similarity, with a Z-score of 13.9 and an r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å for 106 aligned Cα atoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The CBD of Lys2972 was found to have only one structural homolog, corresponding to the target recognition domain (TRD) of bacterial Zoocin A <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The structure of this homolog was determined by NMR (PDB 2LS0) and exhibited a Z-score of 9.8, an rmsd of 2.1 Å for 94 aligned Cα atoms, and a sequence identity of 25.5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Interestingly, a metal ion was identified at the edge of the CBD domain and was observed to be coordinated by the carboxylate groups of Asp216 and Asp219, the main chain carbonyl groups of Trp209 and Ile217, as well as the side chain carbonyl of Asn208 and a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). While this novel metal binding site and its corresponding residues were absent in the previously mentioned Zoocin A TRD structure, they were remarkably conserved in all type A endolysins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">An electrostatic surface charge calculation further revealed a heavily negatively charged patch at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with its metal binding capacity. Considering that the coordination number of the metal is six, all the atoms in the coordination sphere of this metal are oxygens (coming from carboxylate, carbonyl, or water molecules), and the metal-ligand distances range between 2.2 and 2.5 Å, with an average value of 2.41 Å, this metal is expected to be either calcium or sodium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Although refinement with Na+ has resulted in a temperature factor more in line with that of the coordinating oxygen atoms, this may be attributed to the low pH (5.0), which diminishes the binding capacity of D216 and D219 for divalent calcium ions, and the high abundance of sodium ions in the crystallization condition (&gt;100 mM). However, it can be presumed that under neutral pH conditions and/or in the presence of high calcium concentration in milk, calcium is likely the preferred ion bound to this metal-binding motif. Consequently, this specific motif was further designated as a Calcium-Binding Motif (CaBM).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Calcium plays a role in the lytic activity of Lys2972</title><p id="P14">Following the structural analysis described above, the role of calcium in the lytic activity of Lys2972 was investigated by inactivating the CaBM. The amino acids providing their side chains for metal coordination were replaced by alanine to construct single mutants (Lys2972&gt;N208A, Lys2972&gt;D216A, and Lys2972&gt;D219A), as well as a triple-mutant-designated Lys2972<sup>CaBM</sup> (Lys2972&gt;N208A+D216A+D219A). After Ni affinity and size exclusion chromatography, the purity and molecular weight of each endolysin was confirmed on 4–12% BisTris gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The enzymatic activity of each purified enzymes (wild-type and four mutants) was assessed by measuring the reduction in turbidity of a <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> cell suspension in the exponential phase after a 15-minute incubation period with or without CaCl<sub>2</sub>. In the presence of 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the lytic activity of Lys2972 increased by 24.4 ± 2.0% (at a protein concentration of 1 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the Lys2972<sup>CaBM</sup> mutant was 32.3 ± 2.4% less active than the wild-type. Of note, an increase in lytic activity was also observed for Lys2972&gt;N208A (11.4 ± 1.3%) and Lys2972&gt;D216A (18.0 ± 2.4%) mutants, but to a lesser extent compared to WT Lys2972 (29.6 ± 1.9%) and at a protein concentration of 0.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is noteworthy that the Lys2972&gt;D219A mutant did not show any increase in enzymatic activity in presence of calcium, indicating that D219 plays a crucial role in calcium binding. Additionally, we observed that the calcium response of Lys2972 reached saturation at 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, while this was not the case for the Lys2972&gt;N208A and Lys2972&gt;D216A mutants, as their activity gradually increased with calcium concentration. Finally, the addition of EDTA (10 mM) resulted in an 11.5 ± 1.5% decrease in Lys2972 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We also generated a mutant that lacked the entire CBD (Lys2972ΔCBD). This additional mutant exhibited one-hundred-fold reduced activity. Indeed, while Lys2972 achieved approximatively 60% turbidity reduction after 15 minutes at a concentration of 0.2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), the mutant required a concentration of 20 μM to reach comparable activity level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). In comparison, the decrease in activity (approx.. 30%) at the same concentration when CaBM was inactivated suggests that its contribution to enzyme activity may not be essential. Instead, CaBM might play a more significant role in other aspects of enzyme function. Other studies have shown that calcium can increase the heat stability of various proteases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Calcium-binding motifs can also play a crucial role in improving mechanical stability by creating additional non-covalent bonds that strengthen the overall protein structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The CaBM is important for the thermal stability of Lys2972</title><p id="P17">To investigate whether CaBM has a stabilizing effect, we performed a thermal shift assay to compare the stability of Lys2972 and its CaBM mutants. Our results indicated that in the presence of 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the melting temperature of Lys2972 increased from 54.5 to 60.0 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, no such increase was observed with the mutants Lys2972<sup>CaBM</sup>, Lys2972&gt;N208A, Lys2972&gt;D216A, and Lys2972&gt;D219A or when 10 mM of EDTA was added to Lys2972 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The importance of CaBM for the stability of Lys2972 was further substantiated by testing the activity of the endolysin at different temperatures. In the presence of 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Lys2972 retained its lytic activity at temperatures up to 56.6 °C, which could not be achieved without CaCl<sub>2</sub> or an active CaBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), validating this unique metal-binding motif.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Inactivation of the CaBM in Lys2972 is associated with a temperature-dependent fitness cost of phage 2972</title><p id="P18">Since we observed that calcium can increase the thermal stability of Lys2972, we investigated whether temperature could affect the replication of a phage mutant with an inactivated CaBM. This was achieved by replacing the three critical amino acids (N208A, D216A, D219A) responsible for coordinating calcium with alanines using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The resulting phage mutant, designated 2972<sup>CaBM</sup>, produced clear plaques at 37 °C on <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> DGCC7710 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Then, we infected the same bacterial host with either phage 2972 or 2972<sup>CaBM</sup>, incubated them at different temperatures, and then measured end turbidity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences between 2972 or 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> under these experimental conditions, as the replication of both phages and the host was impaired at 46 °C and no lytic activity was observed at 49° C. A closer look at the kinetics of cell lysis for phage 2972 or 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> showed that inhibition of cell lysis occurred for both phages at 47 °C, whereas no differences were observed at 42 °C and 46 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). However, while the lytic plaques produced by phage 2972 (0.34 ± 0.12 mm<sup>2</sup>) and 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> (0.33 ± 0.11 mm<sup>2</sup>) showed no statistical differences at 37 °C (p-value = 0.1716), the 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> mutant produced smaller plaques at 42 °C (0.28 ± 0.09 vs. 0.25 ± 0.09 mm<sup>2</sup>, P ≤ 0.001) and at 46 °C (0.17 ± 0.05 vs. 0.11 ± 0.04 mm<sup>2</sup>, P ≤ 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

However, both phages failed to exhibit lytic activity at 60 °C. These results were consistent with the observation that Lys2972 was capable of lysing cells at 55 °C, provided that the CaBM was functional and that calcium was present (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Overall, the results suggest that CaBM plays a critical role in enhancing its lytic activity at high temperatures during phage 2972 replication.

The first is the limited genetic diversity of strains that were infected with these streptococcal phages. <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> strains are known for their low genetic diversity, as this species is thought to have emerged relatively recently from a commensal ancestor in the Salivarius group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In comparison, the genetic diversity within <italic>L. lactis</italic> is much higher, and up until recently it was divided into four subspecies.

Consistent with this lactococcal strain diversity, we recently showed, that the diversity of lactococcal phage endolysins resulted from specific adaptations to the host at the strain level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, the significant difference in endolysin diversity between phages that infect these two dairy bacterial species may be due to variations in host diversity, as lower host diversity leads to lower endolysin diversity and vice versa.</p><p id="P26">Similarly, the limited genetic diversity of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> strains may affect the diversity of phages that can infect this species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Indeed, lactococcal phages are currently divided into at least 10 groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, while <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> phages are classified into 5 groups. Moreover, in our study, it was observed that 62% (120 out of 195) of the analyzed <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>-infecting siphophage genomes belonged to the <italic>Moineauvirus</italic> genus, while 38% (46 out of 195) belonged to the <italic>Brussowvirus</italic> genus.

This unique phage group was the only one that did not possess a type A endolysin, which were otherwise detected in 91% of the genomes examined and in the four other phage groups.</p><p id="P27">We then hypothesized that type A endolysins had distinctive features to be so prevalent in various streptococcal phages. Structural analysis of the phage 2972 endolysin provided valuable insights into type A endolysins. The analysis not only provided crystallographic data for the amidase_5 and zoocin_A domains, but also revealed the presence of a calcium-binding site (CaBM) in the structure of the endolysin. Calcium is also known to increase the thermal stability of several enzymes including proteases such as trypsin and proteinase K <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated the effect of calcium on the thermal stability of Lys2972. Our results showed that the presence of calcium effectively improved the thermal stability of the enzyme and that this effect was not observed in a mutated protein with an inactivated CaBM.</p><p id="P28">Flexibility in the substrate-binding region is critical for effective substrate identification and binding, as it facilitates mechanisms such as induced fit and conformational selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

Similarly, the presence of calcium may also impact the flexibility of the substrate-binding region of Lys2972, leading to slight variations in enzyme activity. Indeed, our observations confirm that the addition of calcium causes an increase, albeit modest, in enzyme activity, whereas inactivation of CaBM or addition of EDTA resulted in a small decrease.</p><p id="P29">To gain a deeper understanding of the biological function of CaBM in the lytic cycle of phage 2972, we used the innate CRISPR-Cas system of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> to directly inactivate the CaBM in the endolysin of phage 2972 by introducing alanine substitutions into the three amino acids known to coordinate calcium. It is noteworthy that despite the mutation of CaBM, replication of the phage was not significantly affected at 37 °C. This is best evidenced by the ability of the mutant phage to produce lytic plaques of comparable size to the wild-type phage, suggesting that CaBM is unlikely to play an important role in either folding or regulation of the enzyme. However, we observed that the fitness of the phage mutants was significantly more impaired when the replication temperature was increased. In addition, the phage mutant was unable to resume cell lysis after a 15-minute heat shock at 60 °C or to induce lysis of a bacterial cell culture at 55 °C, indicating that CaBM plays a critical role in maintaining the thermal stability of the enzyme and making the lytic cycle of phage 2972 more resilient to temperature fluctuations.</p><p id="P30">The ability of CaBM to thermally stabilize endolysin in the presence of calcium makes it particularly suitable for phages that infect bacteria such as <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>.

In addition, various hard cheeses are made using elevated temperatures. The ability of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> strains to withstand high processing temperatures has made it an essential ingredient in the production of Swiss cheeses (such as Emmental and Gruyère) and some Italian cheeses (such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano), which typically require cooking temperatures in the range of 50 to 58 °C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

The fitness cost associated with CaBM inactivation was determined by calculating the difference between the titer of phage 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> and the titer of the total phage population. To determine the number of 2972<sup>CaBM</sup> particles in the mixed population, a plaque assay was performed using the strain <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> DGCC7710 BIM-Lys2972. This strain contains a spacer that specifically targets <italic>lys2972</italic>, resulting in a significant 5.0 ± 0.1 log pfu/ml reduction of the phage 2972 population. However, this reduction does not apply to 2972<sup>CaBM</sup>, as its PAM was modified to prevent any interference with the CRISPR-Cas system during genome editing.

Subsequently, the tubes were transferred to a programmable water bath that replicated the temperature gradients during cheese production. This involved an initial incubation period at 35 °C for 60 to 80 minutes, followed by a temperature shift to 55 °C over 20 minutes, which was then maintained for an additional 30 minutes. Finally, the temperature was decreased to 40 °C over one hour. After these incubations, the infected cells were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated at 40 °C in a microplate reader and absorbance was measured every 15 minutes for 16 hours (BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader).

Adaptors and low-quality bases were trimmed from the raw reads using trimGalore with the default parameters. Subsequently, the filtered reads were mapped to the 200 bp reference using bwa mem <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Over 99.2% of reads mapped in all samples, and the reference was sequenced with an average depth of 10<sup>6</sup> coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using freebayes (-F 0.01 -p 12 –pooled-discrete) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. To establish the detection limit, we considered 0.002, which represented the highest SNP frequency observed in the control. Coincidentally, the default Phred quality score of 40 corresponds to the 0.002 technical error rate, serving as the technical error threshold.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS188824-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d84aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS188824-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d84aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS188824-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d84aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would also like to thank Denise Tremblay, Genevieve Rousseau, Alessandra Gonçalves de Melo and Rachel Morin-Pelchat for technical help and suggestions.

infecting <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, available on NCBI as of February 26, 2023, were analyzed for endolysin diversity. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE (v3.8.425), and the phylogenetic tree was generated using Neighbor-Joining and a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model. Conserved enzymatically active domain (EAD) and cell wall binding domains (CBD) were identified using HHPred, BLASTP, and AlphaFold predictions. Endolysins were classified into five groups based on their catalytic domains and are represented by different colors. Accession numbers for each endolysin are followed by the name of the phage from which it was found, and each phage genus is depicted by a unique color. The presence of a group IA2 intron within the endolysin gene is indicated with a star, and the intron found in the endolysin gene of phage 2972 (<italic>Brussowvirus</italic>) is provided as an example. B) The gene conservation of all genes in the <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> phage genomes is depicted through protein identity and the number of phages that contain each gene (density plot on the x-axis). Additionally, the dn/ds substitution rate and gene size are represented by the point color and size, respectively.
