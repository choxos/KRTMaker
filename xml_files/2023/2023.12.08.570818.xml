We calculated the Hurst exponent (H) - a measure of temporal complexity - from resting state functional magnetic resonance signal in preterm and term born infants. Anatomical, fMRI, and diffusion weighted imaging data from 716 neonates born between 23-43 weeks gestational age were obtained from the Developing Human Connectome Project. H was assessed in brain tissues and 13 resting state networks. H significantly increased with age, and earlier birth age contributed to lower H values. In most brain regions, H begins below 0.5 at preterm age and crosses 0.5 at term age. Motor and sensory networks demonstrated the greatest increase in H. Correlations between indirect measures of myelination and H were moderate. Overall, H appears to reflect developmental processes in the neonatal brain, as BOLD signal in the preterm infant transforms from anticorrelated to correlated but is reduced compared to term born infants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Infants born before completing the full term of 37 weeks GA are defined as being preterm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">World Health Organization, 2023</xref>). There are numerous biological, social and environmental factors that can potentially lead to preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Vogel et al., 2018</xref>). Preterm infants are more susceptible to dysfunctions in their sensory, motor and cognitive systems, and experience a higher prevalence of developmental impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ream and Lehwald, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Luu et al., 2017</xref>). This is due to interrupted brain maturation stages, and from early exposure to the harsh external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Doi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Infants born preterm have important alterations in brain maturation that are reflected in more immature white matter microstructure, smaller regional brain volumes, and abnormal connectivity. These alterations in brain maturation may contribute to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in this cohort. MRI studies assessing functional properties of the preterm brain have also found lower functional connectivity and less distributed networks (i.e., more focal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).However, adult-like resting state networks (RSNs) have been observed in infants as early as 24 weeks GA, including visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor, parietal, cingulate, temporal, default mode, prefrontal, frontoparietal, executive, thalamic and cerebellar regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Doria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fransson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Smyser et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) can be analysed beyond spatial connectivity measurements by looking at characteristics of the time-signal, such as determining its level of signal complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). Temporal complexity of the BOLD signal is thought to be a product of brain criticality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Byrne and Jerbi, 2022</xref>). The brain and its neural systems are theorized to transition between critical states of order and disorder to maximize information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zimmern, 2020</xref>). The critical brain hypothesis can describe how the brain dynamically processes information through phase transitions, as there must be equilibrium between order and disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Byrne and Jerbi, 2022</xref>). These critical phases are characterized by long range temporal correlations (LRTC) thought to reflect a system primed to optimally process information by balancing between stability and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cruz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Meisel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Moran et al., 2019</xref>).

Fractal qualities exist in the BOLD signal by way of self-repeating structures in the time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Campbell and Weber, 2022</xref>). H indicates the level of temporal complexity of a signal, with values ranging between 0 and 1. H values closer to 1 are considered complex but more ordered, with greater long-term auto-correlations. H values closer to 0 are described as chaotic with long-term switching between high and low values in adjacent pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Díaz M. and Córdova, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eke et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2000</xref>). Thus, H values &gt; 0.5 are said to have long-term memory and have persistent and auto-correlated behaviour, while H values equal to 0.5 describe random noise and contain little to no correlation in the signal, and H &lt; 0.5 are said to have short-term memory and have anti-correlated behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Díaz M. and Córdova, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maxim et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In preterm born infants, brain criticality has been studied using electroencephalogram (EEG) and fMRI, with various types of analyses such as H, power-law, spectral density and/or phase locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zimmern, 2020</xref>). In brief, these studies have shown that LRTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartley et al., 2012</xref>) and EEG bursts are predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>). Using EEG, term born infants at 6 and 12 months were found to have LRTCs, demonstrating that these spatiotemporal dynamics are found in the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Jannesari et al., 2020</xref>). An fMRI-EEG study in term born infants found scale-free power-law exponents were network-specific (i.e. different for each network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fransson et al., 2013</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, however, no study to date has investigated the temporal complexity of BOLD signals in a preterm cohort compared to term born infants.</p><p id="P7">We assessed BOLD signal complexity by computing H values from rs-fMRI data from term and preterm infants. Using open science data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, we analysed rs-fMRI scans of 716 infants born between 23 and 42.71 weeks GA. We used median birth ages of 29, 35 and 41 weeks GA to illustrate cohorts of very preterm, moderately preterm, and term healthy controls, respectively. H was calculated in various brain tissues and 13 resting state networks. We also computed fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data, and tested for associations between H and these indirect measures of myelination. We hypothesised that (1) H would increase with scan age with differences across resting state networks, (2) preterm infants would have lower H values compared to the term born infants at term equivalent age (TEA), and (3) there would be associations between H and DTI measures suggesting that H development mirrors that of myelination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Participant Demographics</title><p id="P8">After excluding rs-fMRI scans with meanFD ≥ 0.05, 97 scans were removed from an initial set of 803.

Most of these exclusions were from the THC cohort (from 518 to 454 subjects). The resulting preterm group was composed of 187 infants including 81 infants with preterm only scans, 41 infants with term-equivalent only scans, and 65 infants with both preterm and term-equivalent aged scans. Moreover, the preterm cohort was subdivided according to the WHO thresholds into very preterm (VPT, infants born &lt; 32 weeks GA) and moderately preterm (MPT, infants born ≤ 37 weeks GA but &gt; 32 weeks GA). Within the VPT group there were 70 infants with preterm scans, of whom 37 also had TEA scans. Within the MPT group there were 76 infants with preterm scans, of whom 28 also had TEA scans.

First, we found that earlier preterm birth age was associated with lower H values at both preterm scans and later at scans conducted when the preterm infants reached term-equivalent ages. This was true in all brain tissues and networks, and was most pronounced in the very preterm group (VPT) which consistently had the lowest H values. Second, H values also demonstrated a network effect such that H in motor and sensory networks increased ahead of other networks. Third, we found moderate significant correlations between H and white matter estimates of FA (positive) and H and RD (negative). These results suggest that developmental changes in H are in some way associated with white matter development during early infancy.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>H and Myelination</title><p id="P21">We observed that H increases in motor and sensory RSN prior to other networks, a pattern that is consistent with functional connectivity studies in development across brain activity measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Doria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Eyre et al., 2021</xref>). The earlier maturation of motor and sensory regions may be essential for the newborn’s survival in the external environment and/or to trigger the formation of other cortical networks via spontaneous neuronal activity and input from the sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cao et al., 2016</xref>). Auditory, visual and somatosensory systems become established at 33 to 35 weeks as evoked responses are maturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kostović and Jovanov-Milošević, 2006</xref>). An fMRI study with term infants by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fransson et al. (2013</xref>) found that power law exponents were greater in sensory, auditory and visual networks than other higher order networks. We posit that the higher H values and greater slopes for H in motor and sensory networks compared to the prefrontal and frontal networks at both preterm and term ages might reflect this same earlier functional maturation and pattern. The cerebellar RSN had low H values in all the groups compared to the other networks. Other studies suggest that the cerebellum demonstrates increased growth relative to the cerebral cortex, from 24 to 40 weeks; the maturation of the cerebellum is disrupted in preterm neonates due to a variety of conditions including hemorrhage, morphine exposure, and dysmaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Volpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Spoto et al., 2021</xref>). This may explain why cerebellum H values are particularly low in the preterm group.</p><p id="P22"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Herzmann et al. (2019</xref>) assessed the functional connectivity in the cerebellum in comparing term to very preterm infants. They found decreased positive and negative functional connectivity correlation in the VPT group which they attributed in part to suppressed BOLD signal fluctuations that are associated with preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Herzmann et al., 2019</xref>). Here we show that cerebellar H values in the THC group in the current study were also low (below &lt;0.5). If an analysis of H were conducted beyond the term ages, we might observe greater BOLD complexity in the cerebellum. Overall, we find that the cerebellum network in our analysis displayed the lowest H values; however, it is unclear what the contributing mechanism would be that differentiates this region from the others, and suggests future work is needed. In comparing how H develops in the RSNs to the ventricles, it is evident that all RSNs except the cerebellum eventually surpass the ventricles during preterm age (25-34 weeks PMA). H values could signify the functional organization that occurs during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. In this current study we compared our RSN values to the ventricles to indicate the baseline level of H signalling. Since all but one RSN surpasses the ventricles, we can infer that the H measure of temporal complexity in the BOLD signal is not just fMRI signal noise.</p><p id="P23">We discovered modest but significant correlations between fractional anisotropy with H and radial diffusivity with H. These correlations were consistent in both the total white matter and individual white matter regions. Myelination is thought to commence at 20 to 28 weeks gestation, and to continue into the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Smyser et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have explored the relationship between myelination and functional connectivity. There is a theory that structural connectivity precedes - and is essential to - the formation of functional connectivity networks. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Vo Van et al. (2022</xref>) showed that functional RSNs exist in more underdeveloped forms compared to more highly developed structural connectivity at the third trimester. Another study which utilised rs-fcMRI and DTI tractography in preterm infants at TEA showed that motor and visual functional connectivity was associated with WM maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Weinstein et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has also been theorized that activity dependent neuronal signals trigger myelination through sufficient blood and oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). To date, it is clear that development of the brain’s structure and function are highly integrated, but they are not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Smyser et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it is necessary to explore the relationship between BOLD complexity and myelination throughout the human lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>H Interpretations of Temporal Complexity in Infants</title><p id="P24">Our results provide a novel rs-fMRI method to investigate criticality and complexity of the BOLD signal in infants, and these findings build on prior work in EEG. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartley et al. (2012</xref>) identified long range signalling with H in EEG in very preterm infants and concluded that the immature brain is capable of non-trivial electrical activity. Results here confirm the presence of long-range temporal correlations that are higher - and we infer more developed - in all our infants by term-age. We found short memory series in our preterm group (H &lt; 0.5) and at term we found mostly long memory series (H &gt; 0.5). Similar to our methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fransson et al. (2013</xref>) used Welch’s method for power spectral density estimation in a term born cohort with fMRI and speculated that the observed increase of power law exponent in their multiple sensory networks demonstrated neuronal processes with longer internal memory. Furthermore, an increase in power law exponents in a functional network is thought to signify more information flow and storage for longer time lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fransson et al., 2013</xref>). Based on this, we postulate that the earlier the infant is born, the less internal signaling memory is permitted to promote information flow and storage given lower H values. With EEG and according to the critical brain hypothesis, it is apparent that there is a transition between the preterm infant asymmetric discontinuous brain activity to term age symmetrically continuous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Meisel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Jannesari et al., 2020</xref>). In another EEG study, periods of bursting neuronal activity became shorter and by 30 weeks PMA low voltage activity was apparent to demonstrate the presence of continuous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2012</xref>). With the use of rs-fMRI and H measurements, the preterm infants here may exemplify the critical state transition from asynchronous/anti-correlated to synchronous/correlated processing. This type of BOLD signal processing information cannot be revealed through functional connectivity measurements. Temporal complexity (as measured by H) provides a unique way to investigate and characterize the BOLD signal.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>H as a biomarker for Neurodevelopment</title><p id="P25">The very and moderately born preterm groups were found to be significantly different at both preterm and term age comparisons. At term age, the THC group had higher H values than preterm infants at TEA. Furthermore, the VPT had the lowest H values overall. Structural abnormalities have been identified in infants born less than 32 weeks, with reduced overall brain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ream and Lehwald, 2018</xref>), and we now show temporal complexity alterations in the functional signal in the preterm group. Clinically, infants born less than 32 weeks GA have higher NICU admission rates, need more respiratory support, and are at higher risk of neurodevelopmental delays than preterm infants born 34 to 37 weeks GA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Smyrni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). When compared to term born children, VPT children will likely show lower scores in executive function measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rogers et al., 2018</xref>). These intellectual challenges in children born preterm can persist into adolescence and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ment et al., 2009</xref>). Alternative information processing patterns and inferior synchronicity and criticality has been found in extremely preterm children (&lt; 27 weeks GA) compared to term born children at 10 years, demonstrated with structural, diffusion and functional MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Padilla et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the extremely preterm group may have impaired adaptability to external and internal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Padilla et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the term born infants had decreased complexity with higher H values which suggest more organized and correlated BOLD signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Díaz M. and Córdova, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wink et al., 2008</xref>). The preterm groups had lower H values which could signify less organized, more chaotic, and anti-correlated signalling within their functional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Díaz M. and Córdova, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wink et al., 2008</xref>). When we assessed H in the GM, we discovered that the earlier the infant was born, H decreased by 0.00435 per week by TEA. This is in line with the clinical literature where there are more negative adverse outcomes for the infant with earlier gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Smyrni et al., 2021</xref>). At this broad level of clinical acuity, our findings map onto the higher risk cohort. Longitudinal studies with both preterm and term infants in measuring H would better assess if these differences remain throughout the lifetime, and if preterm birth permanently impacts temporal complexity.</p><p id="P26">With regards to H trends in aging, it was found that in a cohort of 116 healthy adults aged 19 to 85 years, H was significantly correlated with age in the grey matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). This is the same general trend that we find when we correlate H with scan age and birth age for all subjects. In the current infant study, H values ranged from 0.33 to 0.65. Previous studies with H measurements in the brain have all been greater than 0.5, creating the belief that the brain only produced long memory signals of 0.5 &lt; H &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciuciu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">He, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Churchill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lei et al., 2013</xref>). Our results in the preterm cohort contrast with these previous works. The low H values observed here could reflect a unique developmental stage in the brain that simply does not exist at any other point in life, and could include contributions from neural, vascular and other complex processes. Moreover, the use of non-traditional rs-fMRI analysis is recommended for H and other time series metrics.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Comparison to Other H Studies</title><p id="P27">We assumed that H in the tissues would be greater than 0.5, as is seen in all adult studies to date and in a previous study of ours in preterm infants. However, we found that H was less than 0.5 at preterm age in all the regions we assessed. In our previous work, we evaluated a very preterm group of 98 (64 scanned at preterm age) infants at preterm and TEA with a sampling rate of 3s and only 100 volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Drayne et al., 2022</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2023</xref>). In that study, H was found to be between 0.67-0.70 in various RSNs. In the current study, we have replicated our previous findings that H increases with age and that certain RSNs show more rapid changes in H than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Drayne et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2023</xref>). This previous work was the first study to assess BOLD temporal complexity with rs-fMRI in a preterm group. The present study used 641 subjects (187 preterm), and a sampling rate of 0.39sand 2,300 volumes. Due to the limited number of frequency values we could use to calculate H using Welch’s method, our previous study obtained the power-law slope using the entire frequency range. In the current study, we limited the calculation of the slope over the range of 0.08 to 0.16, which previously used in adults is believed to better represent brain signalling in the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dona et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we were able to build and expand on these previous findings by using a higher sampling rate and highly sampled rs-fMRI, a larger infant population and explore comparisons between preterm groups and to term born infants. For these reasons, we believe that this current study may better reflect the true H value in this population.</p><p id="P28">H measurements in the brain are method and calculation dependent. We chose to calculate the PSD using Welch’s method as it has been demonstrated to be more advantageous over alternative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rubin et al., 2013</xref>) and was used in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Campbell and Weber, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Drayne et al., 2022</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2023</xref>). Based on the criteria of sensitivity to spikes, activation, and tissue type Welch’s outperformed other more commonly used methods such as detrended fluctuation, rescaled range and wavelet analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rubin et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Churchill et al. (2016</xref>), suggested that this finding is dependent on the number of volumes in the fMRI scans and deduced that detrended fluctuation analysis is more robust for shorter time windows. However, in order to conduct fractal analysis, a higher sampling rate or approximately 500 volumes are proposed to improve accuracy of the fractal method analysis and to prevent incorrect estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Campbell and Weber, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maxim et al., 2005</xref>). This optimal higher sampling rate is noted to be a TR less than 1 second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dilharreguy et al., 2003</xref>) and greater reliability and more detailed analysis are provided with scans of approximately 13 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). Our fMRI data included a long time-window for a total of 2,300 volumes or 15 minutes scan length with a TR of 392 ms.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P29">As stated in the Introduction, preterm birth is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon with both medical and sociocultural factors which were not controlled for in this study. There are a variety of metrics to measure brain complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Byrne and Jerbi, 2022</xref>), and thus it becomes more difficult to directly compare results between studies. The use of the term brain complexity and the significance of the results produced is heavily dependent on the methods of neuroimaging and computation of values utilized. We have tried to synthesize our findings with other work in the field, but these efforts are limited by the specificity and diversity of complexity related measures. Radiologic scores were given to each scan ranging from 1 (normal appearance) to 5 (incidental findings possible/likely significance for imaging analysis). There were 24 VPT, 13 MPT and 16 THC that had a radiologic score of 5, meaning that there is a possibility of brain injuries or lesions affecting analysis. We did not exclude these infants from analysis as the preterm group already was significantly smaller than the term born group; however, we found no significant difference when including DVARS in our linear mixed effect model. Moreover, our large group number differences between preterm to term born infants is a disadvantage. Additionally, the preterm group only had a small number of longitudinal scans available in the preterm group. All the infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project except 6 THC were scanned during natural sleep to minimize motion during scan acquisition. There are implications for the type of ‘resting’ activity that occurs during awake versus sleep states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Eyre et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Future Directions and Conclusion</title><p id="P30">It would be advantageous in future work to have more equally sized groups when comparing the preterm born infants to term born controls. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate whether white matter injuries or hemorrhages within the preterm groups would impact H values as the BOLD signal could be impacted due to brain injuries.</p><p id="P31">We investigated the Hurst exponent as a measure of temporal complexity of rs-fMRI signaling in comparing preterm born infants to term born infants. Our results indicate that H values below 0.5 are found in infants which has not yet been previously identified in the literature. We also showed somewhat curiously that H begins below 0.5 at preterm age and crosses 0.5 at term age in most regions. This could mean that the brain signalling develops from anti-correlated to correlated processing. In our interpretation, preterm birth interrupts development in the third trimester of gestation leading to disrupted functional signal organization at a foundational, BOLD-signal based level. The results of this study suggest that the Hurst exponent can be used to better understand and index brain development in the preterm and term newborns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S22"><title>dHCP Dataset</title><p id="P32">Data for this study were obtained from the third release of the open source Developing Human Connectome Project, KCL-Imperial-Oxford Consortium (dHCP) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/">http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/</ext-link>) and ethics were approved by the UK National Research Ethics Authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Makropoulos et al., 2018</xref>).

White matter microstructural associations to H in the preterm group were assessed by computing Pearson correlations between FA and H and between RD and H.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>All supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS192678-supplement-All_supplementary_data.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d164aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Developing Human Connectome Project, KCL-Imperial-Oxford Consortium forthe use of their data funded by the European Research Council under the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement no.
