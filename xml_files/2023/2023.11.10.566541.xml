In such biosensors, effector proteins, for example circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP), are inserted into a PBP such that the effector protein’s output changes upon PBP-substate binding. The insertion site is often determined by comparison of PBP <italic>apo</italic>/<italic>holo</italic> crystal structures, but random insertion libraries have shown that this can miss the best sites. Here, we present a PBP biosensor design method based on residue contact analysis from molecular dynamics. This computational method identifies the best previously known insertion sites in the maltose binding PBP, and suggests further previously unknown sites. We experimentally characterise cpGFP insertions at these new sites, finding they too give functional biosensors. Our method is sufficiently flexible to both suggest insertion sites compatible with a variety of effector proteins and be applied to binding proteins beyond PBPs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Protein-based biosensors are important tools for research in biochemistry and medicine. Being genetically encodable, they can monitor real-time <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions and can be optimised by directed evolution. The minimum requirement for a biosensor is that is possess an input-sensing “detector” domain and an output-generating “effector” domain. Modularity of detector and effector domains makes design of new sensors much simpler, which is why the periplasmic binding protein scheme of protein-based biosensors has been so successful.</p><p id="P3">Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are a large family of bacterial proteins that scavenge and sense nutrients, and so are very well suited to detecting small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Edwards, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nasu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). They have evolved to bind a wide range of metabolically important ligands with high affinity and specificity, and new ligand specificities have been engineered by directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Guntas <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) and computational methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Tavares <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Upon substrate binding they undergo significant conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). For this reason their <italic>apo</italic> (without ligand) and <italic>holo</italic> (ligand-bound) states to be distinguished by receptors and thereby regulate many processes downstream in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Quiocho and Ledvina, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Felder <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Structurally, PBPs possess two distinct folded lobes that are spanned by flexible hinge loops, and upon substrate binding these lobes close around the substrate with a Venus flytrap- or hinge-like movement. In other words, when PBPs are <italic>apo</italic> (without ligand) they are most likely in an “open” conformation, and when they are <italic>holo</italic> (ligand-bound) they are in “closed” conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In PBP biosensors, the PBP’s structural changes upon substrate binding are physically transmitted to a fused effector protein so as to measurably change the effector’s output. Sensors with outputs such as fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alicea <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Shivange <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Borden <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jing <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Younger <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2018</xref>), and enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Guntas and Ostermeier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Choi, Xiong and Ostermeier, 2016</xref>) have been generated by inserting different effector proteins into PBP sequences, demonstrating the modularity of this approach. Typically, effectors are circularly permuted: their sequence is rearranged such that their N and C termini are very close to each other, ideal for insertion into the PBP sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Yu and Lutz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nasu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, despite many examples of PBP biosensors, their design is impeded by our limited ability to identify sites in PBPs where effectors can be inserted to produce active sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>), which we term “the identification of functional insertion sites”.</p><p id="P5">Functional insertion sites were first rationally identified by the comparison of <italic>apo</italic> and <italic>holo</italic> crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Marvin <italic>et al.</italic> showed that regions of greatest change in backbone dihedral torsion angles between the <italic>apo</italic>-open and <italic>holo</italic>-closed states of the maltose binding protein were associated with production of viable sensors upon insertion of circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP). This method has been successfully applied to other PBPs, either by referring to <italic>apo</italic>/<italic>holo</italic> crystal structures or by homology modelling of known successful insertion sites onto the new PBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alicea <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013, 2019). However, change in crystal structure backbone torsion angle can be an unreliable indicator of good insertion sites: sites of high change can be nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and sites of low change can be excellent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Younger <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Clearly crystal structure backbone torsion does not explain all factors necessary for functional insertion into PBPs. Alternatively, functional insertion sites have been identified by screens of random insertion libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Guntas and Ostermeier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), but these methods are labour intensive, difficult to get full insertion coverage with, and do not explain why the identified insertion sites are functional.</p><p id="P6">In order to address these current shortcomings in PBP-based biosensor design, we reasoned that molecular dynamics (MD) could contain data that discern functional insertion sites better than crystal structure backbone torsion. We applied structural modelling, simulation, and analysis to the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>) using the well-researched maltose binding protein (MBP) as a model subject. In simulations, requiring only the <italic>holo</italic> structure as a starting point, we captured MBP’s transition from closed to open state. We found that regions with substantial changes in residue contacts were correlated with the previously identified functional insertion sites, but the analysis also identified additional sites. From these additional sites, we generated new viable MBP sensors with a range of properties. We therefore propose that “change in residue contacts” is a more reliable indicator for functional insertion sites than “crystal structure backbone torsion”. This represents a significant advance in our understanding of the design parameters of PBP-based biosensors and demonstrates that computational analysis can greatly reduce barriers in the novel design of such sensors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P7">Previous successful design of PBP biosensors has relied on inserting effector proteins into PBPs at regions of putative substrate-induced conformational change. We reasoned that functional insertion sites could be identified by using molecular dynamics simulations that capture such conformational change. As a test subject for this approach, we chose the maltose binding protein (MBP). Two previous studies provide screening data of large libraries of MBP with randomly inserted effector proteins. Nadler <italic>et al.</italic> randomly inserted a cpGPF, observing the greatest maltose-induced fluorescence changes from insertions at residues 169-171, followed by residues 355-348 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Younger <italic>et al.</italic> inserted a zinc-finger transcription factor finding that insertion at position 335 produced the greatest maltose-induced change in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Younger <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Agreement in 335 as a good insertion site supports 355’s significance and shows that some insertion sites can be used with many different effectors. Therefore, the two regions of interest for our study are 169-171 and 335-348, and our aim was to find properties in molecular dynamics that distinguish these regions from all others.</p><p id="P8">We performed simulations of the substrate bound “closed” state using a crystal structure (PDB: 1ANF) as a starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Quiocho, Spurlino and Rodseth, 1997</xref>). 10 × 100 ns simulations were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A, B</xref>). Open-state simulations were also performed from a starting point of 1ANF, except with maltose manually removed, and then simulations were run long enough for the protein to transition from the closed to the open state. This was a self-imposed restriction as we were aiming to produce a method that did not require crystal structures of both closed and open states (although both do exist for MBP). We ran 10 x 200 ns of these <italic>apo</italic> simulations, observing closed-to-open transition in 8/10 of them, visible as a distinct increase in RMSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C, D</xref>). Representative endpoint poses of the <italic>holo</italic> and <italic>apo</italic> simulations clearly show the closed and open states respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The first metrics we investigated were changes in backbone dihedral torsion (ΔDIHE-MD) and root mean squared fluctuation (ΔRMSF-MD) between closed and open simulations. For ΔDIHE at residue <italic>i</italic>, the dihedral angle between alpha-carbon atoms c-α <italic>i-1</italic>, c-α <italic>i</italic>, c-α <sub><italic>i+1</italic></sub>, and c-α<sub><italic>i+2</italic></sub> is taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Between the MBP 1OMP (<italic>holo</italic>) and 1ANF (<italic>apo</italic>) crystal structures, residue 175 has the greatest ΔDIHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Marvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), although Nadler and colleagues’ random insertion at residue 171 was found to produce a better sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). ΔRMSF was chosen to investigate regions of flexibility and conformational change within the protein. ΔDIHE and ΔRMSF were calculated for each residue for each of the final 50 ns of each closed-state simulation and for each of the simulations that reached the open-state, and the mean value in the open-state was subtracted from that of the closed. We compared these to ΔDIHE of the crystal structure (ΔDIHE-Crys). We hoped that at least one of ΔDIHE-MD and ΔRMSF-MD would highlight our regions of interest 169-171 and 335-348.</p><p id="P10">Unfortunately, ΔDIHE-MD and ΔRMSF were worse at highlighting our regions of interest than ΔDIHE-Crys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A, 3B, 3C</xref>). Residues in the region of interest (ROI) 169-171 have some of the largest ΔDIHE-Crys values, with 170 and 171 ranking 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>. ΔDIHE-MD and ΔRMSF do not discern residues of this range at all. For the 335-348 range, residues did not stand apart for any measurements in MD or crystal structure. This shows that crystal structures can discern some good insertion sites (169-171) but not all (335-348). This initial analysis of the MD trajectory provided worse sites than using the static crystal structure alone, indicating that these metrics were not sensitive to the kinds of motions required to generate functional sensors.</p><p id="P11">In order to identify more subtle structural dynamics, we applied the program CONAN (CONtact ANalysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Mercadante, Gräter and Daday, 2018</xref>) to our MD data. CONAN produces many metrics on the changes in interactions of a structure throughout a simulation. We submitted our <italic>apo</italic>-MBP simulations to CONAN, thereby providing it dynamic data on the close-to-open transition. Of interest to us was the Pearson Correlation Coefficient matrix output. This matrix would show us regions that experience changes in contacts between closed and open states, so may be involved in the changes in conformation that distinguish functional insertion sites.</p><p id="P12">We ran CONAN setting the contact cutoff as any residue atoms that came within 0.5 A and then remained within 0.8 A of each other. The resulting Pearson Correlation Coefficient matrix has positive values for residues that most interact early in the simulation (when MBP is closed) and negative values for residues that most interact late in the simulation (when MBP is open). To find the most significant hotspots of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient matrix, first an average-Pearson matrix was produced, with each pixel value being the mean of that pixel’s value across the Pearson matrices from each individual simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1</xref>). Then pixels were clustered to define distinct peaks (positive values) and valleys (negative values). For each cluster, mean pixel value, median pixel value, and maximum absolute pixel value was calculated. Finally, peaks and valleys were filtered for those that were in the &gt;99<sup>th</sup> percentile of mean, median, and max absolute values simultaneously (peaks and valleys ranked separately).</p><p id="P13">In the resulting mean-filtered Pearson matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>), it is clear that our regions of interest 169-171 and 335-348 experience some of the most substantial changes in residue contacts during MBP opening in our MD. ROI 169-171 aligns with an area of negative Pearson space, indicating contacts that only occur in the open state. ROI 335-348 aligns with an area of positive Pearson space, indicating contacts that only occur in the closed state. The Pearson matrix calculated from the comparison of the MBP closed and open crystal structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>) has too much noise to discern any ROIs, demonstrating the necessity of MD-generated data. These data provide the first unifying known feature of ROIs 169-171 and 335-348: changes in contacting residues between closed and open state.</p><p id="P14">It is particularly of note that this metric captures ROI 335-348, which is not identified by comparison of crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A, B, C</xref>) but is identified by all random insertion studies to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Younger <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). These studies randomly inserted cpGFP and a zinc-finger transcription factor respectively and both identified residue 335, showing that functional insertion sites can be agnostic to the effector placed there. Another rational insertion study inserted beta-lactamase at 164 to achieve maltose-dependent antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Guntas and Ostermeier, 2004</xref>), which is at the edge of the 170-centred CONAN hotspot. Changes residue contacts seems therefore to be a consistently important factor for a variety of sensor outputs, namely fluorescence, transcription, and catalysis. From this perspective, we propose that Pearson hotspots therefore correspond to regions where an inserted effector will experience significant changes in residue environment upon substrate binding, and that these changes are likely to significantly modulate effector output.</p><p id="P15">To validate this rationale for identifying good MBP insertion sites, we used the Pearson data to guide the design of new maltose sensors. We decided to explore the areas of positive Pearson correlation highlighted in our mean-filtered matrix from residue 200 to 250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>). This region is sparsely sampled by random insertions with the transposon-based method, and is not distinguished by crystal structure ΔDIHE, so could provide previously unknown sensors.</p><p id="P16">Sequences were generated for the insertion of cpGFP into MBP every three residues in clusters 205-217 and 224-233. Sensors will be denoted by “<bold>MBP_i-cpGFP</bold>”, where <bold>i</bold> is the residue index of the insertion. For linkers, we emulated the design of Nadler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) (nucleotide and amino acid sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 3</xref>). The resulting sequences were cloned into pET-28a backbone. For negative controls, cpGFP was inserted at regions of flat Pearson space: <bold>MBP_131-cpGFP</bold> and <bold>MBP_195-cpGFP</bold>. For positive controls, two very good sensors from Nadler <italic>et al.</italic> were reproduced: <bold>MBP_170-cpGFP</bold> and <bold>MBP_348-cpGFP</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nadler <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Plasmids for expression of these sensors were transformed into BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic> and induced with IPTG. Pellets were recovered and lysed. Lysates were mixed with a pseudocytosol to simulate eukaryotic cellular conditions. The pseudocytosol was supplemented with either 0 mM, 1 mM, or 100 mM maltose, and the samples were tested for cpGFP fluorescence on a plate reader. Sensors were assayed by two metrics: raw fluorescence (arbitrary units) and ΔF/F0 (where ΔF is the difference in fluorescence between 0 mM maltose and the given concentration, and F<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence at 0 mM). ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> is a key metric in fluorescent sensor design, with an absolute value of &gt; 0.25 being considered a successful design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nasu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The absolute ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values for our negative controls <bold>MBP_131-cpGFP</bold> and <bold>MBP_195-cpGFP</bold> did not exceed 0.25.</p><p id="P18">By this standard, and when compared to previously discovered sensors, our method has generated several new viable maltose sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 1, 2</xref>). For example, <bold>MBP_233-cpGFP</bold> had lower raw fluorescence than those of Nadler’s <bold>MBP_170- cpGFP</bold> and <bold>MBP_348-cpGFP</bold>, but in terms of ΔF/F0 <bold>MBP_233-cpGFP</bold> exhibited higher values under our experimental conditions. At concentrations of 1 and 100 mM, the ΔF/F0 values of <bold>MBP_233-cpGFP</bold> were 0.729 and 0.741, respectively, while for <bold>MBP_170-cpGFP</bold> they were 0.495 and 0.523, and for <bold>MBP_348-cpGFP</bold> they were 0.445 and 0.650. By the “&gt;0.25” standard, <bold>MBP_233-cpGFP</bold> is certainly a viable sensor.</p><p id="P19"><bold>MBP_230-cpGFP</bold> is another sensor of note, with low raw fluorescence but by far the greatest ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. It exhibited very little fluorescence at 0 and 1 mM and was only slightly brighter at 100 mM, with raw measured values of 22, 31, and 72 respectively. However, this small change resulted in a 100 mM ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of 3.954, by far the largest of those we measured. <bold>MBP_230-cpGFP’</bold>s fluorescence uptick at 100 mM was extremely consistent between experimental repeats, not a result of small fluctuations around a small value, making it another viable sensor, particularly for use in conditions of low background fluorescence. <bold>MBP_227-cpGFP</bold> also achieved ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0.25 for 100 mM, and <bold>MBP_217-cpGFP</bold> did so at 1 and 100 mM, totalling 4 identified viable sensors.</p><p id="P20">Not all designs were successful. <bold>MBP_224-cpGFP</bold> and <bold>MBP_227-cpGFP</bold> had no fluorescence over all conditions (the apparent large ΔF/F0 for <bold>MBP_224-cpGFP</bold> at 100 mM is an artefact of small fluctuations). Insertions from 205-214 did not provide viable sensors, with small if any ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values. Clearly yet further factors than Pearson hotspots determine whether an insertion is functional or not. That said, the identification of 4 new viable sensors with a variety of profiles generated by our method is very encouraging, especially since we purposefully restricted our search to regions that were not well sampled by previous studies. Although our designs are less bright than those of previous studies, brightness is one feature that can be relatively easily improved by directed evolution.</p><p id="P21">Modulation of effector domain output upon substrate binding is central to biosensor design. Early PBP-biosensor studies inserted effectors at regions of high backbone dihedral angle change (high ΔDIHE), and attributed output modulation to direct transmission of backbone conformational changes from detector to effector. However, random insertion studies have shown that some insertions at sites of low ΔDIHE give substantial substrate-induced output changes, showing that ΔDIHE the insertion sites that best modulate effector output are sometimes overlooked by this metric. Here we use Pearson Correlation Coefficient of residue contacts in MD simulations to show that regions of significant contact change during PBP opening correlate well with the known best insertion sites. We then designed new sensors from insertions in regions of high Pearson Correlation Coefficient and low ΔDIHE, validating this as a new method to generate PBP-biosensors.</p><p id="P22">In this work we have demonstrated that Pearson hotspots correlate with known good insertion sites from more regions of primary sequence better than changes in dihedral angles of crystal structures or MD-derived poses. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient matrix can be accessed from only the <italic>holo</italic> crystal structure, and could even be accessed for PBPs with no known crystal structure thanks to structural prediction algorithms such as AlphaFold2, which are known to mostly predict <italic>holo</italic> states of binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Saldaño <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). A wider variety of candidate insertion sites will help with the successful insertions of a wider variety of effectors such as transcription factors and enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Guntas and Ostermeier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Younger <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). It would also be interesting to see this method applied to other sensor proteins with similar hinge-like binding dynamics, such as the <italic>de novo</italic> hinge proteins recently developed in the Baker lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Praetorius <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Finally, the most immediate impact of this work is the forging of a new, computational avenue for PBP-biosensor discovery that can be performed at a much greater scale than current wet-lab methods for minimal labour and cost.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>MD simulations</title><p id="P23">Simulations were set up using AmberTools and performed using the Python package OpenMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Eastman <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).

We defined a “contact” as any residue atoms that came within 0.5 A and then remained within 0.8 A of each other, as this is well within the limit to exclude water (which has a radius of 1.9 A).

For each contact in the Pearson Correlation Coefficient matrix, the pixel’s mean value across the 8 simulations analysed was taken. These means formed the matrix that was subjected to pixel clustering, the code for clustering was adapted from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Galloway <italic>et al.</italic> (2021)</xref> to differentiate between peaks and valleys. For each cluster, mean pixel value, median pixel value, and maximum absolute pixel value was calculated.

Plates were immediately imaged on an Infinite M200PRO (Tecan) plate reader, with excitation/emission of 485/515nm, with gain set to 40. In each of the three biological repeats, three technical repeats were performed for each condition and from these the mean was calculated. The mean value of the background negative control pET28a was subtracted from the positive controls and experimental conditions. From this background-subtracted mean value, ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values were calculated, where ΔF = F<sub>X</sub> – F<sub>0</sub>, where X = 1 or 100. For the MBP negative control, 5 μg of MBP in 5 μL (RayBiotech) was mixed with 15 μL of lysis buffer and 200 μL of pseudocytosol with 0, 1, or 100 mM maltose.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS190976-supplement-Supplementary_Material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d44aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S11"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a BBSRC Engineering Biology Breakthrough Award (BB/W013320/1).
