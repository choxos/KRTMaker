Nonetheless, both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can acquire genetic changes, such as chromosomal aberrations, copy number variations (CNVs) and point mutations, over extended periods of <italic>in vitro</italic> maintenance and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Draper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halliwell et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, chromosomes 1, 12, 17, 20 and X are particularly prone to full or partial gains in hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Draper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">The International Stem Cell Initiative, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mayshar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Taapken et al., 2011</xref>). These aberrations often confer a growth advantage for the variant hPSCs, resulting in these cells eventually outcompeting the wildtype hPSC population in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Krivec et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Stavish et al., 2023</xref>). However, at early cell passages it is often possible to find a mosaic population of variant and normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baker et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P3">This genomic instability raises clear safety concerns when considering the use of hPSCs in clinical applications, as some of the recurrent CNVs are also present in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halliwell et al., 2020</xref>). However, the impact of these genetic alterations on the utility of hPSCs for disease modelling has yet to be fully explored. While certain aberrations may not clearly affect the phenotype of undifferentiated hPSCs or their differentiation potential, they may have a more pronounced impact on differentiated cells, potentially altering cell function, physiology, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mehrjardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). This could compromise the value of hiPSCs as disease models for drug discovery if disease phenotypes are either obscured or even exacerbated. Notably the chromosome 1q region, which is recurrently gained, harbours several genes expressed in cardiac cells, including <italic>TNNT2,</italic> a gene encoding one of the major cardiac sarcomere proteins, and in which altered expression is known to result in cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Vikhorev and Vikhoreva, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To determine whether a gain of the chromosome region 1q31.3-1q32.1, which includes <italic>TNNT2,</italic> would affect the cellular phenotype of a hiPSC line and its differentiated cardiomyocyte derivatives (hiPSC-CM), we carried out transcriptomic profiling and assessed the hiPSC-CMs for altered contraction kinetics. Our analysis revealed that hiPSC-CMs carrying a gain of this 1q region exhibited an enrichment of genes associated with the cardiac contraction machinery. Furthermore, these cells demonstrated a shorter contraction duration and irregular contractions when cultured in a multicellular three-dimensional model.</p><p id="P5">These findings underscore the critical need for genomic characterization and continuous monitoring of CNVs during extended culture of hPSCs. While these genetic changes may initially seem inconsequential to the culturing and differentiation of hPSCs, they can still impact the functionality of their differentiated derivatives, thereby influencing their suitability for disease modelling and drug response studies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human iPSCs with a gain of chromosome region 1q31.3 do not appear malignant</title><p id="P6">Continuous karyotype monitoring by SNP-based array on a control hiPSC line derived from a healthy individual (LUMC0020iCTRL-06; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>)) detected a mosaic population with an ~8MB duplication within chromosome region 1q31.3-1q32.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>) that resulted in the duplication of 107 genes. Interphase FISH analysis revealed this gain to be an interstitial duplication, while notably G-band karyotyping failed to detect the duplication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1B and S1C</xref>). Digital droplet (dd)PCR confirmed the absence of the duplication prior to reprogramming, and that hiPSCs with the small chromosomal region gain (dup-1q31.3) gradually outcompeted the karyotypically normal wild-type hiPSC (WT-1q31.3) population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). Approximately 30% of the culture consisted of the dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs at an early passage, with this rising to 48% after 3 further passages, and finally establishing as a homogenous culture of 100% dup-1q31.3 cells within 17 passages.</p><p id="P7">Following single cell dilution, clones with and without the 1q31.3-1q32.1 gain were isolated, as confirmed by SNP array analysis and ddPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). To determine if the subclones would maintain their respective genotypes with successive passaging, we assessed the hiPSCs for the chromosomal region gain by ddPCR every 5-10 passages. We confirmed genomic stability for the region in both cases for up to 30 passages. Moreover, the size of the gained amplicon and copy number remained constant during culture maintenance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To evaluate the potential malignancy of the 1q31.3-1q32.1 gain, we conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay to determine if the hiPSCs would produce teratocarcinomas in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Both hiPSC lines expressed the pluripotency markers OCT-4, SOX2 and SSEA-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) before subcutaneous transplantation into mice. Tumors were isolated for histopathological analysis between 4 and 12 weeks post-transplantation. Both lines yielded xenografts composed entirely of differentiated derivatives from the three embryonic germ layers without an undifferentiated component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that teratomas and not teratocarcinomas formed. Although the teratomas from dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs were harvested earlier due to reaching the maximum permitted size faster, there was no significant difference in average teratoma weight between the hiPSC lines (2125 ± 572mg and 3075 ± 790mg; WT-1q31.3 and dup-1q31.3, respectively), and no notable difference in the daily weight gain of the mice was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs upregulate genes associated with contractility and cause a hypercontractile response in cardiac microtissues</title><p id="P9">We next explored the expression patterns of the 107 genes present in the gained 1q region. Filtering the duplicated region identified 46 genes (43% of the total CNVs) as being expressed in the human heart. Among these were genes involved in sarcomere organization (<italic>TNNT2</italic> and <italic>LMOD1</italic>). <italic>TNNT2</italic>, specifically, encodes cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a protein pivotal in regulating muscle contraction and an early cardiomyocyte marker during hPSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">van den Berg et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore investigated whether an additional copy of this gene affected the differentiation of the dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs to cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="P10">Flow cytometric analysis indicated comparable efficiency in cardiomyocyte differentiation between the lines, with approximately 77% of the differentiated cells expressing cTnT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, there was no difference in the expression of MLC2v (~40%), indicating that proportion of ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs was also similar between the two lines. However, RT-qPCR revealed an approximately twofold increase in <italic>TNNT2</italic> expression in dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs compared to WT-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs (P&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). Additionally, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cTnT confirmed significantly higher protein expression in the dup1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs (14250 ± 1722 vs 9844 ± 1340, respectively; P&lt;0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, right).</p><p id="P11">To further understand the impact of the 1q region gain on hiPSC-CM phenotype, RNA-seq analysis was performed. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed distinctive differences between CMs derived from dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs and those from WT-1q31.3 hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Hierarchical clustering identified 1287 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two lines, with 767 upregulated and 520 downregulated genes in the dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A and S2B, Table S2</xref>). While analysis of the RNA-seq data indicated that <italic>TNNT2</italic> was more highly expressed in the dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs, it did not reach significance (RPKM WT-1q31.3 hiPSC-CM: 385 ± 42; RPKM dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CM: 571 ± 71; P=0.057), most likely due to variability between the biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C and S2D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted that upregulated DEGs in dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs were enriched in genes linked to muscle contraction machinery, while downregulated DEGs were associated with BMP signaling and DNA proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The upregulation of key genes involved in muscle cell differentiation, heart contraction and sarcomere organization indicates an augmented excitation-contraction coupling cascade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Additionally, pathway annotation by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that genes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were significantly upregulated in dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We next investigated whether the altered expression of cTnT and other genes linked to sarcomere organization and cardiac contraction affected the contraction-relaxation kinetics in the dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs. Representative contraction recordings of hiPSC-CM monolayers are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. Analysis of the contractility kinetics using MUSCLEMOTION revealed no significant differences in contraction duration (ContD), time to peak, relaxation or amplitude between WT-1q31.3 and dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The absence of discernible differences in contractile responses in the dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs despite the altered expression of genes related to cardiac contraction might be attributed to hiPSC-CM immaturity. To determine whether maturation in 3D cultures containing other cardiac cell types would reveal differences in contraction, we generated cardiac microtissues (cMTs) by co-culturing the hiPSC-CMs with CNV-matched hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) and cardiac fibroblasts (hiPSC-CFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, we created cMTs by aggregating the dup1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs with WT-1q31.3 hiPSC-ECs and -CFs (dup/WT cMT). Subsequent MUSCLEMOTION analysis of paced cMTs revealed a significant decrease in ContD in dup-1q31.3 cMT compared to WT-1q31.3 cMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This difference was also evident in dup/WT cMT, suggesting that the hiPSC-CMs were responsible for the hypercontractile phenotype. Examination of additional parameters indicated that the decrease in ContD was due to a faster time to peak, while relaxation remained consistent across all three types of cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Blinded examination of the contraction traces revealed irregular contractions in some of the dup- and dup/WT-cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). This irregular phenotype, characterized by progressive shortening of ContD and amplitude during recording, was more frequently observed in cMTs containing dup-1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that hiPSC-CMs overexpressing TNNT2 exhibit impaired contraction, potentially contributing to the pathological phenotype observed in the cMTs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">The influence of karyotypic irregularities on the utility of hPSCs in various biomedical applications is a growing area of focus. These acquired genetic alterations which can emerge rapidly and may not be immediately evident, not only raise safety concerns for the use of hPSC-based therapies in regenerative medicine but may also impact broader applications such as disease modelling and drug discovery. Detecting these variants is pivotal for ensuring the quality of hPSCs.</p><p id="P17">In this study, we identified a hiPSC line that at low passage consisted of a mosaic population comprised of both wild type cells and cells with a gain of the chromosome region 1q31.3-1q32.1. Significantly, this mosaicism eluded detection through G band karyotyping, highlighting the challenges of detecting relatively small size CNVs and the need to employ multiple approaches to confirm the integrity of karyotypes. Moreover, <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs may be present in the human somatic cells themselves prior to reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abyzov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>), indicating a high degree of genetic variability that might still be underestimated in hPSCs.</p><p id="P18">Over extended passages, the cells harbouring an interstitial duplication in amplicon 1q31.3 gained a selective growth advantage and eventually dominated the hiPSC culture, although it was possible to isolate and maintain the wild type hiPSCs prior to this occurring. Aberrations in chromosome 1q are recurrent in hPSCs, with the prevalence of this abnormality increasing in recent years and correlating with a shift from the culturing of hPSCs on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Stavish et al., 2023</xref>). Recent studies have reported that the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>MDM4</italic>, located in the duplicated chromosomal region, as the likely driver for the competitive advantage of hPSCs containing a gain of chromosome 1q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Krivec et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Stavish et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>MDM4</italic> suppresses the p53 response to cellular stress, thereby increasing the threshold for triggering apoptosis. Moreover, duplications of regions within 1q are detected in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>), with MDM4 also proposed to contribute to the frequent occurrence of chromosome 1q amplifications in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Girish et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Despite this, transplantation of the dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs into immunocompromised mice did not result in malignancy. While it could be expected that the dup-1q31.3 hiPSC line would be more likely to generate teratocarcinomas due to their enhanced proliferative potential, a recent International Stem Cell Initiative (ISCI) study established no clear correlation between teratocarcinoma formation and karyotypic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">The International Stem Cell Initiative, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Similarly, the ability of the dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs to differentiate into ventricular-like cardiomyocytes remained unaffected. This lack of effect on differentiation capacity is likely due to the differentiation protocol used where notably the concentration of CHIR99021, a Wnt signalling pathway activator, is lower compared to some other published differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lian et al., 2012</xref>), and possibly because both a tankyrase inhibitor (XAV939) and a porcupine inhibitor (IWP-L6) subsequently are used to down-regulate Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brink et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P21">While cardiomyocyte differentiation of dup-1q31.3 hiPSCs was unaltered, the duplication of genes involved in muscle contraction led to increased expression of sarcomere genes (e.g. <italic>ACTC1, TTN</italic>) and <italic>TGF</italic>-β<italic>1</italic>, a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy. The duplication of <italic>TNNT2</italic> also resulted in both increased transcript and protein expression in the hiPSC-CMs. Although missense mutations in <italic>TNNT2</italic> are more frequently observed, there is a documented case of an HCM patient with an extra copy of <italic>TNNT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>), with features of the disease including impaired diastolic function and hypercontractility.</p><p id="P22">Although transcriptomic and proteomic changes were observed in hiPSC-CMs when cultured in 2D, these did not manifest a contractility phenotype. However, in a 3D culture system known to promote the maturation of hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Giacomelli et al., 2020</xref>), faster as well as irregular contractions were observed in cMTs containing dup- 1q31.3 hiPSC-CMs. Previous studies have also observed different degrees of HCM-associated contractility abnormalities with sometimes conflicting results when the hiPSC-CM HCM models were analysed in either 2D or 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to 2D systems, 3D models support the development of more mature and functional sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Drakhlis and Zweigerdt, 2023</xref>), highlighting the importance of physiologically relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems. The differences between the 2D and 3D culture models may also be attributed to the rigidity of the substrate affecting force generation.</p><p id="P23">In summary, this study underscores the importance of careful monitoring for chromosome aberrations in hPSC lines, not only in the context of cell therapy but also potentially in research settings like disease modelling or drug screening. Although these abnormalities might not manifest observable changes in undifferentiated cell populations, they could significantly confound disease phenotype readouts, Investigating the implications of such abnormalities on other differentiated hPSC derivatives also warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S7"><title>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines</title><p id="P24">The hiPSC lines used in this study the hiPSC line, LUMC0020iCTRL (female, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), RRID: CVCL_ZA25), and subclones of this line (WT-1q31.3 and dup-1q31.3).
