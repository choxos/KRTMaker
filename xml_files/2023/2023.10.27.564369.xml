Establishing successful early pregnancy requires communication between the gametes and the maternal environment as well as successful bi-directional communication between the developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) and the uterine environment. Irrespective of the species studied, or indeed the type of conceptus present, there is an optimum window of uterine receptivity (UR) to implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Furthermore, recent data in multiple species indicates that the endometrium is capable of ‘sensing’ the type of embryo present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Studies in mammals with diverse implantation strategies (invasive implantation in humans and superficial implantation in cattle) have shown that embryos with different developmental competencies i.e. embryos more likely to give rise to successful pregnancy (<italic>in vivo</italic> produced) versus those that do not (<italic>in vitro</italic>, clones), are sensed by the endometrium during pregnancy recognition/implantation and the endometrium modifies its transcriptome accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Not only does the endometrium establish UR to implantation but it also modifies this receptivity depending on the quality of embryo present. However, the mechanism by which the endometrium does this still remains elusive.</p><p id="P3">In cattle, coordinate with conceptus elongation, the trophectoderm cells produce and secrete increasing concentrations of the pregnancy recognition signal IFNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In addition to this secretion of IFNT, the conceptus produces additional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) that induce transcriptional changes in the endometrium. Interestingly, data from Bauersachs et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) demonstrates that exposure of the endometrium to the conceptus induced a larger transcriptional response than exposure to a type 1 Interferon response alone <italic>in vivo</italic> i.e. factors other than IFNT alter the endometrial transcriptome. In work by Bauersachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) no changes in IFNT production by embryos with different developmental competencies was determined and, therefore, the biosensor capability of the endometrium is not mediated only by production of different concentrations of IFNT and subsequent actions on the endometrium.</p><p id="P4">Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a non-traditional form of cell-to-cell communication. EVs are membrane-bound vesicles (classified depending on their size and biogenesis) and contain lipids, proteins, as well as RNA (both coding and non-coding RNAs) molecules that are capable of being incorporated into target tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Data in mouse show that EVs produced by embryonic stem cells (ESC) are delivered to the trophectoderm lineage to enhance embryo implantation in the endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). One of the first reports of this phenomenon in the uterus was through the incorporation of endogenous retroviral envelope proteins that are shed from the endometrial epithelium and incorporated into the trophectoderm cells of sheep conceptuses with more recent data confirming that the mode of transfer of these retroviral particles was via EVs (specifically exosomes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>)). This phenomenon has been reported in other species e.g. sheep and cattle at different points on the reproductive axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). More recently, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs from the embryo are detectable in culture media, although it is not clear if these are EV-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Additionally, bovine blastocysts produced <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> are capable to secrete different amounts of extracellular vesicles containing different miRNA contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The <bold><underline>overarching hypothesis</underline></bold> tested is that the biosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part, by loading of different EV cargo derived from the conceptus during the pregnancy recognition period.

We tested the hypothesis that differences in the cargo of EVs derived from conceptuses with different developmental potential are responsible for the biosensor capabilities of the endometrium. We have clearly demonstrated that the endometrium responds differently to embryos produced by assisted reproductive technologies and these differ depending on how the embryo is produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These differences are also modified depending on the sex of the conceptus, extending this biosensor capability of the endometrium not only to developmental competency but to conceptus sex also. Following characterization of EVs from conceptuses during the pregnancy recognition period, differences in the miRNA cargo of EVs were determined. Treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with miRNA mimics and inhibitors for selected miRNAs altered the proteomic composition of the cells, proving for the first time that different miRNAs cargo from conceptus-derived EVs are responsible in part for the biosensor capability of the endometrium.</p><p id="P16">A major factor that can influence the response of the endometrium to the conceptus is via the actions of P4 on the endometrium which can alter the developmental trajectory of the conceptus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In order to exclude this as a confounding factor from our study we measured concentrations of P4 in the recipients. No differences were observed in the concentration of this key molecule (P4) that regulates the endometrial landscape. Therefore, any differences observed in the endometrial response are not due to the enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) or delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) P4 alterations the endometrium or ULF composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> culture of the conceptus could lead to the identification of proteins that may be an artifact of the culture conditions in this study. In order to reduce this possibility, we have accurately characterized EVs according to current ISEV guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Moreover, previous work has sown that conceptus-derived proteins do have a functional effect on the endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), demonstrating that there are functional roles for these proteins identified in conceptus-conditioned medium (CCM). The differences observed are therefore due to differences in composition of the EVs themselves as no changes in size, concentration, or indeed markers were observed in EVs from different source conceptuses.</p><p id="P17">Our study has independently confirmed that the endometrium is a biosensor of developmental potential of the embryo mediated by EVs, as well as identified transcripts that are ART-specifically induced in the endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that during the pregnancy recognition period the endometrium is also capable of deciphering between male and female conceptuses on Day 16 something not previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Data in several mammalian species have shown embryos produced using different assisted reproductive technologies have different developmental potential and pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). For the first time, our evidence demonstrates that these are potentially mediated via differences in embryo-maternal cross talk during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. While we know this bi-lateral talk is necessary to support conceptus elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and required to signal pregnancy recognition, these data support the notion that more nuanced interactions occur with continuous fine-tuning of the necessary secretion from the endometrium that is tailored to the needs (in terms of development) by the conceptus. Despite substantial differences in the transcriptome of the conceptus as it transitions from the blastocyst to an elongated conceptus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), there has been limited data on the endometrial response to the sex of the conceptus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Our data show that there is endometrial sensitivity to male and female conceptus during the pregnancy recognition period.</p><p id="P18">By using an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach to transfect cells with selected mimics and inhibitors for selected miRNAs that are altered in conceptus-derived EV cargos, we have determined what key pathways in the endometrium that are altered via differences in EV cargo during pregnancy recognition. There are also likely differences in other cargo components. The majority of pathways altered are involved in the secretion and internal cell signaling. This may indicate that not only is the endometrium a biosensor, but that conceptus-derived EVs could potentially alter the endometrial secretome. One of the key functions of the endometrium is production of ULF to support growth and development of the conceptus prior to the formation of the placenta.

The search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995Da), acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011Da) and Methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus (-89.03Da) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021Da) and the addition of the TMT mass tag (+229.163Da) to peptide N-termini and lysine as fixed modifications. Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filtered to satisfy false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS190336-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d36aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the help and assistance of students throughout the sample collection phase of this project.

Statement</title></caption><p>During the peri-implantation period of pregnancy in mammals, the endometrium acts as a biosensor for the developmental competency of the embryo. However, the mechanism by which biosensor capability of the endometrium is established, remains elusive. In this study, we show that embryos of different developmental competencies have distinct microRNA cargo contained in their extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exposure of the endometrium to these conceptuses alters the transcriptional response of the endometrium during the process of pregnancy recognition. This differential response is mediated in part, by the delivery and action of the these differentially abundant microRNAs into EVs. Here we propose differences in EV-mediated miRNA cargo are responsible in part for this biosensor capability of the endometrium.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of animal model.</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that the biosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part by different cargo present in extracellular vesicles produced by the conceptus during the pregnancy recognition period.
