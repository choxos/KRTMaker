Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of soluble S from SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed this structural adaptation at high-resolution. The analysis of S trimers in situ on intact virions has the potential to provide more functionally relevant insights into S structure and virion morphology. Here, we characterized B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, and Mu variants by cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, assessing S cleavage, virion morphology, S incorporation, “in-situ” high-resolution S structures and the range of S conformational states. We found no evidence for adaptive changes in virion morphology, but describe multiple different positions in the S protein where amino acid changes alter local protein structure. Considered together, our data is consistent with a model where amino acid changes at multiple positions from the top to the base of the spike cause structural changes that can modulate the conformational dynamics of S.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The accumulation of genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has had striking effects on transmission, antibody resistance, pathogenesis, and diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The start of the pandemic was driven by a lineage B virus hereafter refer to as the index strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Early in the pandemic, the S protein obtained an aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) mutation at position 614 which corresponded with an increase in transmissibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The most widespread lineage with D614G (lineage B.1) became the dominant genotype globally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Over the course of 2020, B.1 was replaced by genetically similar direct ancestors, before being overtaken by several lineages towards the end of 2020/start of 2021, referred to as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs). Different VOCs/VOIs arose and become dominant in different regions, with the Alpha (B.1.1.7) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> variant in Europe, the Beta variant (B.1.351) in Southern Africa, and the Gamma (P.1) and Mu (B.1.621) variants across South America. In early 2021 the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) arose in India (alongside the B.1.617.1 Kappa variant). The Delta variant then become the dominant global lineage outcompeting all previous VOCs/VOIs. Towards the end of 2021, the Omicron variant (BA.1) carrying over 30 mutations in S became the major variant circulating globally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. As of December 2023, relatives of those lineages, still classified as Omicron lineages, continue to circulate as the predominant lineages worldwide with few exceptions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus in the family of <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. The 30 kb linear RNA genome is encapsidated by the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) forming a “beads-on-a-string” structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The viral genome encodes 4 structural proteins: S, membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S glycoprotein trimers protrude out from the viral membrane and are the major proteins on the viral surface, making it the main target for vaccine design. Early SARS-CoV-2 strain S harbored a suboptimal polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction (<sup>681</sup>PRRAR<sup>685</sup>), that allowed cleavage by cellular furin. This polybasic cleavage site that appears absent in other closely related sarbecoviruses. The presence of this polybasic cleavage site results in cleavage of S during glycoprotein trafficking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and was shown to be a key determinant for virus replication, pathogenesis and transmissibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Sequential cleavage of S at the S1/S2 site followed by the S2’ site within the S2 domain exposes the fusion peptide (FP), which mediates host-viral membrane fusion, allowing entry of the viral genome into the host cell. Several VOCs/VOIs have convergently evolved substitutions proximal to the S1/S2 cleavage site at P681 that enhance furin cleavage, such as P681H (Alpha, Mu, and Omicron) and P681R (Delta, Kappa, and Omicron BA.2.86) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Enhanced cleavage of the full-length S into S1 and S2 is thought to lead to higher efficiency in the viral entry process and virus transmissibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4"><italic>In vitro</italic> structural characterization of recombinant, purified S by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful tool to study this fusion machinery. It allows understanding of the molecular architecture of S <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, it offers possible structural explanations for the interaction between S and host receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and it provides insights into viral immune evasion via interactions between S and antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of this established method, cryo-EM has been used to determine structures of recombinant, purified S trimers from emerging variants including Alpha, Beta, and Gamma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, as well as Delta, Kappa, and Epsilon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and, more recently, Omicron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. These studies offer possible structural explanations for how mutations in S could contribute to the observed transmission and immune evasion phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, often by modulating immunogenic sites. These studies have also described differences in the range of conformational states of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD), which can move between open, closed, and locked states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. A direct comparison between different studies can be difficult, due to differences in the techniques used to prepare the recombinant protein, including the introduction of stabilizing mutations, different producer cell lines, lipid environments, and purification methods.</p><p id="P5">In situ structural studies by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of SARS-CoV-2 assembly and isolated virions reveal the viral morphology, 3D organization of structural proteins, and the distribution and conformational states of S on virions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

Here also, the techniques used to prepare the viral samples may influence the conformational state distribution of S, including the ratio of prefusion and postfusion forms. Preparation methods may also influence virion morphology, and recently, cryo-ET studies of emerging variants suggested some may have non-spherical viral morphology, such as cylinder-shaped virions from the index strain and three emerging variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and membrane-invaginated virions from the Delta variant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here, we describe virion morphology, and perform in situ structure determination of S from a panel of SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants including B.1, Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, and Mu.

Then, we resolve the high-resolution structures of S from the native virions, evaluate their structural differences, identify key structural changes and assess the range of observed conformations.

To assess the effect of these amino acid changes on the cleavage efficiency of the variants, virions were harvested from infected Vero cells 72 hours post-infection, and split into two pools which were either inactivated with 4% paraformaldehyde and concentrated by ultracentrifugation for subsequent electron microscopy, or were concentrated using protein concentration columns, inactivated by heating in Laemmli buffer and subjected to western blot using anti-S2 and anti-nucleoprotein antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. We quantified the amount of cleaved S2 and uncleaved S (S0) via densitometry analysis and calculated the cleavage efficiency as the ratio S2/(S0+S2) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. This analysis suggests large variations in furin cleavage efficiency among the variants.</p><p id="P8">Mutations directly adjacent to the S1/S2 furin-mediated cleavage site have been shown previously to affect cleavage efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Gamma (P681), retaining the proline at position 681, shows cleavage at levels similar to B.1. Alpha and Mu have a P681H mutation (<sup>681</sup><underline>P</underline>RRAR<sup>685</sup> to <sup>681</sup><underline>H</underline>RRAR<sup>685</sup>) at the furin cleavage site, while Delta has a P681R mutation, making the furin cleavage site <sup>681</sup><underline>R</underline>RRAR<sup>685</sup>. The efficiency of furin-mediated processing can be ordered: P681R (Delta) &gt; P681H (Alpha and Mu) &gt; P681 (B.1 and Gamma), in broad agreement with other studies using authentic live virus particles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and viruses generated using reverse genetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The fact that the furin cleavage efficiency correlates well with the amino acid at position 681 implies that other amino acid changes elsewhere in S have only marginal effect on the furin-mediated processing efficiency [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Data using variant-matched pseudoviruses showed a strong correlation with the live virus data with pseudoviruses containing P681R and P681H showing a higher amount of cleavage than those without any changes in the S1/S2 site [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-d</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Insights into the mechanism of enhanced cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 variants</title><p id="P9">Several different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why mutations at position 681 influence spike cleavage. These include i) direct changes in the S1/S2 loop charge (through addition of positively charged amino acids arginine or histidine) ii) removal of the inflexible proline 681 residue allowing greater flexibility of the S1/S2 loop and better cleavage by furin or iii) removal of proline 681 results in a lower proportion of O-linked glycosylation at the nearby position 678, resulting in greater accessibility of the S1/S2 loop to furin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">To test these different hypotheses, we generated and tested cleavage of pseudovirus containing spike mutations T678I (which would ablate O-linked glycosylation) and P681L (which would remove the proline, induce greater flexibility and reduce O-linked glycosylation without changing the charge of the S1/S2 loop). Neither of these mutants resulted in enhanced S1/S2 cleavage in our system [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-f</xref>], suggesting that the enhanced spike cleavage seen in P681H/R variants is most consistent with increased positive charge in the S1/S2 loop.</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, we tested the ability of recombinant furin to cleave fluorogenic peptide analogues of the S1/S2 loop. These peptides contained either the wild type S1/S2 loop (from lineage B.1), a monobasic mutant version, or mutations equivalent to P681H or P681R. As expected, the wild type peptide was efficiently cleaved by recombinant furin while the monobasic mutant was not [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>].

A small fraction of “dented” virions (with regions with negative membrane curvature) was observed: 38% for B.1 (n = 72) and less than 15% for other variants (n &gt; 69). Reexamining a subset of our previous cryo-ET data of B.1 virions in cell supernatant prior to sucrose-cushion ultracentrifugation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we found all virions (n = 57) to be spherical without any membrane invagination or deformation.

From 3D tomographic volumes we quantified the number of prefusion and postfusion S trimers for each variant (n = 15) by visual examination [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>]. Delta (34 ± 14) and Mu (35 ± 16) had more prefusion S trimers per virion than B.1 (20 ± 10); Alpha (23 ± 12) and Gamma (27 ± 13) had similar numbers of prefusion S trimers as B.1 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>]. The number of postfusion S trimers in each virion were similar with only Mu (2.8 ± 2.2) showing more postfusion trimers B.1 (1.3 ± 1.5).

In order to detect structural changes at the residue level, we aligned the S structure from each variant to B.1, and calculated the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) at the position of the alpha carbon (Cα) for each amino acid [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>]. Cα RMSD could not be calculated for unresolved, flexible regions in the NTD and RBD domains. High Cα RMSD values mark local structural changes between the variants and B.1.

In addition, the Gamma variant differs in the NTD next to D138Y, in the receptor binding site in RBD (next to E484K and N501Y), and in the HR2 helix bundle, all of which are known to be heterogeneous in S structure.

An antigenic supersite on the NTD has been described that constitutes the N terminus of NTD (residues 14–20), a β-hairpin (residues 140–158), and a loop (residues 245–264) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.

Consequently, these flexible regions of our S trimer structures from virions are not well resolved and do not offer a structural explanation for phenotypes associated with variation in these regions [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>]. The global architecture of the RBD is similar among variants and is also consistent with structures from purified S [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>].

Notably, Mu variant has a much lower B-factor in the RBD region, relative to its NTD, indicating that the RBD in Mu variant is structurally more rigid.</p><p id="P19">To further assess the conformational states of the RBD, we performed focused classification on the S1 region (using a mask including the NTD plus the open/closed RBD) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>]. For all variants, we identified S trimers in both open and closed states [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1</xref>]. The majority of S trimers from all strains have all three RBDs in the closed state (hereafter, closed state), ranging from 73% (Mu) to 88% (Delta); the Mu variant has the most populated 1-RBD open state (hereafter, open state), constituting 25% [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>]. This contrasts with studies of recombinant, purified S ectodomains where the majority of the S trimers are in the open state (at least 1-open RBD), varying from 55% to 100%, depending on the virus strains and how the samples were prepared <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. In our study, S trimers are assembled and anchored on the native viral envelope bilayer with all other surrounding viral structural proteins, including M, E, and N. They are also subjected to fixation using paraformaldehyde. Studies from in vitro purified recombinant proteins are either missing the anchor of the membrane, the context of the viral proteins surrounding S, or both, and are typically unfixed. The conformational shift towards the closed state in S on virions may reflect the native context, or could be a result of chemical fixation of the virus preparation.</p><p id="P20">Apart from open and closed states, previous studies have identified an additional conformation called the ‘locked state’ when introducing engineered disulfide bonds. In the locked state the NTD and RBD are in a closed position, but more tightly packed than in a typical closed state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We performed further focused classification on the S1 region (mask on NTD plus closed RBD) to see whether a subpopulation of S trimers is in the locked state. Using this approach, 30% of the S monomers in the Mu variant are in the locked state, while the locked state was not observed for other variants. In the locked state of Mu variant, a 10 Å displacement of the NTD toward the center of the three-fold axis was detected [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>]. This 10 Å shift allowed a newly established salt bridge between K113 (NTD) and E471 (RBD), keeping the RBD and NTD more tightly packed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>]. The Mu variant has been reported to be about 10 times more resistant to antibodies elicited by either natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or mRNA vaccination as its parent B.1 strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The prevalence of the locked state might contribute to this behaviour by altering the conformational distribution of the antigenically vulnerable NTD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Our data does not provide an obvious structural explanation for the presence of the locked state in the Mu variant.</p><p id="P21">It was previously reported that the fatty acid linoleic acid is bound into a pocket in the RBD in the locked state and that this may play a role in stabilizing S <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Linoleic acid is, however, absent from all our resolved structures, including the Mu variant locked conformation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>]. This is inconsistent with recent reports arguing that linoleic acid is a conserved hallmark among beta coronavirus S <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 recruits the heme metabolite biliverdin to its NTD epitope for immune evasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and cryo-EM studies of recombinant, purified S trimers show the presence of biliverdin density in both closed and locked states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, biliverdin is absent in all of our on-virus structures, potentially due the serum-free cell culture conditions in which the viruses were propagated. We cannot rule out that the absence of linoleic acid and biliverdin is due to PFA fixation, but it is more likely that they were not incorporated into S on the virions.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The Alpha variant mutation A570D modulates RBD opening by regulating a secondary structure switch</title><p id="P22">Our quantitative Cα RMSD analysis identifies particularly large structural differences between Alpha and B.1. The major differences are around the A570D mutation, in the 630 loop (residues 617-644), and in the FPPR (residues 823-853) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Multiple studies have suggested that the 630 loop and the FPPR are able to adopt alternate conformations that may modulate RBD opening <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Studies of purified full-length S proteins in detergent found that 630 loop and FPPR motifs are folded in the closed conformation of B.1, and all unfolded in the closed conformation of Alpha, suggesting that the two motifs could regulate the conformational states of S <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">The on-virus structure of the B.1 closed state is similar to the one we determined previously from BatPat1 B.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, (the B.1 strain analysed here differs by an additional V1068I substitution [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>]). The significantly higher resolution of the structure we present here allows more reliable determination of side-chain orientations and allows more residues in the 630 loop and FPPR to be resolved [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>]. The structure generally agrees with that determined from recombinantly expressed and purified full-length B.1 S trimers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">The closed form of Alpha has important structural differences to the closed form of B.1. Firstly, residues 852-855 (chain B) which form the end of the final α-helix in the FPPR, instead adopt a β-strand conformation, folding down and packing against residues 858-861 (β-strand) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>]. F855, which approaches the outside of P589 (chain A) in the closed B.1 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>], is instead packed against the inside of P589, while K854 (chain B) has rotated from its position facing the 630 loop (chain A) towards the 570 hairpin (chain A) at the base of the RBD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>]. The 570 hairpin has moved ~5 Å outwards such that K854 faces D570 at the A570D variant (Alpha) position. The 630 loop is largely disordered [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>].</p><p id="P25">In the B.1 S trimer, upon opening of the RBD in chain A to make the receptor binding site accessible, we observe an outwards movement (~5.7 Å) in the 570 hairpin. The directly-neighboring residues 852-855 from chain B are in the β-strand conformation seen in the closed Alpha, but K854 has not rotated and continues to face the 630 loop [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>]. Instead, residue F855, which packs against the outside of P589 in the closed B.1 and the inside of P589 in the closed Alpha, rotates towards chain A residues 568-572. On the opposite side of the trimer, chain A residues 855-858 have also transitioned to the β-strand conformation, F855 packs against the inner surface of P589, and the adjacent K854 rotates towards the 570 hairpin. This is very similar to the conformation seen in the closed Alpha, but whereas in the closed Alpha K854 appears to interact with the variant A570D, at this position in the open B.1, the 570 hairpin from chain C is still in its closed position and K854 appears to interact with D568 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5g</xref>]. The end of the FPPR of chain B remains in the helical conformation seen in the closed state, while the 630 loop of chain A, adjacent to 852-855 from chain B, is largely unfolded. In contrast, the 630 loop of chain C, adjacent to 852-855 from chain A, is folded. The structural transitions involving residues K854 and F855 were not observed in previous studies using recombinant purified full length B.1 proteins – instead these residues were found in an α-helix in the closed form and in all chains of the open form in recombinant protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">In the open form of Alpha, residues 852-855 and the 630 loop are generally in the positions observed in the Alpha closed form [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>]. There is some increased ordering of the 630 loop in chain C, consistent with the relative increase in order observed for the same residues in the B.1 open form. The 570 hairpin has moved slightly further out in chain A, and less far in chain C, where it is possible that K854 in chain A is interacting with D568 rather than D570, though this cannot be said in confidence [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5h</xref>].</p><p id="P27">The above observations suggest that upon opening of the B.1 chain A RBD, the 570 hairpin at the base of the RBD moves slightly outwards [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>]. This is associated with a helix-to-strand transition of resides 852-855 at the end of the FPPR in the neighboring chain B, where F855 rotates towards the “out-position” 570 hairpin, and in chain A, where K854 rotates towards D568 in the “in-position” 570 hairpin [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. We can only speculate as to the functional relevance of these transitions, but suggest that the proximity of K854 and D568 at a position opposite the raised RBD may both stabilize the folding of the 630 loop and modulate the position of the 570 hairpin, either hindering opening of the chain C RBD or favoring it. In the Alpha variant, the A570D mutation stabilizes an interaction between the rotated K854 and the “intermediate-position” 570 hairpin, thereby allowing these transitions to happen already in the closed conformation of the S prior to RBD opening [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. Of note, B.1 which appeared and became dominant early in the pandemic, and from which all variants tested here are descendants of, removed an interaction between K854 and D614, which may also favor these transitions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. In addition, our structure show that residues 852-855 at the end of the FPPR adopt an α-helix conformation in all the other variants (Gamma, Delta, and Mu), indicating that it is the Alpha A570D mutation that favors the helix to strand switch [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>D950N mutation modulates the structural variation of fusion core</title><p id="P28">The D950N mutation induces a structural difference between Delta/Mu (which both contain the D950N mutation) and B.1, indicated by &gt; 2 Å Cα RMSD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].

The histidine is at the base of the trimeric S, facing the 3-fold symmetry axis. In B.1, D1118 is oriented downwards towards the membrane; in Alpha, H1118 has two conformers with one orienting upwards away from the membrane [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d-e</xref>], and an additional density orienting downwards towards the membrane [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>].

The downward-facing H1118 (chain A) is accompanied by rotations of R1091 in chains A relative to the closed conformation, while R1091 in chain B has not moved. The correlation between these changes at the base of the S and the opening of RBD at the apex of the S, suggests a long-range allostery within the S trimer.

Our results indicate that overall virion morphology is largely spherical in all variants – we did not observe invaginated or cylindrical morphologies described by some studies for some strains – suggesting that the evolution of more competitive strains has not led to evolved changes in virion morphology. We observed some variability in the amount of S incorporated into virions in different strains, but the scale of our study cannot rule out that this reflects variation between preparations or within variant lineages.</p><p id="P32">S trimers undergo a series of structural transitions during assembly, receptor binding and entry. The range of conformations adopted by S (including cleaved/uncleaved; locked, closed, open; pre- and post-fusion) has evolved to control the transition of S from a locked, to closed, to open state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and thereby permit transmission under a range of environmental conditions. Structural biologists sample this equilibrium imperfectly: it may be altered by removing the transmembrane domain, by adding an artificial trimerization foldon, by using recombinant expression systems, by subjecting S to biochemical purification protocols, or by using different buffers or detergents. Conformations may also be removed by these processes or by computational classification. Studies of S in situ on virions are also imperfect – the choice of cell lines, as well as methods of inactivation and concentration, might also alter the conformational equilibrium. Nevertheless, our “on-virus” studies permit structure and conformation to be observed in a close-to-native environment. They have also revealed novel structural details, such as the absence of linoleic acid and biliverdin in the on-virus spike, and the presence of an allosteric route from the RBD to the base of the spike.</p><p id="P33">As expected, our “on-virus” structures of S confirm that the evolution of strains has not led to any substantial changes in the fold or architecture of S. Instead, they are consistent with three types of functional change in S. First – and not well described by our structures in the absence of antibodies – are local amino acid changes that will modulate the immune response. Second are changes that alter the proteolytic cleavage of S by mutation of the furin site. The third type are changes that alter the range of conformations adopted by S. This third type of change includes the increased structural stability and presence of the locked state in Mu, the subtle change in the fusion core observed as a result of the D950N mutation in Delta and Mu, the substantial and complex changes observed in the RBD-opening structural switch as a result of the A570D mutation in Alpha, and the changes in a putative allosteric pathway from RBD to membrane as a result of D1118H in Alpha. All of these changes can be seen as different evolutionary mechanisms for modulating structural transitions.</p><p id="P34">We are optimistic that the hybrid pipeline combining cryo-EM and cryo-ET will continue to be a powerful technique to study existing and newly emerged infectious pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Biosafety</title><p id="P35">All infectious virus work was approved by the local genetic manipulation safety committee of Imperial College London, St. Mary’s Campus (centre number GM77), and the Health and Safety Executive of the United Kingdom, under reference CBA1.77.20.1.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Cells and Virus</title><p id="P36">Vero cells (Nuvonis technologies) were cultured in OptiPRO SFM (Life Technologies) containing 2X GlutaMAX (Gibco).

First, S trimers were manually picked in a random subset of 100 micrographs from each dataset and used for neural network training for Topaz and crYOLO, respectively. Then, we performed Topaz/crYOLO training separately for each dataset due to differences in virus concentration, background noise, image contrast, and types of cameras used. Using the trained and optimized neural networks, S trimer particles from all micrographs are then automatically picked. To remove bad particles, particles were extracted at pixel size of ~4 Å (bin4 or bin6) and then subjected to 3D classification with alignment (C1 symmetry) using a previously published 30 Å lowpass-filtered S trimer as the initial reference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Note, 2D classification was not performed and skipped as the viral membrane dominates the 2D alignment. Good classes were selected from 3D classification, re-extracted, and subjected to 3D auto-refinement (C3 symmetry) in RELION. Then, lower-binning particles were extracted and subjected to 3 more rounds of 3D classification with alignment to further remove bad particles. The refined S trimer positions were subjected to Bayesian polishing to correct for per-particle beam-induced motions with optimal parameters obtained from training on 10k particles. The polished particles were then submitted for another round of 3D auto-refinement, followed by CTF refinement to estimate (anisotropic) magnification, beam tilt (both trefoil and tetrafoil), and per-particle defocus and per-micrograph astigmatism. After each round of Class3D, Bayesian polishing, or CTF refinement, 3D auto-refinements (C3 symmetry) were performed followed by post-processing.
