We demonstrate that qPISA can direct protein engineering efforts like stabilization of GLP-1, a key DPP4 substrate used in treatment of diabetes and obesity. Thus, qPISA offers a versatile approach for profiling protease and especially exopeptidase specificity, facilitating insight into enzyme mechanisms and biotechnological and clinical applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Despite a reputation for being a promiscuous class of enzymes that indiscriminately digest or degrade proteins, many of the ~600 human proteases exhibit substantial substrate specificity.

Recognition of P1 by a specific active site pocket, generically termed subsite S1, often provides substrate sequence specificity to the enzyme. Substrate residues further to the N-terminus (termed P2, P3, etc.) or to the C-terminus (P1', P2', etc.) of P1 may be recognized by additional subsites (S2, S3 and S1’, S2’, respectively).</p><p id="P4">Although this model implies that the interactions between the individual substrate residues and their corresponding subsites are relatively independent of one another, it is evident that constraints in size, geometry or charge may lead to interactions such that certain sequence combinations are favorable, others unfavorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ng, Pike, and Boyd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Qi et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, quantifying such cooperative effects requires large data sets of quantitative cleavage information that have been difficult to obtain. Several mass spectrometry-based techniques such as PICS, TAILS, Subtiligase N-terminomics, COFRADiC, COCharDiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Amiridis and Weeks 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gevaert et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kleifeld et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kukreja et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schilling et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schilling and Overall 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Weeks et al. 2021</xref>) can successfully identify protease-mediated cleavage events in native contexts or in <italic>in vitro</italic> lysates by enriching and detecting cleavage products. Yet, they tend to be limited to a few hundred sites per experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tsiatsiani and Heck 2015</xref>) and they suffer from an absolute quantification bias of mass-spectrometry where the exact sequence of a peptide influences its detectability and quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liigand, Kaupmees, and Kruve 2019</xref>). These challenges can only partially be addressed by more complex experimental designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lapek et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Plasman et al. 2011</xref>) and greater standardization of input material along with streamlining of processing and improved peptide mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Uliana et al. 2021</xref>), or by reduced complexity of input material through carefully designed peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">O’Donoghue et al. 2012</xref>). Hence, the goal of simple and inexpensive generation of quantitative data for a large number of substrates remains to be achieved.</p><p id="P5">Here, we develop a highly parallelized, mass-spectrometry-based approach termed <underline>q</underline>uantitative <underline>P</underline>rotease specificity Inference from <underline>S</underline>ubstrate <underline>A</underline>nalysis (qPISA), to quantify the activity of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on thousands of peptides. DPP4 is an exopeptidase that regulates blood glucose metabolism through N-terminal processing of the small peptide hormone GLP-1, which initiates GLP-1 degradation and promotes its renal clearance. DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, i.e., derivatives rendered less sensitive to cleavage by DPP4, have thus become two important classes of drugs for the management of type II diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deacon 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Palmer et al. 2016</xref>). DPP4 clips dipeptides off the N-termini of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mentlein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Walter, Simmons, and Yoshimoto 1980</xref>), with a strong preference for cleavage after proline in the P1 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lambeir et al. 2003</xref>). Whether and to what extent additional substrate positions contribute to the specificity for DPP4-mediated cleavage has remained unclear. Structural studies have failed to identify specific constraints for these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rasmussen et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>), and functional assays have yielded conflicting data, likely due to small numbers of tested substrates and a lack of systematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lambeir et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we show that assessing the DPP4 activity on tens of thousands of distinct peptides obtained from a cheap source, HeLa cell tryptic lysates, allows us to identify substrate features that promote or impair cleavage, including combinatorial interactions among different substrate positions. The resulting substrate motifs can predict protein half-lives measured in independent studies, and guide approaches to engineer substrates with altered stability. We validate the specificity of the motifs through applying qPISA to another member of the DPPIV family, <italic>C. elegans</italic> DPF-3, an orthologue of human DPP8/9, which reveals a related but distinct cleavage motif. Through a DPF-3 structure that we solve using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we can rationalize differences in the subsite interactions between the two exopeptidases. Thus, our results broaden our understanding of DPPIV family proteins by revealing similarities and differences. They provide an unusually comprehensive dissection of subsite cooperativity in proteases and a basis for more targeted approaches to substrate engineering, which we demonstrate in a proof-of-principle experiment for GLP-1. We propose that the procedure that we developed can be readily adapted for the characterization of other proteases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Proteomic analysis reveals abundant peptide level changes in tryptic HeLa cell lysates treated with recombinant hDPP4</title><p id="P7">As an important clinical target, hDPP4 has been characterized extensively in research extending over more than three decades. Yet, the peptidase database MEROPS lists only 34 observed cleavages by hDPP4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/pepsum?id=S09.003;type=P">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/pepsum?id=S09.003;type=P</ext-link>, accessed 09 April, 2024). This dataset supports a clear preference for Pro in P1 (26/34 events), consistent with the fact that the S1 subsite of DPP4 is highly suited to accommodating the unique features of proline, i.e., a pyrrolidine group and a ‘kink’ in the backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>). The dataset also implies some benefit of Ala in P1 (4/34 events), again consistent with structural data, but it does not reveal further sequence features that could contribute to specificity. Indeed, no clear picture has emerged from the assessment of individual substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lambeir et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This level of apparent specificity appears surprisingly low, even when considering a possible role of structural features in restricting cleavage to small peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rasmussen et al. 2003</xref>). Moreover, many of the known substrates emerged from candidate testing rather than unbiased approaches, leaving it unclear how representative the data is. To generate an unbiased and much larger dataset, potentially capable of revealing combinatorial motifs of sequence specificity and identifying sequence feature both beneficial and detrimental to cleavage, we adapted the Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Site Specificity (PICS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schilling et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schilling and Overall 2008</xref>) approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Specifically, we utilized a commercially available HeLa cell lysate digested with trypsin as a cheap and diverse source of peptides, that we then incubated with recombinant, commercially available human hDPP4. We simplified the PICS protocol by eliminating the enrichment for C-terminal or ‘prime-side’ cleavage products, and instead directly quantified peptides from treated and untreated control lysates using TMT-labeling and mass spectrometry. We could quantify a total of 53,499 unique peptides with a high level of correlation among three replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>). Based on the known preference of trypsin for cleavage after arginine or lysine,</p><p id="P9">we designated 43,314 peptides (80.96% of detected) as tryptic based on their matching any one of the following three sets of criteria; i) peptides start downstream of, and end with, Arg/Lys, ii) peptides start downstream of Arg/Lys and derive from the carboxy terminus of a protein, or iii) peptides end with Arg/Lys and derive from the amino terminus of a protein. These are the input peptides. The remaining 10,185 (19.04%) non-tryptic peptides represent potential products of the digestion with DPP4. Supporting this assignment, a comparison of peptide intensities before and after digestion revealed that most of the tryptic peptide intensities were unaffected or reduced after protease incubation, while most non-tryptic peptides showed substantial increase in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Substrate-focused analysis identifies beneficial residues in the P1 position of DPP4 substrates</title><p id="P10">PICS is aimed at enriching and detecting cleaved peptides upon exposure of peptide mixtures to proteases of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schilling et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schilling and Overall 2008</xref>). The focus on product detection is beneficial because product detection can directly ascertain cleavage. However, it is poorly suited to a quantitative analysis because of both biases in the detectability of individual peptides from complex mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mallick et al. 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liigand, Kaupmees, and Kruve 2019</xref>) and the lack of baseline levels to which to relate product peptide amounts. A direct quantification of input peptides could potentially circumvent these issues because these peptides are present in both DPP4-treated and control lysates, allowing for a straightforward quantification of differential abundance. This analysis would also compensate for certain compositional biases in the input material (such as the cheap tryptic lysates used by us), which would be canceled out. Hence, by focusing on the substrates, we saw an opportunity to build a continuous predictor that not only distinguishes substrates from non-substrates but also captures the extent of proteolysis. To this end, we devised a linear model to predict the tryptic substrate peptide intensity changes in the experiment from their amino acid sequences. Linear models (described in more detail in Methods) use a set of independent variables as input to calculate an output such that the correlation between the output of the model and the observed data is maximized. The performance of a linear model can be quantified by the R<sup>2</sup>, which is the amount of variability in the data that it can explain. In the following, to allow for a fairer comparison among models of different complexities, we use the adjusted R<sup>2</sup>, which accounts for different numbers of parameters in the models.</p><p id="P11">To determine the most important positions within the peptides, we evaluated a series of simple models that each used only one out of the six positions from P2 to P4' as a single predictor. This revealed that the identity of the amino acid at P1 (the second residue from the N-terminus) is a key specificity feature, accounting for a substantial 60.7% of the total variance of the peptide changes observed in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Contrasting with the large contribution from P1, the next two most highly scoring positions, P2 and P1', accounted for only 1.4 % and 1.2% of the total variance, respectively. Indeed, the S2 and S1' subsites are relatively open and can accommodate also bulky side chains, explaining the moderate contribution to specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rasmussen et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The other three positions (P2'-P4') were essentially negligible at ≤0.5% each, consistent with structural observations of DPP4 in complex with a decapeptide, which revealed that only residues from P2 to P2' form specific interactions with DPP4 side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aertgeerts et al. 2004</xref>). Even when we considered the first three (P2, P1 and P1') or all six positions simultaneously, in a linear fashion, the predictive power was only slightly increased to 63.1% and 63.5% of total variance, respectively.</p><p id="P13">We used the model that combined all six positions in a linear fashion to generate a sequence logo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected, this revealed proline in P1 as the most beneficial amino acid. Surprisingly, however, alanine appeared similarly beneficial. This was unexpected since proline had been reported to outperform any other residue in P1 regarding both substrate fit to the S1 subsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>) and cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lambeir et al. 2003</xref>). It was also unexpected given the much lower frequency of alanine than proline at the P1 site of substrates reported in the MEROPS database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/pepsum?id=S09.003;type=P">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/pepsum?id=S09.003;type=P</ext-link>, accessed 09 April, 2024). However, the observation is entirely consistent with the fact that key physiological substrates of DPP4, namely GIP-1 and GLP-1<sub>7-37</sub>, contain alanine in P1. Alanine contains only a methyl group as a side-chain, which provides two features potentially beneficial for cleavage by DPP4: a small size that is well tolerated in the S1 subsite and a reduction of allowed backbone torsion angles, which facilitates formation of a kinked backbone conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aertgeerts et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rasmussen et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Martin et al. 1993</xref>), Ser and Thr also appeared beneficial for cleavage in P1, but to a much lower extent than Ala or Pro. This may be explained by their reaching the size tolerance threshold of the S1 subsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rasmussen et al. 2003</xref>). Finally, some residues in P2 and P1' appeared moderately detrimental to cleavage, most noticeable proline in P1'.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>hDPP4 target site motifs reveal context-dependency of residues in particular substrate positions</title><p id="P15">Although the outstanding importance of P1 revealed by our analysis agrees well with the published literature, it left a large fraction of the variance – and thus the features that determine substrate quality – unaccounted. We suspected that certain combinations of residues could be particularly beneficial for, or detrimental to, cleavage. Specifically, a crystal structure of DPP4 in complex with a substrate revealed that the side chains of P2 and P1' point towards each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>), suggesting that certain rotameric combinations might cause clashing, attraction or repulsion, and thereby affect substrate accommodation in a hydrolysis-competent conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The large number of substrates for which we had quantitative data allowed us to systematically test the occurrence of this and other interactions. Thus, we created a set of additional models that incorporated interactions terms with a linear combination of the first three positions. Surprisingly, inclusion of P2:P1' interactions increased the predictive power of the model by merely ~0.4 percentage points relative to the baseline model with the linear combination of the first three positions. By contrast, incorporating interactions between either positions P2 and P1 (P2:P1) or P1 and P1' (P1:P1') increased the predictive power of the model by 3.4 and 6.0 percentage points, respectively. This was equally unexpected given that the structural data had shown that the P1 side chain is shielded inside the S1 subsite from those of its two neighbors P2 and P1', and that it additionally points in an opposite direction from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, a model including the P2:P1 and the P1:P1' interaction terms simultaneously increased the predictive power of the model by 9.6 percentage points relative to the scenario that considered all positions independently, and by 12 percentage points relative to the “P1 only” baseline scenario. Thus, the final model achieved a predictive power of 72.7%.</p><p id="P17">The increase in predictive power supports the existence of complex interactions among the three substrate positions that together define substrate specificity. To visualize the rich results of the final model for DPP4, we created multi-panel sequence logos, depicting the contributions of positions P2 and P1' given a certain amino acid in P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table 2</xref>). This allowed us to visualize the full model, including the numerous interaction terms (Methods). The sequence logos depict positive as well as negative contributions of specific amino acids, relative to “average” cleavage, with the value of P1 containing the positional identity term of P1 and the values of P2 and P1' their respective positional identity terms plus their respective interaction terms with P1. Thus, the total predicted cleavage efficiency for a specific amino acid triplet is given by the sum of all the three individual contributions, which may be positive or negative.</p><p id="P18">Consistent with the analysis above, Pro and Ala in P1 appeared by far the most important cleavage-promoting feature, while Ser and Thr were also beneficial, albeit less so. At the other two positions, Pro in P1' emerged as the most consistent feature, being highly detrimental in the combination with all relevant P1 residues and the largest negative predictor of cleavage from our model. Indeed, although the simpler model lacking interactions pointed to a modest negative contribution of Pro in P1' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), the interaction model reveals that Pro in P1' can effectively neutralize even the positive contribution of Pro and Ala at P1. This is explained by the fact that proline at P1' would induce another kink in the peptide backbone which is incompatible with the substrate binding mode. It is also consistent with previous work that failed to observe cleavage of certain P1'(Pro)-containing peptides by hDPP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Puschel, Mentlein, and Heymann 1982</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Thus, proline in P1' exhibited a quantitative context-dependent effect in that the size of its negative effect depended on the size of the positive effect of the residue in P1. Other residues in either P2 or P1' revealed even qualitative P1-dependent effects. For instance, Thr and Val in P1' were mildly beneficial for cleavage when P1 was occupied by Pro but clearly detrimental with Ala, Ser, or Thr in P1. Such context-dependence agrees with a lack of substantial predictive power from individual positions other than P1, or linear combinations of P2, P1, and P1', described above.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The DPP4 model predicts substrate turnover kinetics</title><p id="P20">Given that the subsite interaction data revealed through our analysis could not be predicted from available structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>), we sought to validate our findings and test whether the model could predict cleavage activity on an unrelated dataset. To this end, we used a published dataset providing the half-lives of 21 synthetic peptides (representing physiological and pharmacological substrates of DPP4) upon incubation with DPP4 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Keane et al. 2011</xref>). Strikingly, although our model was derived from analysis of peptide turnover at a single time point, and thus did not contain any kinetic information, we observed a very good anticorrelation (Pearson R=-0.7) between our model prediction score and the previously reported half-lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Thus, peptides predicted to be good substrates according to a high model score had short half-lives, whereas low-scoring peptides had longer half-lives. Notably, this analysis also confirmed that in the context of extended peptides, alanine in P1 can indeed be as beneficial for cleavage as proline, exemplified by GRF-amide, which starts with the tripeptide YAD, as one of the most rapidly processed substrates of DPP4 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Comprehensive qPISA data provide a basis for protein engineering</title><p id="P21">Human DPP4 is a key regulator of blood glucose level, which it controls chiefly through processing of the incretin Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP-1<sub>(7-37)</sub>).

To achieve clinical utility, GLP-1RAs such as semaglutide required stabilization against DPP4-mediated cleavage, and modifications that include the replacement of Ala in the P1 position with Gly or 2-aminoisobutyric acid helped to increase the half-life to a maximum of about 165 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lovshin 2017</xref>). Since further GLP-1RA stabilization would simplify medication schedules that require subcutaneous injections, there is a continued interest in further increasing its half-life without compromising its agonist function. However, the protein engineering space is limited by the fact that the amino terminus of GLP-1<sub>(7-37)</sub> is deeply embedded in the GLP-1 receptor transmembrane core and required for full receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhang et al. 2017</xref>). Hence, the ability to modulate ‘cleavability' at additional sites may help to meet the competing requirements of stabilization and maintenance of biological activity.</p><p id="P22">To provide proof-of-principle that our approach can be used to expand the substrate engineering space on a peptide of interest, we assayed the activity of hDPP4 on different 12 residue-long synthetic peptides representing the N-terminus of GLP-1<sub>(7-37)</sub> and variants thereof. As GLP-1<sub>(7-37)</sub> starts with HAE, we investigated the effect of altering P2 (from His to Asp) and/or P1' (from Glu to Pro), two of the most inhibitory amino acids towards cleavage for peptides containing Ala in P1 according to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, second panel). Product formation from the canonical substrate (HAE) in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay was essentially complete within ≤ 30 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). By contrast, replacement of His at P2 with Asp (DAE) yielded greatly decreased product levels at all time points and continued product accumulation over 120 minutes, consistent with the model prediction of reduced DPP4 activity on this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). No measurable product generation was observed in buffer-only control reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Additionally, and again consistent with the model prediction, replacement of glutamate in P1' with proline (either alone, in the HAP peptide, or together with aspartate in P2, DAP) completely abrogated product formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). The introduction of proline in P1' may destabilize the GLP-1 helix fold, which is important for receptor binding, thus negatively affecting activity. However, molecular modeling, using the GLP-1 structure bound to its receptor described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>), suggested that aspartate in P2 will likely be well tolerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).

In agreement with the results for DPP4, we found that Pro, Ala, Thr and Ser in P1 were all favorable for substrate cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

Confirming robustness of the results, we repeated DPF-3 qPISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl.

By contrast, the correlation was much lower (R=0.76) with the parameters of the DPP4 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">To visualize the differences in the specificities of DPF-3 and DPP4, we subtracted the model parameters and generated a new sequence logo depicting the differences between the two enzymes. This analysis confirmed the greater preference of DPP4 vs. DPF-3 for Ala, Ser and Gly at P1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl.

Thus, Asp or Glu in P2 were broadly detrimental for DPF-3-mediated cleavage, but much more context-dependent for DPP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl.

In P1', both enzymes prefer aromatic or hydrophobic residues, but the effect is generally stronger for DPF-3 than DPP4, and for both enzymes less pronounced when P1 is occupied by Pro than any other amino acid.</p><p id="P28">Finally, we asked if the two models could detect differences in the specificity of DPF-3 and DPP4 at the single peptide level. To this end, we predicted the cleavage efficiency for all the detected tryptic peptides using both models separately and compared the two output scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This showed that one group of peptides was predicted to undergo efficient cleavage according to both models, while specific subsets of peptides were predicted to undergo preferential cleavage by either DPF-3 or DPP4.

The map was interpretable for residues 37-123, 259-431, and 470-916. The resolution varied between 2 Å and 6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl. Fig. 4, 5</xref>).

Moreover, no outstanding differences regarding residue positions or side chain conformations were evident in the structure to explain altered specificities between DPF-3 and DPP4. Instead, the divergent enzymatic footprints appear best explained by differences in the S2 and S1’ subsites. Unlike DPP4, DPF-3 contains an acidic residue (E309) but lacks a bulged loop inserting a hydrophobic/aromatic residue (F357 in DPP4) into the S2 subsite, which alters its geometry and chemical environment substantially. E309, which structurally aligns with a serine in DPP4 (S209), is adjacent to the double glutamate motif that is required to position the terminal NH3<sup>+</sup> group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Thoma et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P31">This difference between the two proteins is consistent with the stronger negative contribution of acidic residues, i.e., Asp and Glu, at P2 in DPF-3 relative to DPP4. A decreased tolerance for certain amino acids in S2 may also require a greater contribution from the other subsites for efficient cleavage, thus offering a potential explanation of DPF-3’s clear preference for P1(Pro) with its optimal S1 subsite binding and the constrained substrate backbone.</p><p id="P32">Another significant difference from DPP4 is the presence of an isoleucine (I705) in the S1’ subsite of DPF-3 that is oriented towards the P1' substrate position. In DPP4, the corresponding side chain is a serine (S552), which is retracted from the substrate along with a segment of the loop. This difference is consistent with DPF-3’s enhanced preference for several hydrophobic and all aromatic amino acids at P1', because the isoleucine may facilitate hydrophobic packing of these side chains to contribute to substrate binding or positioning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Detailed knowledge of substrate specificity and its underlying mechanisms not only reveals physiological and pathological functions of proteases, but also facilitates their clinical and biotechnological application, for instance by instructing protein engineering approaches to optimize protease substrates.

Nonetheless, certain peptides may be excluded from analysis, e.g., in the current implementation with tryptic lysates, substrates containing arginine or lysine in P1 will be depleted. However, digestion with other proteases such as GluC, Chymotrypsin, AspN, or elastase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dau, Bartolomucci, and Rappsilber 2020</xref>) can be utilized to ensure sufficient diversity as previously achieved for PICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schilling and Overall 2008</xref>).

These account for about 10 % (71/703) of human proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rawlings et al. 2018</xref>) and their inability to cleave internally in proteins has made it challenging to study them with techniques such as synthetic peptide libraries (because each peptide encodes only one potential cleavage site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">O’Donoghue et al. 2012</xref>) or non-mass-spectrometry-based large-scale methods such as phage-display that exploit endoproteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Matthews and Wells 1993</xref>). For exopeptidases, our analysis can exploit the fact that the cleavage site can be anchored to the protein terminus when analyzing substrates. Nonetheless, we propose that it can also be extended to endopeptidases. In this case, identification of matching pairs (or trios) of changing substrates and products would be needed to assign sites of cleavage. This will be facilitated by the numerous tools that have previously been developed to determine such cleavages. Sufficiently large number of quantifiable peptide changes may thus require additional adaptations to sample preparation and data analysis to account for the variable detectability of individual peptides in complex mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mallick et al. 2007</xref>).

Nonetheless, and given that a preference for P1(Pro) could be well explained by available structural data, we were surprised by the similar level of activity DPP4 achieved on substrates containing P1(Ala). This is unlikely to be an artifact of qPISA since among the five most short-lived substrates whose half-lives were examined by Keane et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Keane et al. 2011</xref>), two carried P1(Ala), including the least stable substrate, GRF-amide.</p><p id="P38">Despite a major contribution from P1, its identity does not fully specify activity of DPP4. Whether and to what extent other positions contribute has remained largely unknown, in part because most studies were limited to a relatively small number of substrates, and technological differences prevented comparisons across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lambeir et al. 2003</xref>). In our analysis, ~40% of variance in the data remained unaccounted in a model that focused exclusively on P1. Importantly, isolated consideration of additional substrate positions provided little further information, and only the combination of residues led to a substantial increase in variance explained. In other words, the impact of the identity of P2 or P1' (on which we focused), can only be understood in the context of the identity of P1. We propose that this context dependency prevented the previous, smaller studies from reaching a consensus in understanding the relevance of these residues.</p><p id="P39">Given the architecture of the DPP4 active site, cooperative interactions appear best explained by indirect effects of P2 and P1' on P1. For example, side chains packing in a specific way against residues in the S2 and S1’ subsites could influence the positioning or backbone geometry, thus aiding in or competing with hydrolysis-competent engagement of the scissile bond. Since proline in P1 on the other hand has a strong positioning effect for the P2 residue due to its constrained backbone geometry and its superior accommodation in the S1 subsite, it may be more compatible than any other residue with the negative effects of certain side chains that are not well tolerated in the S2 subsite. Further changes in the S2 and S1’ subsites of DPF-3 relative to DPP4 may then explain why combinatorial effects seem to be even more extensive for DPF-3.</p><p id="P40">Coverage by our data permitted a near complete survey of the 1,200 dipeptide combinations involving P2:P1, P1:P1', and P2:P1' (3x20<sup>2</sup>), and these combinations were sufficient to explain most of the experimentally observed substrate specificities. Yet, ~30% of variance in the data remained unexplained.

Linear models are a class of simple but highly interpretable continuous predictors. Given a set of independent variables as input, a linear model calculates an output based on a weighted sum of the independent variables plus an intercept. The weights and the intercept represent the model parameters and are fit such that the correlation between the output of the model and the observed data is maximized. Categorical variables such as amino acid sequence (20 possible values) can be incorporated into a linear model by converting the categorical variable with 20 possible states into 20-1=19 dummy variables. The “left out” amino acid is represented by zeros in all of the 19 dummy variables. Multiple amino acid positions can be incorporated by concatenating blocks of dummy variables. Effects of cooperativity between pairs of amino acid positions can be incorporated by including interaction terms. The performance of a linear model is typically quantified by R^2 which is the amount of variability in the data that it can explain. Here we use a slight variation, namely the adjusted R^2. This measure attempts to account for the complexity of the model and allows for a more fair comparison between models that contain different numbers of parameters.</p><p id="P48">Once we had identified and fit the final model that included parameters for the position effects of P2, P1, and P1' as well as interaction effects of P2:P1 and P1:P1', we extracted all the coefficients and rearranged them into derived terms that allowed for simpler interpretability and visualization (i.e., in sequence logos). To do so, we first added back the left-out amino acids at all positions and interaction terms at a value of zero and mean normalized all the coefficients. Secondly, we moved the contributions of P2 and P1' into the interaction terms of P2:P1 and P1:P1' which reduced the total number of terms that need to be added up for every prediction from 6 (Intercept,P2,P1,P1',P2:P1,P1:P1') to only 4 (Intercept,P1,P2:P1,P1:P1'). Thirdly we moved the intercept term and all the shifts caused by the various mean normalization steps into the coefficients of P1.
