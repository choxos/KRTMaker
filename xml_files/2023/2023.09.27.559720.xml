A caveat with this hypothesis is the temporo-spatial divide between plaques and NFTs. This has been addressed by the inclusion of soluble species of Aβ and tau in the revised amyloid cascade hypothesis, however, the demonstration of a correlative relationship between Aβ and tau burden in post-mortem human tissue has remained elusive. Employing frozen and fixed frontal cortex grey and associated white matter tissue from non-AD controls (Con; n=39) and Alzheimer’s diseases (AD) cases (n=21), biochemical and immunohistochemical measures of Aβ and AT-8 phosphorylated tau were assessed. Native-state dot-blot from crude tissue lysates demonstrated robust correlations between intraregional Aβ and AT-8 tau, such increases in Aβ immunoreactivity conferred increases in AT-8 immunoreactivity, both when considered across the entire cohort as well as separately in Con and AD cases. In contrast, no such association between Aβ plaques and AT-8 were reported when using immunohistochemical measurements. However, when using the non-amyloid precursor protein cross reactive MOAB-2, antibody to measure intracellular Aβ within a subset of cases, a similar correlative relationship with AT-8 tau as that observed in biochemical analysis was observed. Collectively our data suggests that accumulating intracellular Aβ may influence AT-8 pathology. Despite the markedly lower levels of phospho-tau in non-AD controls correlative relationships between AT-8 phospho-tau and Aβ as measured in both biochemical and immunohistochemical assays were more robust in non-AD controls, suggesting a physiological association of Aβ production and tau phosphorylation, at least within the frontal cortex. Such interactions between regional Aβ load and phospho-tau load may become modified with disease potentially, as a consequence of interregional tau seed propagation, and thus may diminish the linear relationship observed between Aβ and phospho-tau in non-AD controls. This study provides evidence supportive of the revised amyloid cascade hypothesis, and demonstrates an associative relationship between AT-8 tau pathology and intracellular Aβ but not extracellular Aβ plaques.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The original amyloid cascade hypothesis stated that the extracellular deposition of insoluble beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques drives intracellular tau phosphorylation, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and the subsequent neurodegeneration which underlies the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Owing to the lack of correlation between plaque burden and cognitive impairment, as well as a growing understanding of the toxicity of fibrillar and pre-fibrillar intermediate species, the hypothesis has been revised to include roles for Aβ oligomers and tau oligomers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Whilst the recent outcomes of plaque clearing and Aβ oligomer targeted immunotherapies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] support this revised amyloid cascade hypothesis, several inconsistencies relating to the interaction of Aβ and tau remain.</p><p id="P3">Foremost, is the spatio-temporal disconnect between the emergence and progression of Aβ plaque and tau NFT pathology. Based on the post-mortem neuropathological Thal phases of Aβ deposition and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies Aβ plaques originate within the neocortex, specifically within the orbito-frontal and medial parietal cortices, before spreading to the hippocampus, the brain stem and cerebellum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In contrast, as reflected by Braak NFT staging, tau pathology initially occurs in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and subsequently spreads to the lateral temporal and parietal cortices and finally to the frontal and occipital cortices[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Cross sectional population studies further highlight the independent nature of the two hallmark pathologies, reporting that tau pathology consistent with Braak Stages I-II, occurs more readily with age than that of plaque depositions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Consequently, Aβ deposition is not a prerequisite for NFT formation in aging, nor in the cases of primary tauopathies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The independence of tau pathology from Aβ plaques is particularly evident in cases of primary age-related tauopathies (PART), which present with AD related NFTs in a spatial pattern consistent with Braak NFT stages up to stage IV without Aβ plaque deposition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Moreover, the demonstration of prion-like spreading via tau seed templating and pathology propagation, provides a mechanistic process by which the presence of tau pathology may occur independent from the influence of Aβ plaques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Such tau seed propagation of pathology likely contributes to the progression of tau pathology in many tauopathies, including AD.</p><p id="P5">Taken together, the direct causation of NFTs, purely as a consequence of Aβ plaque burden is difficult to ratify, with the differential emergence in time and space of the neuropathological hallmarks, as well as the independent occurrence of tau aggregations in other neurodegenerative conditions.</p><p id="P6">However, it remains likely that plaque deposition or rather the process of amyloid plaque formation, influences the generation of tau pathology. This is perhaps most strongly supported by numerous biochemical studies of human brain tissue, which report robust correlations with pathological Aβ and tau species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Despite the close relationship between tau and Aβ levels in various biochemical assays, histochemical approaches frequently fail to detect such correlations. The disconnect between biochemical and histochemical analysis clearly highlights differences in the pathological species measured within the different methodological approaches.</p><p id="P7">In line with the revised amyloid cascade hypothesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], a range of experimental models demonstrate that soluble pathological species of both tau and Aβ exert toxic influence within the brain, evident in injection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], familial AD (FAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], tauopathy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] mouse models and cell culture approaches[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Whilst APP centric FAD mouse models, do not develop NFTs, there is clear evidence of increased tau phosphorylation within these models. Moreover in multi-genic mice, in which a human mutant tau gene is included, APP centric mutations can accelerate and enhance NFT pathology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, evidence for the induction of tau pathology following Aβ intracerebral delivery is sparse in non-transgenic animals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and even in tau transgenic mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Whilst there are several possible explanations for the failure of exogenous Aβ to drive tau pathology in-vivo, one possible contributing factor is that the sole delivery of Aβ to the extracellular space may not be sufficient to drive tau pathology. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that intracellular Aβ accumulation may also play a role in the pathobiology of AD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], influencing cellular dysfunction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and tau phosphorylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Despite the potential for non-plaque Aβ to contribute to the production of tau pathology, few studies have sought to examine both biochemical and immunohistochemical quantification of Aβ and tau pathology within the same cases, thus, allowing for a direct comparison between the correlative strength of total Aβ, plaque Aβ and intracellular Aβ with tau pathology. This current study aimed to quantify such parameters across cases to establish potential correlative relationships between pathological species in order to further understand the influence that Aβ, in various forms, may have upon the regional generation of tau pathology, both in neuropathologically confirmed cases of AD as well as non-AD control cases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human post-mortem brain tissue</title><p id="P10">A study cohort of post-mortem human brains from clinico-pathologically classified AD (n=21) and non-neurodegenerative control cases (Con, n=39) was obtained from the Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource (NBTR).

Despite a numerically higher mean within the GM compared to the WM, there was no statistically significant difference between the magnitude of increase between GM and WM in AD cases (p&gt;0.05). Similarly, when Aβ levels were examined based on the neuropathological cohort stratification of Non-AD and AD, elevations were apparent within the GM (3.35±0.59 fold c.f non-AD, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig1 a.ii + c.ii</xref>) and WM (2.56±0.56 fold c.f non-AD, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig1 a.ii + b.ii</xref>) of AD cases. Again, no difference between the magnitude of increase within AD cases relative to control cases was observed between GM and WM (p&gt;0.05).</p><p id="P23">Such an outcome from the analysis of phospho-tau and Aβ between AD and non-AD cases is not surprising but serves to validate the use of dot-blots to measure biochemical changes in phospho-tau and Aβ.</p><p id="P24">To further place the observed changes of tau and Aβ within the context of disease progression, the cohort was subdivided into their respective Braak stages (0-VI) and the association of crude lysate measures of AT-8 phospho-tau and Aβ with disease progression was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 c.i + ii</xref>). Phospho-tau AT-8 immunoreactivity correlated with increasing Braak stages when considered across the entire cohort within the GM (r=0.7, p&lt;0.001) as well as in the WM (r=0.67, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, a modest but significant correlation between Braak NFT stage and age was reported (r=0.34, p&lt;0.05) although age did not correlate with biochemical measures of AT-8 (p&gt;0.05, data not shown). Correlations between AT-8 immunoreactivity and Braak NFT remained when adjusting for age (r=0.62 and r=0.57 for GM and WM respectively, p&lt;0.001 for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig 1 c</xref>). Interestingly when probed for the stage at which phospho-tau levels were significantly elevated from that of “pathologically-free” Braak stage 0 cases, Braak stage IV was indicated (p&lt;0.05, for both GM and WM). Braak stage IV being the stage prior to gross affection of the frontal cortex with NFTs. Furthermore, when split according to neuropathological diagnosis, and controlled for age, a significant correlation was observed in the non-AD control group in GM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 c.i</xref>, r=0.47, p&lt;0.01) and WM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c.i</xref>, r=0.43, p&lt;0.05), but not in AD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 c.i</xref>, p&gt;0.05). Together the data suggest that in non-AD control cases, AT-8 phospho-tau increases within the frontal cortex in line with the intra-regional spatial AT-8 positive NFT progression, somewhat independent of age. Thus, initial levels of frontal cortex AT-8 positive phospho-tau may be regionally generated.</p><p id="P25">Following a similar line of investigation for the accumulation of Aβ in relation to disease progression, Aβ levels were correlated with individual Braak NFT stages. Across the entire cohort, robust correlations were reported for both the GM (r=0.67, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig 1 d</xref>) and WM (r=0.6, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig 1 d</xref>). Again, correlations remained when controlling for age (r=0.54 and r=0.53 for GM and WM respectively, p&lt;0.001 for both). In line with observations of AT-8 phospho-tau, individual comparisons with Braak 0 cases reported an initial significant elevation from the “pathologically-free” baseline at Braak 4, in GM and WM samples (p&lt;0.05).

Similar to correlation with Braak staging, all other neuropathological classifications also reported robust correlations when considered as a single cohort (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S.table 2</xref>). When considering Non-AD controls only, significant correlation with AT8 phospho-tau was only apparent with CERAD scores for GM and WM (r=0.4, p&lt;0.05 and r=0.47, p&lt;0.001, respectively) whilst GM and WM scores for Aβ correlated with Thal, CERAD and NIA-AA (r=0.38-0.52, p&lt;0.05, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S.table 2</xref> for full details).

Based on % area coverage, AT-8 immunoreactivity, a composite of NFTs and NTs reported a marked ~ 100 fold increase in % coverage in the frontal grey matter of AD cases compared to controls (7.6±2.5% vs. 0.07±0.02%, in AD and non-AD cases respectively, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 b.i</xref>). Equally, quantification of the % area coverage of Aβ plaques between AD cases and non-AD controls, also, unsurprisingly reported a significant increase with the AD cases (14.26±1.7% cf. 3.55±1%, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 b.ii</xref>).</p><p id="P29">When measures were considered in relation to progressive Braak NFT staging, AT-8 phospho-tau (r=0.55, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 c.i</xref>) and Aβ plaques (r=0.67, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 c.ii</xref>) strongly correlated with Braak stage, following a correction for age. Again, a significant elevation in AT-8 phospho-tau and Aβ plaque coverage from “pathologically-free” Braak stage 0 cases was reported at Braak Stage IV (p&lt;0.05), in line with observations from biochemical measurements. When controlling for age, no significant correlations were observed for AT-8 phospho-tau or Aβ plaques for either non-AD or AD groups (p&gt;0.05). Further analysis with additional neuropathological classification reported strong correlations with Thal and CERAD and NIA-AA when considered as a single cohort and in control only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S.table 3</xref>). Collectively, the data largely suggests that correlative relationships reported within the overall cohort likely stems from group effects driven by the general increase of pathological hallmarks between non-AD and AD groups and not as incremental regional increase in line with progressive Braak stage. Such observations contrast with the findings of the biochemical investigation.</p><p id="P30">Equally correlations between IHC quantified Aβ and AT-8 phospho-tau also reported a correlation only when the data were analysed as a single cohort combining non-AD controls and AD cases (r=0.65, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 d</xref>) and not when examined as a separate data set of non-AD controls or AD cases (p&gt;0.05, for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2 dii + iii</xref>). Nevertheless, biochemical measures correlated with respective histochemical measures for AT-8 and Aβ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Stable 4</xref>). Thus, despite the contradiction between biochemically measured association of AT-8 phospho-tau and total Aβ and histologically measured AT-8 phospho-tau and Aβ plaque load, the measures by differing methodological means are somewhat inter-related.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Quantification of intracellular Aβ</title><p id="P31">The absence of a correlation between IHC measures AT-8 and plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig 2</xref>), despite a robust correlation with of biochemical AT-8 and total Aβ measures from crude tissue lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig 1</xref>), suggests the possible inclusion of additional Aβ sources within the biochemical quantification. Accordingly, the application of MOAB-2 Aβ antibody to fixed post-mortem human brain tissue sections, labelled both extracellular plaques and intracellular pools of Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3</xref>). Comparisons of APP and MOAB-2 Aβ labelling, demonstrated a clear distinction in subcellular and plaque labelling in both GM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3 a</xref>) and WM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3 b</xref>). Whilst there is a degree of overlap as would be expected given the spatial limitation and the production of Aβ from APP, co-localisation is absence in the majority of puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3</xref>; white arrows), confirming the specificity of MOAB-2 for the labelling of Aβ, as previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Across a subset of the cohort, both in the GM and WM, a progressive increase in intracellular Aβ staining in line with increase AT-8 immunoreactivity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4.a</xref>). When intracellular Aβ was quantified according to % area coverage, a significant increase in the levels was observed in AD cases compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4b.i</xref>, p&lt;0.001 in GM and p&lt;0.05 in WM). Similarly, AT-8, as measured by immunofluorescence was again elevated in AD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4 b ii</xref>, p&lt;0.001 in GM and WM). Both AT-8 (r=0.62, p&lt;0.01 in GM and r=0.5, p&lt;0.05 in WM) as well as intracellular Aβ (r=0.61, p&lt;0.01 in GM) correlated with Braak stage when controlling for age. Equally, strong correlations were observed with Thal, CERAD and NIA-AA also (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S.table 5</xref>). No correlations with any neuropathological classifications were reported when the cohort was spilt according to Non-AD and AD groups. Nevertheless, correlative measures between intracellular Aβ and AT-8 phospho-tau reported a significant relationship across all cases (in GM, r=0.76 and in WM, r=0.71, p&lt;0.01 for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4 c i + d i</xref>,) and in control cases only (in GM, r=0.82 and in WM, r=0.76, p&lt;0.01 for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4 c ii + d ii</xref>). Interestingly when considering only the AD cases, a significant inverse correlation of intracellular Aβ with AT-8 phospho-tau in the GM, was apparent (r=-0.74, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4 c iii</xref>), although no correlation was reported in the WM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig 4 d iii</xref>). As with IHC quantifications of plaques and AT-8 as per TMA slides, measures of intracellular Aβ and AT-8 here, also correlated with biochemical measures when considered as a single group, although no significant correlations were observed when split into Control and AD categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S. table4</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Collectively quantification of the intracellular Aβ and its correlation with AT-8 phospho-tau appears to support the biochemical findings of a close relationship between AT-8 and Aβ, particularly in non-AD control cases. However is should be noted that spatial colocalization of AT-8 and intracellular Aβ was not common and appeared to be the exception rather than the rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig 5</xref>), instead here we find a correlation of regional AT-8 burden with regional intracellular Aβ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Collectively this study reports an apparent correlation between biochemical Aβ and AT-8 phospho-tau measures. Such a relationship was not reproduced when comparing IHC based quantification of Aβ plaques and AT-8 phospho-tau but was observed when considering IHC measures of phospho-tau and intracellular Aβ. These correlative relationships are perhaps surprisingly strongest within the non-AD control group and are evident in both grey and white matter. Together the data suggests a close relationship between non-plaque Aβ and tau, which is at least partially due to the accumulation of intracellular Aβ and its potential influence on tau phosphorylation.</p><sec id="S15"><title>Regional correlation of tau and Aβ</title><p id="P34">A long-standing critique of the amyloid cascade hypothesis has been the disconnect between NFT and Aβ-plaque burden within a given brain region of either non-AD controls or indeed AD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. However many biochemical approaches have previously found correlations between Aβ, either total Aβ or specifically Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, with a range of phosphorylated and oligomeric tau markers within the GM of a given cortical region[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, disease dependent changes in white matter Aβ levels have also been previously observed using Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> ELISAs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and like-wise hyperphosphorylated tau has also been observed biochemically within the white matter of AD cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Here we observed that levels of AT-8 reactive phospho-tau and Aβ increased in non-AD controls in line with Braak stage progression, in both the frontal grey and white matter and exhibited a positive correlation between Aβ levels and AT-8 when measured biochemically. Whilst our observations cannot determine causality, our findings are consistent with many <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments in which the application of Aβ to various cellular preparations results in downstream tau phosphorylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Moreover, support for the interaction of Aβ with tau pathology, can be gained from studies reporting that interventions targeting Aβ levels consequently reduce tau pathology both <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] as well as in biofluids obtained from human clinical trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>].</p><p id="P35">When considering the association of Aβ and tau phosphorylation within non-AD controls, our findings are similar to the observation of a previously seen correlation between Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> level and p-181 tau in the CSF of control cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. However here we can extend this finding to show that within the frontal cortex there is a regional dependence between Aβ levels and tau pathology. As work by others have reported no or minimal seed competent tau within the frontal cortex in non-AD controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], the source of pathology within the frontal cortex is likely to mainly be intraregional, with minimal influence of extra-regional spread. Such intraregional dependence would be consistent with the strong correlation between Aβ and AT-8 signals within the non-AD controls, which is somewhat weakened in AD cases, when seed competent tau species have presumably invaded the frontal cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], the self-propagation of tau pathology thus diminishing the relative contribution of Aβ to the production of phospho-tau species. Interestingly, a linear relationship between regional soluble tau phospho-species and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> has previously been reported alongside a bimodal relationship within the insoluble fraction, implying a weakening of the relationship between Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and tau phosphorylation once aggregated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, given that this present study did not seek to distinguish between soluble and insoluble pathology, the increased representation of insoluble tau pathology within lysates from AD cases, likely further explains the weakening of the linear relationship between Aβ and tau phosphorylation in AD cases.</p><p id="P36">Accordingly, no linear correlation was observed between plaque load and AT-8 load when measured histologically. Such differences may relate to the presumed loss of extracellular soluble Aβ and exclusion of intracellular Aβ pools, as is common practice when assessing Aβ burden as part of a neuropathological assessment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Intracellular Aβ</title><p id="P37">Historically, intracellular Aβ has been problematic in its quantification, largely due to the cross-reactivity of Aβ antibodies with APP and other intermediate APP metabolites. Howecer, several commercial Aβ antibodies are available, including MOAB-2 which shows no cross-reactivity with APP under many conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>].</p><p id="P38">Although often overlooked, the production of Aβ occurs intracellularly following endosomal APP cleavage via β-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] and sequential γ-secretase processing within either Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] or lysosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] compartments. Whilst the majority of Aβ is trafficked to the extracellular space, age-related changes in the relative production of Aβ peptide length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] and disease alterations to trafficking mechanisms, such as Rab GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], may act synergically to enhance the retention of intracellularly produced Aβ and or indeed its reuptake, leading to its intracellular accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Accordingly, post-mortem examination of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of non-diseased non-AD cases, suggests an increase in intracellular Aβ in line with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] and furthermore AD animal models also show an age-related accumulation of intracellular Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Intracellular Aβ and tau</title><p id="P39">Here, when selectively measuring intracellular Aβ, a positive correlation between Aβ and AT-8 in the frontal cortex of non-AD controls was observed. This is consistent with biochemical measures of frontal cortex lysates in the same cases as present here or indeed previously reported biochemical measures in the lateral temporal cortex of a different study cohort[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, in work by others, no such relationship has been observed in the entorhinal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Such a contrast in relationships may relate to the regions selected for investigation. The entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest affected cortical regions with tau pathology in AD, and thus presumably represents a cortical area of increased vulnerability to tau pathology. Such vulnerability may mean that tau pathology may be generated in an Aβ independent manner within the region as is the case of primary age-related tauopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, within the prefrontal cortex, a region which does not demonstrate robust age related NFT tau pathology and is not burdened with NFTs until late into the Braak NFT staging criteria (Braak V-VI), such modest pre-tangle tau-pathology generated in this region may be largely dependent on Aβ mediated mechanism. Such a mechanism may become modified under pathological conditions, either upon reaching a critical threshold of intracellular Aβ accumulation and/or via seed component invasion.</p><p id="P40">Interestingly within the grey matter, although a positive relationship between intracellular Aβ and phospho-tau was observed in non-AD control cases, an inverse relationship was observed in AD cases. Whilst intracellular Aβ levels remained elevated compared to controls, there has been reports of a reduction of intracellular Aβ levels in line with the deposition of Aβ plaques in mice models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] as well as in serial observations in Down’s syndrome brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and cases of late stage NFT mediated neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Such contradictions may be due to differences in the specific regions of investigations. However, it is equally plausible that elevation of intracellular Aβ precedes and indeed acts as a source for extracellular plaque deposition, with the excessive deposition of plaques at later stages subsequently reducing intracellular Aβ levels as observed in animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. In turn tau pathology may continue to grow due to the influence of seed component species.</p><p id="P41">In any case, excessive intracellular Aβ accumulation, is unlikely to be benign. The familial Osaka E639Δ APP mutant which produces non-fibril E22Δ Aβ gives rise to an accumulation of intracellular Aβ oligomers in the absence of plaques.

Whilst several of the downstream cellular dysfunction may be independent of tau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>], these studies nevertheless highlight the induction of tau pathology via Aβ independent of plaque formation, in support of the observed correlation of intracellular Aβ and phospho-tau observed here.</p><p id="P42">Given emerging evidence from clinical Aβ antibody trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], which supporting the targeting of soluble fibrillar Aβ species to consequently reduce tau pathology, further understanding the degree of interaction between Aβ and tau will provide greater insight into the mechanisms of AD related pathogenesis.

Given that such linear increases in Aβ plaques and AT-8 pathology is not observed when quantified via IHC, the study demonstrates the potential influence of non-plaque Aβ in the intra-regional generation of tau pathology. Specifically, the occurrence and accumulation of intracellular Aβ, in line with AD pathological progression, at least in part correlated with AT-8 pathology and thus may contribute to production of tau pathology. This finding is supportive of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, yet in late-stage AD cases such a relationship may be diminished, with additional factors contributing to tau pathology, at least within the frontal cortex. Critically, the observation of a localised relationship between Aβ and phospho-tau in cases with low Braak NFTs stages implies that there is a degree of regionally generated AD related pathology, which may be tolerated within a physiological range. Following the age-related accumulation of pathology, this regionally produced burden may prime the region for the invasion of seed competent forms of tau originating from connected regions, raising the burden beyond a critical threshold, and thus removing the necessity of Aβ for the propagation of tau pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary

For age and PMI both range and mean ±SEM are provided. For numerical scores of pathology, range and percentage composition are given. For CERAD scores, negative (neg), A and B reported. For NIA-AA, not, low and intermediate (inter) risk for Alzheimer’s disease. For McKeith criteria, only percentage composition is given, where cases free of LBs (No LB), brainstem, Limbic and neocortical (Neo) predominate are indicated.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Disease</th><th align="left" valign="top">N</th><th align="left" valign="top">Sex (% Male)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Age (years)</th><th align="left" valign="top">PMI (hrs)</th><th align="left" valign="top">NFT Braak stage</th><th align="left" valign="top">Thal Phase</th><th align="left" valign="top">CERAD</th><th align="left" valign="top">NIA-AA</th><th align="left" valign="top">LB Braak stage</th><th align="left" valign="top">McKeith Criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="11">Immuno-blots</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Con</td><td align="left" valign="top">35</td><td align="left" valign="top">57.1%</td><td align="left" valign="top">47-97<break/>80.5±2.2</td><td align="left" valign="top">16-95<break/>45.8±3.7</td><td align="left" valign="top">0-IV<break/>17.1% -0<break/>17.1%- I<break/>25.7% -
