This process is aided by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which enhances entry efficiency and infectiousness by cleaving the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein (Spike). The cleavage primes the Spike protein, promoting membrane fusion instead of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Despite the pivotal role played by TMPRSS2, our understanding of its non-protease distinct domains remains limited. In this report, we present evidence indicating the potential phosphorylation of a minimum of six tyrosine residues within the cytosolic tail (CT) of TMPRSS2. Through the use of TMPRSS2 CT phospho-mimetic mutants, we observed a reduction in TMPRSS2 protease activity, accompanied by a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, which was found to occur mainly via the endosomal pathway. We expanded our investigation beyond TMPRSS2 CT and discovered the involvement of other non-protease domains in regulating infection. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a strong interaction between TMPRSS2 and Spike. We revealed a 21 amino acid long TMPRSS2-Spike-binding region (TSBR) within the TMPRSS2 scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain that contributes to this interaction. Our study sheds light on novel functionalities associated with TMPRSS2’s cytosolic tail and SRCR region. Both of these regions have the capability to regulate SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between viral entry and host factors, opening new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent behind the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Since its initial emergence in Wuhan in December 2019, millions have succumbed to the effects of COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 represents the third coronavirus outbreak characterized by a high mortality rate, following the occurrences of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This situation raises alarms about the potential for future coronavirus pandemics. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells through its surface glycoprotein, Spike, by attaching to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). To facilitate the fusion of the virus membrane with the host cell or endosome membrane, Spike must undergo cleavage at two distinct sites: the polybasic cleavage site (S1/S2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cleavage site (S2’). This cleavage process leads to the release of the Spike fusogenic peptide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The hACE2 receptor alone is sufficient to enable SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 virions enter the cells through the endosomal pathway, where Spike gets cleaved by endosomal cathepsin-L. However, in the presence of TMPRSS2, the membrane fusion entry pathway becomes predominant due to Spike cleavage at the cell surface. This entry process is faster than the endosomal pathway, resulting in an increased infection kinetics and higher viral load <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, TMPRSS2 facilitates syncytia formation, thereby enhancing virion-free cell-to-cell spread <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Interestingly, in TMPRSS2-positive cells, the compound camostat, which inhibits TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity, effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection via both the membrane and the endosomal cell entry routes. Therefore, it has been proposed that both entry pathways, namely TMPRSS2-mediated membrane fusion and TMPRSS2-independent receptor-mediated endocytosis, are mutually exclusive. However, the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, since TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in lung cells, this may explain why the exclusive endosomal entry inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) failed in treating COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In addition to the critical role of TMPRSS2 protease activity, we hypothesized that other domains of this protein may play roles in regulating the viral entry pathway into cells. Here, we report that the cytosolic tail (CT) of TMPRSS2 can undergo posttranslational tyrosine phosphorylation. Intriguingly, when we engineered a phosphomimetic TMPRSS2-CT mutant, we observed a significant reduction in TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity. This reduction in enzymatic activity, in turn, resulted in a marked decrease in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, specifically through the endosomal pathway. Consequently, we proposed the hypothesis that TMPRSS2 physically interacts with Spike in a manner to limit its accessibility to the endosomal pathway. We found a 21-amino acid (aa) region within the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain (SRCR) of TMPRSS2 that binds to Spike. Our analysis revealed that TMPRSS2-Spike physical interaction facilitates membrane infection provided that TMPRSS2 is enzymatically competent.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tyrosine phosphorylation of TMPRSS2 cytosolic tail reduces its protease activity</title><p id="P6">Compared to other virus-entry-associated serine proteases such as TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">https://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>), TMPRSS2’s cytosolic tail (CT) is distinguished by its abundance of tyrosine residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. According to data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Phosphosite.org">Phosphosite.org</ext-link>, specific tyrosine residues within TMPRSS2 CT, namely Y44, Y45, and Y52, have been identified as phosphorylation sites. Notably, this region contains an Abelson kinase (Abl)-specific Y45xxP motif as well as two PxxP motifs. The Y45xxP motif is well-suited for possible Abl1/2 phosphorylation, while the presence of the two PxxP motifs suggests their potential to interact with Abl1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To explore this possibility, we transfected HEK293T with either constitutively active Δ81Abl1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or Abl2 along with TMPRSS2-Flag. Subsequent immunoprecipitation (IP) of TMPRSS2-Flag demonstrated the formation of a complex between Abl1 and TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1b</xref>). Immunoblotting (IB) of IP samples with PY20, a phosphorylated tyrosine-specific antibody, revealed TMPRSS2 tyrosine phosphorylation. As positive controls, we used the yes-associated protein (Yap), a reported Abl1 substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and cortactin, a reported Abl2-substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. TMPRSS2 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Abl1 but poorly, if any, by Abl2.</p><p id="P7">To pinpoint the tyrosine residues that undergo phosphorylation, we employed mutagenesis by substituting tyrosine with phenylalanine (Y→F). Phenylalanine shares a similar chemical structure with tyrosine but lacks the ability to be phosphorylated. We observed a significant reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of TMPRSS2, specifically when six residues were Y→F mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1a and 1c</xref>). As expected, phosphorylation was inhibited by imatinib, an Abl kinase inhibitor. The TMPRSS2 CT region is highly disordered, rendering it accessible to the relevant tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1d</xref>). These findings suggest that TMPRSS2 is susceptible to tyrosine phosphorylation and point towards Abl1 as a potential tyrosine kinase involved in this process.</p><p id="P8">To evaluate the impact of TMPRSS2 CT tyrosine phosphorylation on TMPRSS2 protease enzymatic activity, phospho-mimetic (Y→D) or phospho-dead (Y→F) TMPRSS2 mutants were overexpressed in HEK293T cells and purified via Flag-IP. Next, the purified protein samples were mixed with the serine-protease-sensitive BOC-QAR-AMC, a synthetic serine protease substrate emitting fluorescence signal upon its cleavage, and measured fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. All TMPRSS2 Y→F and the 2xD mutants were enzymatically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1f</xref>). However, only poor enzymatic activity was observed with the TMPRSS2-6xD mutant. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of TMPRSS2 CT modulates TMPRSS2 protease enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TMPRSS2-6xD mutant poorly supports Spike-mediated infection and membrane fusion entry</title><p id="P9">Next, we investigated the effect of TMPRSS2-6xD on pseudo SARS-CoV-2 infection. We infected HEK293T-hACE2 expressing the corresponding TMPRSS2 mutants with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and evaluated the infection rate after 2 days. TMPRSS2-6xD infection efficacy was lower than that of TMPRSS2-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2a</xref>), attributing a suppressive role to this mutant. These results suggest that TMPRSS2 phospho-mimetic mutant suppresses SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.</p><p id="P10">Given the reduced enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2-6xD, the efficacy of camostat in preventing lenti-Spike infection is expected to be minor. Indeed, pretreatment with camostat led to a decrease in lenti-Spike infection in wild-type TMPRSS2 cells, while it did not affect infectivity in cells lacking TMPRSS2 or expressing TMPRSS2-6xD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, TMPRSS2-6xD-mediated low level of infection was markedly sensitive to the endosomal cathepsin-L inhibitor E64d <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, suggesting that lenti-Spike enters TMPRSS2-6xD cells through endocytosis instead of membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2c</xref>). Under this condition, a residual level of infection was maintained that might result from the involvement of some other proteases or even TMPRSS2-6xD itself.</p><p id="P11">Cell-cell-fusion rate, as measured by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, was lower in TMPRSS2-6xD compared with wtTMPRSS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2d</xref>). However, it was significantly higher compared to TMPRSS2-negative cells, possibly because TMPRSS2-6xD maintained low level of enzymatic activity. These results suggest that TMPRSS2-6xD poorly supports SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion entry.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TMPRSS2 physically interacts with Spike</title><p id="P12">In search of additional TMPRSS2 regulatory regions we asked whether TMPRSS2 physically interacts with Spike. To this end, we constructed several TMPRSS2 C-terminal truncation mutants for co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, a robust binding between TMPRSS2 and Spike was revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3b</xref>). The TMPRSS2 amino acid 1-405 region exhibited comparable efficacy to the wild type in its ability to immunoprecipitate Spike. In contrast, the regions 1-316 and 1-170 demonstrated reduced effectiveness but still managed to pull down certain levels of Spike. However, no Spike IP was evident by the TMPRSS2 1-159 region. Similar results were obtained in a reciprocal experiment using Spike to bring down TMPRSS2 and the corresponding truncated mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). These results suggest that TMPRSS2 binds Spike, and an extended TMPRSS2 region is required for achieving maximal binding.</p><p id="P13">Inspection of the TMPRSS2 protein via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uniport.org">uniport.org</ext-link> revealed its cysteine-rich nature supports multiple disulfide bridges interlinking nearly all regions of the protein, except for a 21 aa region within the identified area, which we designate as TMPRSS2-Spike-binding-region (TSBR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3c</xref>). Next, the 21aa long TSBR was deleted to construct TMPRSS2-Δ149-170. Surprisingly, unlike the wt, the TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 mutant was inactive in cleaving Spike to form the TMPRSS2-specific S2’ Spike fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3d</xref>). Notably, the expression level of TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 mutant was much higher than that of wt TMPRSS2 and accompanied by a slight increase in Spike expression. Despite the high level of TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 the level of co-immunoprecipitation was comparable to that of wt TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3d</xref>). These data suggest that TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 mutant displays a diminished binding to Spike, highlighting an inefficiency in their interaction. Structural prediction analysis has unveiled that the region spanning amino acids 149 to 170 is prominently exposed on the protein surface, facilitating interaction with potential binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we assessed the TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 on supporting infection. The transduction of Spike-lenti pseudovirus was significantly increased in the presence of TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3f</xref>). In contrast, TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 did not increase transduction efficiency. These data suggest that TSBR deleted TMPRSS2 poorly supports infection. To investigate the route of infection of the TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 mutant, cells were E64d treated, the inhibitor of the endosomal pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. While the transduction of the wt TMPRSS2 cells was E64d refractory, a marked reduction was observed in cells expressing TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3f</xref>). These results suggest that TSBR mediating Spike interaction regulates TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity and membrane route of infection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TMPRSS2-6xD physically interacts with Spike</title><p id="P15">We next asked whether the TMPRSS2-6xD suppressive effect on infection could derive from abortive Spike interaction. We addressed this possibility by investigating Spike-TMPRSS2 binding. HEK293T were transfected with Spike and TMPRSS2 constructs and harvested for TMPRSS2-IP and IB 1.5 days later. Neither the TMPRSS2-specific cleavage pattern of Spike nor the amount of TMPRSS2-Spike associated proteins were substantially changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4a</xref>). Remarkably, both Spike-TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2-6xD robustly bind Spike even after Spike cleavage, as evident from the appearance of Spike S1/S2 and S2’ fragments in TMPRSS2-IP lysate.</p><p id="P16">To confirm that TMPRSS2-6xD is properly localized in the cells and extracellularly exposed, we conducted experiments to show whether it binds Spike at the cell surface like wtTMPRSS2. To this end, we performed attachment assays where HEK293T cells overexpressing Spike were mixed with HEK293T-hACE2 overexpressing TMPRSS2 in a ratio of 1:1. After a short incubation time, 1 h, extracts were prepared and subjected to HA-Spike-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4b</xref>). The incubation for this short period assures investigation of the attachment process, without further processing, in line with cell-cell fusion assays described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2d</xref>). Both, wt TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2-6xD were comparably immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4c</xref>). Moreover, the levels of expression of TMPRSS2-6xD and wtTMPRSS2 were found to be similar, consistent with the IB data presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4a</xref>). These results suggest TMPRSS2-6xD and wtTMPRSS2 are similar at the levels of cleavage pattern, expression, Spike interaction, and cellular localization.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Omicron Spike Y655 residue reduces TMPRSS2 binding</title><p id="P17">Omicron exhibits reduced TMPRSS2-dependency, enabling infection of TMPRSS2-positive cells through both entry pathways, facilitated by the presence of Omicron-specific Spike Y655 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig. 5a</xref>). However, the precise underlining mechanism remains elusive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. To investigate whether the diminished Omicrons reduced TMPRSS2-dependency might stem from a decreased binding between Omicron-Spike and TMPRSS2 due to the Y655 residue, HEK293T were transfected with Omicron-Spike wt and Y655H mutant, along with a reciprocal experiment involving Delta-Spike wt and H655Y. The aim was to assess the impact of these mutations on TMPRSS2 binding. Analysis of HA-TMPRSS2 immunoprecipitation revealed the levels of the Omicron Y655H mutant were elevated, while the Delta H655Y mutant exhibited reduced levels relative to its wt counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig. 5b</xref>). These results strongly indicate the participation of the wt Spike residue H655 in binding to TMPRSS2. Consequently, these findings point towards a significant role of the interaction between TMPRSS2 and the H655 residue of the Spike protein in defining TMPRSS2-dependency. Furthermore, they suggest that a robust binding between Spike and TMPRSS2 counteracts the endosomal entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig. 5c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Here, we elucidate the role of TMPRSS2 non-protease domains in regulating SARS-CoV-2 lenti-Spike infection. While the catalytic domain of TMPRSS2 is well-documented for its pivotal role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 membrane route of infection, the significance of other regions within TMPRSS2 has received limited attention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Given that TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in facilitating the cellular entry of various viruses, including but not limited to influenza, parainfluenza, hepatitis C, and multiple coronaviruses, conducting examination of TMPRSS2’s distinct domains bears significant relevance in understanding and combating these viral infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">We have identified TMPRSS2 cytosolic tail (CT) as a putative substrate for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. Through a phosphomimetic mutation approach, our study demonstrates that tyrosine phosphorylation of the TMPRSS2 CT can downregulate its enzymatic activity. This allosteric regulation of TMPRSS2 activity via modification of its cytosolic tail might have some implications in the development of new antiviral strategies. While camostat and nafamostat are general serine protease inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, targeting TMPRSS2 phosphorylation may offer a more virus-specific approach. This is particularly relevant since other virus-associated proteases, such as TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11a, have limited phosphorylatable amino acid residues in their cytosolic tails <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it’s worth noting that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts are frequently described in prostate cancer. In these cases, the N-terminal portion of TMPRSS2, including the cytosolic tail but not the catalytic domain, is commonly fused to the ERG transcription factor in cancer patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This underscores the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between tyrosine kinases and TMPRSS2, which could pave the way for innovative treatment strategies targeting both viral infections and cancer.</p><p id="P20">The authenticity of endogenous Abl1 as the genuine TMPRSS2 kinase is currently uncertain, given that our study relied on the over-expression of an overactive Δ81-Abl1 mutant. The definitive identification of the genuine tyrosine kinase responsible for TMPRSS2 phosphorylation remains a topic for future investigations. In our prior study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we documented the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the use of imatinib in an Abl1/Abl2-independent process. In this study, we demonstrate that imatinib effectively inhibits Abl1-mediated hyperphosphorylation of TMPRSS2, suggesting an enhancement in SARS-CoV-2 infection control. However, it’s worth noting that imatinib’s inhibitory effect primarily occurs at the level of Spike protein by direct imatinib-Spike interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, which is an upstream process. This overrides the significance of TMPRSS2 phosphorylation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P21">SRCR domains are known to interact with extracellular proteins and molecules, but this domain is not well characterized in the context of TMPRSS2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12329760 causing V160M mutation in TMPRSS2-SRCR domain is associated with severe COVID-19 disease progression, suggesting that the SRCR domain impacts SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We describe here that TMPRSS2 robustly binds Spike. Truncated deletion mutant analysis revealed that the aa 149-170 region within the TMPRSS2-SRCR domain plays a role in Spike binding. However, given that the TMPRSS2-Δ149-170 deletion mutant continues to bind Spike, we hypothesize that the TMPRSS2 binding region may be more extensive, possibly encompassing an additional binding region. This putative second binding region is likely situated between TMPRSS2 amino acids 316 and 405, as its deletion resulted in reduced binding. It would be intriguing to investigate whether TMPRSS2 can bind to the surface proteins of other TMPRSS2-dependent viruses, potentially establishing a broader role for the Spike-binding domain in viral infection.</p><p id="P22">A mediator of TMPRSS2 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is the H655 residue.

In brief, the calcium-phosphate (CaPO4) method was employed for all transfections. For 6 cm plates, the prepared DNA mix consisted of 8 µg of DNA and 25 µl of 2.5 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) in a total of 250 µl of water. In the subsequent step, the DNA mix was vortexed, and 250 µl of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS2x) were added dropwise. After a one-minute incubation, the transfection mix was introduced to cells that were 80% confluent. The medium was replaced with fresh growth medium after eight hours. In cases where transfection was later utilized for transduction, the virus-containing medium was filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane filter (Sartorius®) after 2.5 days. Cells transduced with Lenti-Spike were treated with 5 µg/ml Hoechst solution (Molecular Probes®) before being analyzed under a microscope. The ratio of Hoechst-stained nuclei (representing all cells) to GFP-emitting cells (indicating infected cells) was quantified using a previously described ImageJ macro <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB)</title><p id="P26">Cells were harvested using ice-cold PBS and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes. The resulting pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer containing both protease inhibitors (ApexBio®) and tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma®) at a 1:100 concentration ratio each. After a 15-minute incubation on ice, the cell lysate underwent a 15-minute centrifugation at maximum speed. The supernatant was subsequently combined with a three-times concentrated Laemmli buffer at the appropriate concentration.</p><p id="P27">For IP, the supernatant was mixed with antibody-conjugated beads (Sigma®) and incubated for 4 hours at 4°C on a rotator. Subsequent washing steps and elution (Sigma®) were carried out following the manufacturer’s protocol to separate HA- or Flag-tagged proteins and their respective interacting partners from other proteins. After an additional brief centrifugation at 13000 rpm, the IP samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer.</p><p id="P28">The IB samples were boiled for two minutes prior to being loaded onto a 8% gel, if not described differently. Subsequently, standard procedures for SDS-PAGE, blotting, and antibody treatment were followed as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. For enhancing the signal of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories®) and visualization, EZ-ECL kit (Biological Industries®) was used.

HEK293T-hACE2 were transfected with TMPRSS2-Flag, and HEK293T were transfected with Spike-HA and harvested after 2.5 d. Cell suspensions were centrifuged down, and the pellets were resuspended in growth medium before mixing in a 1:1 ratio. After an hour, cells were harvested with RIPA buffer, and their extracts were subjected to IP and IB. <bold>c)</bold> Both wt TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2-6xD are located at the outer cell membrane and attached to Spike. HEK293T-hACE2 and HEK293T were treated as described above. Result was verified with an additional experiment and measurements of band intensities were done like above, representing the IP/Total ratio normalized to wt TMPRSS2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189060-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Spike residue Y655 determines affinity to TMPRSS2.</title><p><bold>a)</bold> The Omicron Spike Y655 is highlighted on the Spike structure in red.

HEK293T-hACE were transfected with TMPRSS2 and respective Spike constructs. HA-IP to pulldown TMPRSS2 was performed, and samples were treated as described above. Omicron-Spike Y655H mutation increases TMPRSS2 binding while Delta-Spike H655Y mutation decreases TMPRSS2 binding compared to respective wt. Band intensities of the three replicates from panel 3c were measured via ImageJ, and adjusted to the respective actin band. The Omicron samples were normalized to band intensity of wt Delta-Spike and Delta samples to wt Omicron-Spike. Afterwards, the ratio of IP/Total was compared between respective wt Spike and belonging mutant. <bold>c)</bold> Scheme of SARS-CoV-2 routes of infection in different conditions. SARS-CoV-2 enters hACE2-positive cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and shifts entirely to membrane-fusion route when TMPRSS2 is additionally present. Omicron and respective subvariants are the only variants known to infect TMPRSS2-positive cells via both entry routes due to Omicron-Spike-specific Y655 residue. The extent of Spike-TMPRSS2 interaction determines the route of infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189060-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A summary model.</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 binding to hACE2 enables two distinct entry routes: receptor-mediated endocytosis and membrane fusion. The presence of TMPRSS2 tilts the preference towards the membrane fusion pathway, likely facilitated by the physical binding of Spike. In contrast, the phosphorylation of TMPRSS2’s CT region by tyrosine kinases, such as Abl1, reduces TMPRSS2’s enzymatic activity. This, in turn, inhibits the membrane fusion pathway, leading to a decrease in the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189060-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
