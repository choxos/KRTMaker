This theory explicitly predicts that optimising gene expression in adulthood can ameliorate functional senescence and improve fitness. Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling (rIIS) extends the reproductive lifespan of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> at the cost of reduced reproduction. Here, we show that adulthood-only rIIS improves late-life reproduction without any detrimental effects on other life-history traits in both benign and stressful conditions. Remarkably, we show that rIIS additively extends late-life reproduction and lifespan when animals are exposed to a fluctuating food environment – intermittent fasting (IF) – resulting in reduced food intake in early adulthood. Full factorial genome-wide RNA-Seq across the life course demonstrated that IF and rIIS modulate the age-specific expression of pro-longevity genes. IF, rIIS and combined IF + rIIS treatment downregulated genes involved in peptide metabolism in early life and differentially regulated immunity genes in later life. Importantly, combined IF + rIIS treatment uniquely regulated a large cluster of genes in mid-life that are associated with immune response. These results suggest that optimising gene expression in adulthood can decelerate reproductive ageing and increase fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ageing</kwd><kwd>Life-History Evolution</kwd><kwd>Trade-Offs</kwd><kwd>Developmental Theory of Ageing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The evolutionary theory of ageing maintains that ageing evolves because the force of natural selection declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The decline in selection gradients with age results in the accumulation of deleterious alleles whose effects on organismal performance are concentrated in late-life (mutation accumulation, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and favours alleles whose effects on fitness are positive in early life despite being detrimental in late life (antagonistic pleiotropy, AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). On a physiological level, there are two main proximate theories that aim to explain the evolution of ageing – the ‘disposable soma’ theory (DST) and the developmental theory of ageing (DTA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The DST argues that ageing evolves via resource allocation trade-off between investment into somatic maintenance, growth, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). The DTA proposes that ageing evolves because selection fails to optimise age-specific gene expression, resulting in suboptimal physiology in late life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). While the DST falls under the umbrella of AP, the DTA allows for the evolution of ageing via MA and AP alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">DST and DTA make unique testable predictions that can be used in empirical studies to advance our understanding of the evolutionary physiology of ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Specifically, the DTA predicts that optimising age-specific gene expression using experimental approaches can postpone or slow down age-related deterioration and improve fitness, while the DST predicts that diverting resources to improve late-life performance will come at the cost of early-life performance. Here we focused on a well-established system of insulin signalling-regulated life-history in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes to ask whether downregulation of insulin/insulin-like signalling (IIS) in adulthood can slow down reproductive ageing without costs to other life-history traits, and, therefore, improve reproductive fitness.</p><p id="P5">Previous work established that reduced IIS extends reproductive lifespan in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> but such extension was accompanied by a marked reduction in overall reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) suggesting a genetic trade-off. It is important to emphasise that such genetic trade-off does not imply direct reallocation of resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Furthermore, while reduced IIS improves reproductive ageing in benign environments, it is not clear whether such effects will manifest in more natural conditions when the organisms are exposed to temporary food shortages. Interestingly, different forms of food shortages, such as continuous dietary restriction (reduced intake of nutrients without malnutrition) or intermittent fasting (IF) (aka time-restricted fasting) also can extend reproductive lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, it is not clear whether such effects are underpinned by the same molecular pathways. For example, it has been suggested that different forms of fasting increase lifespan via different molecular signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and the same can apply to reproductive ageing.</p><p id="P6">IF is a form of dietary restriction (reduced nutrient intake without malnutrition) which involves cycling periods of fasting and food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Different IF regimes have been shown to extend lifespan in model organisms and reduce age-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). IF is hypothesised to act via inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and previous work suggested that IF does not markedly increase lifespan in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This could be in part due to the behaviour of the DAF-16 transcription factor, which translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to fasting but relocates back to the cytoplasm under prolonged food shortage (over 24 hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Therefore, long-term fasting treatments likely bypass IIS and act via different pathways, including DAF-16 independent pathways such as AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Similarly, it is possible that different IF regimes also act via different pathways and vary in their effect on late-life health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Our goal was to establish whether adulthood-only downregulation of IIS can slow down reproductive ageing and improve organismal fitness under both ad libitum and limited resources. We found that reduced IIS not only improves reproductive ageing to increase lifetime reproductive success in different environments, but the benefit is particularly strong when resources are limited. Then, we investigated the impact of IF and rIIS on age-specific nuclear localisation of DAF-16 transcription factor and found that combined IF + rIIS treatment has a stronger effect across the life course because different treatments are more effective at different ages. IF leads to DAF-16 nuclear translocation during early-adulthood while rIIS causes a more moderate DAF-16 nuclear localisation during both early and late-adulthood. Therefore, when IF and rIIS are combined, this results in a more pronounced DAF-16 nuclear localisation from early to late-adulthood. Finally, we investigated the effects of both treatments on genome-wide gene expression in full-factorial design across three different ages (young, mid-life and old) and found that both similar and distinct physiological processes are modulated by early-adulthood IF and rIIS treatments at different ages. Early in life, shared mechanisms, such as suppressing translation, were activated in IF, rIIS and their combination. In contrast, late in life, more distinct mechanisms, such as the ones involved in immunity, were differentially regulated by IF, rIIS and their combination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Early-adulthood IF and rIIS additively increase survival and slow down reproductive ageing</title><p id="P8">To understand whether rIIS and IF work through similar mechanisms as previously suggested, we explored the effects of rIIS in combination with IF. Considering that the timing of dietary interventions matters, we examined how early and late-adulthood IF influenced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). We found that rIIS and early-adulthood IF additively increased survival in the wild-type N2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In contrast, late-adulthood IF did not affect survival, regardless of whether rIIS was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We also assessed the impact of rIIS and early-adulthood IF on various strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to evaluate the generalisability of our findings beyond N2, the commonly used laboratory strain. For USA strain, early-adulthood IF increased survival both in the absence and presence of rIIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). For Portugal strain, there was no effect of early-adulthood IF on the survival of control worms but it further increased survival in the presence of rIIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In summary, our findings showed that rIIS increases survival when combined with early-adulthood IF and this was consistent across different worm strains.</p><p id="P10">Knowing that various dietary restriction types and rIIS mutants can reduce reproduction, we investigated how IF and rIIS affect self-fertilised reproduction. IF significantly reduced reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, IF: χ<sup>2</sup> = 76.41, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001), whereas rIIS had no effect on reproduction in the N2 strain (rIIS: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.65, df = 1, p = 0.421; IF x rIIS interaction: χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.41, df = 1, p = 0.121). These effects did not change when matricides were censored and were similar in two other <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). In brief, we showed that, in contrast to intermittent fasting, reduced IIS does not decrease reproduction during its application.</p><p id="P11">To test whether IF and rIIS slow down reproductive ageing, we explored the effects of IF and rIIS on late-life mated reproduction. Our study revealed that both IF and rIIS independently led to increased late-life reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, IF: χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.5049, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001; rIIS: χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.9117, df = 1, p = 0.009; IF x rIIS interaction: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0122, df = 1, p = 0.912). When IF and rIIS were combined, late-life reproduction was higher than all other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>). Altogether, these data emphasize that IF and rIIS additively delay reproductive ageing.</p><p id="P12">Finally, we tested whether IF and rIIS have effects that pass down to the next generation by looking at the survival and reproduction of offspring produced later in life. Our findings show that neither IF nor rIIS changed how well these offspring survived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). Similarly, there was no effect of IF or rIIS on offspring lifetime reproductive success (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5</xref>, IF: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.8584, df = 1, p = 0.354; rIIS: χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.5170, df = 1, p = 0.113; IF x rIIS interaction: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.6178, df = 1, p = 0.432).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Both IF and rIIS enhance DAF-16 nuclear localisation but in an age-specific manner</title><p id="P13">To understand the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of IF and rIIS on ageing, we explored the nuclear localisation of the DAF-16 transcription factor. DAF-16 activates longevity genes when it moves into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We observed that IF significantly increased DAF-16 nuclear localisation during early-adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), but this effect diminished gradually with advancing age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). On the other hand, rIIS also caused DAF-16 to move into the nucleus, but this effect was weaker compared to IF during early-adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Interestingly, unlike IF, rIIS continued to enhance DAF-16’s localisation into the nucleus as worms grew older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). These varying effects at different ages led to a significant interaction between IF and rIIS (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.12, df = 1, p = 0.02) with marginally nonsignificant interactions between rIIS and age (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.18, df = 1, p = 0.07) and between IF and age (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.10, df = 1, p = 0.08). Thanks to the early-life effect of IF and the sustained impact of rIIS during both early and late life, the combined treatment benefited from higher DAF-16 nuclear localisation throughout the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IF, rIIS and their combined treatment exert age-dependent effects on gene expression</title><p id="P14">We analysed gene expression changes in worms subjected to IF, rIIS or both on day 1, day 7 and day 13 by sequencing polyA(+) RNA in triplicate for each condition and time point. The principal component analysis (PCA) of samples shows that the largest variation in gene expression changes is due to the ageing of animals, as PC1 can separate all Day 1 animals from Day 7 and Day 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6</xref>). Next, we calculated the differential gene expression changes in worms exposed to IF, rIIS and combined treatments compared to control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The largest gene expression changes are observed in day 1 animals, and the number of differentially expressed genes between conditions go down as the animals age for day 7 and day 13 samples. Moreover, while rIIS treatment resulted in the highest number of differentially expressed genes in the early life, the combined treatment led to a greater number of differentially expressed genes at more advanced ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, to understand how DAF-16 activation contributes to the differential gene expression across treatments and time points, we analysed the presence of previously identified direct targets of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Direct DAF-16 targets behaved similar to the total number of differentially expressed genes. During early adulthood (day 1), most of the direct DAF-16 target genes were activated by rIIS. As the worms aged (days 7 and 13), rIIS alone was not enough and the combination of rIIS and IF was necessary to activate many DAF-16 direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IF, rIIS, and their combination have age-specific effects on diverse biological functions later in life, particularly those related to biosynthesis and immune response</title><p id="P17">To understand the shared and unique mechanisms between IF and rIIS, we used Venn diagrams for Gene Ontology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs. 7</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). On day 1, all treatments upregulated genes involved in developmental processes. Moreover, rIIS uniquely upregulated 55 % of differentially expressed genes. These genes were related to processes such as DNA and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). On the other hand, all treatments downregulated genes involved in processes like peptide metabolism, ATP metabolic process and Ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis. In addition to that, IF uniquely downregulated genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis. 56 % of differentially regulated genes were uniquely downregulated by rIIS, involved in processes such as neuropeptide signalling, tricarboxylic acid cycle and actin filament regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). In summary, during early adulthood, all treatments upregulated genes involved in developmental processes while downregulating genes associated with biosynthesis.</p><p id="P18">On day 7, IF, rIIS and their combination differentially regulated several immune genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Although many immune-related genes were shared between rIIS and the combined treatment, there were others that were only expressed when rIIS was combined with IF. Specifically, the combined and IF treatments together upregulated immune genes <italic>cnc-1</italic>, <italic>cnc-5</italic> and <italic>clec-52,</italic> which are known to function through pathways beyond IIS, such as TGF-β and p38 MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Likewise, the combined treatment also uniquely downregulated a substantial number of genes related to immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Intriguingly, among them, <italic>cdr-4</italic>, previously reported to be upregulated by rIIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), exhibited the opposite response in the combined treatment. In brief, the combination of rIIS and IF shares some immune genes with rIIS, but it also influences other genes not connected to insulin signalling, potentially through the effects of intermittent fasting.</p><p id="P19">On day 13, similar to the patterns observed on day 7, the combination of rIIS and IF exhibited differential regulation of various immune genes, often together with rIIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). rIIS and the combined treatment both upregulated genes involved in several processes, including immune response, response to ROS and amino acid metabolism. On the other hand, the combined and IF treatments jointly upregulated immune genes <italic>lys-8</italic>, <italic>spp-1</italic> and <italic>ilys-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>). Among them, <italic>lys-8</italic> has been reported to be influenced by IIS, as well as TGF-β and p38 MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>spp-1</italic> and <italic>ilys-2</italic> were found to be downregulated by rIIS, which is the opposite direction of how combined treatment and IF regulates them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). So, only <italic>lys-8</italic> was regulated in the same direction as rIIS. rIIS and the combined treatment both downregulated mechanisms associated with immune response, organic acid metabolism and response to inorganic substances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Intriguingly, no genes were downregulated by IF and the combined treatment together. In short, at older ages, the combination of rIIS and IF regulates a substantial number of processes similar to rIIS alone, while some processes are also influenced by IF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">We found that adulthood-only reduced insulin signalling (rIIS) via <italic>daf-2</italic> knockdown slows down reproductive ageing and, in doing so, increases lifetime reproductive success in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites because early life reproduction via selfing was unaffected. This effect was particularly pronounced when animals experienced food shortage in the form of intermittent fasting (IF). By examining the nuclear localisation of DAF-16 across different ages, we showed that the combined effects of early-adulthood IF and rIIS led to higher total nuclear localisation of this transcription factor, potentially maximizing its activity. Specifically, DAF-16 localisation in the combined treatment was mainly driven by IF instead of rIIS in early life, while the opposite was true later in life. Genome-wide RNA sequencing showed that IF and rIIS shape gene expression in an age-dependent manner. The GO terms analyses suggest that genes involved in biosynthesis and immunity are potential candidates for explaining the additive effects of IF and rIIS on ageing. The reduction in biosynthesis during early adulthood at least partially aligns with the disposable soma theory (DST), suggesting a trade-off between growth and maintenance (resource allocation). In contrast, regulation of immunity genes later in life is broadly in line with the developmental theory of ageing (DTA), which posits that ageing results from suboptimal gene expression in late life due to the weakening of natural selection on biological function in adulthood.</p><p id="P21">Previous work shows a complex picture with respect to the suggested role of insulin signalling in reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Different studies reported that while some <italic>daf-2</italic> alleles can result in sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), others lead to the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) or extended reproductive lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) of selfing hermaphrodites compared to wild-type worms but with severely reduced reproductive rate and total brood sizes, especially in stressful and fluctuating temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). However, self-fertile <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites are sperm limited (they produce around 300 sperm prior to maturation), and mating can substantially increase late reproduction and lead to higher lifetime reproductive success. Therefore, while some reproductive ageing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites occurs prior to cessation of sperm, it is key to study reproductive ageing in mated hermaphrodites that have unlimited access to sperm while still producing oocytes. Mated <italic>daf-2 (e1370)</italic> hermaphrodites indeed can have increased reproductive lifespan but reduced rate of reproduction and low lifetime reproductive success compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Later work demonstrated that <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants have improved maintenance of oocyte quality with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Because early-life reproduction is more important for fitness than late-life reproduction, given <italic>C. elegans’</italic> life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), this suggests a genetic trade-off or constraint that links reproductive lifespan extension to reduced fitness. It is important to emphasise that such a trade-off is unlikely to be resource-dependent because neither reduction nor increase in early-life offspring production has a direct effect on reproductive ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Finally, later work suggested that mated <italic>daf-2 (e1370)</italic> hermaphrodites may actually suffer from reduced reproductive lifespan and reduced overall reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The discrepancy between different studies likely results from the timing of mating during life course and differences in animal husbandry, but it is clear that lifelong reduction in IIS in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants is likely to carry substantial fitness costs, even if it has positive effects on reproductive ageing under certain conditions.</p><p id="P22">While we found that adulthood-only <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi improves late post-mating reproduction without negative effects on the early self-fertile stage together with increased longevity, it still remains possible that there is a trade-off between slower reproductive ageing and offspring quality. We have previously shown that adulthood-only <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi improves offspring quality of self-fertile hermaphrodites in a benign environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), has no effect on offspring quality in fluctuating stressful environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and has overall positive effects on fitness and lineage survival in a long-term multigenerational scenario, which mimicked the evolution of age-specific modifier gene that reduces adulthood-only expression of daf-2 in every generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Here, we found that offspring produced late in life by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi mated hermaphrodites had similar lifetime reproductive success and survival compared to wild-type worms. Overall, these results suggest that <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi-mediated improvement in reproductive ageing is both general across benign and stressful environments and does not trade-off with offspring quality.</p><p id="P23">Interestingly, we found that IF during early-adulthood, but not late-adulthood, increases survival. This result aligns with previous work in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> fruit flies, suggesting that IF has a greater impact on survival when applied early, but not late, in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In fruit flies, 5 days fasting-2 days eating IF regimen increased lifespan when applied during early or mid-adulthood. However, when applied during late-adulthood, it shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Similarly, 18 hours fasting-6 hours eating IF regimen also increased lifespan in fruit flies when applied during early, but not late, adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Our findings in worms further support the importance of the timing of the treatment, with early-adulthood being more beneficial.</p><p id="P24">Crucially, early-adulthood IF increased survival both in the presence and absence of rIIS, suggesting that IF may be working at least in part through a different route than IIS. Although early or late-adulthood IF was not previously compared in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it was shown that applying IF throughout the entire lifespan increases longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In these studies, a 2-day fasting-2-day eating regimen increased survival in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through an IIS-dependent mechanism, contrasting with our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Our IF regimen differs from previous studies, which used a 2-day intermittent fasting and eating cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), whereas in our experiment, we applied 9 hours of fasting on alternate days. In fact, our IF regimen is perhaps more similar to the time-restricted feeding regimen used in fruit flies, which was suggested to work independently of inhibition of insulin-like signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying our results, we first explored DAF-16 nuclear localisation. DAF-16 is a key transcription factor which acts downstream of nutrient-sensing signalling and germline signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). As a response to signals related to food availability or germline maintenance, it enters the nucleus and transcriptionally activates pro-longevity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). In our experiment, DAF-16 is expected to remain in the cytoplasm in the presence of food and when the IIS pathway is active (control). However, when food is scarce (IF treatment), when the IIS is inactivated (rIIS treatment), or both (combined treatment), DAF-16 is expected to relocate to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Our findings indicate that in early-adulthood, fasting causes DAF-16 to enter the nucleus more than rIIS. Conversely, fasting is no longer that effective in later adulthood, while rIIS worms maintain the same DAF-16 nuclear localisation as observed in their youth. DAF-16 has been shown to rapidly respond to changing food availability by moving into the nucleus shortly after fasting initiation and returning to the cytoplasm upon resuming a normal diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Hence, in our IF treatment, DAF-16 is expected to be in the nucleus only during fasting periods (9 hours on alternate days) and back in the cytoplasm during non-fasting periods. In the rIIS treatment, DAF-16 is expected to be in the nucleus constantly, at least during the first week of lifespan, because IIS is constantly reduced by RNAi treatment. In fact, deactivating the IIS pathway has been shown to cause DAF-16 to stay in the nucleus even until later ages, as late as day 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In the combined treatment, worms experience both intermittent nuclear localisation due to IF and the constant nuclear localisation due to rIIS, and benefit from both treatments. These findings support the hypothesis that IF and rIIS are modulating DAF-16 localisation in an age-dependent manner, leading to potentially increased DAF-16 activity in combined treatment. This is further supported by the fact that some direct DAF-16 targets are only expressed in the combined treatment at later ages.</p><p id="P26">To better understand the mechanisms driving the effects of the combined treatment, we explored the function of genes that were differentially expressed by IF, rIIS and their combination at different ages. Our findings revealed that IF and rIIS activate both similar and distinct mechanisms depending on the age of the worms. For example, during early adulthood, all treatments downregulate numerous genes involved in biosynthesis, a change known to promote longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Likewise, in later adulthood, they all downregulate a gene involved in the xenobiotic response<italic>, cyp-33C8</italic>, whose downregulation increases survival under oxygen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). This implies that similar mechanisms could contribute to extending reproductive ageing and lifespan across IF, rIIS, and combined treatments, particularly early in life. Still, the level of downregulation is important because decreasing the synthesis of proteins and carbohydrates can be harmful to reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In fact, we observed that IF uniquely downregulates genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis early in life. Differential regulation of biosynthetic processes can be one of the reasons why rIIS had no effect on early reproduction while IF was detrimental.</p><p id="P27">However, later in life, the combined treatment uniquely combines distinct and shared immune mechanisms originating from both IF and rIIS. Notably, numerous immune genes upregulated in the combined treatment together with IF are not related to the IIS pathway, indicating that IF can trigger additional immune responses through alternative mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Although the immune response is crucial for survival and reproduction, excessive production of antimicrobial peptides can actually harm the host due to elevated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). For example, increased expression of some of the immune genes can lead to poor reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Therefore, finetuning the age-specific expression of immunity genes has an important role in regulating lifespan and reproduction. In fruit flies, selection for late-life reproduction and longevity led to the enrichment of immunity genes, suggesting that age-specific regulation of these genes contributes to extended lifespan and reproductive-span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). The simultaneous control of various immune response pathways by the combined treatment could provide insight into its additive effect on survival and late-life reproduction.</p><p id="P28">Nevertheless, it is important to note that the worms in our study were kept in clean environments without any infections. In fact, the downregulation of certain genes involved in immunity by the combined treatment could be detrimental and pose challenges in the presence of infectious threats. For example, we found that <italic>lys-3</italic>, a lysozyme induced in response to pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), is consistently downregulated in all three treatments during late adulthood, despite evidence that its overexpression can extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Therefore, it becomes evident that not all mechanisms regulated by the combined treatment are universally beneficial. Finetuning immune response genes is indeed challenging but it could be a powerful way to slow down ageing effectively.</p><p id="P29">Our study suggests that reduced insulin signalling in adulthood ameliorates reproductive ageing in benign and food-limited environments without costs to reproductive rate or offspring quality. Notably, the benefits of adulthood-only rIIS to late-life reproduction and survival become more apparent when animals experience fluctuating food shortages in the form of IF. Specifically, we observed that early-adulthood IF and adulthood-only rIIS additively enhance both survival and late-life reproduction. The dynamic regulation of DAF-16 nuclear localisation in an age-specific manner suggests a finely tuned mechanism through which IF and rIIS exert their effects. Our exploration of age-specific gene expression patterns suggests that both shared and unique regulatory pathways may contribute to the additive effects of IF and rIIS on life-history traits. These results are in line with the hypothesis that reduction in the force of natural selection after reproductive maturity results in the evolution of suboptimal gene expression in adulthood, causing ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P30">It has been previously suggested that both DTA and DST-like processes can play a role in the evolution of ageing, and that these processes are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The additive increase in lifespan and late-life reproduction when rIIS was combined with IF aligns with this suggestion because IF directly limits reproduction, and combining rIIS with IF to further slow down reproductive ageing comes at the cost of early-life reproduction. Further research is necessary to establish the relative contributions of resource allocation trade-offs and suboptimal age-specific gene expression to the evolution and expression of ageing across a broad range of taxa.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P31">Three <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild-type strains: N2 (UK, Bristol), JT11398 (Portugal), EG4725 (USA) and the mutant strain: zIs356 [daf-16p::daf-16a/b::GFP + rol-6(su1006)] were obtained from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, USA, funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, P40 OD010440) and stored at −80°C until use.

For the Control and rIIS treatment groups, worms were transferred to new plates every 24 hours. For the IF and IF + rIIS treatment groups, worms were transferred to new plates twice on fasting days and every 24 hours on ad libitum (adlib) days. To ensure that the eggs laid during the 7-day reproductive period developed into larvae, we allowed the eggs to hatch and develop for two days. After this period, the hatched larvae were killed at 42°C for 3.5 hours and stored for counting later.</p><p id="P36">We monitored late-life reproduction by mating hermaphrodites with males after the self-reproductive period ended. Males were produced by exposing around 50 L4 hermaphrodites to 30°C heat shock for 5 hours on NGM plates and then incubating them at 20°C. On days 8 and 12, two males were paired with a single hermaphrodite for 24 hours, after which the males were discarded. The hermaphrodites were then transferred to fresh plates daily until the cessation of reproduction on day 14. Hermaphrodites were maintained on their corresponding RNAi treatments until the end of reproduction. We replicated this experiment by maintaining all experimental worms on empty vector RNAi producing <italic>E. coli</italic> during late reproduction (days 8-14).
