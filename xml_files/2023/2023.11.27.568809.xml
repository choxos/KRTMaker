To protect their limited resources, plants have evolved multiple layers of defence, including physical barriers and chemical defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">War et al., 2012</xref>). Chemical compounds in particular play a central role in plant-herbivore interactions, as they can shape the community of herbivores that attack a plant, and in turn are shaped by herbivore-imposed selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agrawal, Hastings, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). As a result of reciprocal adaptations between plants and their herbivores, many plants have evolved a vast diversity of toxic, repellent, or antinutritive compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Speed et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Resistance traits of plants, including chemical defences, require a significant investment of energy and resources by the plant. For example, production of defensive glucosinolate compounds by plants in the Brassicaceae has been estimated to consume 15% of a plant’s total photosynthetic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bekaert et al., 2012</xref>). Defence investments therefore represent a substantial cost for plants, both by decreasing resource allocation to other plant functions (direct or allocation costs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Herms &amp; Mattson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Züst &amp; Agrawal, 2017</xref>), and by indirectly decreasing plant fitness through altered interactions with other species (ecological costs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Strauss et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, both costs and benefits of defence are context dependent, and even direct costs may vary depending on the biotic and abiotic environment. For example, the growth-differentiation balance (GDH) hypothesis predicts a physiological trade-off between faster growth and higher defence levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Herms &amp; Mattson, 1992</xref>), yet rapid growth is primarily essential during plant establishment in highly competitive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Züst et al., 2011</xref>), while costs may be lower under different conditions. Similarly, high defence investments should only be beneficial in the presence of herbivores susceptible to that defence, while a lack of susceptible herbivores should favour less defended plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Simms &amp; Rausher, 1987</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The interplay between competition, defence, and herbivory has been well-documented in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hambäck &amp; Beckerman, 2003</xref>), where the manipulation or exclusion of herbivores commonly results in substantial shifts in defence trait expression and competitive interactions among plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mauricio &amp; Rausher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, natural gains of novel defences may have analogous consequences to artificial herbivore exclusion: following the gain of a potent new defence, plants may at least temporarily escape herbivore-imposed selection, which likely will alter their competitive interactions and may allow plants to colonize new environments (“escape and radiate”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ehrlich &amp; Raven, 1964</xref>).</p><p id="P10">For example, plants in the order Brassicales evolved potent glucosinolate defences approximately 80 million years ago, with subsequent biosynthetic innovations in defence triggering bouts of speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edger et al., 2015</xref>). However, specialist herbivores eventually evolved strategies to disarm and overcome this defence over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ratzka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sporer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wittstock et al., 2004</xref>). As a result, extant species of the Brassicaceae are typically attacked by a diverse community of glucosinolate-resistant herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bidart-Bouzat &amp; Kliebenstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mertens et al., 2021</xref>). However, despite this apparent ineffectiveness against specialist herbivores, most Brassicaceae species nonetheless produce a diverse arsenal of glucosinolate defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>), highlighting the challenges of inferring ancient evolutionary processes from current ecological interactions.</p><p id="P11">Gradual co-evolutionary adaptations might feasibly mask the processes that initially shaped new resistance traits, thus focusing on traits of recent evolutionary origin may provide a practical means to explore the costs and benefits of plant resistance before specialized antagonists could evolve. In one such example of a recent gain of a novel defence, plants of the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> (Brassicaceae) evolved the ability to produce cardenolide compounds within the last 5 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Züst et al., 2020</xref>). Cardenolides are a potent class of toxins with distinctly different mode of action from glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agrawal, Petschenka, et al., 2012</xref>), and consequently at least some glucosinolate-resistant herbivores are completely repelled from <italic>Erysimum</italic> plants by these compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sachdev-Gupta et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Younkin et al., 2024</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang &amp; Züst, 2025</xref>). This ‘escape’ from herbivores may have resulted in a recent and rapid radiation in this speciose genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Züst et al., 2020</xref>). Most <italic>Erysimum</italic> species co-express glucosinolate and cardenolide defences, but while variation in glucosinolates is limited among species and appears to have become fixed within at least some species (T. Züst, unpublished), variation in cardenolides is much more extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Züst et al., 2020</xref>), and may reflect more diverse selection pressures acting on the novel defence. To the best of our knowledge, no herbivore has evolved specialised resistance to cardenolides in the <italic>Erysimum</italic> system, and only one cardenolide-specialised seed bug has shifted its host range to include seeds from these plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Petschenka et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>Erysimum</italic> system thus offers a unique opportunity for studying the interplay between herbivory, defence, and fitness, before interactions are changed by coevolution.</p><p id="P12">Here we use the annual plant <italic>Erysimum cheiranthoides</italic> to characterise the natural community of herbivores that attack this plant in central Europe. We aim to address whether the gain of cardenolides has allowed this plant to escape from herbivory in a natural community, and to understand the selective forces that act on this species in its putative ‘enemy-free space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jeffries &amp; Lawton, 1984</xref>). We compared benefits of the novel defence under high herbivore pressure to potential costs of defence under high competition. To this end, we grew the dually defended <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> side-by-side with a phenologically similar Brassicaceae plant (<italic>Brassica nigra</italic>) over two consecutive years. Plants were grown in fields adjacent to oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>), which provided a high density of herbivores specialized on Brassicaceae. We monitored herbivore abundance and plant damage for a full growing season in both years. In the second year we included insecticide treatments to manipulate the costs and benefits of differential investments in resistance traits, and evaluated the performance of both plant species under different levels of competition</p><p id="P13">We hypothesise that due to its novel cardenolide defence, <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> is better defended and damaged less by herbivores, and consequently achieves a higher fitness compared with <italic>B. nigra.</italic> Secondly, we predict that the dual investment in defence may render <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> competitively inferior to <italic>B. nigra</italic> when herbivore pressure is low.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Plant material</title><p id="P14"><italic>Erysimum cheiranthoides</italic> is an annual plant that is native to central and northern Europe and parts of Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Polatschek, 2010</xref>, 2013), where it grows in scattered populations in ruderal habitats. Plants commonly flower from May through September, with peak flowering in June and seed ripening in August to October (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Polatschek, 2013</xref>; T. Züst, personal observations). For this study, we used a total of 38 accessions of <italic>E. cheiranthoides,</italic> which were originally collected from locations in western and central Europe, and which we had propagated in a common greenhouse environment for two generations. To contrast patterns of herbivory on <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> to a more typical Brassicaceae plant, we included the annual <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> as a control. <italic>B. nigra</italic> is a representative member of the Brassicaceae that is well-liked by many glucosinolate-resistant herbivores, which shares a similar phenology, and which grows at a similar rate and reaches a similar size as <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> under field conditions. Seeds of <italic>B. nigra</italic> used in this study were originally provided by the Botanical Garden of Krefeld, Germany. For the current study, we focus on species-level patterns between <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and <italic>B. nigra,</italic> thus we treat accessions of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> as equivalent.</p><p id="P15">Plants for field experiments were sown in late April for transplantation to the field in late May. We soaked seeds of E. <italic>cheiranthoides</italic> in water and kept them at 4 °C for three days to break dormancy. Three soaked seeds were placed on the soil surface of pots (7 × 7 × 8 cm) filled with a 1:1 mixture of washed sand and peat-based planting substrate (Einheitserde, Patzer Erden GmbH, Germany). Seeds of <italic>B. nigra</italic> were directly sown into pots without pre-treatment and lightly covered with soil. Pots were covered with transparent plastic hoods for one week to maintain high humidity, and seeds were germinated in a growth chamber (constant light, 23 °C, 60% relative humidity). Seven days after sowing, plants were moved to an open greenhouse and shaded from direct sunlight for continued growth and hardening. In the last week of May, three-week old plants were transplanted into freshly tilled fields at the Swiss federal agricultural research station (Agroscope Reckenholz, Switzerland). Plants were transplanted to the field inside their plastic pot to slow the escape of growing roots and to limit excessive biomass growth in the field. A small set of plants was kept in the greenhouse for an additional week and used for the assessment of leaf traits (trichome density and size) and innate herbivore preference under laboratory conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Field experiments</title><sec id="S5"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Experiment 1: 2022 herbivory</title><p id="P16">In 2022, we used a rectangular field site measuring 6 m × 80 m in a SW to NE orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>, 47.4376° N, 8.5268° E), located alongside a larger field of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>). On either side of the experimental plot, 1 m-wide buffer strips of a commercial cover crop mixture consisting of <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> and <italic>Avena strigosa</italic> had been sown two months earlier. We divided the experimental plot into ten blocks (5 × 7 m), and in each block we planted 38 <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and 4 <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants in a randomized grid pattern, with plants spaced 1 m apart and with a 0.5 m distance to the plot edge on each side. Throughout the experiment, plants were watered as needed, and the surrounding soil was weeded regularly and kept free of other vegetation. Unfortunately, cover strips had to be mowed halfway through the experiment (week 5) to prevent weed seed dispersal.</p><p id="P17">We closely monitored plants over a period of nine weeks. In weeks 3, 6, and 9, we assessed plant damage by herbivores, and in the six remaining weeks, we recorded the herbivores that were present on each experimental plant. In weeks of herbivore community assessments, we visited each plant once and recorded the type and number of herbivores sitting or feeding on the plant. Herbivores were recorded at species level where visual identification was feasible, and as functional groups otherwise (e.g., flea beetles, weevils). Assessment of all plants was completed over 2-3 subsequent days in each week. In weeks of damage assessment, we visited each plant once to record leaf damage and plant size. We approximated total damage by counting the number of leaves on a plant with visible herbivore damage of any size, and we approximated plant size by counting the total number of leaves, as well as measuring the height of the plant stem from root base to apical meristem. A representative sample of leaves were harvested and analysed to determine nutritional quality of plants throughout the 2022 experiment. Briefly, leaves were frozen on dry ice and later freeze-dried for 48h. Dried leaf material was then ground to a fine powder and extracted for determination of soluble sugars, digestible starch, and total digestible proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Whole plants were sequentially harvested for biomass, with complete blocks assigned to different harvests. Block 7 was randomly selected for plants to complete development to seed production. Plants in blocks 1-3 were harvested in week 8 to capture early plant biomass, mostly before seed setting. Plants in blocks 4-6 were harvested in week 11, and plants in blocks 8-10 were harvested in week 14. A few plants had stopped vegetative growth and completely ripened their seed earlier, thus, to prevent loss of biomass we harvested these individuals ahead of schedule. For biomass harvesting, we cut the stem of each plant at soil level and placed the entire aboveground biomass in paper bags. Aboveground biomass was dried at 60°C for 48-96 hours and weighed to the nearest gram. Plants in block 7 were dug out of the soil in week 8 and transported back to a greenhouse where we let them finish their development and ripen their seeds. At the onset of seed ripening, each plant was wrapped in a paper bag to prevent seed loss. After harvesting, seeds were separated from vegetative biomass, biomass was dried and weighed, and seed mass was weighed separately for each plant in this block. Finally, we counted and weighed a subset of 100 seeds for each plant to determine average seed size.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Experiment 2: 2023 herbivory and herbivore exclusion</title><p id="P19">Based on the results of the 2022 field experiment, we set up a modified field experiment in 2023 with added treatments of plant competition and herbivore suppression. To test for the effect of plant-plant competition, a subset of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> plants was grown together with a <italic>B. nigra</italic> plant in the same 7 x 7 x 8 cm pot. To reduce herbivore loads, half of all plants (individual and competing) were additionally treated with weekly applications of lambda-cyhalothrin (Kendo® Gold, Maag Gardens, Switzerland), a non-systemic pyrethroid insecticide.</p><p id="P20">In 2023, we used a different rectangular field site measuring 4 m × 66 m in a W to E orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>, 47.4284° N, 8.5232° E), again located alongside a larger field of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>). On either side of the experimental plot, 1.5 m-wide buffer strips of the same cover crop mixture had been sown one week prior to transplanting, which were maintained throughout the experiment. We divided the experimental plot into six blocks (3 × 7 m). For blocks 1, 2, 5, and 6, we planted 36 individual <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and 4 <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants each in a stratified random grid pattern, with plants spaced 1 m apart and with a 0.5 m distance to the plot edge on each side. For blocks 3 and 4, we planted 40 pairs of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants each, with each pair spaced apart from the next by 1 m (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). Starting at transplanting, we applied weekly sprays of lambda-cyhalothrin (15 mg/L water) to all plants in blocks 2, 4, and 6, completely wetting all leaf surfaces. We maintained spraying for seven consecutive weeks, increasing the total volume sprayed as plants were growing larger, from approximately 30 mL per plant in the first three weeks up to 150 mL per plant by week 7. Plants in blocks 1, 3, and 5 were sprayed with an equivalent amount of water.</p><p id="P21">Herbivore community assessments were carried out as before (weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8), but we modified our damage assessment (weeks 3, 6, 9) to distinguishing leaves with high (leaves with more than 75% of area damaged) and low damage. With damage assessments, we also measured plant height and the total number of leaves. However, total leaf counts had high levels of observer bias for older (and therefore larger) plants in 2022, thus for weeks 6 and 9, we instead measured plant diameter and branch number. We additionally counted the total number of leaves on 20 randomly selected plants in weeks 6 and 9, and from this subset generated a predictive linear model of total leaf number as a function of plant height, diameter, branch number, assessment week and observer. We then used this model to predict the total number of leaves for all remaining plants. In the 2023 field experiment, all plants were harvested in week 10. We cut plants at soil level and placed the entire aboveground biomass in paper bags, followed by drying at 60°C for 48-96 hours and weighing to the nearest gram.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P22">The current study is focused on differences between <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and <italic>B. nigra,</italic> while variation among <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> accessions will be presented elsewhere. For the 2022 field experiment, we use herbivore community, damage, and plant size data from all 40 <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants and 40 neighbouring <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> plants. Neighbours were selected randomly out of the maximum of four immediate neighbours for each <italic>B. nigra</italic> plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>).

Two <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> neighbours were selected for this dataset to avoid issues with small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>).

As the competition treatment had little effect on herbivore community composition, we only used individual plant data for these analyses.</p><p id="P24">We first analysed the total number of individuals observed on each plant as a function of plant species, using separate negative-binomial Generalized Linear Models (GLM, function ‘glm.nb’ in the <italic>MASS</italic> package, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Venables &amp; Ripley, 2002</xref>)) for each year, and including insecticide treatment as an explanatory variable for 2023. To examine temporal variation in herbivore presence and abundance, we next employed a series of Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) using the ‘gam’ function in the <italic>mgcv</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wood et al., 2016</xref>), fitting separate negative binomial GAMs to total herbivore counts in 2022 and 2023. For the 2022 data, we constructed a full model that included a parametric term of ‘plant species’ and a smoothing term (based on thin plate regression splines) for ‘days in the field’ that was allowed to vary by plant species (i.e. separate smoothers for each plant species). We determined the number of nodes (parameter <italic>k</italic> in GAM) by subtracting 1 from the total number of weeks insects were observed in the field. To estimate the significance of the parametric term we used the default Wald tests on deviance explained. To evaluate the support for species-specific smoothers, we constructed equivalent models without interaction terms and compared nested models based on BIC. For the 2023 data, we included an additional parametric term of ‘insecticide treatment’ and a modified smoother allowing for an interaction between ‘days in the field’ and all four combinations of ‘plant species’ and ‘insecticide treatment’.</p><p id="P25">We finally fit a set of models to the individual presence and abundance data for the eight most abundant herbivores in both years. Data from the 2023 insecticide and competition treatments was excluded from this analysis to simplify results. Herbivore abundance was analysed again using negative binomial GAMs, while we also analysed herbivore presence-absence data (i.e., the likelihood of occurrence) using binomial GAMs. To avoid problems with excess zeros, we only included data from weeks in which an herbivore was observed more than once in the dataset, adjusting the number of nodes accordingly for each herbivore (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Plant damage assessments</title><p id="P26">The amount of leaf damage was analysed by fitting a Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Model (GLMM) using the glmer function in the <italic>lme4</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). To account for the paired design of the competition treatment in 2023, we specified ‘neighbourhood group’ as a random effect for all models. In the competition treatment, neighbourhood group refers to individual pots with pairs of plants, whereas in the individual treatment, neighbourhood group refers to three adjacent pots each with a single plant (one <italic>B. nigra</italic> plant randomly paired with one or two <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> neighbours). For the 2022 field experiment, we used the numbers of damaged and undamaged leaves for each plant as a two-vector dependent variable (i.e., a binomial variable representing the proportion of leaves with insect damage).

High mobility may also explain the higher numbers of observed herbivores on insecticide-treated plants in 2023. Pyrethroid insecticides are toxic upon contact but have a relatively low environmental persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ripley et al., 2001</xref>), thus weekly applications likely knocked down herbivore numbers and reduced plant damage, but the resulting increase in plant quality may have subsequently attracted higher numbers of mobile (less damaging) herbivores. Correlations between herbivore abundances and plant damage supported this explanation, as under ambient herbivore conditions, plant damage on <italic>B. nigra</italic> and <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> was best correlated with <italic>P. xylostella</italic> and <italic>E. ornata</italic> abundance as two major damaging herbivores, respectively.

Our measurements revealed only modest differences in foliar nutrients between <italic>B. nigra</italic> and <italic>E. cheiranthoides,</italic> and total protein content as a key resource for herbivores did not differ between plant species for most of the experiment.

Structural traits such as plant height, size, or shape could also have affected herbivore colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>) but such differences are perhaps less likely to explain the observed patterns in our study, given the similarities in plant size, similar apparency of plants in a weeded bare soil environment, and consistent preference for <italic>B. nigra</italic> of four Brassicaceae herbivores in leaf disc choice assays. Overall, the large observed differences in herbivore preference are unlikely to be caused by the relatively modest differences in nutritional traits or plant shape. Cardenolides thus remain one of the most distinctive traits between the two species, although the additional importance of trichomes and perhaps other unmeasured traits cannot be ruled out at this point.</p><p id="P49">A direct causal role of cardenolides for defence of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> was recently demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Younkin et al.

However, despite the substantial costs at lower herbivore abundances, our study clearly demonstrated a benefit of this defensive strategy in other conditions. Damage by herbivores can reduce growth of undefended plants directly by reducing photosynthetically active leaf area and depleting vital plant resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Machado et al., 2016</xref>), or indirectly by inducing plant responses that divert resources away from growth to defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Attaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zangerl et al., 2002</xref>), yet <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> experienced neither of these impairments under high herbivore pressure. By preferentially attacking the competitively superior susceptible host plants, herbivores thus benefitted a competitively inferior resistant plants, which would be expected to result in an increase in its frequency over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Crawley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Myers &amp; Sarfraz, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P51">Despite weak competitive ability of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> (and likely that of its close relatives) in the absence of specialized herbivores, the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> has undergone a recent radiation that coincided with the gain of cardenolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Züst et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that this key innovation facilitated an escape from herbivory and subsequent diversification in enemy-free space. However, <italic>E. cheiranthoides,</italic> and species in the genus more generally, still mostly occupy marginal habitats that are often devoid of vegetation, rarely forming large populations. <italic>Erysimum</italic> plants thus appear to lack the ability to become dominant species within a community, despite being better defended than most of their heterospecific neighbours. Further evolutionary change and optimization may perhaps lower costs of defence for these plants in the future (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karasov et al., 2017</xref>). However, an increase in frequency of <italic>Erysimum</italic> plants may also increase selection pressures for the types of specialized herbivore resistance to evolve that are common in cardenolide-producing plant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dobler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Petschenka et al., 2017</xref>), thus continuing the never-ceasing arms race between plants and their herbivores.</p><p id="P52">In conclusion, the gain of a novel defence appears to have allowed <italic>Erysimum</italic> plants to escape herbivore-imposed selection, if not herbivory entirely. However, the costs required to maintain this ‘enemy-free space’ are so substantial that plants can only thrive under conditions where competitors are absent, or where they are suppressed by strong herbivory. As these specific conditions are rare, <italic>Erysimum</italic> is currently confined to survive in marginal habitats, yet changing environmental conditions might well favour this unusually well-defended plant in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191809-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mark Charran, Broti Biswas, Teresa Vaello, Daniel Schlagenhauf, Alina Pfammatter and Paul Wieduwilt for field assistance, and Laura Dällenbach, Rayko Jonas and Markus Meierhofer for greenhouse support.
