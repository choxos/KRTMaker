These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN<sup>+/-</sup> or STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN<sup>+/-</sup> (but not STRN3<sup>+/-</sup>) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Protein phosphatase 2A</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>cardiac hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The development of heart failure is associated with significant morbidity and a poor prognosis despite optimal medical therapy. It affects millions of people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. A leading cause of heart failure is hypertension that affects ~30% of all adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Whilst the identification of patients suffering from hypertension and their management has significantly improved in recent years, a number of patients present acutely with end-organ damage or progress to complications of hypertension in spite of maximal therapy. Broader therapeutic options for individual patients to manage hypertensive heart disease are clearly needed, but this requires greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Striatin (STRN) is associated with salt-dependent hypertension in mice. Thus, mice that are heterozygotic for STRN gene deletion have a similar blood pressure profile to wild-type littermates when provided with a low salt diet, but have a greater increase in blood pressure with higher dietary salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. This probably results from effects in endothelial cells and enhanced vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These mice also have increased renal damage in response to aldosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Further evidence for a role for STRN in heart failure comes from boxer dogs with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and heart failure, resulting from an 8 bp deletion in the 3’UTR of STRN and reduced STRN expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In humans, SNPs in the STRN gene are linked to blood pressure regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], PR/QRS interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. SNPs in a second isoform, striatin 3 (STRN3, also known as SG2NA) are also linked to hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. STRN, STRN3 and the third isoform, STRN4, are all expressed in the heart. Understanding the roles of these proteins may increase therapeutic options in patients with hypertension to both reduce the risk and to manage the development of heart failure complications.</p><p id="P5">The heart mainly contains contractile cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells in the capillary network and fibroblasts producing extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Since adult mammalian cardiomyocytes are terminally-differentiated, they respond to increased cardiac workload (e.g. resulting from hypertension) with hypertrophic growth to increase contractile function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The increase in cell size is associated with increased contractile apparatus and changes in gene expression (e.g. upregulation of <italic>Myh7</italic> and <italic>Nppb</italic> mRNAs).</p><p id="P6">Cardiomyocytes may undergo necrosis or programmed cell death in situations of extreme or prolonged stress, compromising cardiac function and leading to heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Loss of endothelial cells and capillary rarefaction is another feature of developing heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], along with increased fibrosis in the myocardium (interstitial fibrosis) that compromises cardiac function by increasing ventricular wall stiffness, and around the arterioles (perivascular fibrosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Fibrosis is associated with increased numbers of myofibroblasts which may derive from activation of resident fibroblasts or other cardiac cells (e.g. endothelial cells may undergo endothelial to mesenchymal transition and increase numbers of myofibroblasts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Cellular changes associated with cardiac remodelling are regulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Whilst much is known about protein kinase signalling cascades, specific roles of phosphatases and dephosphorylation are less well understood. The Ser-/Thr- phosphatase PP2A is highly abundant and ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. It is formed of one of two catalytic subunits (PP2A<sub>c</sub>), one of two regulatory subunits (PP2A<sub>A</sub>) and one of many targeting “B” subunits that direct PP2A to its substrates. Striatins form a class of B subunits (B’”) for PP2A, but also interact with protein kinases, particularly those of the Germinal Centre Kinase (GCK) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Because of this, striatin-based complexes have been termed <bold><italic><underline>STR</underline></italic></bold>iatin-<bold><italic><underline>I</underline></italic></bold>nteracting <bold><italic><underline>P</underline></italic></bold>hosphatase and <bold><italic><underline>K</underline></italic></bold>inase (STRIPAK) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. This system places GCKs in close proximity to PP2A which maintains the kinase in a dephosphorylated (inactive) state. Inhibition of PP2A or removal of the phosphatase or kinase results in kinase activation, most probably through autophosphorylation. Striatins have an N-terminal domain that binds caveolins, potentially directing them to the plasma membrane and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-binding domain. A coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal WD repeats facilitate binding of other proteins. Interactome studies have identified many proteins in STRIPAK complexes, some of which probably direct different complexes to different subcellular targets and/or subdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Striatins, GCKs and STRIPAKs regulate a diverse array of cellular processes including cell survival/proliferation/migration, key features of cardiac remodelling. As described above, STRN is linked to various forms of heart failure and conductance irregularities. Consistent with the latter, STRN is of significant importance in composite junctions between cells, and immunostaining experiments place STRN at intercalated discs between cardiomyocytes, potentially regulating ion fluxes between cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Our hypothesis is that STRIPAKs play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with developing heart failure. Here, we show that <italic>STRN, STRN3</italic> and <italic>STRN4</italic> are all dysregulated in human failing hearts compared with normal controls, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3. Our data in mouse models with heterozygote knockout of STRN and STRN3 identified STRN, but not STRN3, as a potential mediator of the early phase of cardiac remodelling (i.e. prior to heart failure development and cardiac dysfunction) induced by developing hypertension in mice resulting from angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. Further studies using mice with inducible cardiomyocyte-specific STRN deletion confirmed that cardiomyocyte striatin plays a key role in this early remodelling phase.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics statement</title><sec id="S4"><title>Human heart samples</title><p id="P9">Human heart samples were from the University of Pittsburgh, U.S.A.

Animals were checked daily and breeding was conducted with mice between 6 weeks and 8 months with a maximum of 6 litters per female. Mice undergoing procedures were monitored using a score sheet and routinely culled if they reached a predefined endpoint agreed with the Named Veterinary Surgeon. Weights were taken before, during and at the end of the procedures. Mouse weights from the start and end of procedures are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. These studies used only male mice because of the intention to convert the line for conditional gene deletion using tamoxifen (see below), an approach which has not been fully characterised for female mice. Furthermore, our recent studies of inducible deletion of BRAF indicated that males and females responded very differently to this regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Mice were allocated to specific groups on a random basis with randomisation performed independently of the individual leading the experiment. Four mice receiving AngII that died and all data for these were excluded from analysis (one wild-type from the STRN colony that died on day 2, two STRN<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cre<sup>MCM/-</sup> mice treated with corn-oil that died on day 7 and one STRN<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cre<sup>MCM/-</sup> mouse treated with tamoxifen that died on day 7). Post-mortem analysis showed rupture of a major blood vessel in all cases. Otherwise, no mice were excluded after randomisation. Individuals conducting the studies were not blinded to experimental conditions for welfare monitoring purposes. Data and sample analysis (e.g. echocardiography, histology) was performed by individuals who were blinded to intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mouse lines and gene deletion strategy</title><p id="P14">Mice for STRN or STRN3 knockout were from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP).

The fur covering the mid-scapular region was removed using an electric razor and the area was sterilised with HIBISCRUB® (VioVet). Under aseptic conditions, a 2 cm incision was made at the midscapular region and blunt dissection generated a pocket towards the lower-left flank of the mouse for the minipump to be inserted.

Haemotoxylin and eosin staining was used for analysis of myocyte crosssectional area. Cells around the periphery of the left ventricle (excluding epicardial layer) were chosen at random (ensuring that the cells were in cross section and with a clear, rounded nucleus) and outline traced using NDP.view2 software (Hamamatsu). Up to 30 cells were measured per section by a single independent assessor and the mean value taken for each mouse. To assess interstitial fibrosis, sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome or picrosirius red and analysis used Image-J as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].

At this 7 day time point, AngII induced only a small, non-significant increase in interstitial fibrosis and this was most commonly detected in the area at the junction between the interventricular septum and the ventricular wall.

These mice were used to generate homozygous floxed STRN mice with a single allele for tamoxifen-inducible Cre under the control of a Myh6 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Male STRN<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cre<sup>+/-</sup> mice (8 weeks) were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen (40 mg/kg) to induce recombination, an approach which is not associated with significant cardiotoxicity from the Cre enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Recombination was detected in hearts but not kidneys from STRN<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cre<sup>+/-</sup> mice treated with tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), confirming cardiac-specific gene deletion. Osmotic minipumps were implanted 4 days after tamoxifen treatment (by which time the tamoxifen has been cleared from the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]) to deliver acidified PBS vehicle or 0.8 mg/kg/d AngII for 7 days.

STRN4 expression was increased in the hearts of some mice, but the overall difference was not statistically significant. As with global heterozygous STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>), AngII increased expression of STRN, but there was no increase in the hearts of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Using echocardiography, we detected no significant differences in cardiac function between any of the conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).

This was significantly reduced in mice with cardiomyocyte deletion of STRN. To determine if there were likely to be secondary consequences, we measured the width of the aorta after systolic contraction when the aortic diameter is at its largest, compared with the diameter following cardiac relaxation. AngII had no significant effect on either measurement in mice treated with corn-oil vehicle alone. However, with cardiomyocyte deletion of STRN, the width of the aorta following relaxation (i.e. the smallest diameter) was significantly greater in mice treated with AngII than the aortas from the vehicle treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). This resulted in a significant decrease in the width ratio, suggesting that the loss of striatin in the heart had a secondary effect on the aorta.</p><p id="P33">AngII increased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and this was significantly reduced with cardiomyocyte knockout of STRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>).

Unexpectedly and in contrast to the effect of global heterozygous STRN knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>), the increase in interstitial and perivascular fibrosis induced by AngII was significantly inhibited with cardiomyocyte STRN knockout and this was associated with reduced expression of fibrotic gene markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D-F</xref>). We conclude that cardiomyocyte STRN plays an important role in early adaptive remodelling of the heart induced by AngII, with effects at the level of the cardiomyocytes themselves to promote hypertrophic growth and to increase cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Eukaryotic cellular responses are regulated by vast numbers of protein phosphorylation reactions, catalysed by over 500 different protein kinases in the mammalian kinome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and countered by a range of protein phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. We have detailed knowledge of how some key signalling pathways operate, but the regulation and roles of many protein kinases remain to be unravelled. Here, we focused on a relatively uninvestigated system, the STRIPAK complexes with a striatin isoform at the core, bringing together the most abundant protein phosphatase in the cell (PP2A) with key protein kinases (GCKs) to regulate their activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Our data indicate that the three striatin isoforms are all dysregulated in human failing hearts, but our studies with genetically-altered mice place a particular emphasis on striatin itself in the development of cardiac hypertrophy induced by AngII treatment and, therefore, in the broader context of hypertensive heart disease.</p><p id="P35">The data support a working model in which striatin-based STRIPAKs operate in all cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). AngII probably acts primarily on endothelial cells since these are highly responsive to AngII and are in direct contact with AngII in the blood. Amongst other effects, AngII stimulates endothelial cells to release pro-hypertrophic factors (e.g. endothelin-1, Edn1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]) that act on cardiomyocytes, inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In turn, cardiomyocytes release factors that promote fibrosis (e.g. fibroblast growth factor 2, FGF2) and proliferation (e.g. EGF family ligands) in other cardiac cells. Our previous studies with BRAF knockout mice support this concept since <italic>Edn1</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> mRNAs are upregulated in mouse hearts by AngII, but manipulation of cardiomyocyte signalling (with cardiomyocyte knockout of BRAF) selectively inhibit the increase in <italic>FGF2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. We propose that the response involves striatin-based STRIPAKs with activation of GCKs in one or more of the cardiac cell types. With cardiomyocyte knockout of STRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), the likely dysregulation and mislocalisation of one or more GCK in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to reduce hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Pro-fibrotic cardiomyocyte-derived factors are also reduced, resulting in inhibition of fibrotic genes and overall reduction in cardiac fibrosis. With heterozygous global striatin knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), the situation is more complex. Striatin-based STRIPAKs are decreased in all cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), most likely resulting in some dysregulation and mislocalisation of GCKs throughout the heart. Thus, there is probably reduced production of hypertrophic factors from endothelial cells to suppress cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and, coupled with the effect of striatin loss in cardiomyocytes, this potentially leads to more profound inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). There is also likely to be a reduction in cardiomyocyte derived pro-fibrotic factors, but we did not detect any decrease in cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This could be due to dysregulation of the system generally, increasing the overall level of stress on the heart.</p><p id="P36">Previous studies in mice with global heterozygous STRN knockout used the same knockout-first system as we used here. The earlier studies developed from prior work demonstrating upregulation of STRN in mouse heart and aorta by aldosterone, modulation of dietary salt or a combination of L-NAME (to inhibit NO production) and AngII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates have similar blood pressure when fed a restricted salt or normal diet (0.03% or 0.3-0.5% NaCl, respectively), but have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure on a higher salt diet (1.6% NaCl) along with enhanced contraction of aortic rings and reduced relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice also have an enhanced response to aldosterone with increased renal (though not cardiac) damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in the renal or cardiac responses of STRN<sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type mice in a hypertension model using L-NAME and AngII, despite an increase in blood pressure. This apparently contradicts our data, but the models are different. L-NAME specifically inhibits NO production and compromises endothelial cell function and vessel relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. In the Garza et al. model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], mice were treated with L-NAME for 7 d, before implantation of minipumps for delivery of 0.7 mg/kg/d AngII for 3 d in a regime that increased blood pressure. Our approach used AngII at a similar dose over 7 d, but without L-NAME, a regime with a minimal effect on blood pressure over this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and, arguably, a milder model. Our goal was to assess effects of AngII as hypertension develops and our data indicate that STRN is required for this early adaptive phase of the cardiac response.</p><p id="P37">STRN3 was first identified as a nuclear antigen (S/G2 nuclear antigen, SG2NA) subject to cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and, consequently, there is greater emphasis on its role in proliferating cells and cancer (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]). However, it is expressed at significant levels in the heart and, of the multiple splice-variants, the dominant isoform is reported to be 78 kD, lacking two exons from the full-length 87 kDa variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] Although other variants are reported in the heart, we detected a single dominant band above the 75 kDa marker, presumably corresponding to the 78 kDa STRN3 isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1-S3</xref>). We are not aware of other published studies of STRN3 in the heart or of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in STRN3 knockout mice. STRN3 was expressed in mouse and human hearts and was significantly upregulated in human failing hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). However, we did not detect any significant differences in cardiac function or dimensions between STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates, either at baseline or in response to AngII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The studies of STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> and STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice were done in parallel and the negative results with STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> mice emphasize the potential importance of STRN in the early adaptive response to AngII. However, STRN3 may play an important role in later phases of hypertension-induced cardiac dysfunction and/or in other cardiac pathologies (e.g. myocardial infarction that results in acute injury). It also has to be considered that we studied mice with heterozygote rather than homozygote gene deletion and study of homozygotes (not possible because of embryonic lethality) may have been more revealing. Because of this, it was important to adopt a conditional deletion approach to avoid problems during development.</p><p id="P38">Immunostaining studies place STRN at the intercalated disc in the heart suggesting it may regulate ion fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Consistent with this concept, reduced expression of STRN in boxer dogs is associated with ARVC and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], both of which are associated with a higher risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. In addition, studies in cultured cardiomyocytes indicate that overexpression of striatin enhances contraction and STRN knockdown reduces contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) link the STRN gene with QRS/PR interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], further suggesting a role in regulating ion fluxes and contractility in cardiomyocytes. We did not detect any differences in cardiac function between STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates, but it is unlikely that we would have detected arrhythmias with echocardiography in the relatively young mice we studied with a relatively low level of stress resulting from the dose and duration of AngII treatment. Greater differences would perhaps have been detected in older mice or with a more severe or prolonged stress (e.g. in a myocardial infarction model, prolonged treatment with AngII or with transverse aortic constriction).</p><p id="P39">Even though we saw no effect of heterozygous STRN knockout on cardiac function using echocardiography, the overall hypertrophic response induced by AngII was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This was due to a reduction in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy rather than fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that the phenotype resulted from decreased STRN expression in cardiomyocytes. To address this, we developed a model for homozygous cardiomyocyte-specific STRN knockout adopting a system for inducible and conditional gene deletion. This used a well-established approach using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre enzyme under the regulation of the MYH6 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], a system which avoids problems associated with development but raises additional concerns of potential cardiotoxicity from the Cre enzyme. This was minimised by only using mice hemizygous for Cre and by restraining temporal activation of the enzyme with just a single dose of tamoxifen to induce recombination. In hemizygous Cre<sup>+/-</sup> mice, we detect no cardiotoxicity with or without AngII for at least the duration of the experiments reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Others have used a similar approach and also report little cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Given the results with STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice, we anticipated that the hypertrophic response induced by AngII would be compromised by cardiomyocyte STRN knockout, and the increase in predicted LV mass estimated on echocardiograms was, indeed, reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, the degree of inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy appeared less than with the STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice and, in contrast to the STRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice, there was substantial reduction in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The mice were derived from sperm from our STRN<sup>+/-</sup> colony so the difference is unlikely to be due to the genetic background. Thus, the effect on fibrosis is most probably a true reflection of the knockout system, leading to our working model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> as described above.</p><p id="P40">SNPs in the STRN gene have been linked to regulation of blood pressure and the development of heart failure using GWAS, but there are some difficulties with interpretation.

HEATR5B (HEAT repeat containing 5B) is a ubiquitously expressed protein-coding gene of unknown function and further studies of its role in blood pressure regulation may be useful. Nevertheless, SNPs in the STRN gene are also linked to increased blood pressure (rs2540923 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], rs3770770 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]) in addition to QRS/PR interval (rs3770770 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], rs17496249 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (rs2003585 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]).

MST1/2, MST3, SLK and MAP4K4 are relatively highly expressed in adult rat cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>], so these are the candidate kinases for cardiac adaptation to AngII. MST1/MST2 are involved in HIPPO signalling and regulation of cell survival/cell death in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. Since cardiomyocyte MST1 knockout increases autophagic flux to alleviate AngII-induced cardiac damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], dysregulation of MST1 as a result of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout could have a similar effect and reduce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. MAP4K4 associates with striatins in cardiomyocytes and is linked to human heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>], so could also be involved. MST3 plays an important role in cell migration and is regulated acutely by phosphatase activity in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>], but there is little/no information on the role of SLK in heart. Whilst all of the kinases may interact with each of the striatins in experiments conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> or using overexpression approaches, specificity in terms of STRIPAK binding partners or subcellular targeting remains to be determined.</p><p id="P42">This study only considers the role of STRN and STRN3 in the early stages of cardiac remodelling induced by AngII, not the later stages associated with heart failure and decreased ejection fraction. Extending the study over a more prolonged period would enable further assessment of whether STRN knockdown or cardiomyocyte deletion could prevent this deterioration of cardiac function. Longer term studies would also help to determine if STRN3 plays an important role in developing heart failure, as suggested by the minor abnormalities in longitudinal strain we detected in STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> mice treated with AngII over 7 d. We also did not consider the possible effects of STRN on arrhythmias and sudden death. We noted that the STRN mice under investigation in this study appeared more prone to sudden death than other genetically altered mice (e.g. those associated with BRAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]) we studied in parallel. However, there was no correlation with STRN expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), suggesting it was either coincidental or related to the background strain. Given the link between STRN and ARVC in boxer dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and SNPs in the STRN gene to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it will be important to conduct additional studies to assess possible arrhythmias in mice with STRN knockdown. Probably the greatest limitation of this study is the lack of knowledge of the STRIPAK complexes themselves. Thus, although the data suggest that inhibiting STRN will reduce cardiac hypertrophy induced by AngII, STRN potentially acts at the core of multiple complexes that regulate different GCKs, and one or more of these GCKs may be involved. Knowing which GCKs are involved and how they are regulated will be a crucial element for identifying specific targets for therapeutic manipulation of STRIPAK signalling.</p><p id="P43">In conclusion, our data indicate that STRN, but probably not STRN3, plays an important role in the early remodelling processes induced in the heart to AngII. Although there is clearly much research still to be done, the data clearly identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a novel signalling paradigm in development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Understanding this system may provide therapeutic options for modulating the responses and managing progression of hypertensive heart disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190182-supplement-Supplemental_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d34aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andrew Cripps, Mhairi Baxter and Wayne Knight (University of Reading), and Robert Bond, Emma Mustafa and Rene Ocho (St. George’s University of London) for support for the <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse studies.</p><sec id="S22"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the British Heart Foundation (PG/15/41/31560, FS/18/33/33621, PG/15/24/31367, FS/19/24/34262) and Qassim University, Saudi Arabia (to H.O.A).</p></sec></ack><sec id="S23" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="P44">All primary data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN3" fn-type="con"><p id="P45"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P46">J.J.C. was responsible for and conducted the breeding for the experiments with the STRN<sup>+/-</sup> and STRN3<sup>+/-</sup> mice, and the echocardiography and analysis.

PP2A dephosphorylates GCKs to maintain the inactive state in the three main cell types of the heart (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts). GCKs in STRIPAKs are targeted to subcellular domains where they modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, regulate cell death or (in endothelial cells or fibroblasts) influence cell proliferation and migration. <bold>A</bold>, In our working model, AngII acts primarily on endothelial cells in direct contact with the blood and highly responsive to this hormone. Endothelial cells release pro-hypertrophic factors to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes release additional pro-fibrotic and pro-proliferative factors that affect other cardiac cells. The response involves striatin-based STRIPAKs and activation of GCKs in one or more of the cardiac cell types, with GCKs potentially being activated by reduced PP2A activity in the STRIPAK complex. <bold>B</bold>, Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of striatin caused dysregulation (with possible increased phosphorylation) and mislocalisation of GCKs in cardiomyocytes, reducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The response was not completely lost because pro-hypertrophic factors acting through other signalling pathways were still produced by cardiac non-myocytes. Cardiomyocyte-derived factors that promote fibrosis were probably reduced, reflected in reduced expression of fibrotic genes and an overall reduction in cardiac fibrosis. <bold>C</bold>, In heterozygous global striatin knockout mice, striatin-based STRIPAKs were decreased in all cardiac cells resulting in some dysregulation and mislocalisation of GCKs. This resulted in reduced production of hypertrophic factors and, coupled with loss of striatin in cardiomyocytes, more profound inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Although there was probably some reduction in cardiomyocyte-derived profibrotic factors, together with dysregulation of STRIPAK components in non-cardiomyocytes, this was not sufficient to suppress cardiac fibrosis overall.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190182-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
