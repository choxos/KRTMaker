More than 300 causing genes were identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.sph.uth.edu/RetNet/">https://web.sph.uth.edu/RetNet/</ext-link>). Over the last 20 years, proof-of-concept for gene therapy to restore visual function and delay retinal degeneration in different models of IRDs has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). From these studies, several of the vectors are being tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). It is worth to mention that an FDA-approved drug, Luxturna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), paved the way of the gene therapy development for ocular diseases. Nonetheless, the application of this technology to treat certain forms of IRD either failed or produced imperfect retinal rescue. This concerns mainly structural proteins, proteins linked to cell structures or proteins necessitating an appropriate stoichiometric level with other partners to be functional, this feature being often not known. As examples, gene therapy for Bardet-Biedl Syndrom-1 showed efficacy to express the transgene, but the BBS1 protein accumulated in the photoreceptors and no restoration of visual function was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Deficiency of the ciliary protein LCA5 provokes retinal degeneration and gene therapy to restore its expression was only partially successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Indeed, only 4 animals out of 16 treated showed an improved retinal activity monitored by ERG and several others revealed improved photoreceptor responsiveness to light using multiple electrode array suggesting that only patches of transduced photoreceptors expressing the right amount of the LCA5 protein properly restored photoreceptor function. Investigation using the Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-Ex-M) method to probe for cellular outcome of the LCA5 gene augmentation strategy revealed that many photoreceptors showed an extension of the LCA5 protein outside of the normal localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), suggesting that protein miss-localization may account for impaired functional rescue. However, success of long-term effect with other genes coding for ciliary proteins with treatment at any ages of the disease were documented for RPGR or NPHP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) revealing different regulations of protein addressing to the cilium.</p><p id="P6">Retinitis pigmentosa-type 28 (RP28) is the consequence of bi-allelic null mutations in the <italic>FAM161A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), which codes for a protein (FAM161A) known to form part of the inner scaffold structure maintaining microtubule doublets of the connecting cilium and the basal body/centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Interestingly, FAM161A when overexpressed in human cells decorates cytoplasmic microtubules, highlighting its microtubule binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Interestingly among the potential homologue proteins, FAM161A has only one strong hit with more than 95% with a predicted shared structure of TPX2 (<italic>Xenopus</italic> kinesin-like protein-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). It is thus not surprising that FAM161A is a microtubule binding protein and may interact with other centriolar proteins as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We recently showed in the <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup>mouse deficient for <italic>Fam161a</italic> gene that the connecting cilium (CC) did not form properly and displayed ultrastructural aberrations with spread microtubule doublets due to the loss of the inner scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Moreover, we found that the localization of other proteins composing the CC such as the centriolar protein POC5 or the connecting cilium protein CEP290 was markedly reduced. In addition, the cilium was fully disorganized leading to an abnormal distribution of the Rhodopsin protein necessary for the phototransduction function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). All proteins involved in the phototransduction pathway traffic through this CC structure to form or reach the outer segment to ensure light detection, emphasizing the importance of cilium integrity for photoreceptor function. Alteration of the CC in <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> mice leads to a slow and progressive cell death, phenocopying the human RP28 disease. It is also important to note that CEP290 deficiency leads to retinal degeneration. A correct reconstruction of the CC in the <italic>Fam161a</italic>-associated deficiency appears thus necessary to restore cell function and maintain cell survival in the FAM161A deficient retina. Seizing the opportunity of this mouse model which recapitulated human disease features with a relatively slow degenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), we investigated the possibility to restore the thin structure of the CC and tested different levels of gene expression to assess whether this CC formation necessitates critical control of FAM161A expression. In a previous study, the gene transfer of the long mouse <italic>Fam161a</italic> isoform under the control of the <italic>Interphotoreceptor Retinoid-Binding Protein</italic> enhancer combined with the <italic>G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 1</italic> promoter (IRBP-GRK1), showed efficient transgene expression in rod and cone photoreceptors leading to retina rescue and improved retinal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Nonetheless, some ectopic FAM161A expression extending outside the CC was observed. Because it is known that FAM161A overexpression leads to ectopic FAM161A localization on cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), which could provoke potential cellular side effects, we aimed to optimize gene transfer and to translate this gene therapy approach using the human <italic>FAM161A</italic> cDNA.</p><p id="P8">In the human retina, <italic>FAM161A</italic> generates two major isoforms due to alternative skipping of the fourth exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). We tested these two isoforms, individually or in combination, using AAV2/8 vectors bearing the shorter or the longer human isoform controlled by different promoters and regulatory elements. We identified the conditions (vector design, treatment plan and dose) which allows the rescue of retinal survival and function. The gene therapy allows not only to repair the disorganized CC, but also to restore the appropriate expression (no ectopic expression) and localization of other proteins composing the CC. With this study, we propose that for certain structural proteins the use of a weak promoter prevents side effects, and combined with an adapted vector dose ensures an optimized distribution of the vector in the targeted tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Vector designs for photoreceptor specific expression of human long or human short FAM161A isoforms</title><p id="P9">To optimize gene transfer of the two human isoforms of the <italic>FAM161A</italic> gene (Supplemental Figure 1A, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)), we investigated different promoters and administration possibilities. To validate the expression of these two isoforms from the cDNA sequences, each cDNA was inserted in a plasmid bearing the ubiquitous, intron less, <italic>Elongation factor-1-alpha</italic> promoter (EFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). FAM161A protein expression was first tested in hTERT-RPE1 cells where the hFAM161A was detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>”). Overexpressed long or short hFAM161A isoforms decorated the cytoplasmic microtubules and stabilized microtubules as indicated by the strong acetylated tubulin signal, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In comparison, cells that do not overexpress FAM161A presented only few acetylated-Tubulin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A</xref>” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>”). The size of the two hFAM161A isoform products were confirmed by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">After this validation, different vector constructs were generated to test gene transfer efficacy according to the promoter activity. In a previous study, the <italic>Interphotoreceptor Retinoid-Binding Protein</italic> enhancer combined with the <italic>G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 1</italic> promoter (IRBP-GRK1) drove efficient transgene expression in rod and cone photoreceptors but some ectopic FAM161A expression extending outside the CC was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that using the endogenous <italic>hFAM161A</italic> promoter in the vector design may better mimic the endogenous expression and would represent an asset for the gene augmentation strategy. The mouse <italic>Fam161a</italic> promoter was shown to contain two Crx-bound-regions located in the promoter region (<italic>Cbr1</italic>) and in the first intron (<italic>Cbr2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). <italic>Cbr1</italic> and <italic>Cbr2</italic> are well conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) suggesting an active role for <italic>hFAM161A</italic> transcription. We thus identified the corresponding region in the human gene by direct alignment centered on the ATG start site of the mouse and human genomes. We identified putative Crx-binding sites in two human regions, in a 607 bp fragment 5’ of the transcription start site defined as FCBR1 and in a 457 bp fragment in the human first intron defined as FCBR2 (Supplemental Figure 1B). We also defined a 460 bp segment as the <italic>FAM161A</italic> core promoter (F0.4, Supplemental Figure 1B). To design an endogenous-like promoter for <italic>FAM161A</italic>, we fused FCBR1 or FCBR2 to F0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For all vectors, three <italic>FLAG</italic> sequences were added at the 5’ of the <italic>hFAM161A</italic> transgene, as well as a <italic>WPRE4</italic> sequence in the 3’ of the transgene cassette to stabilize the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) followed by a polyA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Gene expression driven by these different promoters was first tested with a GFP transgene without the <italic>FLAG</italic> tag. AAV2/8 vectors were individually administrated by subretinal injection into post-natal day (PN) 14-15 <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> mice and the GFP expression was analyzed one to two months later by immunolabeling. The IRBP-GRK1 promoter at a dose of 1.3×10<sup>9</sup> genomic copies in 2 microliters (GC/2μL) induced a marked GFP expression in photoreceptors as expected (n=12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas the vector with FCBR1-F0.4 promoter at a dose of 1×10<sup>10</sup> GC in 1 microliter produced low levels of GFP (n=6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) detectable in a limited region close to the injection site in the photoreceptor layer (outer retinal layer, ONL). By contrast, the vector with the FCBR2-F0.4 promoter (1×10<sup>10</sup> GC/0.5μL) produced a robust expression of GFP in photoreceptors and in the retinal pigment epithelial cells (n=9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AAV2/8-IRBP-GRK1 vectors partially preserve the retina integrity but not its function</title><p id="P12">We have previously shown that <italic>mFam161a</italic> expression of the longer isoform delivered by the AAV2/8-IRBP-GRK1 vector in the KO mouse retina preserves retinal structure and function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Here, we performed a similar study using the hFAM161A vectors. The AAV2/8-IRBP-GRK1-HL FAM161A-WPRE (IRBP-GRK1-HL) or AAV2/8-IRBP-GRK1-HS FAM161A-WPRE (IRBP-GRK1-HS) vectors (10<sup>10</sup> GC/μL) were subretinally injected separately into PN15 <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> eyes. Control eyes were injected with AAV2/8-IRBP-GRK1-GFP-WPRE (IRBP-GRK1-GFP). Surprisingly, in contradiction to the <italic>mFam161a</italic> vector, neither of the <italic>hFAM161A</italic> vectors restored or preserved retina function as attested by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings 3-month post-injection (mpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We confirmed that FAM161A expression after 3 to 6 mpi was well detected in photoreceptors, and was not only localized at the CC level but also often extended throughout the outer nuclear layer and was strongly expressed in the inner segment (ONL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, H). Such pattern of expression was observed for both the HS and the HL transferred isoforms. At 6 mpi, the ONL thickness was around two-fold thicker in the <italic>FAM161A</italic>-treated groups in comparison to the GFP control group or untreated region, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J-M</xref>). In another set of experiments, the two HS and HL vectors were co-injected at the same age (PN14-15) in the FAM161A deficient mice (10<sup>10</sup> GC/μL in total, n=18). No significant improvement of the ERG response under scotopic condition was evidenced compared to the GFP-control group despite a tendency observed at 2 mpi (<italic>p</italic>=0.0828, n=18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). The pattern of FAM161A expression was similar to the injection of single isoforms and it was detected in the photoreceptors with ectopic expression in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>, orange arrows and Suppl. Figure 2). The retina thickness was also well preserved with this co-treatment and corresponded to more than two thirds of the WT retina thickness <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2N</xref>). To further gain insights into the distribution of FAM161A in the retinal layer especially at the level of the CC and to determine if abnormal features appeared with this treatment, we turned to ultrastructure expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that FAM161A was present in the CC but no longer restricted to it (white arrow) and instead extended towards the inner segment as well as along the entire axoneme, stained with anti-tubulin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, orange arrows). The re-expression of FAM161A protein leads to the full decoration of microtubules in IS and ONL, such as seen in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Nevertheless, FAM161A expression closed the opened microtubule filaments. Looking at the CC only, the length of the FAM161A, CEP290 or POC5 labeling is increased in comparison to a WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Treatment also restored expression of two other proteins found in the cilium, LCA5 and IFT81, although the expression pattern was imperfect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, orange arrows). We then investigated whether the extended photoreceptor expression was due to a dose-dependent effect. Two lower doses were tested and the combination of the IRBP-GRK1-HS plus IRBP-GRK1-HL vectors at 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>8</sup> GC (total) per injection (Supplemental Figure 2). Although the density of the transduced cells markedly decreased with the lowest dose, many cells with expression of FAM161A in the photoreceptor cell body were observed. Thus, the dose reduction decreased the number of transduced cells (as expected), but did not reduce the spread localization of FAM161A in the photoreceptor cells. As expected, no functional improvement was noted in these low dose conditions (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AAV2/8-FCBR1-F0.4 vectors allow correct FAM161A localization, restored photoreceptor structure and prevented retinal degeneration</title><p id="P13">We hypothesized that the lack of functional rescue with IRBP-GRK1 vectors may be due to the mis-localization of the FAM161A proteins in photoreceptor cells due to high expression of the transgene as observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We thus explored the efficiency of two composite promoters, FCBR1-F0.4 and FCBR2-F0.4, derived from the human <italic>FAM161A</italic> gene sequences (Supplemental Figure 1) to drive expression in the retina. First, <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> mice were subretinally injected at PN14 with 10<sup>10</sup> GC of AAV2/8-FCBR2-F0.4-HS FAM161A (FCBR2-F0.4-HS) vector and analyzed one or three months later. The FCBR2-F0.4 vector induced a strong expression of the HS protein with mis-localization invading the ONL (n=6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, rare discrete FAM161A labelling was observed in the CC of photoreceptors, after the injection of the AAV2/8-FCBR1-F0.4-HS FAM161A (FCBR1-F0.4-HS) vector (n=6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), even if some additional spread expression/localization into the photoreceptor cells were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplemental Figure 3). Interestingly, the injection of the AAV2/8-FCBR1-F0.4-HL-FAM161A (FCBR1-F0.4-HL) vector also produced a restricted FAM161A localization in the CC with much less ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In view of the weak expression and few targeted photoreceptors induced by the FCBR1-F0.4 vectors in the CC, we increased the vector dose to 10<sup>11</sup> GC/eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 3,4). PN14 <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> mice were treated by single injection of HL, HS or GFP driven by FCBR1-F0.4 vectors as well as combined injection of FCBR1-F0.4-HS and FCBR1-F0.4-HL and analyzed 3 mpi. In FCBR1-F0.4-HS (10<sup>11</sup> GC) condition, an increased number of FAM161A–positive CC was observed despite several photoreceptors still displayed ectopic localization of the protein in the photoreceptor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, orange arrows). In single injection of FCBR1-F0.4-HL vector, an increased number of well detectable FAM161A-positive CC was observed (n=7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, with the combined administration of FCBR1-F0.4-HL and FCBR1-F0.4-HS (1×10<sup>11</sup> GC each), a regular and delicate FAM161A labelling was homogenously distributed in CC (n=7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 4). Moreover, ectopic expression was observed in some horizontal-like cells (identified by their morphology and position) and in some (few) fibers of the outer plexiform layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref> and Supplemental Figure 3). We thus continue with this dose to investigate the potential of the vector with the FCBR1-F04 promoter.</p><p id="P14">We then investigated whether the CC structure was reconstructed after the gene therapy treatment with these different vector administrations. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy U-ExM was performed to investigate FAM161A precise localization and to characterize the different partners forming the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). When injecting FCBR1-F0.4-HS vector, we observed a closure of the CC, but FAM161A was unevenly distributed with high variations in the CC and some ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, orange arrows). A similar observation was made for its interacting protein POC5, but a shorter POC5-positive CC was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). CEP290 and LCA5 expression was partially restored while the transporter protein IFT81 was weakly present at the level of the bulge region, where it has been shown to accumulate. The FCBR1-F0.4-HL vector also zipped the microtubules filaments at the level of the CC, and the localizations of FAM161A, POC5, CEP290, LCA5 and IFT81 resembled better to the expression pattern observed in the WT CC than when treated with FCBR1-F0.4-HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). Importantly, for the combined injection of the two vectors coding for the HS and the HL isoforms, we found that FAM161A, POC5, and CEP290 correctly localized to the CC as well as LCA5 and ITF81 which were observed at their specific places (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The quantification of the CC length positive for FAM161A or POC5 clearly revealed that the combination of FCBR1-F0.4-HS+ FCBR1-F0.4-HL restores a CC length similar to WT conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). For comparison, CC lengths were quantified in retina treated with the IRBP-GRK1 vectors which clearly showed FAM161A and POC5 extended expressions not seen with FCBR1-F0.4 vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Altogether, these results uncovered that the combination of HS+HL prevented the ectopic expression of the HS isoform and restored proper CC.</p><p id="P15">The correct subcellular addressing of the FAM161A protein in the CC resulted in a remarkable protection of the ONL thickness. Indeed, the non-transduced retina areas were markedly thinner in all groups as well as in the transduced region of the GFP control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The quantification of the effects of the different isoforms on retina thickness revealed that the co-administration of the HS and HL isoforms was the most efficient to maintain the ONL thickness compared to HS (data not shown) or HL alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also examined in the HS+HL group whether the rescued retina contained well-structured cone CC. Low- and high-magnification images with expansion microscopy revealed that cones were also re-expressing FAM161A in the rescued retina and that the connecting cilium appeared restored (Supplemental Figure 5). We then determined whether the retina rescue was dependent on the number of CC expressing a correctly addressed FAM161A protein. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that, for all groups tested, the ONL thickness increased with increasing density of CC positive for FAM161A. Moreover, the HS and HL co-administration generated the highest CC density in the treated areas close to WT levels (P&gt;0.9999, n=4). A clear correlation between FAM161A-positive CC density and ONL thickness can be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). A linear regression with a higher slope significantly distinguishes the HS+HL group (slope=0.5267; R2=0.4467) from the HS (slope=0.3224; R2=0.5925) or HL (slope=0.1885; R2=0.2147) groups (p&lt;0.01). In summary regions with high CC density corresponds to region with the thickest ONL and the co-expression of the HL and HS isoforms potentiates the yield of FAM161A-positive CC number.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Combined FCBR1-F04-HS+FCBR1-F0.4-HL administration restores retina activity in Fam161a<sup>tm1b/tm1b</sup> mice and prevents retinal degenerations</title><p id="P16">To reveal whether the correct protein re-expression, localization and preservation of the retina integrity ameliorated the retina activity of <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> eye mice after gene therapy, ERG recordings were monthly performed until 3 mpi.

In the present study, to translate this work into a FAM161A gene therapy for a future clinical application, we further examined the efficiency of AAV vectors to deliver the human <italic>FAM161A</italic> cDNA. Using conventional approaches to specifically express the transgene of interest in cones and rods with an IRBP-GRK1 promoter construct and a vector dose of about 10<sup>10</sup> GC/injection (and lower doses as well), the human FAM161A protein was localized not only in the connecting cilium but along the cytoplasmic microtubules and also extended into the axoneme. The expression in the ONL resembles the expression pattern seen after <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection of cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). FAM161A protein was already shown to tightly interact with microtubules and to decorate these structures when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Thus, a controlled expression of FAM161A is required to correctly reconstruct the CC inner scaffold without ectopic cellular expression thus maintaining the cohesion of axonemal microtubules. For many gene therapy approaches a strong expression is required to cover the needs of the cell or the neighboring tissue. This strategy is appropriate for proteins with high demands such as enzymes (RPE65 in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) or PDE6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) or necessitating renewal such as in muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) or secreted factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), but this high level of expression need is less clear for proteins constituting a structure. Our data suggest that structural proteins such as FAM161A necessitate restricted expression to reestablish their correct function. These results are suggesting that permanent structures such as the cilium necessitates low protein expression level to maintain its integrity, because the renewal of the protein is not expected to occur rapidly. Similarly, for proteins involved in the ciliary transport such as BBS1 or BBS10 high expression appears to be not appropriate to restore rod physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) or efficient to restore rod-mediated vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In this case, overexpression of these proteins could saturate the transport system impacting the cellular processes. Nonetheless, other ciliary proteins involved into the transport through the cilium such as RPGR, NPHP5, and RPGRIP1 need a higher level of expression to restore retina activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). All these results indicate that testing promoters with different activities is crucial to determine the optimal gene transfer conditions for several types of proteins.</p><p id="P19">In the present work, the use of the FCBR1-F0.4 weak promoter has two main advantages. Firstly, it allows to modulate finely the FAM161A protein expression by adjusting vector dose. The number of FAM161A-positive connecting cilium and their morphology improved with the vector dose. Secondly, it minimizes ectopic expression at the dose required to reach a density of FAM161A-positive CC similar to the WT retina. This morphological restoration in many photoreceptors results in a major rescue of the photoreceptor survival and function. On the contrary, with the IRBP-GRK1 constructs, the FAM161A protein is always ectopically expressed, even when reducing the dose by 100 times. In this case, much less photoreceptors are targeted, but the protein is also expressed in the inner segment and even in the cell body. The real consequence of this protein mis-localization is in part unclear, and even if it improves cell survival, poor functional rescue can be obtained. The mechanism of this dichotomous rescue, good survival with very limited functional effect, still needs to be unraveled.</p><p id="P20">In the present study, we tested a high dose condition to highlight the advantage of using weak promoters to treat certain forms of ciliopathy. With the optimization of vector production and purification as required for clinical applications, the final suited dose to deliver should be much less than documented here. Moreover, our strategy implies administration of a mix of two vectors encoding each one of the two different isoforms. In this study, we just tested a one-to-one ratio, which is probably not mimicking the cell physiology. Indeed, analyses from total human retinal extract revealed that the short <italic>FAM161A</italic> isoform is more abundant than the long one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). It would be thus theoretically feasible to reduce the dose for one vector to better mimic the physiological conditions and reduce the final amount of injected viral particles. The optimal dose of each vector remains thus to be determined in future studies, as well as the scale up in larger eyes, to bring these vectors to the clinic.</p><p id="P21">Although the short isoform is around 20-fold more abundant in the retina in comparison to the long one, the long isoform is mostly expressed in the retina in comparison to all other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the injection of the vector coding only for HL produced a clear appearance of FAM161A-positive CC and weak expression in some neuronal fibers in the OPL mimicking the expression pattern of FAM161A we have previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The expression of the short isoform alone was also detected in the CC (but less clearly than the HL), however presented ectopic expression in the photoreceptor body and in fibers connecting the OPL. In addition, the expression was strong in some horizontal cells (identified by their location and morphology). The present work focused exclusively on the gene therapy effect of FAM161A expression on cilium structure reorganization, because of it is the obvious link of cilium structure defect with retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Nonetheless, FAM161A interaction studies by yeast two-hybrid system revealed that FAM161A may also have a role in the Golgi-centrosomal interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This network of proteins is involved in intracellular transport and FAM161A interacts both with proteins regulating the cytoskeletal transport and with protein of the Golgi apparatus. Our immunolabelling results suggest that the short isoform could interact with such protein network but less probably the long isoform, which was almost exclusively detected in the CC (see Supplemental Figure 2). The combined expression of both isoforms produced an unexpected result by presenting a major reduction of ectopic expression of the FAM161A protein in the cell body and axon accompanied by a well-structured CC. FAM161A was also reduced in neural fibers in the photoreceptors and in OPL in comparison to HS alone. These data suggest that interactions between the long and the short isoforms could affect FAM161A distribution and thus could impact FAM161A function.</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, RNAseq studies throughout the human retina development showed that alternative splicing activity occurs during retinogenesis, and that isoforms generations is mainly linked to RNAs coding for CC proteins, including FAM161A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The combined gene transfer of the two isoforms renders thus available the protein isoforms that could be needed for the different developmental stages of the CC rebuilding and homeostasis ensuring photoreceptor’s viability and function. Administration of appropriate isoform or isoforms mix might also be required for other diseases linked to genes submitted to alternative splicing.</p><p id="P23">The cilium reorganization is probably the major action that accounts for the survival effect of the treatment and the function restoration of the combined HS+HL administration, since both isoforms are detected in the CC. Indeed, with the reappearance of FAM161A in the CC, POC5, LCA5, and CEP290 found their correct location. As important, IFT81 was relocated at its two normal sites, just above the basal body and at the bulge level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). IFT81 is involved in the intraflagellar transport and thus contributes to the ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) which may also participate to restoration of the well-formed axonemes after gene transfer treatment as previously observed in another ciliopathy model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The cilium reconstruction led to a re-establishment of the RHODOPSIN transport towards the outersegment as attested by reduced immunolabelling in the ONL.</p><p id="P24">Nonetheless, gene therapy of the mouse long <italic>Fam161a</italic> isoform delivery (0.5×10<sup>11</sup> GC/injection) was sufficient to maintain the retina activity and to protect photoreceptors against degeneration in the <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In that case, the IRBP-GRK1 promoter was used and some ectopic expression was observed in several retinal cells. But the spread of the ectopic expression in photoreceptor cells was never comparable to the one observed using human FAM161A isoforms. Looking at this publication, several inner segments were FAM161A-positive and FAM161A labeling can be observed between the inner segment and the cell body only in few cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Our data would suggest that in this previous study, only group of cells which expressed the FAM161A protein at the right level recovered their function. This would explain why little differences exist on the long term between retina treated in one or two locations (double injections). Altogether, we propose that first the re-expression of the FAM161A protein in the photoreceptors is the major beneficial effect of the gene therapy and second, the mouse and human isoforms differently behaved in the mouse photoreceptors. The amino acid sequence homology between mouse and human is about 60% showing the diversity acquired during the evolution and potential differences in the cellular processes. Many studies remain to be undertaken to understand how FAM161A is directed either to the cilium or implicated in the intracellular transport. Nonetheless, it is thus remarkable that despite the divergence between the mouse and the human isoforms, the human isoforms reconstruct the CC in the mouse <italic>Fam161a</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> photoreceptor as described in our study.</p><p id="P25">Methodologically, our data also highlight the benefit of U-Ex-M observations to validate gene therapy efficacy. Faber <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), already used this technic to show a partial rescue of photoreceptor outersegment and axoneme after gene therapy in the <italic>Lca5</italic><sup><italic>tg/tg</italic></sup> mouse. However, their approach was prospective with full eyes as starting materials dedicated for U-Ex-M. In our study, we adapted the technic to eye sections that can be used in retrospective studies which allows to analyze the same region (proximal sections) with alternative analysis. Merging the high resolution of cellular structure with the power of immunolabeling specificity on standard tissue sections, this innovative microscopy modality will certainly help in the future to better understand biological mechanisms and give an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate therapy outcomes in preclinical studies or analyze clinical samples.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, exploring the possibility to reconstruct the CC in the FAM161A-deficient mouse retina by gene therapy, we identified that structural restoration can be achieved when a weak promoter is used to drive the expression of the transgene and combined with an appropriated dose of vector to efficiently target the tissue. This optimized approach allows to not submerge the targeted cells with the therapeutic protein while reaching a maximal number of cells. Such strategy is probably valid for several other applications necessitating a restricted level of the protein of interest. In addition, we revealed that the two human isoforms of the FAM161A gene are necessary for proper cilium reconstruction and function proposing a novel paradigm of treatment based on combined administration of two therapeutic sequences.</p><p id="P27">The follow-up of 100 RP28 patients since several years indicated a slow degenerative process of the retina with preserved large area around the macula until the fourth decade of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).

A gene therapy treatment with the vector combination in the perimacular region is thus an attractive strategy to change the disease course of retinal dystrophies associated with FAM161A deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="S9"><title>Mice</title><p id="P28"><italic>Fam161A</italic><sup><italic>tm1b/tm1b</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) were kept at 22°C under a 12 hours light / 12 hours dark cycle with light on at 7 am and fed ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Plasmid designs</title><p id="P29">All regulatory regions were amplified by PCR from 293T genomic DNA (Supplemental Table 1).

Image acquisition was performed on an inverted Leica Thunder DMi8 microscope using a 20× (0.40 NA) or 63× (1.4 NA) oil objective with Thunder SVCC (small volume computational clearing) mode at max resolution, adaptive as “Strategy” and water as “Mounting medium” to generate deconvolved images. To avoid gel drifting during acquisition, gels were imaged on Poly-D-lysine (A3890401, Gibco)-coated 24mm coverslips (0117640, Marienfeld).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Antibody stripping</title><p id="P40">In order to have the localization of several proteins within the same precious sample, we used antibody stripping to allow several rounds of immunostainings. Briefly, stained and imaged gels were washed 3 times 5 min in PBST to allow their shrinkage. Then, gels were incubated in 1mL of stripping buffer made of 200 μL SDS 10% (2% final), 62 μL of Tris HCl pH 6.8 1M, 8 μL of ß-mercaptoethanol and 730 μL of pure water for 30 min at 50°C. Then gels were washed 3 times 5 min in PBST allowing a new round of antibody staining. Image acquisition is done without using Poly-D-lysine coated coverslips to avoid losing tissue on the coverslip. To correct potential drifting issues during acquisition, drift correction has been performed manually (&lt;7 pixels correction).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Expansion factor calculation</title><p id="P41">The expansion factor was calculated in a semiautomated way by comparing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of photoreceptor mother centriole proximal tubulin signal with the proximal tubulin signal of expanded human U2OS cell centrioles using PickCentrioleDim plugin described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Briefly, 48 photoreceptor mother centrioles FWHM were measured and compared to a pre-assessed value of U2OS centriole width (25 centrioles: mean = 231.3 nm).

To determine the difference of ONL thickness at different location across the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) we applied a two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test to determine significant difference at specific location between the FAM161A and GFP-treated eyes. For comparison of ONL thickness based on the CC density category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) we performed an ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test for multiple comparison.

(<bold>B</bold>) The ONL thickness rescue by FCBR1-F0.4-FAM161A treatment was dependent on the density of FAM161A-positive CC. The highest FAM161A-positive CC density (nb of CC/200 μ m) and the thicker ONL rescue were observed in retina treated with the combination of FCBR1-F0.4-HS + FCBR1-F0.4-HL.
