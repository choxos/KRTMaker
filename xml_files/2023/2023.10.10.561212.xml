Here, we report how naked mole-rats (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) resist tumorigenesis when exposed to potent skin carcinogens. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of homeostatic full-thickness naked mole-rat skin revealed higher epidermal turn-over, a distinct composition of dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) and fewer resident T-cells, when compared to mouse and human. Carcinogenic treatment of skin generated the expected mutational landscape, but unlike in the mouse, failed to stimulate T-cells or generate tumours. Instead, naked mole-rat accelerated epidermal turnover to shed mutant cells. At the same time, the ECM was extensively remodelled via enhanced anti-inflammatory communication among fibroblasts and between fibroblasts and epidermal cells, creating a tumour-suppressive microenvironment. We demonstrate that, in contrast to mouse, naked mole-rat dermal fibroblasts lack intrinsic tumour-promoting capabilities <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that the cellular ecosystem of naked mole-rat skin actively suppresses epithelial transformation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Naked mole-rats (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) are mouse-sized, eusocial, subterranean rodents with exceptional longevity (&gt;30 years) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and high natural cancer resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

The most commonly used preclinical animal model of SCC is carcinogen-exposed mouse skin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In the classical two-stage chemical skin carcinogenesis model, initiation is achieved by induction of DNA mutations using a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, followed by stimulated epidermal proliferation via repeated treatment with tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

As expected, we found that undifferentiated basal layer cells express keratin 14 (KTR14), while differentiated suprabasal cells labelled positive for KRT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b-c</xref>). Unexpectedly, our immunofluorescence labelling revealed high levels of co-expressed KRT6 in naked mole-rat suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), which is commonly associated with altered proliferation, cell adhesion, and migration in response to wounding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To quantify the cell types found in each species, we generated single cell transcriptomes of full thickness skin biopsies from six naked mole-rats (n = 21) and three mice (n = 9), and compared them to five humans (n = 5) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Using established marker genes, we identified separately in each species: T-cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, mast cells, muscle cells, Schwann cells and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To cross-map cell types between species, we used three complementary strategies. First, we used 12,940 unambiguously orthologous genes to integrate the three species’ transcriptomes using reciprocal principal component analysis (<italic>Methods</italic>) followed by unsupervised clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h-i</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and then, manually annotated cell types using marker genes. Second, we used an automated cell-type classifier based on marker genes (<italic>Methods</italic>). Third, for the small fraction of cells for which the single-species and the integrated 3 species cell type annotation disagreed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>), we trained a deep learning classifier to find a consensus annotation (<italic>Methods</italic>). These analyses revealed a surprising degree of species-specificity in the cell type composition of skin, consisting of five transcriptionally distinct clusters capturing epithelial, fibroblasts, APC, T-cell, and endothelial compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-l</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Our fully integrated analysis revealed three unique features of homeostatic naked mole-rat skin. First, when compared to human (9.9% ± 4.4) and mouse (6% ± 2.5), naked mole-rat skin has very few T-cells (2.1% ± 0.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f-h</xref>). In other tissues, such as spleen and blood, naked mole-rats have a similar proportion of T-cells as mouse (˜30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f-g</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Second, naked mole-rat cell types are transcriptionally divergent from mouse and human, and their compositional proportion in skin also differs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-m</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>). Third, naked mole-rats showed an attenuated potential for activating inflammatory responses, and modulation of cell adhesion molecules in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Our data suggested the naked mole-rat’s suppressed inflammatory landscape during homeostasis may be shaped by a globally altered expression of adhesion proteins. Cell adhesion molecules play a vital role in immune cell trafficking into tissues, effector cell activation and proliferation during homeostasis, inflammation and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. For instance, fibroblasts had altered expression of cell adhesion proteins (F2, PCDHGC5, NRXN1, SULF1, TMEM176A, TMEM176B, DPEP1, GLDN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m</xref>) and dysregulated production of cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a key pro-inflammatory mediator of leukocyte recruitment via altered focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">In sum, naked mole-rat skin has a distinct and immune suppressive environment, likely shaped by the species-specific network of cell adhesion molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Naked mole-rats resist an extreme cancer induction protocol</title><p id="P11">We tested whether species-specific tissue composition contributes to tumour resistance in naked mole-rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> by subjecting mouse and naked mole-rat to powerful carcinogens, followed by single-cell sequencing of full thickness skin biopsies (including two papillomas in mouse) (<italic>Methods</italic>). In mouse, skin cancer is initiated by a single application of DMBA followed by repeated treatment with TPA to drive proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Under this standardized protocol, all mice developed papillomas, benign epithelial tumours, around 10 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; but naked mole-rats resisted the standard DMBA/TPA treatment for up to two years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, we adapted a more intensive protocol developed to produce skin lesions in similarly cancer-resistant blind mole-rats (<italic>Spalax ehrenbergi</italic>) by increasing concentrations of both DMBA and TPA by 5-fold and inducing the application frequency of TPA to three times per week <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">To our surprise, no treated naked mole-rat developed tumours or any macroscopic skin alteration following six months of this rigorous treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We considered the possibility that naked mole-rat cells may have evolved mechanisms to neutralize the mutagenicity of DMBA, thus preventing somatic mutations. To test this, we deeply sequenced the exomes of DMBA-treated mouse and naked mole-rat full-thickness skin biopsies (<italic>Methods</italic>). DMBA treatment produces mainly T-to-A (T&gt;A) transversions in a specific sequence context <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and this signature was readily identified at the variant allele frequency (VAF) expected for clonal expansions in all treated mouse and naked mole-rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-d</xref>). Notably, only naked mole-rats exhibited excess C&gt;A transversions, which in mouse are considered late mutations often occurring subclonally in metastases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, similar to mouse, naked mole-rat skin is highly susceptible to DMBA mutagenesis, and acquires somatic mutations.</p><p id="P14">We also considered the possibility that naked mole-rat cells can resist the proliferation in skin caused by TPA treatment, which triggers cell cycling via protein kinase C family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This was not the case: as in mouse, treatment of naked mole-rat skin with TPA for 12 weeks resulted in epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c-d</xref>) and enhanced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-h</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In sum, naked mole-rat skin resists tumour formation, even when challenged by an exceptionally strong carcinogenic treatment regime that successfully induced somatic mutations and enhanced proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Immune response to carcinogenesis is blocked in naked mole-rat</title><p id="P16">We therefore considered the possibility that inherent differences in how naked mole-rat skin’s ecosystem responds to DMBA/TPA treatment could inhibit tumour formation. We first compared the cell type composition of full thickness mouse and naked mole-rat skin before and after DMBA/TPA treatment using single-cell transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2e-f</xref>). Strikingly, T-cell numbers remained constant in naked mole-rat skin, whereas mouse skin showed a 3-fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>), as expected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We independently confirmed the low number of T-cells in DMBA/TPA-induced naked mole-rat skin by labelling for CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j-l</xref>), present on 95% of T-cells in both epidermis and dermis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The number APCs was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We then asked whether the T-cell population remained stable in naked mole-rats because it was inert to the DMBA/TPA treatment. However, T-cells exhibited a strength of transcriptional response to the treatment, comparable to all other major skin cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2h</xref>). Similar to homeostatic skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), we found that the transcriptional responses in naked mole-rat caused by DMBA/TPA in all cell types were diverged from mouse. We used a machine-learning classifier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> to identify that naked mole-rat T- and fibroblasts had the greatest transcriptional perturbations upon DMBA/TPA treatment; in contrast, epithelial cells directly exposed to the chemicals and eventually forming the tumour have the lowest (<italic>Methods</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2n</xref>). Thus, our data indicated that epithelial transformation resistance in response to DMBA/TPA was mostly modulated by the immediate environment of the epithelial cells.</p><p id="P18">We therefore compared what functional gene set in each cell type were up- and down-regulated by treatment with DMBA/TPA using gene set enrichment analysis (<italic>Methods</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We found that APCs up-regulated DNA repair in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2i-j</xref>). Mouse T-cells upregulated cytokine signalling, including BHLHE40 that activates leukocytes and induces T-helper 17 (Th17) cell polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m, o</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2k</xref>; lower panel) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Such Th17 polarization is tightly linked to cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In stark contrast, naked mole-rat T-cells actively suppressed the same cytokine signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2p</xref>), and instead activated a wound healing response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2l</xref>; upper panel). The lack of immune responses in naked mole-rats was likely due to fibroblasts repressing cytokine signalling pathways in response to the carcinogenic insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2l</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The dermal compartment provides structural support of the skin by producing the ECM, a complex network of proteins and proteoglycans secreted by epidermal cells, fibroblasts and immune cells. Although DMBA/TPA treatment induced ECM remodelling in both naked mole-rat and mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2m</xref>), this remodelling had different functional implications for the two species. Mouse fibroblasts synthesized COL12A1, a component of a pro-cancerous microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>; naked mole-rat fibroblasts upregulated ECM components required for maintaining skin homeostasis and creating an immunosuppressive stromal niche, such as ECM1 and GAS6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Finally, our analysis of epithelial cells in naked mole-rats revealed enhanced wound healing responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2r</xref>), indicating altered balance between proliferation and differentiation towards accelerated epithelial turnover. Fast turnover requires a coupled acceleration of stem cell division and differentiated cell death, suggesting a tumour suppressive strategy by which increased cell differentiation can wash out mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>High cellular turn-over and early differentiation maintain the naked mole-rat epidermis</title><p id="P21">Testing this hypothesis required us to first create high resolution maps of the actively differentiating interfollicular epidermis (IFE) at homeostasis.

Mouse had substantial contributions from sebaceous glands and hair follicles, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>; coloured cells); these cell types were removed from further analyses. We then ordered the remaining interfollicular epidermal cells by differentiation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P22">This revealed a continuous differentiation trajectory that began at undifferentiated cells with high KRT14 expression, and continued through cell states with gradually increasing expression of commitment and terminal differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). In homeostatic skin, we observed multiple short branching events that captured cells in a hybrid state, simultaneously expressing undifferentiation (KRT14) and early differentiation (KRT10) marker genes (Hybrid I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, light orange cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, K14<sup>hi</sup>/K10<sup>hi</sup>). We identified a second hybrid state (Hybrid II) further along the differentiation trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 c-d</xref>). In homeostasis, both hybrid states were significantly enriched in naked mole-rat epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We confirmed in healthy naked mole-rat skin that the undifferentiation (KRT14 or KRT5) and commitment (KRT10) markers were co-expressed within the same cell on RNA and protein levels in both the basal and suprabasal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3c-d</xref>).

Despite a thickening of the epidermis upon DMBA/TPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-f</xref>), the overall proportions of individual epithelial cell states were unaffected in naked mole-rats, confirming a balanced turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, the mouse epidermal composition changed following DMBA/TPA, by triggering cell cycle and imbalancing cell proportions in both undifferentiated and differentiated lineages (significant changes in cell type proportions in mouse are shown with arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Interestingly, the fraction of cycling cells in naked mole-rat epidermis during homeostasis was appreciably greater than in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h</xref>).

We now demonstrate that naked mole-rats can successfully resist even higher concentrations and frequencies of the chemical mutagens for up to six months, similar to the cancer-resistant hairy blind mole-rat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. This cancer resistance occurs despite skin cells accumulating the expected mutational landscape and showing hallmarks of physiological stress. To understand the underlying mechanisms used by naked mole-rats to inhibit cancer inception and growth, we compared the single-cell compositional dynamics and transcriptional responses of homeostatic full-thickness naked mole-rat skin with mouse and human, both of which are well-understood model systems. This comparison identified four novel mechanisms by which naked mole-rats successfully resist cancer induction, which together challenge a number of paradigms in skin homeostasis.</p><p id="P41">First, naked mole-rat skin contains low numbers of resident T-cells, which in mouse and human are integral both to maintaining skin homeostasis and to driving tumorigenesis. In mouse and human skin, resident T-cells defend against invasive pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and aberrant regulation of T-cells contributes to psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Similarly, naked mole-rats also recruit T-cells in response to bacterial toxins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, but in contrast to mouse show no signs of skin inflammation in response to chemically-induced carcinogenesis. Since the direct interaction between T-cells and dermal fibroblasts down-regulates their ECM production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, the lack of T-cell activation in naked mole-rat skin might explain the ECM divergence between naked mole-rat, human and mouse. The suppression of immune responses in naked mole-rat skin might also, at least in part, explain their selective inflammatory pain insensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P42">Second, naked mole-rat epidermal turnover is accelerated in homeostatic and mutagen treated skin. In mouse, TPA-induced proliferation leads to a 3-fold thickening of epidermis due to sustained hyperplasia with an increase in the number of all nucleated cell layers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. The thickening of the epidermis is dramatically less pronounced in naked mole-rats, because the higher progenitor replacement rate is accompanied by accelerated differentiation in the suprabasal layers. Therefore, the naked mole-rat progenitor compartment is rapidly purged of potentially tumorigenic cells; a similar mechanism has been described in thymus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Thus, the carcinogenic treatment challenged naked-mole-rat skin, yet its integrity was successfully maintained by better balancing proliferation and differentiation.</p><p id="P43">Third, we discovered species-specific fibroblast populations that extensively remodelled the ECM in both normal and carcinogen-treated naked mole-rat skin. The current dogma suggests that fibroblast populations in naked mole-rats should promote ageing and tumorigenesis, due to the combination of increased hyaluronic acid, ECM deposition, and production of collagens. The resulting increase in ECM stiffness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> is normally associated with ageing, the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts, and the promotion of tumorigenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Paradoxically, naked mole-rats are long-lived and cancer resistant, and we demonstrated that chemical carcinogen treatment does not generate CAFs. This paradox is resolved by understanding the functional differences between naked mole-rat fibroblasts and their mouse counterparts in tissue homeostasis. Specifically, our results indicated that naked mole-rat fibroblasts do not form tumour-promoting niches, both because they fail to upregulate pro-inflammatory mediators found in mouse CAFs and because they lack the pro-tumorigenic interaction with T-cells.</p><p id="P44">Fourth, naked mole-rat fibroblasts lack intrinsic tumour promoting capabilities, which we directly demonstrated by co-injecting them with human cancer cells. In contrast, similar experiments with mouse fibroblasts enhance tumour formation because the reciprocal signalling between epidermis and dermis creates a cancer-friendly niche <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. While normal fibroblasts can inhibit cancer cell growth and development, CAFs are key regulators of the tumour’s microenvironment through ECM remodelling and crosstalk with infiltrating leukocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. In contrast, naked mole-rat dermal fibroblasts must unidirectionally disrupt this tumour-promoting interaction with cancerous epidermal cells.</p><p id="P45">Naked mole-rat skin appears to effortlessly resist powerful drug treatments specifically designed to generate aggressive cancers.
