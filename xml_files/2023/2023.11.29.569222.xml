The viral RNA polymerase utilizes host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and interacts with the serine 5 phosphorylated (pS5) C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II to initiate transcription. Our study, using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), reveals the structure of the 1918 pandemic IAV polymerase bound to a synthetic pS5 CTD heptad repeat peptide. The structure shows that the CTD peptide binds at the C-terminal domain of the PA viral polymerase subunit (PA-C) and reveals a previously unobserved position of the 627 domain of the PB2 subunit near the CTD. We identify crucial residues of the CTD peptide mediating interactions with positively charged cavities on PA-C, explaining the preference of the viral polymerase for pS5 CTD. Functional analysis of mutants targeting the CTD-binding site within PA-C reveals reduced transcriptional function with normal replication, while other mutants display defects in both transcription and replication, highlighting the multifunctional role of PA-C in viral RNA synthesis. Our study provides insights into the structural and functional aspects of the influenza virus polymerase-host Pol II interaction and identifies a target for antiviral development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Influenza viruses are negative-strand RNA viruses with a genome consisting of eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments organised into viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Each vRNP complex packages one viral genome segment using viral nucleoprotein (NP) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a heterotrimeric protein, that consists of the polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and PB2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). During viral infection, the vRNPs are trafficked to the cell nucleus where the viral polymerase performs both viral transcription and replication. Replication, a two-step process, is primer independent and requires de novo initiation by the viral polymerase to synthesise new vRNA, using positive-sense complementary RNA (cRNA) as an intermediate template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In contrast, viral transcription depends on the interaction of the viral polymerase with the host transcriptional machinery to produce viral positive-sense mRNA. The synthesised viral mRNA contains a 5′ terminal N7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap and a 3′ polyA tail which makes viral mRNA structurally identical to the host mRNA and allows the virus to hijack the host translation machinery for viral protein synthesis in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In a process called ‘cap snatching’, the viral polymerase steals 10-15 nucleotides long capped RNA fragments from nascent capped host RNA, generated by the host RNA polymerase II (Pol II), to prime its own transcription using the PB2 cap-binding and PA endonuclease domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Cap snatching takes place during the early stages of Pol II-mediated transcription which enables the viral polymerase to secure access to host RNA caps before being bound by host cap-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The interaction of the viral polymerase with Pol II has detrimental effects on host transcription and results in inhibition of cellular gene expression (‘host shut-off’) and Pol II degradation at later stages of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To access caps of nascent host RNA the viral polymerase physically associates with host Pol II. Functional and structural studies confirmed that the viral polymerase selectively recognises the serine 5 phosphorylated (pS5) CTD heptad repeat sequence YSPTpSPS, the signature for initiating Pol II involved in capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In structural studies, two distinct binding sites of the CTD to the viral polymerase were observed using polymerase from influenza virus types A, B, and C and synthetic four-repeat pS5 CTD peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Structures of the CTD-bound polymerase of different influenza types revealed shared and distinct binding features between each type, while binding of the Pol II CTD beyond the identified binding sites remains largely unknown. Considering that mammalian Pol II CTD contains 52 heptad repeats of the consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>, which far exceeds the length of CTD mimetic peptides, it appears likely that further interactions between the viral RdRP and Pol II CTD take place beyond the identified binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that the interaction of the viral polymerase with Pol II involves not only the CTD of the large subunit, RPB1, but also other subunits of the 12-subunit holoenzyme such as RPB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we present the structures of the CTD-bound polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus. In these structures, we observe a continuous stretch of the CTD binding site, encompassing three heptad repeats (repeats a-c), on the C-terminal domain of the PA subunit (PA-C). Additionally, we observe a minor population of particles with a unique arrangement of the PB2 C-terminal (PB2-C) region, likely representing a transcriptase intermediate. Based on these structures, we performed mutagenesis of residues in the CTD binding site that are conserved across influenza A virus strains, with the aim of determining their effect on viral polymerase activity using a cell-based vRNP reconstitution assay. Our findings demonstrate that mutagenesis of conserved residues in the CTD binding site results in transcriptional and replicational defects, indicating a potential overlap of binding sites for host factors that facilitate replication and transcription, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P7">The three polymerase genes from influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) virus were codon optimised for insect cells and synthesised (Synbio Technologies).

Of the amino acid residues composing the consensus heptad, serines at positions 2, 5 and 7 (abbreviated as S2, S5 and S7, respectively) as well as the tyrosine at position 1 (Y1) and the threonine at position (T4), can be phosphorylated, with S2 and S5 phosphorylations being the most prominent posttranslational modifications. The influenza virus RNA polymerase has been shown to have a strong preference for the pS5 CTD over pS2 and unphosphorylated CTD. However, combinations of these phosphorylation patterns and the effect of pS7 have not yet been investigated.</p><p id="P17">To further characterise the binding preference of the influenza virus polymerase to Pol II CTD, we used biotinylated Pol II CTD mimic peptides containing four repeats (designated repeats a-d) of the conserved heptapeptide repeat (Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>pS<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>) with a combination of phosphorylation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We found that the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus bound to the pS5 peptide and we also detected low but above background levels of binding to pS7. Interestingly, none of the other peptides were bound by the viral polymerase above background as determined by polymerase binding to a peptide with a scrambled sequence. Overall, this experiment shows that the influenza virus polymerase has a striking preference for pS5 peptide compared to pS2 and pS7 and additional phosphorylations in the pS5 peptide interfere with binding. This binding preference clearly links the influenza virus polymerase to the initiating form of Pol II engaged in capping its nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Structure of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus polymerase bound to Pol II CTD mimic peptide</title><p id="P18">To characterise the binding of the CTD of host Pol II to the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus polymerase, we used recombinant influenza virus polymerase expressed in insect cells and a four-repeat synthetic pS5 Pol II CTD mimic peptide.

The CTD occupies an elongated binding site along the PA-C domain, where we observe 25 of the 28 residues from the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).

E416 and E457 aid in the correct positioning of R454 to coordinate pS5c. Other amino acid residues of the polymerase interact with unmodified residues from the CTD peptide. Specifically, residues Y445, E449, and F612 interact with Y1a and D419 may contact Y1b.

The movement changes the interaction with the polymerase from contacting the PA and PB1 subunits through a three stranded beta-sheet formed by residues 640-676 such that it now contacts the PA-C and PB2-N2 domains through residues 643-654. This interface is smaller than observed in the transcription initiation conformation resulting in this domain being poorly resolved. A small interface was formed between the NLS and residues from the PB1 (583-587), PB2 (125-127), and PA (430-432) subunits. Due to the low resolution, we were unable to accurately describe residue contacts in these regions and will instead limit our analysis to the region of the domain. The relocation of the 627 domain and NLS brings it proximal to the N-terminus of the Pol II CTD peptide.</p><p id="P22">We do not observe any additional peptide density in this reconstruction that would suggest a direct contact between the CTD and the PB2-C. However, given the low-resolution maps, we cannot exclude the possibility of a direct contact. In fact, electrostatic analysis of the surface of the 627 domain that is oriented towards the N-terminus of the CTD peptide shows a highly basic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This surface would likely be receptive to binding of the negatively charged phosphorylated CTD peptide. Recent structural evidence of Pol II CTD binding to the influenza B virus polymerase demonstrates a large additional CTD binding site across the surface of the 627 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, corresponding residues from the influenza B polymerase are not conserved in influenza A strains. Deletion of the 627 domain from the influenza B virus polymerase dramatically reduced binding to Pol II CTD while a similar deletion did not affect the ability of the influenza A virus polymerase to bind CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). It could be that the loss of binding from the deletion of the 627 domain is compensated by the much larger binding surface of the CTD peptide on the influenza A virus PA-C domain.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Effect of mutations in the PA-C Pol II CTD binding site on polymerase function</title><p id="P23">To address the role of the identified Pol II CTD binding site in PA-C in polymerase function, we used a vRNP reconstitution assay followed by the analysis of RNA by primer extension. We co-expressed the three polymerase subunits, nucleoprotein, and segment 6 encoding the neuraminidase vRNA in HEK 293T cells to assemble vRNPs, the minimal viral complex required for transcription (mRNA synthesis) and genome replication (cRNA and vRNA synthesis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Based on our structural model and previously determined RdRP structures from IAV strains, we mutated 14 conserved residues in the PA-C domain that we hypothesised to influence CTD binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Only low levels of vRNA, expressed from the transfected plasmid, were observed if the PA subunit was omitted from the transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, in the presence of a complete wild-type polymerase, we observed mRNA and cRNA, as well as a significant increase in vRNA levels, indicating that the viral polymerase transcribes and replicates the input vRNA. Comparing the RNA levels produced by the wild-type and mutant polymerases, we found that mutations K289A, Y445A, E449A, R454A and K635A affected transcription with relatively little if any effect on replication. The phenotype of these mutants is fully consistent with CTD binding being required for viral transcription, as this interaction facilitates access of the viral polymerase to capped RNA fragments generated from nascent Pol II transcripts. Other mutations such as L290A, T313A, D419A, L527A, R559A, F612A and T639A had no or only a small effect on transcription indicating that these amino acid residues do not contribute critical interactions to CTD binding. Surprisingly, two mutations, E416A and R551A specifically reduced cRNA synthesis, suggesting that amino acid residues around the Pol II CTD binding site also participate in the replication of the viral RNA genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">In this study we have solved the solution state structure of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus polymerase bound to pS5 Pol II CTD using cryo-EM. The structure revealed a continuous density for the CTD peptide with 25 out of the 28 amino acid residues fully resolved. The CTD peptide was found to bind exclusively at the PA-C with two of the phosphorylated serine residues playing prominent roles in guiding the interaction by being accommodated in highly basic grooves. The interaction interface overlaps with that previously observed in a study using polymerase of a bat H17N10 influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, in contrast to this study that observed two separate binding sites for the CTD here we identify a continuous density with the CTD linking the two binding sites. Our structure is the first IAV polymerase structure determined by cryo-EM, revealing that binding of CTD in solution does not stabilise the cap-snatching or transcription initiation complexes and suggesting that a longer CTD peptide and/or other interacting partners are required. While in most particles the PB2-C domains remained unstructured, we observed in a small population the PB2 cap-binding, mid-link, 627, and NLS domains in an arrangement not previously observed. Interestingly, in this novel arrangement the 627 domain is positioned close to the N-terminus of the CTD peptide providing a potential basic surface for additional interactions with the acidic CTD. Binding of the CTD across PA-C and the adjacent 627 domain could stabilise the 627 domain and, consequently, enable the PB2 cap-binding and PA endonuclease domains to assume a cap-snatching competent conformation. Using Pol II CTD peptides composed of more than four heptad repeats could reveal further insights into the interaction of the influenza virus polymerase with Pol II CTD.</p><p id="P25">The Pol II CTD can be phosphorylated at S2, S5, and S7 and on T4 of the heptad repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Binding assays of the influenza A virus polymerase to Pol II CTD peptides containing different phosphorylation patterns revealed a striking preference for pS5 CTD peptides over pS2 or pS7 peptides. Interestingly, combining pS5 with pS2 or pS7 in various arrangements in the same peptide lead to a dramatic reduction of polymerase binding suggesting that the viral polymerase engages with Pol II at a very precise point in the transcription cycle when the capping enzyme is recruited to Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Analysis of our structure explains how additional phosphorylation at S2 and S7 would disrupt CTD binding. Phosphorylation at S2a and S2b would likely be well accommodated as these residues are exposed towards the solvent. On the other hand, phosphorylation at S7a, S7b, S7c, and S2d could be accommodated but would likely require some rearrangement of the peptide. Phosphorylation of S2c would be unlikely to be accommodated given the tight contact with the polymerase and the nearby highly negative charge on S5c.</p><p id="P26">We observed that mutations of PA-C at the CTD binding site cause defects in both transcription and replication. Transcription was affected by mutations in K289A, Y445A, E449A, R454A and K635A of the PA subunit with little to no effects on genome replication. These amino acid residues, along with the previously extensively studied R638 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), are involved in direct interactions with pS5 of the first and third heptad repeat of the Pol II CTD (pS5a and pS5c) as well as Y1 of the first repeat (Y1a), highlighting that interactions with these three amino acids are the most critical for CTD binding. These results are consistent with CTD binding being important for viral mRNA synthesis by enabling cap-snatching. Interestingly, we observed reduced replication of the PA E416A and R551A mutants with little effect on transcription. Recent studies of the influenza C virus polymerase in complex with human and chicken ANP32A revealed that the ANP32A binding site overlaps with part of the Pol II CTD binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). ANP32 proteins have been shown to be essential factors for the genome replication of all three types of influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and influenza A virus likely also interacts with ANP32A through its PA-C domain. We speculate that PA mutations E416A and R551A might inhibit genome replication through interfering with ANP32A binding. Further structural studies using influenza A virus polymerase in complex with ANP32A could provide further insights into how the alternate binding of Pol II CTD and ANP32A at the same site in PA-C regulate transcription and replication by the viral polymerase. The importance of this site in the viral replication cycle has recently been highlighted through the use of nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Specifically, two nanobodies which bind PA-C at sites adjacent to the CTD peptide binding site and have been shown to block CTD binding, inhibited both mRNA and cRNA synthesis and, consequently, viral growth.</p><p id="P27">In summary, our work has uncovered the structural basis of the binding of the CTD of Pol II to the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus. Future research aiming to understand cap-snatching in molecular detail within the context of mammalian Pol II will require the inclusion of additional accessory proteins suspected to contribute to the complex formation between Pol II and the viral polymerase. The highly repetitive and intrinsically disordered nature of the CTD drives phase separation and leads to the recruitment of Pol II and transcription factors that together form condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). In the future, CTD-driven phase separation should be investigated within the context of viral infection to facilitate a spatiotemporal understanding of the links between the host transcriptional apparatus and viral transcription and replication beyond the PA-C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p id="P28">Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS191879-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Haitian Fan and Jane Sharps for their assistance with protein expression and advice on the functional assays.
