The hippocampus is thought to support this ability via pattern separation, or the encoding of similar events using dissimilar memory representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Spatially tuned pyramidal cells in the hippocampus (place cells) contribute to pattern separation by changing their firing patterns in response to spatial and contextual alterations to the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This process, referred to as remapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, results in events experienced in similar contexts being encoded as different memories. Two types of remapping have been described. Global remapping occurs when distinct populations of place cells are recruited to represent different spatial contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Rate remapping occurs when the same populations of place cells encode different contexts by changing their firing rate while maintaining their firing location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Both forms of remapping provide a mechanism to reduce the chance of memory interference.</p><p id="P3">Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been consistently implicated in pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) contribute to pattern separation by driving inhibition in downstream hippocampal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, thus leading to sparser, largely non-overlapping hippocampal representations of similar events. Consistent with this, environmental enrichment (EE), which upregulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, improves rodent performance in several memory tasks involving high memory interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, pattern separation tests have so far failed to model many of the key features of episodic memory such as automatic encoding and integration of episodic memory features. This is important as failure to model episodic memory effectively limits our ability to apply these findings in a clinical setting which could account for failures to translate basic memory research into treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p id="P4">Improvements in pattern separation are associated with functional changes within the hippocampal network, including increased sparseness of neuronal activity and enhanced global remapping of CA1 place cells as rats move between distinct environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, whether EE improves memory discrimination by promoting remapping in CA3 place cells that receive input directly from abGCs in DG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> has not been investigated. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that CA3, particularly its proximal portion (closer to the DG), is involved in pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, with CA3 place cells rate remapping in response to small changes to the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Consistently, stimulation of immature abGCs, which are involved in pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, results in increased place cell remapping in proximal CA3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated whether EE modulates place cell activity and remapping in CA3.</p><p id="P5">We report that EE enhances discrimination of similar contextual memories during an associative recognition memory task, which models episodic-like memory in rodents. These improvements were associated with increased levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and sparseness of activity across the hippocampus. Additionally, EE enhanced spatial tuning, firing rates and remapping of CA3 place cells in response to small changes to the environment. Together, these findings point to increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis, enhanced sparseness of hippocampal activity and CA3 place cell remapping as potential mechanisms for enrichment-dependent memory improvements.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Improved discrimination of similar associative memories and increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis following EE</title><p id="P6">To investigate whether EE improves discrimination of similar episodic-like memories, we tested enriched and standard-housed rats on the Object-Context (OC) and Object-Place-Context (OPC) recognition memory tasks, which test spontaneous memory for associations of objects with places and/or contexts. The effect of EE on rodent performance in these tasks has not been investigated before. To manipulate the overlap in contextual information, the animals were tested on two versions of the tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). In the similar condition, the contexts used were the square and circle version of a “morph” box which shared the same walls and floor. In the dissimilar condition, the contexts were distinct boxes with different walls and floors making them easier to discriminate.</p><p id="P7">Rats raised in an enriched environment for four months (EE, N=12) performed significantly better than standard-housed rats (ST, N=12) in the similar (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,21)</sub> = 6.092, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022, η<sub>p</sub>

Critically, while both groups performed above chance level in the dissimilar version of the OC task, showing successful discrimination of distinct contextual memories, only the enriched rats performed above chance level when the contexts used were more similar. In the OPC task, only the enriched rats showed memory for the similar object-place-context memories. However, there was no significant difference in performance across the groups in either the similar or the dissimilar version of the OPC task (Similar: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,21)</sub> = .762, <italic>p</italic>=.393, η<sub>p</sub>

Interestingly, the enriched rats spent less time exploring the objects both in the similar and in the dissimilar versions of the tasks during encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that EE leads to improved memory discrimination of similar the contextual features of episodic-like memories, and more efficient encoding of novel associations in episodic memory.</p><p id="P8">Next, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) by measuring density of DCX positive cells. Enriched rats had increased DCX positive cell density in the dentate gyrus region compared to the standard-housed rats (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,21)</sub> = 15.10, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub>

Additionally, there was a positive correlation between levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and performance in the similar, but not dissimilar, OC task (Similar: <italic>r</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = .605, <italic>p</italic> = .003; Dissimilar: <italic>r</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = .223, <italic>p</italic>=.852; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). There was, however, no correlation between performance in either the similar or the dissimilar OPC task and levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (S1C, S1D). These findings show that EE leads to greater levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and improved discrimination of similar spontaneous context-dependent associative memories.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Increased sparsity of activity in the hippocampus of enriched rats</title><p id="P9">Previous studies point to EE resulting in sparser hippocampal memory representations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

Increased hippocampal inhibition is thought to promote pattern separation of similar events and reduce interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Next, we assessed whether EE resulted in increased sparsity in the hippocampus as rats explored novel and familiar object-context associations using <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Fos</italic> as a marker for neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Rats explored two copies of one object within one of the similar environmental contexts (square or circle) over 2 days. On day 3, half of the rats experienced the same objects within the same context (familiar object-context condition) or within the opposite similar context (novel object-context condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This allowed us to assess differential effects of EE on hippocampal activity in response to novel and familiar object-context configurations.</p><p id="P10">We found that EE led to reduced activation across the hippocampus in response to both novel and familiar object-context configurations (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,19)</sub> =11.927, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, η<sub>p</sub>

We focused on CA3 as place cells in this subregion receive direct input from abGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and yet the effect of EE on CA3 place cells is unknown. Place cells were recorded as the rats explored the distinct versions of a “morph” box that could be shaped as a square, a circle or as four intermediate shapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Each session began with exploration of the square or circle, followed by exploration of the intermediate shapes (1:7, 2:6, 3:5, 4:4 or 4:4, 3:5, 2:6, 1:7), the opposite shape (circle or square) and a repetition of the first shape. Analysis of CA3 place fields from the square box (10 rats; 5 enriched, 5 standard, Table 1) showed that in the enriched rats CA3 place cells had smaller place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) (<italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> = 6.948, p=0.008) and carried greater spatial information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> = 19.115, p&lt;0.001) compared to CA3 place cells in the standard-housed rats. EE also resulted in reduced sparseness of firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> =19.546, p&lt;0.001), enhanced spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) (<italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> 16.821, p&lt;0.001), and increased firing rates (Average In-Field Rate - <italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> = 13.700, p&lt;0.001; Peak Rate - <italic>H</italic><sub>(1)</sub> =12.381, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref> for example cells). Together, these findings point to increased spatial tuning of CA3 place cells in the enriched rats. This is accompanied by an increase in gain, signalled by the upregulation of firing rates.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Enhanced place cell remapping and increased subset switching in CA3 place cells of enriched rats</title><p id="P12">Next, we sought to assess whether EE modulates CA3 place cell remapping. Previous studies using the morph environment reported a context-dependent firing rates redistribution (rate remapping) in CA3 place cells as rats explore the shapes of the morph box when they were trained with the square and circle shapes in the same location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Here, we assessed whether EE affects CA3 place cell remapping in response to small changes to the environment in the morph box. To investigate the effects of EE on rate remapping, we analysed all cells that had a field in all the shapes included in the recording session (full sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C, Table 2</xref>). CA3 place cells from the enriched rats showed increased rate remapping across the sequence (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,1203)</sub>=7.653, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). EE led to increased rate remapping across the square and the circle shapes, as well as across the square and the most circle-like shapes. Interestingly, CA3 place cells in the enriched rats also showed increased rate remapping in response to the delayed exploration of the initial shape. These findings point to EE resulting in increased flexibility in the CA3 spatial map, as CA3 place cells in the enriched rats showed greater ability to change their firing patterns in response to contextual alterations, as well as to a delayed exploration of a familiar environment. Increased rate remapping was reported across all enriched rats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Interestingly, in the same pool of cells, the spatial correlations between rate maps across recordings from distinct shapes within the session remained high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>) and there was no difference in spatial correlations across groups. This shows that CA3 place cells encode fine changes in context (both spatial/geometric and temporal) using rate rather than global remapping. We next aimed to assess whether EE influenced global remapping across the morph sequence in all recorded place cells, including those with a place field in at least one shape in the session in which they were recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 3</xref>) Consistent with the findings reported above, there was no difference in spatial correlation values for the place cells across the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,346.18)</sub>=1.302, <italic>p</italic>=.255). Together, these findings suggest that EE does not alter global remapping of CA3 place fields.</p><p id="P13">Place cells might also support discrimination of distinct environments by switching on and off as the environment changes, i.e., subset switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Subset switching is thought to result in distinct cell population encoding distinct environments, thus reducing memory interference. Long-term EE results in increased subset switching in CA1 as rats explore distinct spatial environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We compared the percentage of place cells active in at least one, but not all, environments in the enriched and standard groups. Critically, a greater percentage of place cells exhibited subset switching in the enriched rats (44/196 place cells; 22.4%) compared to the standard rats (15/160 place cells; 9.4%) (χ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>(1)</sub>= 10.890, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was the case even when conducting the analysis on a per animal basis (t<sub>(8)</sub>=2.541, p = 0.035, d’= 8.360) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). These findings point to more specific encoding of environments following EE.</p><p id="P14">Finally, as place cells were recorded along the CA3 transverse axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), we next assessed whether there was a relation between remapping scores across the full sequence and tetrode location. There was a significant negative correlation between tetrode location and rate difference (<italic>r</italic><sub>(7)</sub>= −.811, <italic>p</italic>= 0.027) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 4</xref>). There was however no correlation between tetrode location and place cell properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table 5</xref>), spatial correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>), nor subset switching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). This finding points to greater rate remapping in place cells recorded from the most proximal CA3, compared to distal CA3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Being raised in a complex environment enhances memory discrimination in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated putative neural mechanisms supporting enrichment-dependent memory improvements using a behavioural task that models the automatically encoded and integrative nature of episodic memory. We found that EE-dependent improvements in fine memory discrimination are related to increased levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhanced sparsity of neuronal activity across the hippocampus. Critically, we also found that EE changes the way CA3 encodes changes in context. EE leads to increased spatial tuning of CA3 place cells, as CA3 place cells in enriched rats carry greater spatial information, have higher firing rates and show increased remapping in response to small geometric alterations to the environment.</p><p id="P16">These findings are consistent with research showing that adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is upregulated by enrichment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, is fundamental for pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and stimulation of immature abGCs drives place cell remapping in proximal CA3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The current studies extend this research in two important ways. Firstly, by using a behavioural task that models key features of episodic memory we extend previous findings to the most clinically relevant form of memory. Secondly, we demonstrate enrichment-dependent changes in CA3 place cells, the region that receives input directly from abGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, for the first time. We also show that enriched rodents encode associative memories more efficiently as they require less time to accurately encode novel objects in the context-dependent episodic memory tasks.</p><p id="P17">Interestingly, the effects of EE on sparsity of activity were particularly evident in the SPDG, compared to the IPDG. Given that the SPDG receives most input from LEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, these findings support recent research suggesting that immature abGCs drive inhibition in response to LEC input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, in particular, and increased inhibition in the SPDG, rather than the IPDG, is related to improved pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Additionally, the finding that EE results in reduced activity in proximal, rather than distal, CA3 points to a special role for proximal CA3 in pattern separation. This is consistent with previous research pointing to proximal CA3 contributing to pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and with our finding of greater rate remapping in cells recorded from proximal, rather than distal, CA3.</p><p id="P18">The increased spatial tuning of CA3 place cells in the enriched rats suggests that EE leads to more selective and more precise spatial information encoding in CA3, which could support better spatial memory. Combined with recent reports of enrichment-dependent increases of spatial tuning and spatial information in DG mature granule cells in novel environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, these findings show that EE has clear effects on spatial tuning of place cells in the DG/CA3 network. Interestingly, our results stand in contrast to findings from CA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> which suggests that EE’s effects on spatial tuning of place cells might be limited to DG/CA3.</p><p id="P19">EE also resulted in increased firing rates in CA3 place cells, consistent with previous reports of enrichment-dependent increases in activity in DG mature granule cells and CA1 place cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This contrasts with studies showing that increased neurogenesis is typically associated with decreased activity in the DG and CA3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This discrepancy, however, comes from the way activity is measured. Most studies looking at how EE and adult hippocampal neurogenesis modulate hippocampal activity have focused on differences in percentage of active neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, rather than on differences in firing rates. The findings of this study suggest that EE reduces the number of active cells, while increasing the activity of those cells. This allows the hippocampus to reduce interference by encoding spatial information using a small neuronal population with high spatial information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">We also report enrichment-dependent increase in rate remapping in CA3 across the different shapes of the morph box. Interestingly, our standard-housed rats did not show CA3 rate remapping in the morph box as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This can potentially be explained by slightly different protocols. Here rats had a short exposure to the box during training and morph box shapes were made as similar as possible. Previous studies have used different floors and colours for each shape and extensive pretraining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This makes the discrimination between shapes in our study much harder, which might explain the lack of rate remapping in our standard-housed rats.</p><p id="P21">Interestingly, CA3 place cells in the enriched rats showed increased rate remapping across delayed exploration of the same shape. It was reported that exercised mice show increased representational drift in CA1 place cells, i.e., CA1 place cells representation of a stable environment changes more rapidly following exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. It is possible that increased flexibility in CA3 place cell representations in enriched rats comes at the price of decreased stability of representations. This hypothesis would be consistent with adult hippocampal neurogenesis driving forgetting of previous memories and more flexible encoding of novel information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Future studies should further assess the effect of EE on flexibility and stability of hippocampal representations, by looking into the effect of EE on place cell representation of familiar and novel environments over days or weeks. This would allow the investigation of whether and, if so, how EE modulates the balance between flexibility and stability in the hippocampal codes.</p><p id="P22">Finally, CA3 place cells in the enriched rats showed increased subset switching, i.e., more CA3 place cells turned on and off in response to changes to the environment in the enriched rats compared to the standard-housed rats. Increased subset switching suggests enhanced sparseness of activity in the enriched rats, resulting in more specific spatial representations. The increased spatial tuning in CA3 place cells reported here would also point to more precise encoding of spatial information in the enriched rats.</p><p id="P23">In summary, we report for the first time that EE changes the way the CA3 place cells encode spatial environments, by increasing their spatial tuning and chances of remapping. Together, these findings point to more precise, and more flexible, memory representations in the CA3 of enriched rats. This increase in spatial tuning and in the ability to respond to alterations to familiar environments might provide a novel neuronal mechanism for enrichment-dependent improvements in fine memory discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="S8" specific-use="web-only"><title>STAR Methodology</title><sec id="S9"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S10"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P24">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, James Ainge (<email>jaa7@st-andrews.ac.uk</email>)</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P25">This study did not generate new unique reagents.</p><p id="P26">Data and code availability</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="S13"><title>Animals</title><p id="P27">34 male Lister Hooded rats (Envigo, UK; average weight: 100-125g) were used in these experiments. 24 rats (EE: 12, ST:12) were used in the behavioural and Fos experiments, 10 (EE: 5, ST:5) were used in the recording experiment.

Each cannula was glued with superglue (3M, UK) to a plastic shuttle, and each microdrive had 4 plastic shuttles in total. Each shuttle was connected to a screw mechanism. The cannulae were organized in two rows, with 0.4 mm between rows. The cannulae were spaced roughly 0.6mm apart to allow us to target CA3 across the proximodistal axis. This resulted in roughly 1.8 mm between the most far right and the most far left cannulae in the drive. Before implantation, the tetrodes were cut to roughly 5 mm and plated with gold until the impedance of each electrode tip was between 100-200 kW. On the day of surgery, the rats were anaesthetised with Isoflurane in an induction chamber and injected with analgesic Metacam subcutaneously prior to being placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skull was then exposed and the microdrive was implanted in the left hemisphere and targeted at CA3 (3.72-4.0 posterior to Bregma), with the most proximal tetrodes implanted roughly 2.3 mm lateral to midline and the most distal tetrodes implanted roughly 4.1 mm lateral to midline. After the craniotomy, dura was cut, and the tetrodes were lowered 2.8 mm below dura. The implant was the secured to the skull using jewellers’ screws and dental cement.

Within the recording system, the signal was bandpass filtered (600-6000 Hz) and amplified 5000-20000 times with a unity-gain operational amplifier. An oscilloscope on a computer screen connected to the recording system allowed us to visualize filtered signals for each electrode (or channel) of each tetrode. During screening sessions, each channel in the oscilloscope was examined for spiking events. Additionally, population-based EEG signal was examined and sampled at 250Hz. Theta frequency, which is in the range of 8-12 Hz and is characteristic of the hippocampus, was looked for. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) located on the head stage were used to detect the animal’s location. If a unit was detected, a reference channel where no putative cells were present was used as a reference for the other channels. This was done for each tetrode. Additionally, the gain and the threshold for spiking event detection were adjusted to minimize noise and maximize signal for each tetrode. At the end of a recording session, tetrodes from which putative place cells were recorded were nudged down by roughly 10 micrometres. If no units were detected, the tetrodes were moved down by roughly 60 micrometres.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Behavioural apparatus</title><p id="P48">All recordings occurred in an electrophysiology suite consisting of a towel-line flowerpot (screening location) and a recording location.

The test box consisted of the “morph box” described above. For this experiment, the box was painted matte black to avoid the LEDs on the recording head stage reflecting on the walls, which would have resulted in inaccurate detection of the animal’s location within the box.

This was done to habituate the rats to the square and circle shapes, and to foraging for pieces of chocolate wheetos randomly thrown in the environment. When putative pyramidal cells were detected in at least one tetrode, testing and recording began. The testing procedure always began with a 10-to-15-minute exploration of either the square or the circle. Each exploration lasted 10-to-15 minutes and consisted in the rat foraging for pieces of chocolate wheetos randomly thrown in the box. The rat was always placed in the box facing the south wall. The recording session consisted of the initial square or circle exploration followed by exploration of the four intermediate shapes in sequential order, exploration of the circle (if the sequence started with the square) or the square (if the sequence started with the circle) and a repetition of the initial shape (full sequence, Top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). This sequence was counterbalanced across days, as some days the rat experienced the shapes starting with the square, some starting with the circle. In-between exploration of distinct shapes, the rat was placed on the towel-line flowerpot (screening location) for roughly 5 minutes as the environment was morphed and the box was cleaned with Safe4 disinfectant. Data for the full sequence were collected from 3 standard-housed rats and 4 enriched rats.

Spike clusters were first generated using KlustaKwik, which automatically sorts raw spike data into clusters based on principal components (PCs) such as amplitude and energy. The resulting clusters were then either deleted (if they did not look like neuronal spikes) or manually refined to reduce noise. Putative pyramidal cells were distinguished from putative interneurons based on spike width. The recording arena was divided into 5 cm x 5 cm bins. Place fields were constructed by summing the total number of spikes that occurred in each location bin (5×5cm), divided by the time that the rat spent in that location. Place fields were defined as contiguous region of 9 (5cm x 5cm) bins where the minimum firing rate was 0.2 Hz and 20% of the peak firing rate for that cell in that shape. Additionally, for each place field a smoothing value of 5 cm SD Gaussian centred on each bin was applied. Finally, a shuffling procedure was used to define place cells; for all putative place cells, the times at which they fired were shuffled relative to the locations at which they fired. This yielded a randomized distribution of spatial information scores. By doing so, 1,000 randomized rate maps, and spatial information scores, were created for each putative place cell.

Units with an isolation distance of &gt; 20 were classified as highly isolated, units with an isolation distance between 10 and 20 were classified as intermediately isolated and units with an isolation distance &lt; 10 were classified as poorly isolated. Units were included in the analysis if they were intermediately or highly isolated in at least one shape within the session. The automatic isolation distance calculation could only be performed on clusters with a good connection on all four channels per each tetrode. If a channel was grounded or did not have a good connection, isolation distance for that cluster was assessed by comparing those clusters to clusters for which automatic isolation distance could be calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Analysis of place cell characteristics</title><p id="P54">The MATLAB script computed firing maps for each cell, which depict the firing rate for a cell in each bin using a colour ranging from blue (lowest firing rate, cell not active) to red (maximum firing rate, cell maximally active). The firing rate map was analysed for the whole 10-to-15-minute recording trial in each shape, and the following place cell properties were computed: spatial information content, selectivity, spatial coherence, average firing rate in the field, peak firing rate in the field, and place field size. To look at the effect of group on place cell properties, these place cell properties were analysed for all cells that had a place field in the square shape and place cell characteristics in the square were compared for each existing session across groups. The square was picked as a representative shape that could be used to compare the two groups. The spatial information score indicates the amount of information that one can get about the location of the animal based on each spike of the cell.

This was done using a MATLAB script by correlating rate maps of a cell across the initial shape (either square or circle) and each of the subsequent shapes in the session. Each pixel of the rate map from the first shape in the session was correlated with each pixel of the rate map of the same cell in each of the subsequent shapes within the same session. This generated a Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each comparison (here referred as trial). Correlation values ranged between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating maximum remapping and 1 indicating no remapping. Critically, pixels that were not visited by the animal were discarded from the analysis. Cells that did not have a field in one or more of the shapes in the session, or whose fields were only present in one shape, were considered as subset switching, which is a specific form of global remapping. Finally, for each animal a global remapping value was computed. This was done by calculating, for each animal, the average spatial correlation value for all cells recorded from sessions including the full sequence. Averaged values from each animal were then used in the correlation with the tetrode location values.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Analysis of rate remapping</title><p id="P59">The rate remapping analysis was conducted on place fields, rather than on units. Place fields that were present in all shapes within the session in which they were recorded were included in the rate remapping analysis. Rate remapping was calculated across the first shape in the session and each subsequent shape as the normalized “rate difference” between two<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This was done by taking the absolute difference in firing rate for a field between two shapes and dividing it by the sum of the firing rates for that field across the same two shapes. Rate remapping values were calculated for both the average in-field firing rates and the peak in-field firing rates. Greater values indicate greater rate remapping across the two shapes. Finally, for each animal an average rate remapping value was computed. This was done by calculating, for each animal, the average rate difference across the full sequence for all cells, and then averaging that number across all cells recorded for each animal. Only cells that were recorded from sessions including the full sequence were included in the analysis. Averaged values from each animal were then used in the correlation with the tetrode location values.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p id="P60">Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (IBM, version 28). Prior to analysis, normality of data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the Mauchly’s test was significant, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were used. To compare rat performance across groups, univariate ANOVAs were run for each task on the discrimination ratios for each group (EE vs ST). To determine whether the average discrimination ratios were significantly greater than chance level, one-sample t-tests against the value of 0 were conducted on the discrimination ratios for each group for each task. To compare object exploration during the test phase across groups, univariate ANOVAs were run for each task on the total object exploration during test (s) for each group (EE vs ST). Additionally, a Mixed Effect ANOVA with Sample (1 vs 2), Task (OC and OPC) and Similarity (Similar vs Dissimilar) as within-subjects factors and Group (EE vs ST) as between-subjects factor was run on the total object exploration (s) to assess differences in the amount of time the rats spent exploring the objects during encoding. A univariate ANOVA was used to compare DCX density counts across the enriched and the standard groups. To determine whether there was a relationship between performance in the tasks and levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated with DCX density against discrimination ratios for each task for each animal. <italic>c-Fos</italic> density counts and normalized <italic>c-Fos</italic> density counts were analysed in the dorsal hippocampus (SPDG, IPDG, pCA3, dCA3, pCA1, dCA1). A Mixed Effect ANOVA with Group (Enriched, Standard) and Condition (Familiar, Novel) as between-subjects factors and ROIs as within-subjects factor was used to compare <italic>c-Fos</italic> density counts and normalized <italic>c-Fos</italic> density counts across regions, groups and conditions.</p><p id="P61">To determine whether there was a significant difference across the enriched and standard groups in place cell properties, Kruskal-Wallis H-tests were conducted with Group (Enriched and Standard) as Fixed Factor. For the place cell properties, the values for the shape “square” were included in the analyses for each cell that had a place field in the square shape. This was done to assess group differences in place cell properties within a representative shape. For the rate remapping analysis, a Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were run with Cell as Random Factor and Group and Trial as Fixed Factors on rate differences from place fields that were recorded in sessions that included the initial shape (square or circle), a repetition of the first shape and at least two shapes in-between. This was done to include cells recorded from incomplete sessions. To be included in the rate remapping analysis, the place field had to be present in all shapes within the session. Following significant interactions, Bonferroni-corrected pairwise contrasts were performed to compare rate differences across trials and groups. For the main global remapping analysis, a GLMM was run with Cell as Random Factor and Group and Trial as Fixed Factors on spatial correlation values across the first shape and each subsequent shape. This analysis included all units with a field in at least one shape in the session. To determine whether a higher percentage of place cells showed subset switching across the enriched and the standard groups, observed frequencies of place cells showing subset switching were compared across experimental groups using a Chi Square test of independence. Finally, Pearson’s correlations (or Spearman’s correlation) were run between global remapping scores/rate remapping scores and tetrode location values (distance from the most proximal side of CA3) for each animal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189305-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d154aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189305-supplement-Supplemental_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d154aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S40"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the St Andrews Animal Unit (SMAU) for their support and advice on the environmental enrichment used in these experiments.
