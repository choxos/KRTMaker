Pioneering transcription factors (TFs) such as neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2 or NGN2) and achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) play critical roles in initiating and regulating neurogenesis within vertebrate nervous systems, and their pioneering role is transferable in vitro to induce rapid neuron formation from pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). NGN2-induced neuronal cells (iNs) were shown to exhibit excitatory glutamatergic properties within two weeks of in vitro differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, these neurons are heterogenous, with a mixture of central and peripheral nervous system-derived neuron identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This diversity might be linked to NGN2’s naturally varied in vivo expression pattern across regions such as the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). It remains unclear how to guide the proneural function of TFs into each associated lineage.</p><p id="P4">In human brain development, neuronal diversity is stimulated by diverging morphogen gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This has inspired researchers to combine cell type-specific TF overexpression with the addition of extrinsic patterning factors to achieve regional specification (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)). For instance, combining NGN2 overexpression with dual SMAD and WNT inhibition was shown to generate forebrain neurons, while the addition of a SMAD inhibitor and a WNT agonist generated anterior hindbrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, there is a lack of systematic exploration of the neuronal diversity that can be achieved by combining TF overexpression and morphogen exposure and of systematic profiling of cellular heterogeneity within these induced cell populations.</p><p id="P5">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity and enhancing the resolution of cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). By examining the transcriptomes of individual cells during dynamic developmental processes, scRNA-seq enables the reconstruction of differentiation trajectories and the identification of underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This technique has been instrumental in creating comprehensive catalogs of human cells, which facilitates the characterization and validation of programmed cell fates and improves the selection of disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Moreover, the recent advances in scRNA-seq allows for sample multiplexing and the profiling of an increased number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), providing exciting opportunities for high-throughput perturbation screening with readouts at single-cell level. In this study, we set out to systematically explore the neuronal cell type diversity that can be achieved using combinatorial morphogen patterning coupled with NGN2 or ASCL1/DLX2 induction. We used highly-multiplexed scRNA-seq readout to profile nearly 700,000 cells in 480 distinct morphogen combinations and found that iNs can be patterned into diverse neuron subtypes with identities aligned to the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of neural tube development. Additionally, we developed a computational pipeline to analyze cooperative signaling and transcriptional regulation driving cell fate transitions, indicating the power of using in vitro systems to dissect morphogen response pathways. Taken together, our systematic screening approach provides valuable insights into neuron subtype specification and the underlying morphogen-dependent regulators, and it can serve as a general strategy for cell subtype programming.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Combinatorial patterning expands the diversity of NGN2-iN subtypes</title><p id="P6">To systematically program neuron subtypes, we implemented a combinatorial morphogen screening strategy on NGN2-iNs from iPSCs. Our aim was to investigate whether the identity, concentration, and combination of morphogen signaling modulators could influence neuron subtype specification. Our selected compounds play pivotal roles in modulating signaling pathways crucial for patterning and regionalization in early nervous system development. These include four anterior-posterior (AP) morphogen signaling modulators: XAV-939 (XAV, a WNT pathway antagonist), CHIR-99021 (CHIR, a WNT pathway agonist), retinoic acid (RA), and FGF8 and three dorsal-ventral (DV) morphogen signaling modulators: BMP4, SHH, and pur-morphamine (SHH pathway agonist). Employing different concentrations and combinations of these morphogen signaling modulators, we created a total of 24 AP patterning conditions and 8 DV patterning conditions, resulting in 192 unique AP x DV morphogen signaling modulator combinations for screening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). For each of the combinations, we first induced NGN2 expression in iPSCs using doxycycline, followed by sequential exposure to corresponding AP morphogen signaling modulators and DV morphogen signaling modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). This temporal exposure mimicked the natural developmental patterning timeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). After continuous exposure to morphogen combinations, NGN2-iNs from each condition were individually dissociated at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), followed by nuclei isolation, fixation, permeabilization and processing for highly multiplexed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using a split-pool combinatorial barcoding platform (ParseBiosciences).</p><p id="P7">Following data filtering to exclude low-quality cells and potential multiplets, we successfully profiled 184,431 cells across 192 conditions, with an average of 1000 cells per condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Our analysis revealed 101 molecularly distinct clusters of patterned NGN2-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, see Methods). We utilized Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding to visually represent the dataset. Notably, the morphogen signaling modulator treatments significantly increased the diversity of NGN2-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A pronounced separation and mirrored cluster distribution was observed between BMP4-treated and SHH-treated NGN2-iNs, recapitulating their distinct roles in DV patterning and neural fate specification. Canonical marker gene expression analysis indicated that patterned NGN2-iNs primarily exhibited a neuronal identity (MAP2+), transitioning away from pluripotent stem cell states (POU5F1-) and ceasing cell cycle activity (MKI67-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The majority of patterned NGN2-iNs are glutamatergic neurons (SLC17A6+), while there are also cholinergic neuron (CHAT+) and noradrenergic neuron (SLC6A2+) subtypes present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Nearly half of the patterned NGN2-iNs expressed peripherin (PRPH+), a typical marker for the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the expression of PRPH correlated strongly with BMP4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). We provided a detailed list of cluster marker genes, including TFs and ion channels (ICs) that are among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each molecularly distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We annotated the patterned NGN2-iNs by transferring labels from a diverse set of human and mouse primary single cell transcriptomic atlases of fetal and adult nervous systems encompassing all major brain regions, retina, spinal cord, enteric nervous system (ENS), dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) (Supplementary Table 2, see Methods). To enhance robustness in label transfer, we employed high-resolution clustering by aggregating similar cells within the same cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). These high-resolution clusters faithfully represented the overall cluster distribution and significantly expanded the number of features available for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C to E</xref>). Patterned NGN2-iNs are mapped to a spectrum of distinct neuron types spanning the anterior-posterior axis of central nervous system development, including forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Beyond the central nervous system (CNS), certain clusters of patterned NGN2-iNs exhibited regional identities associated with the PNS, including the sympathetic nervous system, enteric nervous system, trigeminal ganglia, and dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Our mapping is supported by relevant cell type markers, including the presence of the LHX9 hgene in midbrain clusters and HOX genes in hindbrain clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). We validated the expression of MAP2 and SLC17A6 as well as neuron subtype-specific marker genes LHX9, SLC5A7, NTRK1 and TRPM8 in selected samples using immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G to I</xref>, see Methods). To probe the functionality of patterned NGN2-iNs, we performed electrophysiological measurements by means of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). Patterned NGN2-iNs developed spontaneous electrical activity early on (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, Movie S1), and demonstrated robust axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>, Movie S1). Moreover, we found that different patterning conditions manifest in distinct electrophysiological activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>), and that this activity could be significantly reduced by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). These findings underscore the efficacy of combinatorial patterning in inducing diverse neuron subtypes from NGN2-iNs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Morphogen combinations activate distinct gene regulatory networks that shape neuronal diversity in patterned NGN2-iNs</title><p id="P9">To understand how morphogen signaling modulators and their combinations drive diverse NGN2-iN subtypes, we analyzed the diversity of clusters that are generated by each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that all conditions give rise to multiple clusters, suggesting that combinatorial patterning is insufficient to generate homogeneous neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A to B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Yet, we were able to identify a preference of morphogen signaling modulator combinations to drive NGN2-iNs towards certain nervous system regions or neuron types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B to C</xref>). Notably, we found that for XAV, FGF8, BMP4 and SHH, the identity of the signaling modulator is dominant in cluster specification, while the concentration contributes only to a minor extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Conversely, for RA the concentration has a dramatic effect on cluster identity, and with increasing RA concentration cells gradually shift to new cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A to B</xref>). The addition of BMP4 to the RA treatment yielded a pronounced acquisition of new cell states, indicating the presence of a synergistic effect between BMP and RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar cooperative effects are also observed for combinatorial treatment with BMP4 and CHIR, while no synergy is observed between SHH and RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Next, we quantified the number of clusters per condition, which showed a strong concentration-dependent effect of RA on cell fate restriction, independent of SHH or BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B to D</xref>). Conversely, CHIR induces increased cellular heterogeneity at medium concentrations, but a drop in cell cluster diversity at the highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B to D</xref>). BMP4 in general tends to produce fewer cell clusters compared to both the control (ctrl) and SHH conditions, yet the combinatorial effect of BMP4 and a high concentration of XAV leads to an intriguing increase in the number of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We looked into how morphogen signaling modulators affect the identity of NGN2-iN subtypes. Notably, RA treatment results in more NGN2-iNs with hindbrain cholinergic neuronal identity, in line with the known function of RA signaling in posterior patterning and cholinergic neural induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). WNT inhibition resulted in a subtle enhancement of forebrain fate, while its activation reduced the proportion of forebrain and midbrain cells. Activation of WNT also induced cells with distinct TG and DRG regional characteristics, accompanied by increased proportions of cholinergic and noradrenergic neuronal identity, consistent with existing research findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). SHH treatment exhibited a dosagedependent effect on anterior pattern acquisition as well as cholinergic neurogenesis, aligning with previous research (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A, S4C, Fig. S5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Conversely, BMP4 drove an increase in noradrenergic neuronal identity and a general regional specification within the PNS as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A to B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A, S4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We did not observe any significant effect by FGF8 treatment.</p><p id="P11">We used two approaches to elucidate the underlying molecular events orchestrated by the morphogen signaling modulators. We first trained a random forestbased regression model to predict morphogen concentrations based on gene expression data, with model performance as a proxy to quantify the difference between morphogen concentrations. We found that SHH and FGF8 responses reached saturation even at the lowest concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast, BMP4 and XAV exhibited minor dosage effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). RA and CHIR displayed the most robust dosage-dependent effects, with response saturation yet to be achieved even at the highest concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Next, we investigated the genes used by the model and found synergistic molecular features in the interplay between RA and BMP4 as well as CHIR and BMP4, which mirrored the effect observed in the acquisition of new cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B to C</xref>). Conversely, SHH treatment together with RA did not induce a strong combinatorial molecular shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A, S5D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To explore the regulatory mechanisms governing patterned NGN2-iNs fate specification in more detail, we inferred GRNs with SCENIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). We identified regulons, transcription factors and their respective target genes, associated with specific morphogen signaling modulators. We found that each morphogen modulator was linked to distinct sets of regulons that exhibited enriched activity in specific nervous system regions, with some regulons being controlled by multiple morphogen signaling modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). RA-associated regulons displayed a pronounced enrichment in hindbrain fates, including well-known drivers of posterior patterning such as HOXB4, RARB, and MEIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A to B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). FGF8-associated regulons had the propensity to promote midbrain fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). BMP4 and CHIR-associated regulons exhibited strong links to the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Notably, known effectors of BMP4, such as PHOX2B, SMAD1, SMAD9, and MSX1, were also identified within these regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Many of the aforementioned regulons exhibited positive activity correlation with the concentrations of their respective morphogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). Additionally, we calculated specifically activated regulons within each molecular cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>). PHOX2B and TLX2 regulons are highly associated with noradrenergic neuron fates, while THRB and RXRG were linked with cholinergic neuron fates, in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). These findings suggested that combinatorial morphogen exposure activates distinct transcription factor regulons that shape the identity and diversity of patterned NGN2-iN cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NGN2 induction in diverse pre-patterned neural progenitor cell input states leads to neuronal identities distinct from post-patterned NGN2-iNs</title><p id="P13">While our study has shown that combinatorial patterning following NGN2 induction (post-patterning) from iPSCs can induce diverse neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), patterning and regionalization typically precedes neuronal differentiation in natural neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). We therefore assessed whether the timing of patterning influences the specification of programmed neural subtypes, and whether diverse input states affect or expand the repertoire of NGN2-iN types. We set up a pre-patterning screen where we first patterned iPSCs into distinct regionalized neural progenitor cells followed by NGN2 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We used three different basal media to induce a neural lineage during pre-patterning, including general neural induction media (NIM), dual SMAD inhibition favoring anterior patterning (N2B27-2Si) and SMAD inhibition coupled with WNT activation promoting posterior patterning (N2B27-SB-CHIR). Following one day of neural induction, diverse AP and DV patterning conditions were provided to the cells, resulting in a total of 96 pre-patterning conditions that served as input states for NGN2 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). We phenotyped these regionalized neural progenitor states using single-cell multiomic analysis, including both transcriptome and open chromatin modalities, combining all 96 samples into one pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A to B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). In addition, we collected bulk RNA-seq data for each individual pre-patterned sample, which allowed us to demultiplex the sc-multiome data into the 96 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Computational analysis of the sc-multiome data of 96 pre-patterned samples revealed a spectrum of diverse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibiting distinct regional identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The chromatin landscape showed drastic changes upon exposure to different morphogen concentrations and/or basal media, with thousands of regions altering in accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). Motif enrichment on differential morphogen patterning conditions reveals major players controlling regional neural fate including OTX2 in forebrain progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) and CDX1 in hindbrain progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Combining gene expression data with motif enrichment also reveals functional roles for transcription factors, which we could link to morphogen signaling modulator concentrations. We found that RFX4 expression is high in clusters linked to RA, and additionally RFX4’s motif is highly enriched in regions accessible in cells expressing RFX4, suggesting an activating role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Similarly, the activator FOXA2 was linked to SHH, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Repressing factors, where expression of a factor leads to closing of regions with its motif, were also found, for example for BMP4 (SNAI2) and XAV (FOXG1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Next, we assessed the accessibility of NGN2 motifs in the various regionalized NPC states. We filtered the NGN2 motifs based on chromatin accessibility to identify potential NGN2 target genes associated with these peaks, and analyzed the enrichment of biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E to F</xref>). Inaccessible NGN2 motifs are involved in neural maturation, suggesting that, following induction, NGN2 as pioneer factor might open up these regions to induce neuronal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). In contrast, accessible NGN2 motifs are associated with patterning and regionalization processes, exhibiting differential accessibility across distinct pre-patterned progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E to F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we wondered how these diverse regionalized NPC input states with distinct chromatin accessibility landscapes would respond to NGN2 induction. We therefore induced NGN2 expression in all conditions using doxycycline and phenotyped the resulting cells using highly multiplexed snRNA-seq, analogous to the experimental procedure applied in the post-patterning screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). We successfully profiled 304,912 cells across 96 conditions and identified 115 molecularly distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). The majority of clusters exhibited a neuronal identity including neuron-like, but interestingly also less mature radial glia-like cells, and we observed a small number of non-neural off-target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Pre-patterned NGN2-iNs exhibit diverse regional and cellular identity distinct from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G to H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). We compared the regional identity composition of regionalized NPC input states and corresponding NGN2-iNs and found that regional identity is largely preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). This implies that in most cases, NGN2 is not actively involved in regionalization but rather induces neuronal differentiation from the regional identity pre-established in progenitors.</p><p id="P16">We compared pre-patterned and post-patterned NGN2-iNs to assess their similarities and to identify new cell states acquired using the pre-patterning regime. We found that pre-patterned and post-patterned cells acquire different region identity composition and cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, Fig. 3J</xref>). Cells in the pre-patterning condition displayed a higher proportion of neuronal cells of the CNS and an increase of off-target non-neuronal cells compared to the post-patterning condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). Enrichments in forebrain and hindbrain regional identity are observed, presumably due to the specific basal media preferences used during pre-patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). Retinal progenitors are highly enriched in dual SMADi/WNTi/BMP4 conditions, whereas neural crest cells are enriched in SMADi/WNTa/BMP4 conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Higher concentrations of BMP4, SHH, and XAV appeared to elevate the proportion of off-target non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the pre-patterning regime with NGN2 induction in regionalized NPCs indeed provides inroads to new neuronal identities beyond those obtained during post-patterning.</p><p id="P17">We investigated the gene regulatory mechanisms driving these cell fate differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). We inferred the GRNs of pre-patterned NGN2-iNs and compared the regulons to that of post-patterned NGN2-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Morphogen signaling modulators generally activate distinct regulon networks in both pre- and post-patterned NGN2-iNs, with some shared regulons like MEIS2, HOXB4, and HOXB9 associated with RA, as well as SMAD1, EBF1, and ZBTB20 associated with BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Intriguingly, while the RARB regulons in pre- and post-patterning are both associated with RA and hindbrain regionality, their activities show low correlation with RA when assessed in the alternate dataset (e.g., pre-regulon score in post-dataset and vice versa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>). This suggests that although the RARB transcription factor is induced by RA, it regulates different sets of target genes in pre- and postpatterned NGN2-iNs. Our findings underscore the distinct effects of NGN2 induction in the pre-patterning versus post-patterning regimes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Leveraging TF induction, combinatorial patterning and scRNA-seq readout as a general strategy for cell subtype programming</title><p id="P18">To assess the potential of combinatorial patterning as a general strategy for cell subtype programming, we extended our investigation to ASCL1-DLX2-induced GABAergic neuronal cells (ASCL1/DLX2-iNs). Adopting a similar experimental framework used for combinatorial patterning coupled with NGN2 induction, we designed 192 different combinations of AP and DV morphogen signaling modulators for pre- and postpatterned cells coupled with ASCL1/DLX2 induction. We performed snRNA-seq on all conditions and profiled 85,756 and 139,711 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A to B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12 to Fig. S16</xref>). Computational analysis identified 78 and 107 clusters for pre- and postpatterned cells, respectively, and revealed a GABAergic neuronal phenotype for a large fraction of the cells indicated by expression of MAP2 and GAD1, and the absence of expression of SLC17A6. Similar to the findings with NGN2-iNs, we observed a higher proportion of off-target cells without MAP2/GAD1 expression in the pre-patterning compared to the post-patterning conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We combined data from all patterned NGN2- and ASCL1/DLX2-induced cells to establish an integrated induced neuronal cell atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Co-clustering all samples revealed minimal overlap between the datasets, indicating the efficacy of our strategies in generating diverse neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To explore the differences in morphogen responsecurves between NGN2- and ASCL1/DLX2-iNs, we quantified the similarity between morphogen signaling modulator conditions and controls in relation to the exposed modulator concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Notably, ASCL1/DLX2-iNs are more sensitive to SHH concentrations, showing more pronounced changes in gene expression primarily at intermediate concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This aligns with previous research showing a higher sensitivity of GABAergic neurons to ventralizing signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Apart from SHH, we find that the other morphogens follow similar dynamics in post-patterned NGN2- and ASCL1/DLX2-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Interestingly, while response to XAV reached a plateau in both postpatterned NGN2- and ASCL1/DLX2-iNs, we find that the highest concentration of XAV affects post-patterned NGN2-iNs to a greater extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Moreover, we identified distinct interactions between basal media and morphogen dynamics in pre-patterned cells independent of the induced TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). This observation emphasizes the distinct action of morphogens in various input states represented by different basal media. It also underscores the potential of distinct pioneering TFs in driving differential gene expression changes from a similar input state, which may arise from their differential interaction with established epigenetic states in prepatterned neural progenitors.</p><p id="P19">To assess the similarity between all identified cell clusters, we performed clustering based on TFs and ion channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). We associated each cluster with the condition that exhibited the highest proportion of cells within that specific cluster. Our analysis revealed an initial cluster segregation based on timing (pre- versus-post-patterning) and TFs, followed by the influence of the basal media and combinatorial morphogen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The purity of clusters that can be reached under optimal conditions ranges from 0.3% to 84%, with a mean of 15%. 71 clusters can be generated with over 25% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). To understand the similarity of morphogen response in each combinatorial patterning scheme, we systematically compared the morphogen-centered regulons across datasets. Our findings revealed substantial similarity between the regulons of post-patterned NGN2-iNs and ASCL1/DLX2-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>). This suggests a shared impact of morphogens on TF-induced neurons post-TF induction, despite variations in proneuronal TFs.</p><p id="P20">iNs exhibit promising potential for studying diseases in vitro, serving both fundamental and pharmaceutical research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). To assess the potential of patterned iNs in disease modeling, we used signatures from Human Disease Ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) to perform gene set enrichment on the marker genes of each cluster and identified several clusters with enriched expression of disease-related genes. Patterned iNs also display expression of a wide repertoire of different neurotransmitters (NTs) and neuropeptides (NPs). Using Random Forest modeling, we were able to link certain morphogen concentrations and conditions to NT/NP expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). We find that the highest concentration of CHIR is associated with GABAergic neurons that express neuropeptide Y (NPY), a neuropeptide that has been linked to obesity and alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Furthermore, increased concentrations of BMP4 in pre-patterned NGN2-iNs is associated with higher expression of somatostatin (SST) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Post-patterned NGN2-iNs exposed to higher RA concentrations, on the other hand, show elevated expression of the glutamate transporter SLC1A2 that is known for its association with various neuropathologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>).

This approach is transformative because of the high induction efficiency and its rapid maturation compared to in vivo neurons, significantly expediting research progress. Despite the potential of iNs to generate brain regionspecific neuron subtypes by coupling with morphogen signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), a systematic exploration of morphogen combinations with iNs and the resulting achievable neuronal diversity has been lacking. In this study, we investigated how morphogen signaling modulator identity, gradients, combination, and treatment timing cooperate with different pioneering TFs to influence neuronal differentiation across 480 conditions. Using high-throughput scRNA-seq as a readout, we individually profiled each condition, successfully capturing a total of 700,000 cells and identified over 400 molecularly distinct clusters. Drawing upon extensive scRNA-seq primary neuron atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), we mapped the patterned iNs, annotated their identities, and assessed their similarity to primary counterparts. We showed that patterned iNs cover diverse neuron subtypes that are mapped across a range of regionality along the neural axis with various neurotransmitter identities. This programmed neuronal diversity atlas can serve as a rich resource to facilitate further engineering of desired neuron subtypes.</p><p id="P22">iNs have certain limitations. We previously found that NGN2-iNs are molecularly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and it has been challenging to match these neuron populations to their primary counterparts with high confidence. While combinatorial patterning successfully expands the diversity of induced neuronal cells, resulting patterned iNs remain molecularly heterogeneous. While we have identified several new conditions that can achieve 80 % neuronal subtype homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), most iN cultures remain heterogeneous. Additional morphogen signaling modulators or overexpression of different TFs, might help to improve specificity. We identified several regional and neurotransmitter subtypespecific regulons, and these TFs could serve as a starting point in further engineering of homogeneous subtypes with desired features. Currently, our annotation of patterned iNs are based on their relative similarity to primary neurons. Although we observe a preference towards specific regionality compared to unpatterned controls, their transcriptomes are still not identical to those of primary neurons. Considering absolute similarity, there remains a considerable distance between patterned iNs and in vivo neurons. This discrepancy could result from their TF-induced nature and the presence of a iN gene expression background. Eliminating this background represents a key obstacle in enhancing the similarity of iNs to primary neurons.</p><p id="P23">All together, our data represents an important foundation in programming iPSCs into specific neuronal cell types. We performed a large-scale combinatorial screen of morphogen signaling modulators, activating and inhibiting important developmental pathways. We have shown how these pathways interact with each other, and their molecular underpinnings in the form of GRNs to create neuronal cell types. We present strategies for the programming of distinct cell types with specific neurotransmitter, TF expression and disease relevances, and our methodology opens up the possibility for future work to enlarge the repertoire of iNs.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>iPSC culture</title><p id="P24">All cells were cultured under standard conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2 unless specified otherwise.

Subsequently, we performed canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based label transfer (implemented in Seurat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), transferring labels from individual primary neuron reference atlases (Supplementary Table 2) onto the highres clusters. This label transfer was based on three gene sets: the 5,000 highly variable genes from our dataset, the highly variable genes from the reference atlases (normally encompassing around 30% of the detected genes), and cluster marker genes from our dataset. We determined the consensus results among the three gene sets and corresponding maximal matching scores within each highres cluster, and subsequently summarized these results to each cluster. The final cluster annotation was assigned based on consensus agreement among primary references, the percentage of highres clusters in each transferred category in each cluster, matching scores, and the expression of canonical marker genes. Each cluster was annotated by multiple layers of identities, including division (CNS, PNS, and non-neuronal), region, neuron type, and associated TF/ion channels defining that specific cluster (Supplementary Table 3).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Morphogen RF classifier</title><p id="P37">To create random forest regressor models to predict morphogen concentrations based on gene expression data, we first subset our data to only contain conditions with at least 250 cells. We then subsampled all conditions to 250 cells. Next, we lognormalized morphogen concentrations and performed min-max normalization. The expression matrix used raw UMIs. The data was split into a train and test data set using train_test_split (test_size=0.11, shuffled). A RandomForestRegressor object was initialized with (n_estimators=100, max_features=’sqrt’, max_depth=10) which was used in MultiOutputRegressor. This model was then used to predict concentrations on the test data. Every model was trained 5 times with different random_states and all functions used are part of the scikit-learn library.</p><p id="P38">For every morphogen we selected the top 150 genes with an importance score&gt;0.001 in each of the 5 runs and merged the set. We then used hierarchical clustering of the averaged expression profiles of every morphogen concentration to create modules.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Gene regulatory network analysis</title><p id="P39">Gene regulatory networks were inferred using SCENIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). We loaded the latest motif databases (motifs-v10, both 10kbp_up_10kbp and 500bp_up_100bp_down) and all human transcription factors from cistarget. We ran SCENIC 20 times on each dataset. Each iteration, we subsampled cells to acquire 100 cells per cluster (with replacement, using different random states each run). SCENIC was run using the pySCENIC implementation of GRNBoost2 and default parameters. The 20 runs were then used to create consensus regulons, only keeping TF-target gene interactions detected in at least 5 runs.</p><p id="P40">We used AUCell to score all cells based on the consensus regulons. We then used GRNBoost2 to link morphogen concentrations and basal media to regulon activity. We also hardcoded interactions in the matrix (var1*var2*var3) to better find interactions between morphogens and basal media. If a variable was linked to a target gene, but the link of an interaction variable had a higher weight than the individual variable, only the strongest link was kept and annotated as such. Finally, we performed filtering on the modules: w&gt;250.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>scMultiome library preparation, sequencing and data pre-processing</title><p id="P41">Single-cell suspensions obtained from each NGN2-iN pre-patterning condition were divided into two distinct pools (Supplementary Table 1). Subsequently, each pool, along with the control NGN2-inducible iPSCs, underwent nuclei isolation individually following provider’s instruction (10x Genomics user guide CG000365). These isolated nuclei were then separately processed for 10x Multiome GEM generation, library preparation, and sequencing according to the provider’s instructions (10x Genomics user guide CG000338). To generate the matrices of transcript and fragment counts per cell, sequencing reads from the fastq file were aligned against the human genome and transcriptome reference (hg38, sourced from 10x Genomics) utilizing the Cell Ranger ARC (v2.0.0, 10x Genomics) analysis pipeline with default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>scMultiome data processing</title><p id="P42">The three RNA libraries were merged together and processed in Scanpy. Cells with fewer than 400 genes or more than 10,000 genes were filtered out. In addition, cells with more than 20% mitochondrial reads and over 50,000 UMIs were removed. Scrublet was used to predict and remove doublets.</p><p id="P43">Clustering was performed with the same parameters as in the other samples. Harmony was used for integration and 60PCs were used for subsequent analyses. Leiden clustering 4 was used as the high resolution clustering due to a lower number of cells compared to the other analyses. Clusters were merged if fewer than 5 differential genes were detected (pval adj&lt;1e-10, lfc&gt;2) with its most similar cluster or if fewer than 3 transcription factors or ion channels were differentially expressed.</p><p id="P44">ATAC libraries were processed in SCENIC+ starting from the fragment files. The RNA clustering was used to create pseudobulks, from which peaks were called using MACS2 (shift=73,ext_size=146,q_value=0.05,keep_dup=’all’). Next, the get_consensus_peaks function was used to create a set of consensus peaks (peak width = 500bp). The compute_qc_stats function was used to calculate quality metrics (duplicate rate, TSS enrichment, FRIP score). We used the following filtering on cells: log(unique fragemens)&gt;3.3, FRIP&gt;0.45 and TSS enrichment&gt;5.</p><p id="P45">To find variable regions, we first imputed accessibility (scale factor = 1,000,000) which we then normalized to a scale factor of 10,000. The function find_highly_variable_features was then used with default parameters. Differentially accessible regions were calculated using find_diff_features on imputed accessibility and variable regions, using the RNA clustering. Further, we calculated differential accessibility between every cluster and the control clusters. Py-cisTarget was used to calculate Motif enrichment on all differential regions using the motif 10 database.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Bulk RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing and data pre-processing</title><p id="P46">To extract RNA, cells from each NGN2-iN pre-patterning condition were individually collected and lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen). Subsequently, RNA extraction was performed in the multi-well format using the MagMAX™-96 for microarrays total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Quality assessment of the isolated RNAs from each condition was conducted using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit and the 2100 Bioanalyzer Systems (Agilent), while quantification was carried out using the Qubit system (Invitrogen). cDNA reverse transcription and amplification were carried out according to the smart-seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). The preparation of the sequencing library was based on the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep protocol (Illumina), and subsequently sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq High Output paired-end 2x75 parameter. Sequencing reads from the fastq file were aligned against the hg38 reference genome (obtained from 10x Genomics) using the STAR RNA-seq aligner with default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Demultiplexing of scMultiome from bulk RNA-seq</title><p id="P47">The MuSiC package was used to demultiplex bulk samples to single-cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). In short, markers were calculated for every cluster using Seurat FindAllMarker (logfc&gt;1, min.pct = 0.1). Then, music_prop was used to estimate cluster proportions (Leiden 0.25) in each bulk sample, using the marker genes. A low-resolution clustering was used since we found the algorithm unable to differentiate between smaller clusters. Instead we focused on linked larger clusters. We then calculated correlations between cluster proportions and morphogen/basal media conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>NGN2-motif analysis</title><p id="P48">To obtain the NGN2-motif-containing fragments from the scMultiome ATAC data, we utilized the Pando gene regulatory network inference package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) that has implemented the human base GRN (NetworkRegions@motifs@data) containing NGN2-binding motifs (MA0669.1, MA1642.1). ATAC fragments were extracted based on the presence of NGN2-binding motifs and subsequently filtered by accessibility. Fragments were considered accessible if detected in over 10% of the cells; otherwise, they were categorized as inaccessible. The accessible and inaccessible fragments were associated with genes based on their genomic proximity using rGREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Subsequently, the associated genes were analyzed for gene ontology enrichment using clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Distance response-curves</title><p id="P49">To obtain a quantitative effect of morphogen concentrations on gene expression changes, we calculated for every cell in each main experiment (pre/post, NGN2/ASCL1+DLX2) the euclidean distance in PCA space (50 components) to all control cells using the cdist function in scipy. We then averaged the distance over the 10 closest control cells and used this as a metric of gene expression change (the distance is affected both by cell type changes and up/down regulation of genes). Next, we calculated the average distance of control cells to other control cells in the same manner and used the mean control-control distance to normalize all other distances.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Neurotransmitter/Neuropeptide linking</title><p id="P50">We used all neuronal clusters (based on MAP2, STMN2 and DCX and TUBB3 expression) and calculated averaged expression profiles for every condition (unique combination of AP-axis, DV-axis, timing, NGN2 or ASCL1/DLX2 and basal media). Basal media and timing were one-hot encoded and all variables were standardized. The expression matrices were log-normalized (scale factor 10,000). We trained a Random Forest Regressor model (n_estimators=100, max_depth=3) to predict expression of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide genes (expressed in &gt; 100 cells, minimum expression level of 0.1) based on conditional variables. The model was scored using R-squared values, and only models with R2&gt;0.1 were used. A second model was trained using OLS regression on the same input. The OLS feature importances were used to give signs to the RF feature importances to indicate directionality.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p id="P51">Neuronal cultures were recorded with CMOS-based high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recording systems, produced by MaxWell Biosystems (Zurich, Switzerland). In the present study, a 24-multiwell plate was used, comprising 24 HD-MEAs, each consisting of 26,400 low-noise electrodes with a center-to-center electrode pitch of 17.5 μm, arranged in a 220 x 120 electrode array structure. The used HD-MEA can record simultaneously from a total of up to 1020 user-selected readout-channels at 10 kHz sampling rate; the sensing area is 3.85 × 2.10 mm2. After 9 days in culture, patterned NGN2-iNs were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using Accutase (STEM-CELL Technologies) and co-cultured with rat cortical astrocytes (Genlantis) on PLO/LMN-coated HD-MEAs (20,000 neurons + 40,000 astrocytes). Weekly recordings of the network activity started 12 days after the plating and continued until week 7. The electrode selection was based on the firing rate, as inferred from a prior Activity Scan (sparse 7x configuration). At each time point, a Network Assay (10 mins) and an Axon Scan (2 mins per configuration) were recorded to capture the network activity and allow for the inference of high-resolution electrical footprints (EFs) of individual neurons. At days in vitro (DIV) 52, the effect of 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) on the firing rate of NGN2-iNs was assessed by recording 10 min of baseline activity and subsequently adding 20μM CNQX (Tocris) to each culture. Networks were allowed to equilibrate for 10 mins and another 20 min of network activity were recorded. Recordings were then concatenated to assess firing rate differences at the single-cell level. HD-MEA recordings were spike sorted using SpikeInterface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>) and Kilosort 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) with default parameters and a spike threshold of 5.5. We used DeePhys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) with default parameters to infer and aggregate electrophysiological features across the development (all feature groups), and calculated the UMAP embedding for each recorded culture. Single-cell UMAP embeddings were generated from all activity-based features at day 12, and clustering was performed using the Louvain algorithm. EFs were inferred from spike-sorted Axon Scans using custom-written Python code.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Immunostaining</title><p id="P52">Patterned NGN2-iNs, co-cultured with rat cortical astrocytes (Genlantis) on PLO/LMN-coated 8-well or 96-well polymer coverslips (μ-Slide ibiTreat, ibidi) for 6 weeks, were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 mins at room temperature. Postfixation, the NGN2-iNs were quenched with 0.2 M Glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 mins and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking buffer (BB, composed of PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% serum matching the secondary antibody’s species) for 10 mins at room temperature. Subsequently, the coverslips were incubated with BB (without Triton X100) for an additional 40 mins and then treated with the respective primary antibody diluted in BB for 2 hours at room temperature or at 4°C overnight. Following five washes with PBS for 5 mins each, the coverslips were incubated with the respective secondary antibody diluted in BB containing 1:1000 diluted DAPI for 1 hour at room temperature (protected from light). After another five washes with PBS for 5 mins each, the coverslips were stored in PBS at 4°C until image acquisition. The immunostained NGN2-iNs were imaged as confocal Z-stacks using the CSU-W1-SoRa inverted spinning disk confocal system, and the acquired images were processed with Fiji.
