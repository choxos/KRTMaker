Studies in the periphery using Leydig cells and hepatocytes, as well as work in microglia, indicate that the function of TSPO may vary between cells depending on their specialised roles. Astrocytes are critical for providing trophic and metabolic support in the brain as part of their role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Recent work has highlighted that TSPO expression increases in astrocytes under inflamed conditions and may drive astrocyte reactivity. However, relatively little is known about the role TSPO plays in regulating astrocyte metabolism and whether this protein is involved in immunometabolic processes in these cells. Using TSPO-deficient (TSPO<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse primary astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> (MPAs) and a human astrocytoma cell line (U373 cells), we performed metabolic flux analyses. We found that loss of TSPO reduced basal astrocyte respiration and increased the bioenergetic response to glucose reintroduction following glucopenia, while increasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Lactate production was significantly reduced in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in U373 cells revealed that TSPO forms a complex with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, which presents a mechanism wherein TSPO may regulate FAO in astrocytes. Compared to TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> cells, inflammation induced by 3h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs revealed attenuated tumour necrosis factor release, which was enhanced in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs at 24h LPS stimulation. Together these data suggest that while TSPO acts as a regulator of metabolic flexibility in astrocytes, loss of TSPO does not appear to modulate the metabolic response of astrocytes to inflammation, at least in response to the stimulus/time course used in this study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>translocator protein 18kDa</kwd><kwd>TSPO</kwd><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>cytokine release</kwd><kwd>fatty acid oxidation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The mitochondrial translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) is a pentameric transmembrane protein with a high degree of evolutionary conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> that resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane of mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, including glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

This array of functions is highly relevant to glial cells, and while there is some knowledge about the role of TSPO in microglia, less is known about its role in astrocytes.</p><p id="P4">The brain is a metabolically expensive system with the highest weight-to-energy-use ratio of any organ in the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It is therefore essential that energy use in the CNS is tightly controlled. Astrocytes play key roles in nutrient uptake and distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, forming intimate relationships with neurons to provide trophic support and modulate neuronal activity directly; in turn, experimental modulation of these cells is sufficient to alter behavioural outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In concert with microglia, astrocytes participate in the CNS inflammatory response by detecting and repairing damage, though this is not considered to be their primary function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As inflammation requires changes in cellular metabolism, this affects energy use within the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that acute and chronic inflammation differentially alters the metabolic phenotype of primary mouse astrocytes in culture, modulating their expression of proteins involved with nutrient sensing and uptake, such as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Previous work has demonstrated that chronic inflammation in the CNS is linked to upregulated TSPO expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, largely attributed to glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In addition to regulating inflammatory responses, TSPO has been implicated in the regulation of cellular metabolism in the CNS and the periphery. For example, in 2016, Tu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> provided the first evidence that TSPO may act as a regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in MA-10 Leydig cells, demonstrating that in these cells TSPO deficiency upregulates gene expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (<italic>Cpt1a)</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO. This study also showed that overexpression of TSPO downregulates <italic>Cpt1a</italic> expression, suggesting a bidirectional relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Using murine microglia, a related study showed that in addition to metabolic impairments, microglial activation in response to proinflammatory stimulation is impaired by loss of TSPO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, Fairley <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> demonstrated that TSPO regulates glycolytic enzyme function and phagocytosis in microglia. However, in GBM1B stem-like cells and U87MG glioma cells, TSPO knockdown has been shown to increase glycolysis and reduce mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The heterogeneity in these findings implies that TSPO may play cell-type and state-dependent roles in regulating cellular metabolism. Studies on the role of TSPO in astrocytes are necessary because of the developmental and functional distinctions between astrocytes and microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> including differential expression of metabolic enzymes, such as CPT1a which is expressed to a much greater extent in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Their unique functions require astrocytes to have fine control of energy sensing and cellular metabolism to rapidly respond to stimuli and restore the homeostatic balance of the brain. TSPO has received attention as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory conditions given its potential role at the interface of inflammatory responses and metabolism (‘immunometabolism’) in glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. While it was recently shown that the astrocyte response to inflammatory stimuli includes regulation of TSPO expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, the role TSPO plays in regulating astrocyte basal metabolism, inflammatory responses, and the metabolic response of astrocytes to inflammatory stimulation remains unclear.</p><p id="P5">Our work tested the hypothesis that loss of TSPO impairs astrocyte glucose metabolism and enhances FAO metabolism under basal conditions. We investigated a possible mechanistic basis for this using co-immunoprecipitations, elucidating a mechanism by which TSPO may regulate astrocyte metabolism.

We found that under basal conditions U373 cells showed increased ECAR (a proxy of glycolysis) and reduced OCR (a proxy of mitochondrial respiration) relative to MPAs, therefore variation in the bioenergetic parameters between MPAs and U373 cells may be accounted for by these differences in basal bioenergetic profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Next, we examined the effect of TSPO deficiency on astrocyte glycolysis via the glycolysis stress test (GST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> (MPAs), 3F (U373 astrocytoma cells)). In this paradigm, a glucose-free incubation period (glucopenia) followed by glucose injection is used to examine the glycolytic rate of the cells. Because our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed that TSPO deficient astrocytes had reduced ECAR, we hypothesised that these cells would exhibit reduced glycolysis.

Postulating that this may have arisen due to a difference in the experimental protocol used – namely, the glucose starvation period followed by the reintroduction of glucose inherent to the GST paradigm – we hypothesised that TSPO deficiency may alter the metabolic adaptations when glucose is absent (glucopenia). We tested this by recapitulating the initial conditions of the MST (glucose present throughout) and GST (glucose absent initially) on the same plate: incubating TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> and TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> MPAs either in the presence or absence of glucose to directly compare their basal metabolic rates under these different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>).

As the conjugate base of lactic acid, L-lactate would acidify media if secreted from the cells, resulting in the changes in ECAR observed in our metabolic flux assays.

In the absence of glucose, while TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> MPAs reduced their L-lactate secretion by 6.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, p=0.0003), L-lactate secretion was not altered in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, p=0.35).

Moreover, we observed a statistically significant interaction between these variables (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.0001, F<sub>(1,20)</sub> = 21.84).

Hence, we hypothesised that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes were meeting their bioenergetic requirements through enhanced fatty acid metabolism. We examined this using a fatty acid oxidation stress test (FAOST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,D</xref>). This assay involves an overnight incubation in limited glucose media (0.5mM) supplemented with carnitine to promote FAO. During the assay, half the cells are treated with palmitate (C16; a saturated fatty acid) to induce FAO, and half of the C16- and control-treated cells are also treated with etomoxir, an inhibitor of CPT1a, the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO. This allows the contribution of FAO to maintaining the basal metabolic rates of the cells to be assessed. By sequentially injecting the same compounds used in the MST paradigm (oligomycin (0.5μM), FCCP (1μM), rotenone-antimycin A (0.5μM)), we were able to estimate maximal FAO, which provides an estimation of the contribution of FAO to the ability of cells to resolve metabolic stress.</p><p id="P43">We found that mean basal FAO was increased by 241.0% in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, p=0.031) compared with TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> MPAs. This suggests that lipids constituted a greater proportion of the substrates used to maintain basal metabolic rates in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs compared with TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> MPAs. We found that maximal FAO was enhanced in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, p=0.0004).

However, it is unclear whether this happens in all cell types and by what underlying mechanisms TSPO may be involved with FAO. In this study, we provide data supporting the hypothesis that TSPO regulates cellular bioenergetics in astrocytes. We showed that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes secrete less lactate than wildtype controls and rely more on FAO to meet their bioenergetic requirements. For the first time, we demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation an interaction between TSPO and the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, CPT1a, providing a possible mechanism through which TSPO may regulate FAO. We showed here that loss of TSPO expression does not restrict the metabolic response of astrocytes to an inflammatory stimulus, nor alter the expression of key metabolic proteins in response to inflammation, but may alter the temporal profile of the astrocyte inflammatory response.</p><sec id="S32"><title>TSPO as a regulator of astrocyte metabolism</title><p id="P57">In other glial and non-glial cells, TSPO deficiency has been linked to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In line with these studies, we found that TSPO deficiency in astrocytes reduced basal mitochondrial metabolism and non-mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, in agreement with a recent study in microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we found that TSPO deficiency enhances the metabolic response in astrocytes following the injection of a supraphysiological glucose concentration during the glycolysis stress test. This may be interpreted as increased glycolytic rate in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs. During a nutrient deficit simulated by exposing the cells to a glucose-free condition for 1h, we found that TSPO-deficient astrocytes lacked the metabolic adaptations observed in TSPO-expressing controls. Moreover, we found that the bioenergetic rates of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes did not change significantly between glucose and glucose-free conditions, and TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes secreted significantly less L-lactate in the presence of glucose. This contrasts with a recent publication demonstrating that TSPO deficiency in microglia increases lactate production and glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. The difference between these findings may be due to fundamental differences in the metabolic machinery of astrocytes (which express relatively high amounts of CPT1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>) and microglia (which express less CPT1a than astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>) underlying the resulting metabolic profile. Regardless, our data show that the basal bioenergetic rates of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes are reduced relative to TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> controls. This may be because TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes metabolise less glucose to maintain their bioenergetic profiles, or that in these cells more products of glycolysis undergo oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p id="P58">As we did not directly quantify pyruvate production in these cells our L-lactate data alone cannot inform us whether TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs oxidise a greater amount of lactate than wildtype controls. Because mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism consumes oxygen, one may therefore anticipate that enhanced mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism would elicit a concomitant increase in OCR. However, when exogenous glucose was unavailable as a substrate, we saw no significant increase in the OCR of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, we are confident that the decrease in L-lactate secreted by TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes relative to TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> controls indicates that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes are less dependent on glucose to meet their bioenergetic requirements. Furthermore, removal of glucose from the media resulted in no change in lactate secretion, OCR or ECAR in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes. This suggests that loss of TSPO may enhance the metabolic flexibility of astrocytes, potentially facilitating metabolism of other fuel sources even when glucose is available as a metabolic substrate. Therefore, we speculated that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes may have been better able to utilise alternative metabolic substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Regulation of FAO in astrocytes by TSPO</title><p id="P59">TSPO has previously been linked to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

By transiently inducing overexpression of a tagged TSPO construct in our astrocytoma lines, we were able to demonstrate that the tagged variant not only interacts with VDAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) – as predicted – but also with CPT1a. We were then able to recapitulate this finding in U373 cells using endogenous TSPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), demonstrating that this interaction was not a result of genetically manipulating these cells. Unfortunately, we were unable to successfully repeat this using MPAs due to technical issues related to the cellular biomass required.

We propose that this interaction is a mechanism by which TSPO regulates FAO in astrocytes. Overall, our data interrogating the role of TSPO in regulating astrocyte metabolism suggests that TSPO deficiency promotes FAO.

However, both microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and astrocytes express HK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, therefore it is likely that the TSPO-HK2 interaction may also be conserved in astrocytes. While we did not explore a potential interaction of TSPO with HK2 in astrocytes, this remains an intriguing avenue for future study. TSPO and HK2 have both been reported to interact with VDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, thus existence of a dynamic TSPO-HK2-CPT1a-VDAC multimer in astrocytes remains plausible. Because metabolic pathways do not exist in isolation, and multiple pathways are used simultaneously to meet the cellular bioenergetic requirements it is plausible that TSPO acts at the interface of CPT1a and HK2 to regulate the balance between glycolysis and FAO.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Loss of TSPO and the astrocyte metabolic response to inflammation</title><p id="P62">In a pathophysiological context, increased use of FAO has been linked to an anti-inflammatory (‘A2’)-like phenotype in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. In our data, when mitochondrial stress responses were assessed during the FAO paradigm using the uncoupling agent FCCP – to mimic the oxidative stress that might be seen in disease states – we found that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes used more FAO to fuel their response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C,F</xref>). This suggests that the bioenergetic response of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs to inflammatory stimulation may be modulated by enhanced FAO. However, we found that the bioenergetic phenotype of LPS stimulated TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs was not significantly different from TSPO<sup>+/+</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>), suggesting that the basal metabolic response of these cells to inflammatory stimuli is not modulated by the absence of TSPO, at least using LPS as an inflammatory stimulus. We did not measure FAO following LPS stimulation, so we cannot provide further comment on whether enhanced FAO in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs modulates the bioenergetic response. Despite this, we have presented data suggesting an altered temporal release profile of TNF from TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> MPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), though we only examined one concentration of one inflammatory stimulus at two timepoints. A cytokine array panel may provide valuable insight into potential modulatory effects of TSPO expression on the release of a wider range of cytokines. This could be paired with a greater variety of inflammatory stimuli, concentrations and timepoints to provide a more holistic insight. The underlying mechanism may be addressed by interrogating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics: TSPO has been linked to calcium signalling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> <italic>in vitro</italic>, and tanycytes <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, which may hint at a potential underlying mechanism distinct from a shift in the metabolic phenotype in astrocytes. Future studies could further interrogate the mechanism by which TSPO regulates the reactive phenotype of astrocytes, perhaps via transcriptomic arrays, which we did not examine in this study so cannot provide comment on. This could be paired with a metabolomics array to better elucidate any differences in substrate utilisation following ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’ proinflammatory stimulation of TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes.</p><p id="P63">Although it is appreciated that pharmacological inhibition of a protein may have different impacts than genetic deletion, our data demonstrating a role for TSPO in regulating astrocyte metabolism and potentially impacting the release of TNF from astrocytes may have implications when considering glial TSPO as a therapeutic target. Firstly, astrocytes are commonly thought to ‘feed’ neurons lactate for downstream metabolism as part of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, and we have reported that TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes produce less lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), implying that these astrocytes may be less able to provide trophic support to neurons as has been speculated elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Thus, we can speculate that prolonged pharmacological inhibition of astrocyte TSPO may result in an impaired ability of astrocytes to sufficiently support neuronal metabolism for prolonged periods. Given recent evidence for the role of astrocytes in regulating memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and other behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, and the crucial role of astrocyte CPT1a in cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, prolonged inhibition of astrocyte TSPO may yield detrimental effects on cognitive and other neural functions which may need to be further investigated. Secondly, astrocytes are highly plastic cells intrinsically involved with the maintenance of the brain microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Perturbations to the ability of astrocytes to respond to noxious stimuli, including by modulating their metabolism – such as chronic neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> – may in turn impair the ability of these cells to resolve inflammation and restore homeostasis. While this impaired metabolic response to LPS-induced inflammation was not observed in our studies, we only looked at one inflammatory stimulus at one concentration, so additional comprehensive studies are required. TSPO may serve as an attractive therapeutic target due to the proposed anti-inflammatory effects of its ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. If TSPO indeed functions as a regulator of metabolic flexibility in astrocytes, continuous pharmacological inhibition of TSPO function in these cells may blunt their ability to respond to inflammatory and other stimuli when chronically administered.

Together these data suggest that TSPO deficient astrocytes are less reliant on glucose to meet their energetic needs. Crucially, we have shown that the rate of FAO is increased in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes and that, when present, TSPO forms a complex with CPT1a, reinforcing this concept. This suggests that TSPO may ordinarily inhibit CPT1a function to conserve intracellular fat stores. Taken together, these data show that TSPO may act as a regulator of metabolic flexibility in astrocytes. Finally, we have shown that despite increases in basal FAO, the metabolic response to LPS stimulation is not impeded in TSPO<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes, though the release profile of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is altered.
