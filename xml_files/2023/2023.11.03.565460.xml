Sequencing approaches have shown that aberrant RNA species may be present during infection, and that they can vary in size, segment origin, and sequence. Moreover, a subset of aberrant RNA molecules can bind and activate host pathogen receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), leading to innate immune signaling and the expression of type I and III interferons. Understanding the kinetics and distribution of these immunostimulatory aberrant RNA sequences is important for understanding their function in IAV infection. Here, we use an amplification-free LbuCas13a-based detection method to quantify mvRNA amplification dynamics and subcellular distributions. We show that our assay can quantify the copy numbers of specific mvRNA sequences in infected tissue culture cells, ferret upper and lower respiratory tract tissue infected with two different pandemic H1N1 IAV strains, or clinical nasopharyngeal swab extracts of hospitalized patients infected with seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 strains. In addition, we find dynamic differences between immunostimulatory and non-immunostimulatory mvRNAs, as well as among mvRNAs derived from different segments, during IAV infection. Overall, our results reveal a hitherto hidden diversity in the behavior of IAV mvRNAs and suggest that individual aberrant RNAs are not produced stochastically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>mini viral RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>Cas13</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>innate immune</kwd><kwd>RIG-I</kwd><kwd>t-loop</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause a mild to severe respiratory disease in humans, depending on the viral strain and activation of the innate immune response. Upon infection, IAV releases eight segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA that are organized into viral nucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. Each vRNP complex consists of a viral RNA (vRNA) that is bound by a helical coil of nucleoproteins (NP) and a copy of the RNA-dependent viral RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). During replication, the IAV RNA polymerase can produce a wide variety of aberrant RNA products including defective viral genomes (DVG) and mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), which contain the conserved termini of the viral genome segments but lack internal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). It is currently assumed that the internal deletions are the result of an intramolecular copy-choice recombination event that involves pausing of the RNA polymerase at an unknown signal and realignment of the nascent RNA to a complementary sequence downstream. Deletion of an internal sequence, results in the formation of a unique junction sequence relative to the full-length viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Some of these aberrant RNAs have been shown to bind and activate retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), leading to downstream innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The production of aberrant RNAs plays a still poorly understood role in viral pathogenicity and the outcome of influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In the case of mvRNAs, their abundance was associated with the appearance of disease markers in mouse and ferret infections with highly pathogenic IAV strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). However, not all aberrant RNA molecules are able to induce an innate immune response. In IAV, as well as other negative sense RNA viruses, sequence-specific preferences for RIG-I binding and activation have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). For IAV, we recently showed that mvRNAs containing a template loop (t-loop), a transient RNA structure that can affect RNA polymerase processivity, are more potent inducers of the innate immune response than mvRNAs without a t-loop in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), although the sensitivity to t-loops is IAV RNA polymerase-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Given the large variety of aberrant RNA sequences produced during IAV infection and the specific effects of different sequences, it is becoming more important to carefully study the kinetics and impact of individual aberrant RNA sequences during infection.</p><p id="P4">Current tools to detect and quantify aberrant RNAs, such as mvRNAs, include primer extension, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and next generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). To complement the above assays and perform aberrant viral RNA quantification without RT and PCR-based amplification, we explored the use of Cas13, an RNA-guided nuclease, for the direct, amplification-free detection and quantification of aberrant IAV RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Cas13 uses a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that consists of a direct repeat region, which is specific to the Cas13 ortholog, and a spacer region, which is designed to be complementary to the target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). When CRISPR-Cas13 binds to the target RNA, the nuclease activity of Cas13 is activated. Cas13 can subsequently cleave the target, a process that is called <italic>cis</italic>-cleavage, as well as any nearby single-stranded RNA molecules, a process called trans-cleavage or collateral cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The trans-activity can be measured with a reporter RNA molecule containing a fluorophore and a quencher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), making Cas13 suitable for a wide-range of applications, including the detection of genomic viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Additionally, the measured fluorescent signal is proportional to the amount of target RNA present in a sample and the exact number of target RNA molecules present in a reaction can be calculated using a standard curve specific for the target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we used amplification-free, a Cas13-based detection method to quantify the expression levels for 10 mvRNAs derived from five different IAV segments. We chose to perform this comparison on mvRNAs, which, because their short length (approx. 56-125 nt), facilitated chemical RNA synthesis and thus the possibility to use a well-defined input that could be used to validate and compare assays. We designed our crRNA such that it targeted the unique junction sequence formed upon mvRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>) to differentiate mvRNAs from genomic RNA and different mvRNAs from each other. We tested our assays using total RNA from cell culture, animal tissue, or clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, and were able to detect mvRNAs in all sample types. Moreover, we observe kinetic and subcellular distribution differences between immunostimulatory and non-immunostimulatory mvRNAs, as well as mvRNAs derived from different segments. With one exemption, these differences correlate with a previously identified RNA structure that modulates IAV RNA polymerase activity, a so-called template loop (t-loop). These results provide new insight into the diversity and behavior of small, aberrant viral RNAs that are produced during IAV infection in cell culture, ferrets, and humans.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Amplification of mvRNAs by RT and PCR introduces errors</title><p id="P6">Different detection methods can be used to quantify IAV aberrant RNA species, but their errors have not previously been compared directly for mvRNAs. To gain insight into the errors generated by these methods, we compared the ability of RT and PCR to quantify known, chemically synthesized mvRNA sequences. Using two mvRNAs of the same length, but a different internal sequence, we observed a lack of consistency in the ability of three different RT and PCR enzyme combinations to produce a single amplification product (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Additionally, the different RT and PCR enzyme combinations amplified the mvRNAs to different levels even though a fixed amount of the synthetic mvRNAs was provided as input (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, S1B</xref>). Thus, while primer extension, PCR, and next generation sequencing are powerful methods to visualize or discover aberrant IAV RNAs, their use as quantification methods appears limited by the enzymes used for the conversion or amplification of different mvRNA sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LbuCas13a can be used to detect and quantify mvRNAs without amplification</title><p id="P7">Cas13 can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA without (isothermal) amplification and T7 transcription steps when the genome is targeted by multiple guides. As only one unique junction is available in mvRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), the previously described approach is not feasible for IAV aberrant RNA molecules. However, Cas13 orthologs have variable amounts of <italic>trans</italic>-cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and this activity can be used to generate additional signal. To determine if Cas13 could be used to detect mvRNAs junctions without the previously described amplification and T7 transcription steps, we compared the ability of two Cas13 orthologs, LbuCas13a and LwaCas13a. First, we compared the activity of the two enzymes in their ability to detect human 5S rRNA in a dilution series of total RNA extracted from HEK293T cells. We observed that LbuCas13a was able to detect 5S rRNA with as little as 0.025 ng of total RNA input, whereas LwaCas13 only produced a signal above background when incubated with 10 ng of total RNA input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next investigated whether LbuCas13a could detect a previously described abundant control mvRNA derived on segment 5 (NP71.6). To detect NP71.6, we designed a crRNA with a spacer sequence complementary to the unique junction sequence relative to the full-length segment 5 vRNA. We subsequently diluted chemically synthesized NP71.6 in water or 100 ng of total HEK293T RNA and found that we were able to detect the mvRNA with a limit of detection &lt;10<sup>6</sup> copies (Table S2), irrespective of the background used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). No fluorescent signal was observed in the absence of synthetic NP71.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We subsequently explored whether we could use LbuCas13a to quantify unknown amounts of NP71.6 in total RNA extracted from HEK293T cells expressing the IAV mini-genome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In this assay, plasmids expressing the three IAV RNA polymerase subunits via an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter and the NP71.6 mvRNA via Pol I promoter were transfected into HEK293T cells. Total RNA was extracted 48-hours post transfection. To investigate our ability to determine the mvRNA level in HEK293T cells, we first made a 5-fold dilution series of chemically synthesized NP71.6 in total RNA from untransfected HEK293T cells. This dilution series was our standard curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Next, we calculated the maximum slope of the fluorescent Cas13 signal for each point of the standard curve, plotted the maximum slope against the known synthetic mvRNA concentrations, and fitted the resulting distribution to the Michaelis-Menten equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Next, the Cas13 signal of the transfected HEK293T RNA was determined and the fitted standard curve data used to convert the fluorescent signal of the transfected HEK293T cells into mvRNA copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, we showed that RT-PCR detection methods can introduce mvRNA amplification biases. To reduce this bias and detect mvRNAs using RT-qPCR in a sequence-specific manner, similar to our Cas13 assay, we introduced a TaqMan probe that was specific for the junction in the NP71.6 mvRNA. When we next compared the quantification obtained using LbuCas13a to the results obtained using primer extension or a two-step TaqMan-based RT-qPCR, we observed indeed that our CRISPR-based detection method yielded no significantly different results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). A similar result was obtained when we expressed the NP71.6 mvRNA in the presence of an inactive IAV RNA polymerase to measure RNA polymerase I (PolI)- derived input levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Consequently, for a single, well-defined IAV mvRNA the RT-qPCR and Cas13 assays yield comparable results. However, in infection experiments, the mvRNA diversity is relatively large, making it more likely that sequence-based biases arise when amplification steps are used for mvRNA detection. We therefore decided to continue our analysis with the amplification-free Cas13 assay only.</p><p id="P10">We subsequently investigated whether LbuCas13a was able to detect a specific mvRNA sequence during IAV infection. To increase the likelihood of detection, we designed a crRNA complementary to a 61 nt-long, highly abundant mvRNA derived from segment 5 (NP-61), which we had previously identified in ferret lung tissues infected with A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) and A549 cells infected with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (abbreviated as WSN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, LbuCas13a successfully detected synthetic NP-61 as well as NP-61 expressed during WSN infection of A549 cells in total RNA. No signal was detected in our water and mock infection controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Taken together, the above results indicate that LbuCas13 can detect a specific mvRNA sequence in well-defined samples similar to primer extension and RT-qPCR, and that it can detect a specific mvRNA sequence in a complex RNA sample without sequence-specific biases that are potentially associated with RT and PCR steps, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A and S1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>mvRNAs can be detected from 3 hours post infection and accumulate over time</title><p id="P11">We previously identified many hundreds of different mvRNA sequences using next generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We and others have proposed that DVGs and mvRNAs are generated through an error-prone mechanism, suggesting that their expression is stochastic. To investigate this hypothesis, we next sought to quantify different mvRNAs produced over the course of IAV infections and study their kinetics. We therefore focused on four sets of two mvRNA sequences derived from IAV segment 2, 3, 4 and 8 (encoding viral proteins PB1, PA, HA, and NS), covering the spectrum of genome segment sizes, segment-specific kinetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and segment-specific unique mvRNA counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Moreover, for each segment, we selected one mvRNA with a t-loop, making it likely that their amplification was reduced and ability to activate the innate immune response increased, and one mvRNA without a t-loop, increasing the likelihood that these mvRNAs were amplified quickly and not able to activate the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, colored red or blue, respectively). We cloned these eight mvRNAs into PolI-driven expression plasmids and confirmed their ability or inability to activate innate immune signaling by transfecting the plasmids in HEK293T cells alongside constructs expressing the IAV RNA polymerase subunits, a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase transfection control, and a luciferase based IFNβ reporter. Measurement of the luciferase signal showed that two mvRNAs, derived from segment 1 and 2 (PB1-66 and PA-66, respectively) were strong inducers of IFN-β promoter activity, while the other six mvRNAs were relatively weak or non-inducers (i.e., PB1-64, PA-60, HA-61, HA-64, NS-56 and NS-80) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next designed crRNAs specific for the junction in each mvRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>) and used these crRNAs together with synthetic RNA standard curves to quantify the number of mvRNA copies present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Using the luciferase reporter data and the number of mvRNA copies identified, we were able to calculate the potential of each mvRNA to trigger an innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We observed that per segment, one mvRNA had a strong potential to induce IFNPβ promoter activity, while the other mvRNA had a weak potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). With one exception (the NS segment), mvRNAs that had a higher copy number tended to have a lower potential to activate the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), which is generally in line with our previous observation on t-loop containing mvRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The presence of a clear exception on the t-loop model suggests that at least one other, still undiscovered, mechanism must exist through which mvRNAs can activate the innate immune signaling.</p><p id="P13">Following the transfection-based characterization of the different mvRNAs and confirming our ability to detect them without amplification, we next measured the kinetics of the eight mvRNAs over a synchronized, 12-hour infection of A549 cells with WSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). We observed that mvRNAs PA-60, PA-66, PB1-64, PB1-66 were detectable in A549 cells as early as 3 hours post infection (hpi) and that their copy number increased steadily over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). At 9 hpi, the PA-60 signal reached saturation, whereas the PA-66, PB1-64, PB1-66 signals did not reach this level in three biological repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast, mvRNAs HA-61 and NS-56 were undetectable until 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>) and both HA-64 and NS-80 remained undetectable over the course of the 12-hour infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 E, F</xref>). In addition, we observed that three of the mvRNAs with a lower potential to activate the innate immune response (PA-60, PB1-64, and HA-61) were more abundant compared to mvRNAs of the same segment that had a stronger potential to activate the innate immune response (PA-66, PB1-66, and HA-64). Comparing the accumulation kinetics of the PB1 mvRNAs to the full-length segment 2, 5 and 6 kinetics, we found that the mvRNA accumulation followed the trend of the full-length vRNA segments, and not that of the mRNAs of the segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PA-60 and PA-66 have different distributions in infected cells</title><p id="P14">We next sought to compare the subcellular distribution of the PA-60 and PA-66 mvRNA pair over the course of an 8-hour IAV infection. To this end, we performed synchronized infections of A549 cells with WSN and fractionated cells at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). During the fractionation process, the volumes were maintained constant to make sure that protein samples could be compared directly to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). However, in constant volumes, different fractions have different RNA (background) levels and adsorption levels to the plastics used. To ensure that the LbuCas13a-based reactions for the standard curve (diluted in HEK293T RNA) and the fractionated samples were performed in a similar RNA environment, we normalized the RNA input for each fraction to 75 ng and subsequently analyzed the mvRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>, we were not able to detect mvRNAs before 4 hpi in the whole cell extract, similar to the infection time course described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. From 4 hpi, the PA-60 and PA- 66 levels started to increase, with PA-60 showing accumulated more quickly than PA-66. The production of PA-60 and PA-66 followed the detection of PB1 in the nucleus 3 hpi. At 7 hpi, both mvRNAs started to reach the upper limit of our detection assay in nearly all biological repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In the subcellular fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), we found that PA-60 became first detectable in the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions at 4 hpi. The PA-60 cytoplasmic mvRNA levels remained undetectable until 6 hpi and then rose quickly. At 6 and 7 hpi, the PA-60 nuclear and mitochondrial levels started to the upper detection limit of our assay. The PA-66 mvRNA was slower to accumulate and became first detectable in the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions 5 hpi. At 7 hpi, the PA-66 mvRNA levels became measurable in the cytoplasm and then rose, reaching the upper limit of detection 7 hpi. The PA-66 mitochondrial levels also increased quickly, reaching the upper limit of detection at the same time as the PA-66 cytoplasmic levels. In contrast, the PA-66 nuclear levels deviated from this trend and accumulated only marginally during the course of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To compare the different fractions directly to each other, we corrected the measured LbuCas13a signal for the RNA input adjustment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and plotted the distribution of the two mvRNAs as a fraction of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, both PA-60 and PA-66 were initially enriched in the mitochondrial fraction. This enrichment then declined for both mvRNAs over the course of the infection. At 8 hpi, PA-60 reached an equal distribution among the three subcellular compartments. However, PA-66 became more enriched in the cytoplasm and only ~10% of the total signal was found in the nucleus at 8 hpi. This enrichment of PA-66 in the cytoplasm may contribute to the slower accumulation of PA-66 overall, as less PA-66 would be associated with active replication complexes. In addition, the enrichment of PA-66 in the cytoplasm increased its likelihood for detection by cytoplasmic pathogen receptors, such as RIG-I, and thereby its potential for activating the immune response. The enrichment of an immunostimulatory mvRNA in the cytoplasm is also in line with previous data showing that mvRNA templates that activate innate immune signaling become differentially enriched in the cytoplasm over the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>LbuCas13a can detect mvRNAs in RNA extracted from ferret lungs</title><p id="P18">We had previously shown that mvRNAs can be detected in mouse and ferret lung samples using RT-PCR and next generation sequencing.

However, based on our previous deep-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), we found that NP-61 was also produced by the pandemic A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) and highly pathogenic avian A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) isolates. We therefore next measured the relative abundance of the NP-61 mvRNA in ferret lung and nasal turbinate homogenates infected with these two strains. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>, not only were we able to detect NP-61, but we also observed differences in abundance and tissue distribution between the two IAV strains. In line with being an upper respiratory tract virus, the pandemic 2009 IAV strain produced higher NP-61 levels in the nasal turbinates compared to the lungs, whereas avian H5N1 produced equal levels in both parts of the respiratory tract.</p><p id="P20">We next investigated whether we could also detect PA-60 and PA-66 in the lung tissue, as this is where the impact of innate immune activation is most severe and linked to the cytokine storm. Previous sequence analyses had shown that these two mvRNAs are only produced by H1N1 IAV strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, both mvRNAs were clearly detectable on day 1 post infection in lungs infected with pandemic A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1). Interestingly, the PA- 60 mvRNA copy number varied more widely than the more immunogenic PA-66 copy number. On day 3, both mvRNAs had dropped in copy number and were only detectable in some samples. In line with our tissue culture analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), we found that the PA-60 copy number was on average higher than the PA-66 mvRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), but the biological variation among the four ferrets tested was too high for a significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>LbuCas13a can detect mvRNAs in RNA extracted from clinical swabs</title><p id="P21">We next investigated whether we could detect mvRNAs in RNA extracted from IAV positive clinical nasopharyngeal swabs. The clinical samples obtained were either positive for seasonal H1N1 or H3N2, and not co-infected with other respiratory pathogens, as determined by clinical RT-qPCR. We first confirmed that we could detect mvRNAs in clinical samples using a RT-PCR and found signals corresponding to the expected size in 6 of 10 IAV positive clinical samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Next, we tested our LbuCas13a assay, using the mvRNA NP-61 mvRNA crRNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, we observed positive signals above our limit of detection for 29 of the 30 clinical samples tested. We next used our synthetic NP-61 mvRNA standard curve to calculate the number of NP-61 copies per μl of extracted clinical sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Further analysis showed that the NP-61 copy numbers were not correlated with the amount of RNA input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), the reported clinical RT-qPCR Ct value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), or patient age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Interestingly, a weak significant difference was observed among the H1N1 samples with respect to the reported patient’s sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Overall, these findings show that mvRNAs can be detected and quantified in a wide range of samples, including influenza virus positive clinical samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">During IAV infection, aberrant RNA molecules of various lengths and sequences are produced. A subset of these molecules can activate the innate immune response, making them important targets for in-depth characterization. We observed that routinely used RNA quantification methods were sensitive to the mvRNA sequence and failed to faithfully represent mvRNA levels, often creating addition aberrant signals. We therefore explored the RNA-guided enzyme Cas13 as an additional tool to quantify mvRNAs levels in cell culture, animal model, and patient samples.</p><p id="P23">We first showed that the LbuCas13a ortholog can detect and quantify mvRNAs with a higher sensitivity than primer extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and that the LbuCas13a reaction can avoid errors or biases introduced by RT-PCR-based amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), because it can detect mvRNAs in an amplification-free manner. In a sample containing a single mvRNA expressed in cells and amplified by the IAV RNA polymerase, LbuCas13 quantifications yielded results that were not significantly different from the primer extension assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This result was expected, as any additional aberrant products produced by the IAV RNA polymerase in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) were excluded in the PAGE-based size selection that underlies the primer extension analysis. Similarly, the TaqMan-based RT-qPCR produced results that were not significantly different from the Cas13-based assay, because the TaqMan probe hybridized to the mvRNA junction similar to the crRNA of Cas13 and thus also excluded any aberrant PCR product that did not include the junction. So, while LbuCas13 is suitable for measuring mvRNA levels with minimal processing and can generate results in a short time with just a plate reader, for samples where RNA levels are low a TaqMan-based RT-qPCR assay may present an alternative. However, when complex mvRNA samples need to be analyzed, which effectively includes all infection experiments, the RT and PCR steps of the TaqMan-based RT-qPCR may introduce unknown, sequence-specific amplification biases that make direct comparisons between mvRNAs in the samples impossible.</p><p id="P24">Using LbuCas13a, we quantified mvRNAs derived from five different IAV segments in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), WSN-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1 infected ferret lung and nasal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), and seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 infected clinical samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In the tissue culture experiments, we observed that mvRNA dynamics vary among different mvRNA sequences and that they accumulate over the course of infection, similar to the full-length vRNA segments. In agreement with previously published data, we also showed that mvRNAs with a potential to induce a stronger innate immune response are less abundant than mvRNAs that induce a weaker innate immune response for the four segments we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). For all but one segment, data also reproduce the finding that mvRNA abundance does not necessarily correlate with innate immune activation and does correlate with the presence of a t-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The exception is the NS segment, whose two mvRNAs do not follow the previous model, suggesting that other mechanisms of innate immune activation by IAV mvRNAs remain to be discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, two of the cloned mvRNAs, which had originally been identified through RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), were not detected in A549 cell infections. Presently, it is unclear if these mvRNAs are of exceptionally low abundance and stay below the detection limit, or if these sequences were artifacts of the RT-PCR steps used to make the sequencing library. To address this question and obtain a better estimate of the misidentified mvRNA sequences in the future, a high-throughput, multiplexed version of our assay must be developed and combined with a systematic analysis of all identified (and potentially unknown) mvRNA sequences. These observations are likely also important for studies of DVG sequences, which also rely on RT-PCR-based sequencing libraries to study sequence variations or identify DVG junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P25">By examining one immunostimulatory and non-stimulatory mvRNAs derived from segment 3 (PA-66 and PA-60) in more detail, dynamics in their subcellular distribution and accumulation were revealed. We observed that while both stimulatory and non-stimulatory mvRNAs appear in mitochondria early in infection, the immunostimulatory mvRNA then accumulates in the cytoplasm whereas the non-stimulatory mvRNA becomes evenly distributed over the nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B, C</xref>). Presently, the mechanism underlying these different distributions is unknown, but the observation agrees with previous analyses of transfected mvRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and may help explain why the immunostimulatory mvRNA is able to activate the innate immune response better. Whether host or viral factor determine mvRNA export from the nucleus or their distribution across the cell is currently not known. Given the early presence of both mvRNAs in the mitochondrial fraction, it is surprising that we did not observe a strong innate immune response in the presence of both mvRNAs. It is possible that low mvRNA levels are insufficient to activate the innate immune response and that higher mvRNA levels are needed to overcome the negative feedback loops that prevent RIG-I from activating the MAVS-dependent signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Alternatively, mvRNAs associated with the mitochondrial fraction may present species that cannot activate innate immune signaling or that may inhibit innate immune activation through a yet to be discovered process.</p><p id="P26">Finally, we showed that the difference in abundance between the segment 3 immunostimulatory and non-stimulatory mvRNAs is also present in ferret lungs one day after infection with recombinant 1918 pandemic H1N1 IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). In addition, we were able to measure the copy number of a highly abundant mvRNA in clinical samples that were positive for H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal IAV RNA, demonstrating that our assay works for many different IAV strains and for many different sample types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). However, despite detection of this mvRNA in these clinical samples, we are not able to establish any correlations between mvRNA copy number and clinical Ct value, amount of input material, or patient age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We expect that any correlations were confounded by unknown clinical factors, as well as when patients were tested in the course of their infection, their immune status, sampling differences, and environmental factors. Interestingly, a weak statistical significance was observed between patient sex and mvRNA levels in IAV H1N1 infected patients. Further clinical research will need to be performed to investigate the importance of this difference.</p><p id="P27">In summary, understanding the dynamics of IAV aberrant RNAs during infection is important because various lines of research have shown that these RNAs can play a role in the outcome of infection. Here we used Cas13 to quantify and characterize 10 different IAV mvRNAs in detail and identify differences in their dynamics and distribution. While our assay is limited in scope due to its limited multiplexing capabilities, it reveals a fascinating, hidden diversity among IAV aberrant RNA molecules, and we hope that our results will stimulate a more in-depth, dynamic characterization of these molecules in order to better understand their role in the outcome of disease.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Preparation of synthetic RNA and primers</title><p id="P28">Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and resuspended in nuclease-free water to 100 μM.
