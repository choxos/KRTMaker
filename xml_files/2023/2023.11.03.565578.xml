The mosquito immune response determines virus transmission, yet, insight into the transcriptional regulation of mosquito immunity remains limited. In this study, we optimized the nascent RNA-sequencing method Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells. PRO-seq enabled profiling the distribution of active RNA polymerases across the mosquito genome at nucleotide precision and identified the exact transcription start nucleotides (TSN) of expressed genes. Based on exact positioning of the TSN, we uncovered core promoter elements, including the Initiator and Downstream Promoter Elements. Notably, RNA polymerase accumulates at the promoter-proximal region of genes, but transcribes into the divergent region to a lesser extent than in vertebrates. To investigate rapid and dynamic immune responses, Aag2 cells were immune-stimulated with heat-inactivated <italic>E. coli</italic> for 1 and 4 hours. Differential gene expression analysis revealed different groups of genes to be induced over time. While Clip domain serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides were induced promptly and sustained, a delayed stress response consisting of heat shock-related genes was only seen at 4 hours after stimulation. Strikingly, gene sets with different temporal expression profiles were associated with distinct transcription factor binding motifs. Altogether, our study provides valuable insights into the functional genomics of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and indicates that even within a rapid response, different dynamics emerge, potentially regulated by distinct transcription factors. These insights are crucial to gain a better understanding of the mosquito immune response and its regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hematophagous insects, in particular mosquitoes, are important biological vectors for the transmission of arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses. Emerging and re-emerging epidemic arboviruses including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya pose a significant threat to global health with currently about half of the human population living at risk of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Epidemic arboviruses rely on transmission by mosquitoes from the <italic>Aedes</italic> genus, primarily <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. This urban-adapted mosquito species originated from Africa, but, due to increased global trade and travel, is now endemic in tropical and subtropical regions all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Arbovirus transmission from mosquito to humans requires active infection of mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Mosquito-intrinsic factors, including stress responses and antiviral immune defense control virus replication and therefore determine the efficiency of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Importantly, besides arboviruses, mosquitoes are naturally infected with environmental microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and insect-specific viruses that interact within the insect in a mutualistic or pathogenic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). This results in an intriguing triangular interaction of the mosquito host, environmental microbes and human-pathogenic viruses, that can directly or indirectly impact arbovirus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It is therefore critical to obtain a holistic view of mosquito host responses to various microbes.</p><p id="P4">A critical cornerstone of mosquito host responses are inducible immune pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Particularly, two nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-related pathways, <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>Immune deficiency</italic> (Imd), and the <italic>Janus kinase and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription</italic> (JAK-STAT) pathway, have been implicated in mosquito immune responses to various microbial challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Generally, inducible immune pathways are triggered upon recognition of foreign molecular signatures, which will activate an intracellular signaling cascade to induce distinct gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In insects, transcriptional responses to bacterial and fungal infection through the Toll and IMD pathways induce the expression of distinct classes of antimicrobial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Moreover, these NF-κB related pathways, in addition to the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, have been recognized as part of the antiviral defense, although it remains unclear how changes in gene expression programs eventually confer immunity against virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Transcriptional responses to pathogen infections rely on interplay of distinct molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Importantly, immune responses are highly dynamic and involve both <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements encoded in the DNA as well as <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that ensure coordinated regulation of chromatin and transcriptional reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, the annotation of regulatory elements such as promotors and enhancers in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome is largely missing, preventing a comprehensive characterization of transcriptional kinetics and the underlying mechanisms that govern immune responses. Moreover, we currently lack experimental tools to capture dynamic changes in gene expression in mosquitoes. Investigating molecular mechanisms that coordinate such dynamic transcriptional responses have been enabled by development of nascent RNA sequencing techniques. In contrast to conventional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods that measure steady-state transcript levels, these techniques track the process of RNA synthesis and measure the levels of newly synthetized RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Nascent RNA sequencing therefore detects both stable and unstable RNA species and quantifies dynamic changes of gene expression at high resolution and sensitivity. Different nascent RNA sequencing techniques have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>); amongst which Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). In PRO-seq, RNA polymerase incorporates a single biotinylated nucleotide (nt) to the active site of transcription (the 3’-end of a nascent transcript), after which it stalls due to steric hindrance of the biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Streptavidin-mediated purification of these labeled transcripts enables selective enrichment of nascent RNAs and provides a genome-wide snapshot of positions and orientations of engaged RNA Polymerases at nucleotide precision. Apart from the highly sensitive and dynamic quantification of nascent RNA synthesis, PRO-seq has proven to be a powerful approach to identify the precise transcription start sites (TSS), termed here Transcription Start Nucleotides (TSN, +1-nt).</p><p id="P6">Here, we adapted PRO-seq for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> cells to unveil dynamic host responses to immune challenges and identify regulatory mechanisms that underlie rapid changes in gene expression. Profiting from the data richness of PRO-seq, we improved the TSS annotation of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome with the precise TSNs, which enabled us to identify functional regions across the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome, and gene sets under control of different core promotor elements such as Initiator, TATA box and Downstream Promoter Elements. Making use of this improved functional genome annotation, we performed differential gene expression analysis at two early timepoints after bacterial stimulation of mosquito cells. We observed hundreds of differentially expressed genes and identified different kinetics of gene expression after the immune challenge. Strikingly, genes with differential dynamics also show differential enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs, indicating that distinct transcriptional regulators coordinate temporal patterns of gene expression upon immune challenge. In conclusion, tracking engaged RNA polymerase molecules at nucleotide-resolution uncovered <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements, functional genomic regions, and mechanisms that underlie transcriptional responses upon immune challenge of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P7">The C3PC12 clone of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) was cultured at 28°C in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with filter-sterilized and heat inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 50 U/ml Penicillin (Invitrogen), 50 µg/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1x non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 2% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma).

Strikingly, in both scenarios, the 5’ peaks from PRO-seq data coincided with a strong accumulation of downstream RNA-sequencing reads and the Initiator (Inr) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), which is reported to occur exactly on the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). These findings support that TSN calling by PRO-seq strongly outperforms the currently available gene annotation. We therefore systematically called and analyzed TSNs based on the PRO-seq 5’ nt data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). In this way, almost 40% of all mosquito transcription start sites could be pinpointed to an exact TSN. For each of these, we calculated the distance between the currently annotated TSS position and the exact called TSN, showing an overall downstream shift, with an average deviation of 55 nt and a median deviation of 27 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). To validate the TSN positioning, we next analyzed the presence of core promoter elements in a 100-nt window around the TSS from either the current or the PRO-seq based TSN. For 12,881 genes with detectable PRO-seq read coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), we specifically analyzed the positioning of the TATA box, the Initiator motif and the downstream promoter element (DPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, upper panel). The TATA box has been reported to locate approximately 30 nt upstream of the gene start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, we only identified less than 300 promotors that contained a TATA box both in the vicinity of currently annotated TSSs and PRO-seq informed TSNs. Yet, only for the exact TSN, the TATA box motif was positioned around the expected 30 nt upstream of the transcription initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, left panel). Even more striking results were obtained when we analyzed the positioning of Inr motif and DPE. Based on the current gene annotation, both elements could be identified in close proximity of more than 2600 and 4000 TSSs, however, their distribution was near random and not enriched at the expected position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, middle and left panel). Using PRO-seq to call TSNs increased the number of identified promotor elements and showed strong positioning of the Inr and DPE elements at the expected distance relative to the TSN. Indeed, the central adenine nucleotide of the Inr motif occurred exactly at the TSN predicted by PRO-seq 5’ peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, middle panel).</p><p id="P27">To support these findings with an independent analysis, we generated sequence logos of the core promoter regions from all 12,881 TSNs that showed accumulation of a specific 5’ peak in our PRO-seq data. In parallel, we performed the same analysis for these genes considering the current TSS annotation. Strikingly, no sequence enrichment for the core promoter elements was observed based on current TSS annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, insert), while core promoters around TSNs called with PRO-seq show strong enrichment of the Inr motif and downstream DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The use of PRO-seq 5’ nt tracks therefore proves to be an accurate method to annotate the exact start site of transcription at nucleotide resolution. For any further analysis in this study, we have therefore used our improved TSN annotation.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Genome-wide analysis of RNA-polymerase distribution</title><p id="P28">We next analyzed the distribution of 3’ terminal nucleotides of PRO-seq reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>) to trace the position of active RNA polymerase. As expected, the majority of 3’ nt reads mapped to gene regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). Besides this, a considerable portion of almost 20% mapped to intergenic transposable elements, reflecting the high content of actively transcribed transposon sequences in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). About a quarter of PRO-seq reads could not be assigned to any currently defined genomic feature. Noteworthy, the fraction of these unassigned reads was reduced to about 5% when also attribution to the opposite genomic strand was permitted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>), suggesting antisense transcription occurs at genes and transposable elements.</p><p id="P29">We next analyzed the positioning of RNA polymerase over gene regions in more detail. In vertebrate cells, RNA polymerases strongly accumulate at the promotor-proximal region near the 5’ end of actively transcribed genes before entering productive elongation through the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). This behavior is visible by a prominent peak of PRO-seq 3’ terminal nucleotides just downstream of the TSS. Moreover, short divergent RNA transcripts accumulate upstream of the TSS, indicative of RNA polymerase engaging in non-productive transcription on the opposite DNA strand. At the 3’ end of genes an additional, often less pronounced peak is evident, reflecting the slowdown of RNA polymerases prior to transcription termination which includes transcript cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similar to vertebrates, RNA polymerase in mosquito cells most prominently accumulates in a promotor proximal window spanning nucleotides 100 nt downstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). More specifically, two main peaks around +30 nt and +50 nt are seen, which likely reflect the early and late pause site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Interestingly, however, only little divergent transcription upstream of the TSS is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the majority of promoters in the mosquito genome do not favor bi-directional initiation of RNA polymerase but are instead uni-directional, similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> but unlike vertebrate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Noteworthy, this is not a universal feature for all <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genes as for specific promoters, divergent transcripts are detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). Moreover, the accumulation of RNA polymerase near the 3’ end is not evident in mosquito cells, suggesting that transcription termination is not associated with a slowdown in RNA polymerase processivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We next aimed to comprehensively quantify the distribution of active RNA polymerases over the different parts of actively transcribed genes, from here on referred to as functional genomic regions. We divided <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genes into six distinct regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>): the promotor proximal region was defined as the genomic region 100 basepairs (bp) up- and downstream of the TSS. The window for divergent transcription was annotated further upstream reaching up to -750 bp. Downstream of the promotor proximal window we separately demarcated the first 1000 bp from the remainder of the gene body, approximately reflecting the first five nucleosomes which are important for the deposition of histone modifications at gene promotors. Finally, we defined the cleavage and polyadenylation window as 100 bp up- and downstream region flanking the cleavage and polyadenylation site (CPS) and the termination window up to 5000 bp downstream of the CPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) shows readily detectable levels of PRO-seq 3’ nt reads distribute over these functional genomic regions, while virtually no PRO-seq 3’ nt reads map to inactive genes that are silenced by repressive H3K9 trimethylation marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). By summing the PRO-seq 3’ nt reads per functional genomic region for all genes, we obtained a distribution of RNA polymerase over genes. As shown before, this distribution also showed little accumulation of RNA polymerase at divergent and CPS regions, and the highest fractions for gene bodies and promoter proximal regions, the latter confirming the RNA polymerase accumulation at the start of genes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Dynamic control of host responses to bacterial stimulation</title><p id="P31">The identification of critical gene regulatory elements and RNA polymerase distribution highlights the value of PRO-seq data for characterizing transcriptional regulation in non-model organisms. Next, we set out to compare the dynamic transcriptional regulation in mosquito cells upon immune challenge. To this end, we stimulated mosquito cells with heat-inactivated (HI) <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is known to result in robust induction of antimicrobial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We collected chromatin samples for PRO-seq at one and four hours post immune challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and PBS-treated cells were taken along as negative controls at both timepoints. To analyze differential gene expression, we quantified the number of normalized PRO-seq 3’ terminal nucleotides located within the gene body (including the +5 nucleosome window; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) as precise estimate of expression independent of polymerase stalling. As expected, bacterial stimulation triggered a robust transcriptional response at both analyzed timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Strikingly, the strongest transcriptional response occurred already one hour post stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas at four hours post stimulation the number of actively transcribed genes already started to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that at least part of the antimicrobial host response relies on a rapid, transient burst of transcription.</p><p id="P32">To characterize the functional differences within such a rapid response, we performed functional annotation clustering with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) on the differentially expressed genes. In this analysis, Uniprot Keywords, Gene Ontology terms and INTERPRO protein domains are integrated to extract non-redundant groups of genes that share common biological functions. At both timepoints, enrichment of a group with Clip domain serine protease (CLIP) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4K</xref>) and a group with antimicrobial peptides (AMP) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4L</xref>) is seen. However, also differences between the timepoints are apparent. For example, a group describing transferrins is only enriched at one hour post immune stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>). Also, serine protease inhibitors, described to play a role in negative feedback of CLIP protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), were only enriched at one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). Interestingly, at 4 hours post immune stimulus, a significant enrichment of genes associated with heat shock and endoplasmic reticulum stress was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4M</xref>), indicating a delayed stress response. These findings strongly suggest that even within rapid responses and narrow timeframes, functional and organizational differences emerge.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Temporal expression patterns are associated with distinct transcription factor motifs</title><p id="P33">After functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes, we aimed to identify potential differences in transcriptional regulation underlying such organization. To this end, we included all transcripts robustly upregulated (log2 fold change &gt; 1) at 1h or 4h for clustering analysis, revealing three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 consists of 96 transcripts that were robustly induced at one hour post infection but that showed no or little synthesis at the four hour timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, upper cluster), indicating a dynamic, short-lived transcriptional response. The 141 transcripts in cluster 2 were induced at one hour post bacterial stimulation and remained actively transcribed also four hours after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, middle cluster). Finally, cluster 3 consists of 27 transcript that showed a slower response with no or little induction at one hour but robust transcription four hour after bacterial stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, lower cluster).</p><p id="P34">To identify the regulators responsible for these distinct temporal expression patterns, we searched for known transcription factor (TF) binding motifs in a 1 kb window upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Strikingly, we observed enriched binding sites for multiple TFs, including the NF-κB-related Rel1/2 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), indicating that, as expected, transcriptional induction was regulated by Toll and/or Imd signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). In addition, we found enrichment of binding sites for multiple transcription factors of the AP-1 family and the GATA family group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of transcription factor binding motifs segregated with the temporal expression pattern of immune-responsive host transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Transcripts activated rapidly and sustained until four hours, exhibited a strong enrichment for the NF-κB Rel1/2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, transiently expressed transcripts that were quickly upregulated but no longer actively transcribed at 4 hours post stimulation, showed the highest enrichment for GATA and AP-1 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Transcripts from cluster 3, being most induced at 4 hours post stimulation, showed highest enrichment for the TEAD2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These findings suggest that distinct temporal expression patterns are governed by specific combinations of transcriptions factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P35">Swift transcriptional adaptation of gene expression to cope with the physiological challenges of pathogen infection is a fundamental aspect of immune responses across all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Pioneering studies on dynamic transcriptional responses upon acute stress such as heat shock have profited from nascent RNA sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Nascent RNA sequencing captures direct transcriptional changes independent of steady state RNA levels and transcript stability, enabling the characterization of dynamic regulatory changes. Here, we adapted PRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) to sequence nascent RNAs upon bacterial stimulation and characterized the regulation of the transcriptional immune response in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> cells. Leveraging the richness of PRO-seq data, we revised the current annotation of transcription start sites to the exact start nucleotide for about 40% of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> transcripts. This reannotation was critical to identify core promotor elements. In addition, we profiled the accumulation of active RNA polymerases across the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome in Aag2 cells and used these data to quantify active transcription in response to bacterial immune challenge. We confirmed rapid and robust induction of gene expression one and four hours after <italic>E. coli</italic> stimulation. While induction of canonical immune genes such as CLIP proteases and AMPs was sustained during the time course, other genes showed only transient or delayed induction, such as heat shock-related genes. Strikingly, the temporal expression patterns of induced transcripts associated with distinctive transcription factors binding sites that could (co-)regulate the expression of these separate groups of genes. Our data suggest that regulation of transcriptional dynamics is critical to ensure coordinated gene expression in response to pathogen challenge.</p><p id="P36">This study was the first to use PRO-seq in mosquito cells. We found that, while the basic principles of the method still apply, it is critical to carefully optimize the procedure to the desired experimental system. For Aag2 cells, the ratio of adapters to input material required optimization in order to reduce adapter dimers in the sequencing library which may be the result of differences in transcriptional activity between cell types. PRO-seq is most efficient in fast-dividing cells, such as cancer cells, that are inherently more transcriptionally active, facilitating capture of nascent RNA. Noteworthy, ongoing developments of PRO-seq variants, such as click-chemistry based protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), will aid in extending the application of PRO-seq to settings where nascent RNA content is expected to be more limited, such as for primary cells or tissue samples.</p><p id="P37">PRO-seq is a powerful nascent RNA sequencing method that enables the characterization of highly dynamic transcriptional processes while at the same time providing information about <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements. This makes it a particularly valuable approach for the accurate annotation of genomes of non-model organisms. Indeed, PRO-seq data enabled us to define exact transcription start nucleotides, having more precision than the current TSS annotation, which is based on conventional RNA sequencing data. We found that the TSS predictions often are too inclusive by calling the most upstream site with RNA coverage. The exact definition of start nucleotides is further impeded by the usually wide distribution of RNA sequencing reads at the 5’ and 3’ ends of transcripts. In contrast, the PRO-seq reads located at the start of a gene often converge in a single dominant peak allowing a highly accurate estimate of the exact TSN location. An overall deviation between annotated TSSs and the exact TSN, with a downstream shift of the TSN, has also been reported for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Importantly, determination of TSNs at high accuracy was instrumental to identify core promotor elements including TATA box, Initiator, and Downstream promotor elements. Only when considering TSNs called by PRO-seq we could observed a profound enrichment of the center ‘A’ of the initiator motif exactly at the first transcribed nucleotide and the downstream promotor elements precisely at the expected +28 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Intriguingly, the possibility to experimentally define exact TSNs will be critical to study the differential use of TSNs between different cell types or upon stimuli, as another level of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The nature of PRO-seq, which relies on biochemical purification of polymerase-associated nascent RNAs, allows profiling of the global transcriptional output irrespective of the nature of the transcript and the type of polymerase involved in RNA synthesis. In mosquito cells, we identified more than half of the nascent transcripts to be derived from annotated genes and about 20% at sequences of transposable elements. 25% of the mapped nascent RNAs could not be attributed to any genomic feature, but this fraction was profoundly reduced when disregarding sequence orientation. While a fraction of this improved attribution could be explained by background reads, our data suggests antisense transcription at gene and transposon loci. Especially for transposable elements, this antisense transcription is not unexpected. In fact, many transposon sequences are located in so-called PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). These genomic loci are core elements of a transposon defense mechanism and are enriched for defective transposable elements that are integrated in antisense orientation to the direction of transcription. It would therefore be intriguing to further research these loci, and the proportion of PRO-seq reads assigned to the opposite strand of annotated genomic features.</p><p id="P40">When assessing RNA polymerase positioning across individual genes, we found a predominant accumulation at promotor-proximal regions from where polymerase is primarily released into the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The two main peaks around +30 and +50 nt suggest an early and late pausing site, as also reported for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Noteworthy, only little transcription is seen at divergent regions, indicating that most <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> promoters seem to be unidirectional. This is similar to what has been reported for promotors in Drosophila, yet in sharp contrast to the bidirectional nature of most vertebrate promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Accumulation of RNA polymerases near the transcription termination site was less pronounced than in vertebrates, suggesting more efficient cleavage of nascent transcripts and RNA polymerase release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Further investigations into specific DNA elements and regulatory factors, will be instrumental to explain the differences in polymerase accumulation at divergent and termination regions.</p><p id="P41">Besides describing fundamental features of transcriptional activity in mosquito cells, PRO-seq enabled us to quantify direct changes in nascent RNA synthesis in response to immune challenge. Interestingly, a robust response was already seen one hour after stimulation. Hundreds of genes were upregulated, which exceeds the response after four hours. Upregulated genes at both time points included CLIP proteases and AMPs, which are important effectors of the mosquito immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Intriguingly, other groups of genes were only enriched at either timepoint, such as heat shock genes at 4 hours. This delayed upregulation of genes related to heat shock and protein processing in the ER is reminiscent of a secondary stress response, potentially triggered by high levels of (secretory) proteins that are unfolded and/or need to be exported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Remarkably, differences in temporal regulation were associated with distinct transcription factor binding motifs at the promotors of differentially expressed genes. NF-κB related motifs, indicative of regulation through the Toll and IMD pathways, were only enriched at promoters of transcripts showing sustained induction. In contrast, the GATA and AP-1 binding motifs, showed the strongest enrichment for transcripts only transiently induced at 1 hour. AP-1 transcription factors have frequently been associated with regulating transcription responses upon immune stimulation, often in concert with NF-kB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Our data provide an intriguing temporal dimension to the differential activity of these two key immune transcription factors in the rapid responses in mosquito cells. It is intriguing to hypothesize that waves of gene expression in the early response to bacterial challenge enable a sophisticated coordination of genetic programs that fulfill distinct functionalities. Altogether our PRO-seq approach identified key gene regulatory elements and provided an advanced characterization of dynamic host responses to microbial challenge in mosquito cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190607-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Vihervaara and Miesen laboratories for valuable advice and discussions and Rebecca Halbach and Ronald van Rij for critical reading of the manuscript.
