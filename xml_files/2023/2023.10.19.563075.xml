A total of 13 patients (8 males) with PD with the average age of 56±6.7 years old and average disease duration of 9.5±4.3 years were recruited in this study. All patients had signed informed consent in line with the Declaration of the Principles of Helsinki prior to surgery. All patients were bilaterally implanted in STN with electrodes consisted of four contacts (Model L301C, Beijing PINS Medical Co, China) and a sensing-enabled neurostimulator (G106R, Beijing PINS Medical Co, China).

In order to inform better control algorithms for closed-loop DBS to deal with sleep fragmentation in PD, bipolar signal adjacent to the stimulation contact, which is the commonly used feedback signal of closed-loop DBS, was used for the following analysis. LFP signals were sampled at 500Hz after filtered with an RC filter of 0.3Hz∼250Hz implemented on board. The distance of wireless transmission was up to 2m, avoiding the disturbance of normal sleep caused by LFP recording platform. The LFP recordings were synchronized with the PSG recordings through manually noting the recording starting time of each recording systems.

The LHPR were higher preceding the transition into deeper sleep stages, as during N2-N3 and REM-N2 process, compared to the similar time window preceding the transition to lighter sleep stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a, b</xref>).

Besides, as theta oscillations in STN LFP have been reported to be positively associated with cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, interruption in theta oscillation could be another mechanism underlying sleep disturbance.</p><p id="P27">On the other hand, only average power of low gamma oscillations in REM sleep was found to be positively correlated with SFI. Since both STN activities in different frequency bands were modulated by sleep stages, we additionally calculated the correlation of SFI and beta, theta and low gamma oscillations in NREM and REM separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4-5</xref>). This generated similar findings: beta and low gamma oscillations in NREM correlated positively with sleep fragmentations severity while only low gamma oscillations in REM demonstrated the same trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 a,b,e</xref>). This can be attributed to a few reasons which need further investigation. Firstly, REM sleep is not a uniform state and can be divided into phasic and tonic substages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Phasic REM, with enhanced widespread thalamocortical synchronization activities, demonstrated higher arousal index threshold with decreased gamma oscillations than tonic REM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here, we raised the following hypothesis which need further exploration: the rhythms of phasic and tonic REM can be interrupted in Parkinsonian patients with sleep fragmentation, leading to more tonic REM with lower arousal threshold and higher gamma oscillations. Secondly, previous research found that in chronic sleep deprivation states, enhanced gamma oscillations were modulated by theta activities in compensation for the losses of REM sleep-related synaptic potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, the elevated gamma oscillations in STN LFP may also be a compensatory mechanism of sleep disturbance in Parkinsonian patients.</p><p id="P28">In summary, our results indicated that the alterations of multiple frequency bands in STN LFPs are involved in sleep disturbance in Parkinsonian patients and combining the low-high power ratio (LHPR) in STN LFPs during sleep may serve as a better biomarker for sleep fragmentation.</p><p id="P29">Further research would be required to dissect how the oscillatory features in the STN LFPs identified in this study interfered with normal sleep: either through serving as a direct neuropathological biomarker of the neural circuits controlling sleep and wakefulness, or by aggravating nocturnal motor symptoms, cognitive impairment and etc.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Sleep spindles distinguishable from beta bursts in STN LFPs during sleep</title><p id="P30">As a hallmark of NREM sleep, sleep spindles have an overlap in frequency band with beta oscillations in normal NREM sleep according to previous researches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. A previous study conducted during the perioperative period demonstrated the presence of spindle activity in STN LFPs that synchronized with EEG spindle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> What’s more, recent in vivo studies with non-human primates also demonstrated field potential spindles in basal ganglia, which increased during sleep after a learning task especially in the striatum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Here in our analysis, we explored the relationship between beta bursts and spindles recorded in STN LFPs of Parkinsonian patients for the first time, revealing that they are distinguishable in terms of frequency and exhibit a negative correlation in their occupation over time. We confirmed this finding from the following two aspects. First, the peak frequency of beta bursts and sleep spindles in STN were dissociable from each other, with beta bursts showing higher frequency and shorter durations compared with sleep spindles. Second, STN sleep spindles were similar with cortex sleep spindles in peak frequency as well as sleep stage dependent distribution density. Moreover, we contend that it is unlikely to identify STN spindles originating from neighboring pathological oscillation bands, since the spindle activities were absent during wake.</p><p id="P31">However, due to the limited synchronization accuracy of PSG and LFP recording systems, further researches should aim to provide more details about the directionality of information flows between cortical and STN spindles. As sleep spindles have a close relationship with learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, previous studies have found that decreased spindle amplitude and density measured from cortex using EEG were associated with dementia in PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We further demonstrated a negative correlation between the occurrence of sleep spindles and beta burst in STN LFPs during NREM sleep. This result indicated that besides contributing to sleep fragmentation, beta bursts may also have detrimental effects on spindle related physiological functions such memory consolidation during sleep.</p><p id="P32">Further research would be required to investigate whether STN spindles, together with above mentioned theta oscillations, could be potential indicators for memory consolidation during sleep and more detailed pathophysiological mechanism of beta oscillations during this process.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Implications on closed-loop DBS</title><p id="P33">Closed-loop DBS modulations adjust the stimulation parameters according to the detected biomarkers dynanmically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, among which beta power triggered closed-loop DBS in PD have been increasingly studied these days and have been found achieving similar or even better therapeutic effect on motor symptoms comparing with traditional open-loop DBS modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">However, the effect of beta triggered closed-loop DBS on sleep is unknown and the closed-loop DBS modulation strategy for sleep is less explored. Previous studies have conducted sleep stage classifications based on STN LFPs and provided possibilities towards more precise neuromodulation around sleep-wake cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. A recent study on the diurnal fluctuations in beta amplitude suggest that the threshold need to be adjusted in beta triggered closed-loop DBS to prevent suboptimal stimulation at night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Here in this study, we showed that with the same threshold defined during awake, beta bursts could still be detected during NREM when patients in Off-DBS and Off-Medication state.</p><p id="P35">Moreover, occurrence of the beta bursts in N2 sleep preceded the transition to stages with more cortical activity (Wake, N1 and REM). These results suggest that, beta power triggered closed-loop DBS, using the same threshold defined during awake, may also reduce sleep fragmentation and improve sleep quality.</p><p id="P36">Another implication of our results on the design of closed-loop DBS is: we may need to differentiate pathological beta oscillation from the sleep spindles. Here we chose beta within the 15-30Hz range to maximize the differentiation from the spindle frequency band. The more commonly used beta range of 13-30Hz were also analyzed to confirm the robustness of our conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Further studies would be required to investigate the effect of high frequency STN DBS on sleep spindle and related functions, such as over-night learning and memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Limitations and Caveats</title><p id="P37">There are several limitations in our study. First, as all data were acquired in Off-Medication and Off-DBS status, whether these trends were stable under different medication and DBS stimulation states remained unknown. Secondly, as a small-sized clinical study, only 12 patients were included. Thus, further study will include more subjects with different treatment states to further verify the transition patterns in sleep.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P38">In conclusion, our data revealed features of STN LFP underlying sleep fragmentation in PD.

already known on this topic</title><p>Beta oscillation, which is a biomarker for rigidity and bradykinesia during awake, significantly reduced during NREM sleep compared to REM or awake. Researches from MPTP non-human primate model suggested increased beta oscillation in basal ganglia contributed to insomnia in PD, however evidence in human patients is still lacking.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>What this study adds</title><p>Beta and low gamma band activities in STN LFPs during sleep recorded from human PD patients correlated with severity of sleep impairment. The low-high power ratio can serve as a biomarker for sleep fragmentation. Besides, pathological beta bursts and physiological sleep spindles can be detected in STN LFP during NREM sleep and distinguishable from each other.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</title><p>These findings enhance our understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie sleep fragmentation in Parkinson’s disease. The study also has implications on the design of closed-loop DBS: we may need to take multiple frequency band activities into consideration and differentiate pathological beta oscillation from the sleep spindles.</p></sec></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Lead Localization, Schematic of Recording Platform and Waveform Examples of EEG and STN LFP.</title><p>a.
