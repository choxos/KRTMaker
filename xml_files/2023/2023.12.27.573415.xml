Molecular chaperones are important cellular factors contributing to the regulation of tau misfolding and aggregation. Here we reveal an Hsp90-independent modulation of tau aggregation by a molecular complex of the two Hsp90 co-chaperones p23 and FKBP51. Integrating NMR spectroscopy, SAXS, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis we reveal the structural basis of the p23-FKBP51 complex. We show that p23 specifically recognizes the TPR domain of FKBP51 and interacts with tau through its C-terminal disordered tail. We further show that the p23-FKBP51 complex binds tau to form a dynamic p23-FKBP51-tau trimeric complex that inhibits tau aggregation and thus may counteract Hsp90-FKBP51 mediated toxicity. Taken together, our findings reveal a co-chaperone mediated Hsp90-independent chaperoning of tau protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cellular homeostasis by molecular chaperones is indispensable for the survival of long-lived neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, are associated with an imbalanced protein load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by the deposition of tau protein as insoluble aggregates in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Hsp90 is a key molecular chaperone that along with the help of several other co-chaperones stabilizes tau and maintains tau levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Direct modulation of Hsp90 by small molecules or other modalities may thus be a pertinent approach to develop therapies for tauopathies and other neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, as Hsp90 interacts with a diverse set of client proteins including steroid receptors and kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, direct regulation of Hsp90 activity might be detrimental. Co-chaperones of Hsp90 that target a specific subgroup of proteins, e.g., intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), may thus be more viable drug targets for the development of therapies with fewer side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. For example, the knockdown of the two co-chaperones, p23 and FKBP51, led to a dramatic reduction in total tau levels in cells suggesting a stabilizing effect of these co-chaperones on tau that is independent of Hsp90 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the molecular basis of Hsp90-independent chaperoning of tau by co-chaperones is largely unknown.</p><p id="P3">p23 is the smallest protein in the Hsp90 machinery and is highly conserved in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The human p23 (molecular weight = 19 kDa) is 160 amino acids long and comprises a folded domain (residue 1 to 110) and a large disordered tail (residue 111 to 160)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The folded domain of p23 consists of anti-parallel β-sheets and is similar to the α-crystallin domain of small heat shock proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The residues present at the beginning of the C-terminal tail of p23 form a conserved helix that interacts with the client binding site of Hsp90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. As an Hsp90 co-chaperone, p23 inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp90, stabilizes its closed conformation, and enhances the client maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In addition to modulating Hsp90 activity, p23 acts as an independent molecular chaperone and prevents protein aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The C-terminal tail of p23 is reported to be essential for its chaperone function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In our recent study, we showed that p23 directly interacts with tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, the residues of p23 that are involved in interaction with tau are still unknown.</p><p id="P4">FKBP51, a 51 kDa molecular chaperone, is highly expressed in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. It is a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family of proteins and binds to the immunosuppressive drug FK506<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. It consists of three folded domains, FK1, FK2, and TPR. The FK1 domain possesses the PPIase activity and the FK2 domain has an ATP binding site. The TPR domain comprises seven α-helices and is the binding site for different heat-shock proteins (Hsps), tubulin, as well as caters to the chaperone function of FKBP51<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. FKBP51 plays a crucial role in stress response by regulating the activity of glucocorticoid receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. It also plays a significant role in tau biology by directly interacting with the proline-rich domain and the repeat domain of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Tau phosphorylation decreases its interaction with FKBP51 suggesting varying interaction of the two proteins at different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The total tau level in the cell increases upon overexpression of FKBP51 which might be due to the impaired ubiquitination of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

In the absence of the co-chaperones, tau started to form amyloid fibrils after ~14 hours. In the presence of either 1:0.1 or 1:0.2 molar ratio of tau to FKBP51, the time to reach half of the ThT fluorescence intensity at the plateau (Tm) was unchanged, suggesting that FKBP51 alone does not modulate the kinetics of tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). However, the tau samples in the presence of FKBP51 reached a higher ThT intensity than the unmodified tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). As a comparable amount of tau aggregated both in the presence and absence of FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), the higher ThT intensity in presence of FKBP51 might be attributed to a different structure of the tau fibril or due to the presence of FKBP51 on the fibril surface.</p><p id="P7">We then studied the effect of p23 on the aggregation of tau. The addition of a sub-stochiometric amount of p23 (tau:p23 = 1:0.1) already delayed the aggregation of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Increasing the amount of p23 (tau:p23 = 1:0.2) further delayed tau’s aggregation. However, unlike FKBP51, the presence of p23 had only little influence on the final ThT intensity.</p><p id="P8">To gain further insight into the modulation of tau aggregation in the presence of both p23 and FKBP51, we added both co-chaperones to a final molar ratio of tau: p23: FKBP51 to 1:0.1:0.1 or 1:0.2:0.2. The presence of both co-chaperones attenuated the aggregation of tau to a greater extent than the individual co-chaperones at the comparable concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Notably, while the final ThT intensity was high even at the 1:0.2:0.2 molar ratio, quantification of the supernatant suggested a lower amount of aggregated tau (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The combined data indicated that p23 and FKBP51 are not acting independently but cooperatively in the modulation of tau aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>FKBP51 binds to p23</title><p id="P9">The findings from the <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation assay suggest a potential cooperative action of p23 and FKBP51. To investigate the molecular basis of this cooperative action, we first recorded two-dimensional (2D) NMR correlation spectra of p23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of deuterated, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled p23 was comparable to previously published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We then added equimolar, two-fold, and three-fold molar excess of unlabeled FKBP51 to the NMR-observable p23. The addition of FKBP51 significantly decreased the signal intensity of residues present in the structured domain (residue 1 to 110) of p23, suggesting an interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The strong signal attenuation can be attributed to the increase in molecular weight due to p23-FKBP51 complex formation that leads to enhanced transverse relaxation. We also observed a decrease in the signal intensity of the p23 residues 114 to 130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Notably, these residues (114-130) present in the C-terminal tail of p23 are predicted by AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> to form an α-helical structure. A similar α-helix near the structured domain of yeast p23/Sba1 was previously reported to interact with the client binding site of Hsp90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Apart from the decrease in signal intensities we also observed chemical shift perturbation (CSP) of the p23 residues 7-12, 53-60, and 80-110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The highest CSP values were observed for residue A94, followed by R88, and K107. Mapping the residues that showed CSP and intensity changes on the three-dimensional structure of p23 revealed the major binding site of FKBP51 near the C-terminal end of the structured domain of p23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, inset).</p><p id="P10">To gain further insights into the role played by the C-terminal tail of p23 to interact with FKBP51, we created a C-terminal deletion mutant of p23 by deleting the terminal 41 residues. The addition of equimolar, two-fold, and five-fold molar excess of unlabeled FKBP51 to the NMR observable truncated p23 (1-119) protein lead to the perturbation of the same residues present in the structured domain of p23 as observed in full-length p23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, the extent of CSP and intensity changes was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). This suggests that although the main binding site of FKBP51 on p23 is the structured domain, the C-terminal tail is also involved in the interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>p23 recognizes the TPR domain of FKBP51</title><p id="P11">To elucidate the binding site of p23 on FKBP51, we <sup>13</sup>C-labeled the methyl groups of the leucine and valine residues of FKBP51 as these residues are distributed in all three domains (FK1, FK2, and TPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We then recorded 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of the FKBP51 and transferred the assignments of the methyl groups present in the FK1 and FK2 domain from our previously published study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The methyl groups present in the TPR domain of FKBP51 could not be assigned due to limited solubility of this domain when expressed alone. Upon addition of two-fold, five-fold, and ten-fold molar excess of unlabeled p23 to the <sup>13</sup>C-methyl-labeled FKBP51, we observed changes in the cross peaks of several methyl resonances from the TPR domain while the resonances of the FK1 and FK2 domain remained unchanged. The data identify the TPR domain of FKBP51 as binding site of p23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To further confirm the interaction between p23 and the TPR domain of FKBP51, we prepared a construct of FKBP51 comprising only the FK1 and FK2 domains, referred to as FK1-FK2. We then added two-fold and four-fold molar excess of unlabeled FK1-FK2 to the NMR observable p23. Addition of FK1-FK2 did not induce any changes in the signals of p23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) confirming that the FK1 and FK2 domain of FKBP51 are not involved in the interaction with p23.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Competitive binding of p23 and MEEVD Hsp90 peptide to FKBP51</title><p id="P13">The Hsp90 C-terminal ends with a highly conserved MEEVD sequence that directs the binding of different TPR-containing co-chaperones (FKBP51, FKBP52, HOP, Cyp40) to Hsp90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The MEEVD peptide interacts with K272, E273, K352, N322, and K329 residues present in the TPR domain of FKBP51 by forming di-carboxylate clamps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To investigate if p23 and MEEVD peptide share the same binding site on FKBP51, we first formed the complex of NMR observable p23 with a two-fold molar excess of unlabeled FKBP51 and recorded the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectra of p23 both in its free and complex form. The addition of FKBP51 leads to the attenuation of most of the signals from the structured domain of p23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The further addition of ten-fold, twenty-fold, and thirty-fold molar excess of MEEVD peptide leads to recovery of ~20%, 40%, and 60% signal intensity from the structured part of p23, respectively, suggesting gradual removal of p23 from the binding site of FKBP51. This indicates that p23 and MEEVD compete to bind with FKBP51 and demonstrates that their binding sites on the TPR domain of FKBP51 are overlapping.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structure of the p23-FKBP51 complex</title><p id="P14">To gain high-resolution insights into the structure of the p23-FKBP51 complex, we modeled the complex using HADDOCK docking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The docking was performed with the crystal structures of p23 (1EJF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and FKBP51 (5NJX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To calculate the structure of the complex, the residues of p23 that showed the highest CSPs (11, 56, 88, 94, 103, 107) were assigned as the active site on p23 and the residues of FKBP51 that bind to the MEEVD peptide (K272, E273, K352, N322, K329) were assigned as the active site on FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). The analysis generated 92 structures within a single cluster with an RMSD deviation of 0.9 ± 0.5 Å from the lowest energy structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The lowest energy structure comprises the C-terminal structured domain of p23 in contact with the MEEVD-binding site on the TPR domain of FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Analysis of the binding interface revealed an insertion of the side chains of R88 and R93 of p23 into a binding pocket in the TPR domain of FKBP51, including a potential direct contact with D347 of FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Consistent with the formation of this binding interface, A94 the residue next to R93 (which could not be assigned in the NMR spectra) and R88 of p23 showed the highest CSPs in the presence of FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To validate the structural model of the p23-FKBP51 complex, we mutated both the arginine residues involved in binding with FKBP51, i.e., R88 and R93 to alanine. To get insight into the binding of the R88A/R93A-mutant p23 with FKBP51, we added equimolar or two-fold molar excess of unlabeled FKBP51 to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled R88A/R93A-mutant p23. Unlike the case of wild-type p23, the addition of FKBP51 to the mutant p23 caused very little attenuation of the NMR signals from the folded domain of p23 indicative of a drastic reduction in the binding of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Also, most of the signals near the C-terminal end of the folded domain of p23, the major binding site of FKBP51 on p23, remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) further validating the structural model of the p23-FKBP51 complex.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Contribution of the C-terminal tail of p23 to the p23-FKBP51 complex</title><p id="P16">To further characterize the p23-FKBP51 complex, we performed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with small angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) with both the free FKBP51 and the FKBP51-p23 complex.

The crystal structure of FKBP51 fits well into the SAXS-derived density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a,b</xref>). An additional density at the C-terminus of FKBP51 is observed which may be attributed to the C-terminal 32 residues (residues 426-457) of FKBP51 that are absent in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The SAXS data of the p23-FKBP51 complex at an equimolar ratio generated a density map with Rg 40.8 Å and Dmax 155.6 Å.

Further comparison of the density map of the free FKBP51 and p23-FKBP51 complex revealed additional electron density near the TPR domain of FKBP51 in the complex state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The complex structure of p23-FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) also fits into the density map calculated from SAXS although the disordered tail of FKBP51, and potentially also the C-terminal helix of FKBP51, may undergo conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Additionally, we observed density near the FK2 and TPR domain of FKBP51 for the p23-FKBP51 complex.

One of the hypotheses for the Hsp90-mediated toxicity is that by attempting to chaperone the microtubule-binding domain of tau, Hsp90 increases the half-life of tau thereby increasing its chances to form toxic aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Also, the interaction of Hsp90 with tau is reported to expose the aggregation-prone repeat domain of tau leading to the formation of toxic oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The inhibition of Hsp90 activity by geldanamycin induces the activation of HSF-1, which further induces the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 leading to the reduction of aggregated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, inhibition of Hsp90 may be associated with adverse effects as Hsp90 interacts with 60 % of the protein kinases and plays a crucial role in cellular stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, finding more specific targets, potentially co-chaperones of Hsp90 that selectively interact with tau or other IDPs, might help to circumvent some of these problems.</p><p id="P23">Using our recently developed co-factor-free aggregation assay of tau, we showed that the Hsp90 co-chaperone p23 strongly delays tau’s aggregation while FKBP51, another Hsp90 co-chaperone, did not slow tau’s amyloid formation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While further studies are required, a tug-of-war between two different activities of FKBP51 may be present, the PPIase activity of the FK1 domain and the chaperone activity of FKBP51’s TPR domain. The PPIase activity of FKBP51 may enhance the aggregation of tau whereas the chaperone activity is expected to delay tau’s aggregation. Such opposing roles on the aggregation propensity of tau and α-synuclein were reported for the two PPIases FKBP12 and PPIA/CypA, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The two activities depend on the concentration of the chaperone/co-chaperone, with a lower concentration favoring PPIase activity while at higher concentrations the chaperone activity may dominate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Currently, we cannot further investigate this hypothesis because of the lower stability of FKBP51 at higher concentrations in our aggregation assay. Notably, FKBP51 stimulates tau aggregation <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, suggesting that its PPIase activity may play an important role <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P24">In contrast to FKBP51, p23 slows the fibrillization kinetics of tau even at substoichiometric concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). p23’s aggregation inhibition activity can be attributed to the interaction of the negatively charged C-terminal tail of p23 with tau’s positively charged aggregation-prone repeat domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a-d</xref>). The C-terminal tail of p23 has previously been suggested to exert chaperone activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our results further revealed that the presence of both p23 and FKBP51 attenuated tau’s aggregation to a greater extent than p23 alone at comparable concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This may arise from the formation of a trimeric complex between tau, p23, and FKBP51 in which tau’s repeat-domain interacts with the C-terminal tail of p23 and tau’s proline-rich domain clusters at the FK1 domain of FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). The trimeric p23-FKBP51-tau complex is most likely not a single rigid complex, but rather a dynamic ensemble of trimeric complex structures in which different positively charged regions of Tau bind to the negatively charged C-terminal tail of p23.</p><p id="P25">We determined the structural basis of the p23-FKBP51 complex using an integrative structural biology approach. The reliability of the modeled complex structure was supported by site-directed mutagenesis of two arginine residues of p23 that insert into a binding pocket on FKBP51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We further showed that p23 and the C-terminal peptide of Hsp90 (MEEVD) bind to an overlapping site on FKBP51’s TPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As Hsp90’s MEEVD residues play a crucial role in mediating the protein’s interaction with FKBP51<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, p23 and Hsp90 may potentially compete to bind to FKBP51. Concurrently, FKBP51 is reported to synergize with Hsp90 to promote toxic tau oligomerization by forming an Hsp90-FKBP51-tau pro-toxic complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The formation of a protective p23-FKBP51-tau trimeric complex may thus be a regulation mechanism to counteract toxic Hsp90-FKBP51 mediated toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Taken together, our findings reveal an Hsp90-independent, p23-FKBP51-mediated chaperoning of tau protein.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="P27">Mutants of p23 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using a thermocycler (SensoQuest Labcycler).
