Recently, vaccine development prospects were boosted by reports that licensed meningococcus serogroup B (MenB) vaccines provided partial protection against Gc infection. To determine antigens responsible for cross-protection, memory B cells from 4CMenB vaccinated volunteers were single-cell sorted to identify antibodies that kill Gc in a bactericidal assay. Nine different antibodies, all deriving from the IGHV4-34 germline carrying unusually long HCDR3s, recognized the PorB protein, four recognized the lipooligosaccharide (LOS), and four unknown antigens. One of the PorB antibodies, tested in vivo, provided protection from Gc infection. The identification of PorB and LOS as key antigens of gonococcal and meningococcal immunity provides a mechanistic explanation of the cross-protection observed in the clinic and shows that isolating human monoclonal antibodies from vaccinees can be instrumental for bacterial antigen discovery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (Gonococcus; Gc), the causative agent of gonorrhea, has been a persistent public health problem for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). Today, gonorrhea is the second most common sexually transmitted disease, causing 710,000 infections yearly in the United States and more than 80 million cases globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">St Cyr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Unemo et al., 2021</xref>). Gonococcal infection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lenz and Dillard, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the impact of gonorrhea on human health is amplified by its role in increasing both transmission and susceptibility to the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jarvis and Chang, 2012</xref>). Since the 1940s the disease has been treated with antibiotics, however, over time the bacterium has acquired resistance to sulphonamides, penicillins, fluoroquinolones and today it is only susceptible to third generation cephalosporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Unemo and Shafer, 2014</xref>). The recent isolation of strains resistant even to cephalosporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Młynarczyk-Bonikowska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Unemo and Shafer, 2014</xref>) raised the alarm of the World Health Organization (WHO) that, concerned about the bacterium becoming untreatable, concluded that the development of new antimicrobials and Gc vaccines is imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Unemo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Unemo and Shafer, 2014</xref>). The search for vaccines against Gc has been largely unsuccessful for many decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). Although in 1978 a human challenge trial demonstrated protection against infection using a pilus purified from the challenge strain as a vaccine, a large-scale phase 3 trial involving 3,250 volunteers failed to show any efficacy, most likely because of the large antigenic variability of the antigen used in this vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boslego et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gottlieb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Greenberg, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maurakis and Cornelissen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Russell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tramont, 1989</xref>). After decades of failures in developing gonococcal vaccines, the recent observation of partial efficacy against Gc infection of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup B (MenB) Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV)-based vaccines has revived the hopes for gonococcal vaccine research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Paynter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Semchenko et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, a retrospective case-control study conducted in New Zealand following mass vaccination campaign with an OMV based MenB vaccine (MeNZB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Paynter et al., 2019</xref>) and three observational studies conducted in the U.S. and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bruxvoort et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) reported 30-46% protection against Gc infection and confirmed observations that had been made in the past in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Longtin et al., 2017</xref>), Cuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ochoa-Azze, 2018</xref>) and Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Whelan et al., 2016</xref>). These observations provided proof of concept that a Gc vaccine is feasible and suggested that MenB OMV-based vaccines contained antigens that might induce a cross-reactive immunity against Gc. The hypothesis is supported by the fact that MenB and Gc share between 80 and 90% of genome identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tinsley and Nassif, 1996</xref>) and their lipooligosaccharide (LOS) antigens share partial similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mandrell et al., 1988</xref>). Since the PorA immunodominant protective antigen of the meningococcal OMV vaccine is not expressed by Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Unemo et al., 2005</xref>), it has been hypothesized that other MenB subdominant antigens might be responsible for the observed cross-protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Semchenko et al., 2019</xref>). A comparative genomic analysis on approximately 1,000 Gc isolates collected in the U.S. and MenB reference strains allowed the identification of 57 Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) with high homology between the two Neisseria species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Marjuki et al., 2019</xref>). Approximately 42% of common OMPs have been identified in the OMV component of the 4CMenB vaccine licensed against MenB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ferrari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vipond et al., 2006</xref>). These included BamA, NspA, MtrE and MetQ, exhibiting between 91% and 100% amino acid sequence similarity, and PorB, RmpM, PilQ, OpcA, FetA, Omp85 (BamA) and LbpA, which were shown to be consistently present in different OMV lots of the 4CMenB vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tani et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the 4CMenB vaccine contained also the NHBA protein which is moderately homologous between the two <italic>Neisseria</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Marjuki 2019</xref>). To understand which MenB antigens could contribute to the cross-protection observed against Gc, we immunized healthy volunteers with the 4CMenB vaccine, collected their peripheral blood cells (PBMCs), single cell sorted the memory B cells (MBCs) and selected the B cells producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the meningococcal OMV and killing gonococcus <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This approach allowed the identification of PorB and LOS as key antigens for cross-protection against gonococcus and meningococcus and provided a paradigm that could be used for antigen discovery for other antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of bactericidal mAbs (b-mAbs) against Gc</title><p id="P4">To isolate MBCs specific for MenB OMVs contained in the 4CMenB formulation, 3 volunteers were vaccinated with the 4CMenB vaccine and their PBMCs were collected 28 days after receiving the booster dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). PBMCs were stained with antibodies for CD19, CD27, IgD, IgM and MenB OMVs labelled with Alexa488, with the aim to identify class-switched memory B cells (MBCs; CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>) OMV-binders. The gating strategy applied to perform the single cell sorting is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>. Using this approach 3,080 OMV<sup>+</sup> MBCs were sorted and incubated for 2 weeks to allow natural production of immunoglobulins as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andreano et al., 2021</xref>). The percentage of class-switched MBCs detected in the three donors was 23.2, 16.9 and 43.1% for subjects 7, 8 and 9, respectively, and the percentage of OMV<sup>+</sup> MBCs ranged from 2.6 to 12.6% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). To identify OMV<sup>+</sup> MBCs that could cross-bind Gc, we performed a whole bacterial cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the Gc strains FA1090 and F62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hobbs et al., 2011</xref>), and the recently described low-passaged clinical isolate BG27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Manca et al., 2023</xref>). This latter strain expresses the same PorB.1B variant of FA1090 and presents a polyphosphate (polyP) pseudo-capsule that has been shown to confer high serum resistance. From the 3,080 OMV<sup>+</sup> MBCs sorted, a panel of 390 (12.7%) antibodies recognized at least one of the tested Gc strains in ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The variable regions of the mAbs heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains were cloned into appropriate vectors for mAb expression as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andreano et al., 2021</xref>). All 390 Gc-binding mAbs were expressed in small scale (1 mL) through transcriptionally active polymerase chain reaction (TAP) and screened by resazurin-based high-throughput antibody bactericidal assay (R-ABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Stazzoni et al., 2023</xref>). For this assay, mAbs were incubated with Gc strains in presence of baby rabbit complement (10-20%) and bacterial viability was measured through the use of resazurin. To maximize the sensitivity of the bactericidal assay, the antibodies were initially engineered using a fragment crystallizable (Fc) region carrying the RGY mutations (E345R, E430G, S440Y) which promote antibody hexamerization and enhance C1q deposition on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">de Jong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McIntosh et al., 2015</xref>). Among the 390 tested mAbs, 36 (9.2%) were found to be bactericidal against FA1090 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, while the RGY antibody scaffold is useful for screening, it cannot be used clinically because of non-specific antibody hexamerization and complement binding in solution even in the absence of the target antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">de Jong et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the subsequent work was performed using a scaffold carrying only the G (E430G) mutation, known as HexaBody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">de Jong et al., 2016</xref>). This scaffold still enables improved complement deposition compared to natural IgG1, while preventing target-independent hexamerization and C1q binding in solution. In addition, the HexaBody scaffold is currently being used in different trials supporting its selection for clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">De Goeij et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Oostindie et al., 2020</xref>). Seventeen out of 36 (47.2%) b-mAbs expressed as HexaBody retained their bactericidal activity against strain FA1090 with potency values (50% inhibitory concentration; IC<sub><italic>50</italic></sub>) ranging from 0.05 to ~150 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Antigen identification and functional mAb characterization on Gc and MenB strains</title><p id="P5">To identify the antigens recognized by the selected mAbs, we performed immunoblot assays using MenB lysed OMVs or purified LOS. In addition, we used microarrays containing 12 recombinant MenB proteins and 26 recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMAs) expressing MenB OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Viviani et al., 2023</xref>). Four of the total 17 b-mAbs (01B05, 03N18, 04E05 and 02G11) recognized purified MenB LOS by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Seven b-mAbs tested by immunoblotting on MenB OMVs recognized a band co-migrating with the Porin B (PorB) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The signal of band intensity for these mAbs ranged from high (01J23, 01K12 and 03M18) to weak (01H12, 02C05, 02K03 and 04L22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The recognition of PorB by all 7 mAbs, including the weakly reactive ones, was confirmed through protein microarray analysis and binding to purified recombinant MenB PorB and <italic>E. coli</italic> GMMAs expressing MenB PorB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, two additional anti-PorB antibodies (01C05 and 02G22) were identified through binding of PorB on the microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Therefore, our results revealed that a total of 9 (53.0%) b-mAbs targeted the PorB antigen and 4 (23.5%) recognized LOS. For the remaining 4 (23.5%) b-mAbs (01L10, 01I20, 02E13 and 05G16) we were unable to identify the target antigen neither by Western blotting nor by protein microarray. To confirm the bactericidal activity of selected identified b-mAbs, antibodies were tested against the Gc strain FA1090 through classical serum bactericidal assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, left panel). All antibodies were able to kill Gc FA1090 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The 17 mAbs killing the FA1090 strain were evaluated for phagocytic activity through the visual opsonophagocytosis assay (vOPA). This approach is based on high-content image analysis to count the number of bacteria internalized by macrophage-like THP-1 cells in the presence of b-mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, middle panel). With the exception of anti-PorB mAb 04L22, all antibodies tested showed opsonophagocytic activity, and 4 anti-PorB antibodies, 01J23, 01K12, 01C05 and 02G22, were found to be the most potent in promoting bacterial internalization by THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Finally, we evaluated through microarray analysis the ability of our Gc b-mAbs to cross-react with additional eighteen low-passaged BG clinical strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Overall, broad cross-reactivity was shown by all b-mAbs with the exception of 02C05 (anti-PorB), 01L10 (unknown target), 03M18 (anti-PorB) and 02E13 (unknown target) which recognized 4, 3, 0 and 0 BG strains respectively. Distinct binding profiles were observed between anti-LOS and anti-PorB b-mAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In fact, anti-LOS were the only antibodies able to bind both BG1 and BG11. Conversely, almost all anti-PorB b-mAbs were able to bind BG10, BG19, BG21, BG23, BG24 and BG29 which were not bound by anti-LOS antibodies. Antibodies targeting unknown antigens showed lower cross-reactivity to BG strains, with the exception of 05G16 which presented a binding profile similar to anti-PorB b-mAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Since Gc b-mAbs isolated in this study were elicited by the MenB 4CMenB vaccine, we also evaluated the bactericidal activity of 17 antibodies against a panel of ten strains representative of the genetic diversity of MenB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, right panel). The panel includes the strains used to produce the Norwegian and Cuban MenB OMV-based vaccines (H44-76 and CU385), the reference strains for NadA and NHBA 4CMenB antigens (5/99, NGH38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Donnelly et al., 2010</xref>), the New Zealand epidemic strain (NZ98/254) from which the 4CMenB detergent-extracted OMVs are derived, and the MC58 strain from which the sequence of fHbp contained in the 4CMenB vaccine was derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pizza et al., 2000</xref>). M01-240364 was selected as a PorB 2 expressing strain to evaluate the impact of different PorB alleles on functional activity. Moreover, the MenB strains M01-240355 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Snape et al., 2013</xref>), M07576 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Viviani et al., 2023</xref>) and ARG3191 <italic>(Neisseria</italic> isolates database ID: 51591) were selected because they were mismatched for NHBA, NadA, fHbp and PorA P1.7-2,4 variants present in the 4CMenB vaccine. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> the genotyping of the 10 MenB strains selected for the bactericidal analysis of antibodies is reported. Our results showed that Gc b-mAbs were highly bactericidal against most MenB strains. Anti-LOS antibodies were able to kill all MenB strains with the exception of NGH38 and ARG3191 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>). Three of these mAbs (01B05, 03N18, 04E05) were more potent than the fourth (02G11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Anti-PorB b-mAbs also showed broad functionality against MenB strains. Interestingly, while only one anti-LOS exhibited low activity against ARG3191, anti-PorB antibodies were extremely functional against this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Conversely, anti-PorB antibodies showed poor or no activity against MenB strains carrying a PorB class different from the NZ98/254 strain, namely 5/99, NGH38 and M01-240364 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

Surprisingly, all 9 anti-PorB b-mAbs used the immunoglobulin heavy variable chain (IGHV) 4-34 germline rearranged with the immunoglobulin heavy joining chain (IGHJ) 3-1 (3/9; 33.3%), IGHJ4-1 (3/9; 33.3%) or IGHJ6-1 (3/9; 33.3%). These heavy chains paired with different light chains, most frequently with IGKV3-20 (7/9; 77.8%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). The b-mAbs targeting unknown antigens also preferentially used the IGHV4-34 germline (3/4; 75.0%) paired exclusively with the IGKV3-20 which accommodated different J genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Interestingly, while most of anti-PorB b-mAbs carry the IGHV4-34 paired with IGKV3-20, only two clonal families with two members each were identified (clone ID 6 and 8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). The remaining anti-PorB antibodies were orphan sequences (i.e. do not belong to clonal families) highlighting the diversity of this class of antibodies. Anti-LOS used mainly the IGHV2-5; IGHJ4-1 (3/4; 75.0%) paired with different light chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). In addition, 3/4 (75%) anti-LOS b-mAbs derived from the same clonal family (clone ID 1). The low number of anti-LOS b-mAbs and their high clonality means that limited heterogeneity was observed in those recovered in this study. Our analyses revealed that anti-LOS and anti-PorB mAbs use preferentially different heavy and light chain gene rearrangements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). In addition, we evaluated the V gene mutation frequency, heavy chain complementary determining region 3 (HCDR3) amino acidic length, frequency of positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids in the HCDR3. Our analyses showed that anti-LOS b-mAbs had almost 3-fold higher V gene mutation frequencies compared to antibodies targeting PorB or unknown antigens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Furthermore, anti-PorB and antibodies targeting unknown antigens showed longer HCDR3 (23 – 28 amino acids, compared to 13-15 for anti-LOS b-mAbs), and a higher frequency of positively charged residues compared to anti-LOS b-mAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C-D</xref>). Finally, no major differences in the frequency of hydrophobic amino acids in the HCDR3s were observed among the three groups of antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Immuno-staining of the gonococcal bacterial surface</title><p id="P7">Following functional and genetic characterization of our panel of 17 Gc b-mAbs, we investigated their binding pattern on the surface of Gc FA1090 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Specifically, three different assays were performed: flow cytometry, to evaluate the percentage of bound bacteria in the whole population, immunofluorescence and immunogold, to profile the binding pattern of each antibody on the surface of single bacteria. Flow cytometry data showed that the majority of anti-LOS antibodies (3/4; 75%) bound 88-92% of FA1090 bacterial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, left panel). Only the 02G11 antibody showed a lower ability to bind Gc. Antibodies showing strong recognition by flow cytometry also had a very strong signal in immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, middle panel). In addition, immunofluorescence and immunogold analyses revealed that all anti-LOS b-mAbs bind homogenously the entire surface of Gc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, middle and right panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Anti-PorB antibodies showed two different modalities of binding.

A similar pattern was also observed by confocal and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, middle panel). Indeed, almost all antibodies (8/9; 88.9%) bound homogenously the whole surface of the bacterium, while the remaining antibody (01H12) bound discontinuously the surface of Gc, showing higher binding intensity on specific spots of the bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, middle and right panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>).

While the γ chain is constitutively expressed in both <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, glycan extensions of the α-chain from Hep1 and the β-chain from Hep2 are controlled by a series of phase variable LOS glycosyltransferase (<italic>lgt</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jennings et al., 1999</xref>) resulting in variable length of sugar chains between and within strains.

Although there is no LOS typing scheme defined for Gc, all strains contain an α-chain that can be composed of 2, 3, 4 or 5 sugars, while the β-chain, composed of a lactose, can be present or absent. To shed light on the specificity of the anti-LOS b-mAbs discovered here, we utilized a library of 8 LOS mutants derived from the MS11 4/3/1 strain, in which the 4 variable <italic>lgt</italic> genes were genetically fixed “ON” or “OFF” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chakraborti et al., 2016</xref>).

Specifically, the MS11 mutant strains presented 8 different LOS structures, 4 carrying both α- and β-chains (2HexG+, 3HexG+, 4HexG+ and 5HexG+) and 4 carrying only the α-chain (2HexG-, 3HexG-, 4HexG- and 5HexG-), where G+ and G- refer to mutants in which the status of <italic>lgtG</italic> is fixed “ON” or “OFF” respectively, while the designation 2Hex, 3Hex, 4Hex and 5Hex refers to mutants expressing 2, 3, 4 and 5 sugars respectively in the α-chain. LOS structures 2HexG-, 3HexG- and 4HexG- are known to be shared between Gc and MenB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mubaiwa et al., 2017</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis on the LOS MS11 mutants revealed that all anti-LOS b-mAbs bound to the 2HexG-, 3HexG-, 4HexG- and 5HexG- structures, while the presence of the β-chain impaired bacterial recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). The data indicate that the minimal structure required for these antibodies to bind the LOS was the 2HexG-, characterized by a single α-chain composed of two hexoses and by the absence of the β-chain. To validate the obtained immunoblot data, the 4 anti-LOS b-mAbs were tested for binding on a microarray containing the 4CMenB OMV present in the vaccine, and additional OMVs from 13 MenB strains known to carry different LOS structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McLeod Griffiss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>).

The MenB (NZ98/254) and Gc (FA1090) PorB regions recognized by 01K12, the anti-PorB b-mAb showing the highest functional activity against Gc, were investigated by Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) and by <italic>in silico</italic> Molecular Docking. 4CmenB and Gc detergent-extracted OMVs were labeled with deuterium in the presence or absence of 01K12 and the level of H/D exchange was monitored on 107 and 78 PorB peptides respectively covering more than 98% of the MenB and Gc protein sequences. Upon binding of the b-mAb to 4CmenB OMVs, reduction in deuterium incorporation was observed on 21 overlapping peptides, which defined an epitope involving loop 5 (V186-H194), loop 6 (D215-L235) and loop 7 (S255-L261) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).

By comparing MenB PorB and Gc PorB 3D models a significant difference was observed in the length and structural features of Loop 5, that appeared short and disordered in MenB PorB and instead 13 residues longer and well-structured in Gc PorB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). In Gc PorB, loop 5 belonging to one monomer was oriented towards the adjacent monomer influencing the conformation of the overall epitope region, while this was not observed for MenB PorB. On the basis of these observations, docking epitope definition was confined to the monomer for MenB PorB and to the trimer of Gc PorB.

In this work, we were prompted by recent reports showing that the licensed 4CmenB vaccine induced protection against Gc to investigate the nature of the immune responses resulting from 4CmenB vaccination and to clone and identify MBCs from vaccinees which produced antibodies able to kill Gc. Surprisingly, the antibodies identified recognized only PorB protein and LOS among the many antigens shared by Gc and MenB. These antigens were already known to elicit bactericidal activity but are not considered as priority antigens in MenB or Gc vaccines. The OMV component used in the licensed MenB vaccine had been included in the vaccine largely because they carry the immunodominant PorA antigen which, despite being antigenically variable, induces strong bactericidal response against homologous strains of MenB, but is not present in Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Humphries et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sacchi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Tondella et al., 2000</xref>). PorB, instead, is the most abundant antigen on the gonococcal surface, it is densely present on the bacterial surface and is readily accessible as a target of adaptive immunity. However, PorB has been studied more for its immune evasion properties than as a vaccine antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jones et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, PorB is known to bind C4BP and factor H and to contribute to the serum resistance of Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ram et al., 2001</xref>) and has other immunomodulatory properties. Monoclonal antibodies obtained by immunizing mice with gonococcal strains had been shown to be bactericidal and opsonic in the presence of complement and able to protect epithelial cells against Gc invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Heckels et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Joiner et al., 1985</xref>), however the 70% amino acid sequence similarity between PorB of MenB and Gc suggested a limited cross-protective role against gonococcus. Surprisingly, we demonstrated that MenB PorB was able to elicit cross-functional antibodies against Gc. Indeed, this is the first study reporting the isolation from humans of Gc bactericidal anti-PorB antibodies from subjects immunized with MenB OMVs. More importantly, the most potent PorB antibody has been demonstrated to be sufficient for protection against urovaginal challenge of gonococcus in the mouse model. This has been shown before for the 2C7 LOS antibody, isolated after immunization of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gulati et al., 2019a</xref>). The anti PorB antibodies identified show a great variability in PorB recognition as assessed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. This can probably be explained by the fact that PorB requires RmpM and other proteins to be stabilized at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jansen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marzoa et al., 2010</xref>) and that several of the epitopes identified may recognize conformations stabilized by these interactions. Another important vaccine target is represented by LOS. On a molar basis, LOS is the most abundant gonococcal outer membrane molecule and plays a key role in many facets of pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ram et al., 2018</xref>). Regarding the similarity or LOS between the two <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, it is known that MenB and Gc share common LOS structures that could elicit cross-reactive antibodies. Shared LOS structures carry an α-chain of variable length, while lack the β-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mubaiwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ram et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the NZ98/254 strain predominantly expresses the L1 and L3,7,9 structure shared with Gc bearing an α-chain with 3 and 4 sugars respectively. We found that anti-LOS b-mAbs elicited by MenB OMVs were able to recognize Gc strains carrying LOS structures with α-chain of variable lengths (2 to 5 sugars), likely through binding to the 2Hex- structure as common minimal epitope therein. Importantly the LOS b-mAbs can recognize the Lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) epitope (also referred as L3,7,9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tsai and Civin, 1991</xref>) which is essential for LOS-mediated adherence and invasion and, upon sialylation, promotes Gc serum resistance. Those LOS structures are complementary to the ones recognized by the 2C7 mAb, the anti-gonococcal immunotherapeutic previously identified by the Sanjay Ram group, which binds structures containing a β-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yamasaki et al., 1999</xref>). The fact that antibodies to LOS (2C7) and PorB (01K12) are protective against gonococcal infection in the urovaginal niche, confirms that humoral responses may be sufficient for protection against gonorrhea. It is also interesting that both of these antigens are key molecular interactors in immune evasion against complement, binding complement down-regulators such as factor H and C4BP suggesting that counteracting mechanisms of immune evasion may be essential in immune interventions against gonococcus. The identification of LOS and PorB as antigens inducing cross-functional antibodies paves the way for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against Gc and sheds light on the broad protection conferred by OMVs contained in the 4CMenB vaccine against Gc and MenB which extends beyond what had been predicted with known antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Marjuki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Martinón-Torres et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, our study shows that isolating human mAbs from vaccinated or infected people, a practice which has become very popular for viral infections during the Covid-19 pandemic, can be a useful strategy also to identify key protective antigens among the hundreds of potential targets present in bacteria. The rapid identification of the key protective antigens can be very useful to develop vaccines and therapeutics to address antimicrobial resistance, which is one of the most important medical challenges of our times.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P12">A limitation of this study is that <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization and <italic>in vivo</italic> protection in the gonococcus LGTI mouse model of infection cannot be fully predictive of the behavior of the same antibody in humans and therefore the real benefit of described antibodies can only be assessed in clinical studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Resource Availability</title><sec id="S13"><title>Lead Contacts</title><p id="P13">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contacts, Oretta Finco (<email>oretta.x.finco@gsk.com</email>), Emanuele Andreano (<email>e.andreano@toscanalifesciences.org</email>) and Rino Rappuoli (<email>rino.rappuoli@biotecnopolo.it</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Materials Availability</title><p id="P14">Reasonable amounts of antibodies will be made available by the Lead Contacts upon request under a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) for non-commercial usage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Experimental Models And Subject Details</title><sec id="S16"><title>Human samples ethics statement</title><p id="P15">Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena (IT) provided samples from 4CMenB vaccinees donors, who gave their written consent.

For mAbs hybridization experiments, nonspecific binding was minimized by preincubating the slides with a blocking solution (BlockIt, ArrayIt) for 1□h. mAbs were then diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in BlockIt buffer and overlaid for 1□h at RT prior to undergo two washes with Tween 0.1% in PBS (TPBS). AlexaFluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, cat# 115-605-174) diluted 1:800 was incubated 1 h, before proceeding with slide scanning. Fluorescence images were obtained using InnoScan 710 AL (Innopsys) and the images were generated with Mapix software at 10□μm/pixel resolution. ImaGene 9.0 software (Biodiscovery Inc.) was used to calculate spot fluorescence intensities while the microarray data analysis step was carried out with an <italic>in-house</italic> developed R script. For each protein the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of replicates was obtained after the subtraction of local background values surrounding each spot. MFI were greater than 6,000, corresponding to the MFI of control protein spots after detection with fluorescent-labelled antibodies, plus ten times the standard deviation, were considered positive. MFI scores were ranked in four categories: (1) high reactivity; MFI□≥□30,000; (2) medium reactivity; 15,000□≤□MFI□&gt;□30,000; (3) low reactivity; 6,000□≤□MFI□&gt;□15,000; (4) no reactivity; MFI□&lt;□6,000.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Killing-based Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) on FA1090 Gc strain</title><p id="P33">Functional characterization of b-mAbs was performed by classical serum bactericidal assay (SBA) against FA1090 strain.

of 4CMenB vaccinees (n=3) from which blood was collected and PBMCs isolated. 4CMenB OMVs<sup>+</sup> memory B cells were single cell sorted (n=3,080) and after 2 weeks of incubation B cell supernatant were screened for their binding specificity against different Gc strains. Once identified, Gc binding mAbs (n=390) were recombinantly expressed in RGY and G (HexaBody) scaffolds to evaluate their bactericidal activity to Gc. <bold>(B)</bold> The second step starts with the characterization of identified functional mAbs in the HexaBody scaffold (n=17). Firstly, antibodies were tested to identify their cognate antigen. Next, mAbs were evaluated for their ability to kill different Gc and MenB strains, and for their binding profiles. Finally, the heavy and light chain sequences of mAbs were recovered and repertoire analysis performed. <bold>(C)</bold> Selected anti-PorB and all anti-LOS mAbs were further characterized to identify their targeted epitope. <bold>(D)</bold> In addition, the most promising anti-PorB mAb was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> to evaluate its efficacy in preventing Gc infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192645-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of Gc bactericidal mAbs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> The graphs show 4CMenB OMV+ mAbs binding activity against Gc strains FA1090, F62 and BG27.
