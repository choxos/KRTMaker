Exhibiting an elongated morphology, CAFs align with each other, closely resembling nematic ordering in liquid crystal physics. While these aligned CAFs may act as a defensive barrier hindering tumor expansion, inherent topological defects could represent weak spots, facilitating cancer cell dissemination. CAFs play a pivotal role in the genesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), with ECM proteins, especially fibronectin, reciprocally modulating CAF alignment and coherence. Yet, the intricate feedback loops between fibronectin deposition and CAF structuring remain largely unexplored. Here, we combined CAF live imaging, traction force microscopy, ECM microfabrication, and theoretical modeling to assess how the ECM influences the dynamics of nematically ordered CAFs. We found that CAFs dynamically orchestrate a fibronectin network that mirrors their nematic ordering. Over time, this passive nematic ordering of fibronectin, in turn, steers CAF rearrangement. Contrary to most cellular systems where defects remain dynamic at a steady state, our data highlights that the ECM/CAF interplay profoundly alters the behavior of both CAF and ECM nematics, leading to aging - massive slow down and even freezing of defect dynamics. This leads to a scenario where aligned areas and defects in CAFs layer are spatially and temporally fixed, yet active – exerting forces at the substate and transmitting forces between cells. Such a state could introduce localized vulnerabilities in the CAF layer, potentially promoting cancer cell spreading.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma is cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the early stages of cancer, CAFs and the extracellular matrix (ECM) form a protective capsule that envelops tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and plays a key role in regulating their evolution. Contrary to the belief that this capsule acts passively to prevent tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we have recently found that CAFs exert active compression on cancer cells, thereby triggering mechanical signaling that slows down their proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The ECM is mainly produced and remodeled by CAFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In return, ECM proteins, in particular fibronectin, facilitate communication among fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This intercellular communication favors alignment within the fibroblasts, and coordinates CAFs’ supracellular contractility and dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This results in a reciprocal relationship between ECM-induced cell activities and cell-driven ECM alterations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, that were also reported for other cell types at the single cell level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>; yet the impact of this interaction on the integrated organization of the ECM/CAF capsule and tumor progression is still to be understood.</p><p id="P5">CAFs have an elongated shape and tend to align with each other in a process termed “cell collision guidance” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In liquid crystal physics, the alignment of the long axis of generic apolar elongated particles is described as nematic ordering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Nematic order inherently involves “topological defects” (induced by geometric frustration, thermal fluctuations or activity), which are singular points in space where particles with different orientations meet leading to an ill-defined local alignment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> In cellular monolayers, defects have been described as spots where biologically important cellular behaviors such as extrusion, multilayering and/or polarity changes are favored <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, while the aligned CAFs within the capsule create a barrier that prevents tumor growth and spread, defects in the alignment could provide weak points, allowing cancer cells to escape. In this context, how the ECM/CAF interaction controls the nematic organization and defect dynamics of CAF monolayers and what consequences these dynamics can have on biological functions such as cancer cell dissemination remains unknown.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we combined CAFs live imaging over a long period with traction and stress force microscopy, ECM patterning, and theoretical modeling to assess how the ECM influences the dynamics of CAFs’ nematic alignment. We found that CAFs dynamically orchestrate a fibronectin network that mirrors their nematic ordering. In response and over time, the passive nematic ordering of fibronectin guides the organization of CAFs. In contrast to most cellular systems described so far, and more generally of active nematic systems, in which defects have a finite density and remain dynamic even in steady state - they move, emerge, and annihilate over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> - we show that the ECM/CAF feedback interaction dramatically impacts the dynamics of both the CAFs and ECM nematic fields, leading to aging, massive slow down and even freezing of defect dynamics. As a result, both the aligned areas and topological defects within CAFs and ECM became stationary in both space and time but remained active, with in particular larger traction forces focused at defects, thereby opening the way to localized weakening of the CAF layer that could favor cancer cell dissemination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CAFs, in conjunction with the fibronectin matrix they produce, establish layers that exhibit congruent nematic ordering</title><p id="P7">To investigate whether CAFs exhibit nematic ordering similar to other elongated cells, such as myoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we seeded CAFs isolated from human colorectal tumors on 11 kPa polyacrylamide (PAA) gels coated with monomeric collagen I to maintain physiological substrate rigidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Over time, CAFs established a monolayer, comprising large regions of aligned cells forming nematic order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This nematic ordering was disturbed locally by topological defects, with expected charges of +1/2 and -1/2, and characteristic shapes of comets or triangles, respectively. Both defect charges were observed with a similar density of 1.5 defects/mm<sup>2</sup> within the CAF layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To examine how these defects influence the deposition and organization of fibronectin by CAFs, we assessed a correlation between the orientation of CAFs (based on F-actin staining) and fibronectin once cell monolayer was confluent and nematic order fully established, approximately 6 days after cell seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The comparative analysis of orientation maps revealed a similar local orientation between CAFs and fibronectin layers, with a 92± 5% local correlation of fibers' orientation (N=4 independent experiments).</p><p id="P9">Because nematic ordering affects the local cell density (especially at defects) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and is thus expected to affect fibronectin deposition, we quantified the local density of cells and the amount of fibronectin at defects compared to aligned areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). We found that both types of defects contained about 2.5 times fewer cells and significantly less fibronectin compared to nearby aligned areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Altogether, this data shows that the deposited fibronectin fibers almost perfectly reproduce the nematic ordering of the CAFs layer.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Freezing of the CAFs active nematic is achieved after transient, aging dynamics</title><p id="P11">Typically, active nematics in both biological materials such as cell monolayers and artificial or in silico systems, can reach a chaotic stationary state in which defects emerge, move and annihilate randomly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. If the orientation of fibronectin deposition matches the local CAFs orientation consistently across space and time, then over several days, with CAFs changing dynamically, the cumulative effect of these random orientation signals should produce a fibronectin layer with uniform density and isotropic-oriented fibers. Because our observations contradicted this prediction, we questioned whether the anticipated chaotic stationary dynamics was occurring within the CAFs’ layer. To investigate the dynamics of the defects, we carried out time-lapse imaging of the CAFs’ layer starting 3 days after cell seeding. Over a period of 15 hours, we observed no changes in either the position or shape of the defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Quantitatively, through automatic tracking of the defects' core positions, we generated trajectories relative to the size of the defect, which provides an estimate of the error in determining the position of the defects. We found that the defect’s total displacement was always significantly smaller than the typical defect’s size, and thus within measurement noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>); this indicates that no significant motion of defects, beyond fluctuations, could be observed.</p><p id="P13">This arrested dynamic is in striking contrast with the dynamic defects observed in various active nematic systems, including cell monolayers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A natural question arises regarding the timeline of this process. To analyze the transient dynamics leading to the freezing of the CAF monolayer, we performed time-lapse imaging of the entire CAF layer starting one day after seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The quantification of the evolution of the cellular flows by PIV over time showed a global slowdown, which led to an almost complete arrest after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Taken together, these results show that the dynamics of defects within the CAFs layer exhibit slowdown, or aging, which eventually leads to an arrested state.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>In the nematic-ordered layer, a majority of CAFs remain stationary yet actively exert and transmit forces</title><p id="P15">We next wondered whether the stasis we observed was limited to defects or if it also applies to the individual CAFs within the nematic ordered layer. In other words, was the whole system frozen? To monitor the movement of individual CAFs, we genetically modified the CAFs to express a fluorescent marker (LifeAct-GFP), mixed 20% of these CAFs with unlabeled CAFs and started time-lapse imaging after nematic order was established. Automated tracking of the labeled CAFs over a 15-hour period revealed two distinct types of movements within the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). While a few CAFs showed directed, linear movement with higher velocities of around 6 μm/h and persistence above 1 (see M&amp;M for definition), the majority of CAFs (92% of n=200) appeared to be fluctuating around their initial positions, with no preferred direction of motion. These fluctuating cells displayed slower typical speeds of approximately 1 μm/h, and a persistence below 1, consistent with random motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While a small subset of CAFs exhibited directed migration, most cells were only fluctuating and remained on average immobile, consistent with global freezing of the cellular flow within the full monolayer and not only of defects.</p><p id="P16">Next, we wondered if only cell motility was decreased or if CAFs, in general, became less active. As CAFs are highly contractile cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> we examined if they remain contractile even in stalled defects. For this, we performed traction force and internal stress microscopy to assess the force patterns generated by the CAF layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). For each defect topology, multiple samples were collectively averaged, using their core and direction to align them consistently (for triangle defects, one of the three equivalent directions was used). While low traction forces and internal stress without a discernible pattern were observed in aligned areas, defects show specific force patterns similar to other cellular systems that are not stalled <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In the case of comet defects, traction forces were highest at the head of the comet core with force directions pointing towards the tail of the comet, with the head of the comet showing compression and the tail displaying tension (<bold>Fig. C, D</bold>, left panels). For triangle defects, peaks of traction forces were evident at each triangle vertex with forces directed towards the triangle core; with the center of the triangle under tension (<bold>Fig. C, D</bold>, middle panels). Thus, even though CAFs and defects in their nematic layer are frozen, they are still active as cells continue to exert forces.</p><p id="P17">Such distinctive patterns at defects could potentially stem from the supracellular units formed between CAFs. Indeed, the low traction forces observed in the aligned area suggest that forces are transmitted between the CAFs. As comet core and triangle vertices are the termini of aligned areas, the transmission of forces between CAFs is abolished and forces are transmitted to the substrate, resulting in the visible peaks of traction in both cases.</p><p id="P18">A possible candidate for such interconnections between CAFs is N-cadherin, a key cell-cell adhesion protein in mesenchymal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Alternatively, CAFs could be linked via stitch adhesions with fibronectin acting as a glue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To examine how CAFs were connected, we stained for N-cadherin and fibronectin in CAF layers of varying densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). At lower densities, where CAFs were more spread out and less aligned, we observed N-cadherin at cell-cell junctions. However, as cell density increased, leading to elongated, nematic-ordered CAFs, N-cadherin presence diminished. Conversely, fibronectin puncta, which were already present at lower cell densities, increased in amount as the CAF density increased. These findings suggest that in a nematic ordered layer, CAFs may be indirectly interacting via fibronectin.</p><p id="P19">Therefore, the observed lack of directed movement of both defects and individual CAFs within nematic layers could be attributable to fibronectin depositions interposed between CAFs and the substrate, potentially immobilizing the system.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fibronectin depletion restores the dynamics of cells and defects in CAF nematic layer</title><p id="P20">To assess whether the immobilization of the CAFs layer dynamics was indeed a result of fibronectin deposition, we depleted fibronectin in CAFs using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and performed time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). By tracking individual cells using Hoechst labeling of nuclei, we observed that fibronectin-depleted cells (siFN) exhibited longer and straighter trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), and moved with greater persistence and speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), compared to CAFs treated with control siRNA (siCtrl). Thus, upon depletion of fibronectin, the mobility of CAFs within the layer significantly increased.</p><p id="P21">Subsequently, we assessed whether the increased motility of CAFs in the absence of fibronectin also influenced the dynamics of defects in the CAFs’ nematic layer. To that end, we performed time-lapse imaging of CAFs treated either with siCtrl or siFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Automated tracking of the cores of defects revealed that in the absence of fibronectin, defects become mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). Indeed, while defects in the layer of control CAFs fluctuated around their initial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), defects in the fibronectin-depleted CAFs layer exhibited longer and straighter trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), moving with greater persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). In particular, comet defects were motile, moving along their head-tail direction, indicating that fibronectin-depleted CAFs were forming a contractile nematic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Triangle defects, in contrast, displayed lower speeds and persistence compared to comet defects, likely due to a lack of a preferred migration direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, as expected in active nematics.</p><p id="P22">Finally, for fibronectin-depleted CAFs, the slowdown of cellular flows was significantly less pronounced and did not lead to freezing observed in control CAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Therefore, the fact that both individual cells and defects remain more dynamic in the absence of fibronectin suggests that fibronectin deposition is causing the freezing or aging, of the system.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Established fibronectin patterns freeze CAF nematic dynamics and migration of individual cells</title><p id="P24">Until now, we showed that CAF nematic ordering generated fibronectin patterns with the same nematic order and that such fibronectin deposition was necessary for freezing the system. To further characterize the mechanism of freezing, we tested if the interaction of CAFs with a pre-existing fibronectin pattern could be sufficient to induce the freezing of the dynamics of the CAF layer. For this, we cultured CAFs on PAA gels, allowing them to create nematic ordering and a corresponding fibronectin layer replica (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Subsequently, we removed the CAFs to obtain fibronectin patterns with nematic ordering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, fibronectin 1). On those fibronectin patterns, we then seeded new CAFs. Once these CAFs formed a confluent layer, we determined the organization of CAFs by staining their F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, F-actin). The comparative analysis of orientation maps revealed a similar local orientation between fibronectin patterns and CAFs layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). We also stained for newly deposited fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, fibronectin 2) and found that the organization of the newly deposited fibronectin mirrored the pre-existing fibronectin pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These data show that the fibronectin pattern was instrumental in instructing the CAFs to align into its specific nematic ordering configuration.</p><p id="P25">Next, we explored if fibronectin patterns or, alternatively, fibronectin depositions between CAFs, were responsible for freezing CAF nematics. To discriminate between these possibilities, we produced fibronectin nematic patterns as described above and seeded either control CAFs (siCtrl) or fibronectin-depleted CAFs (siFN) on top of them. As observed above, CAFs aligned according to the fibronectin nematics and defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Over a 15-hour period, no differences were observed in defect position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Indeed, both, control and fibronectin-depleted CAFs fluctuated around their position, with a fluctuation range smaller than the defects’ size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), thus indicating that no significant motion could be observed beyond fluctuations. By tracking individual CAFs within the nematic layer, we found that fibronectin patterns were also sufficient to arrest the migration of individual cells, independently of whether they produce fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Therefore, fibronectin patterns alone were sufficient to arrest the migration of CAFs and defects within the CAFs layer, even if CAFs are unable to produce fibronectin.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A minimal model of active nematic with coupling to a dynamic, passive nematic field recapitulates the observed aging and freezing dynamics</title><p id="P27">So far, experimental observations show that CAFs behave as an active nematic layer that produces a fibronectin matrix with coinciding nematic order and that CAFs respond and align with a pre-existing nematically order matrix; as opposed to active nematic systems described so far, which exhibit a dynamic stationary state, this coupling was found to induce aging dynamics that eventually lead to a frozen state with immobile topological defects and no observable cellular flow despite local active fluctuations.

This effect results in the immobilization of both individual cells and the defects within the CAFs layers. This passive nematic formation stems from the CAFs laying down a fibronectin network that mirrors their inherent nematic order. Notably, this leads to a reduced presence of CAFs and a diminished fibronectin density at defect cores. The primary deposition of fibronectin echoes the nematic organization of the CAFs, which in turn guides the CAFs layer to maintain this specific nematic arrangement. As the CAFs persistently deposit fibronectin following this blueprint, a reinforcing feedback loop between the CAFs and the fibronectin layer emerges. This feedback culminates in a system that progressively solidifies, becoming static over time.</p><p id="P33">The fibronectin deposition does not only halt the movement of defects, but it also restricts the movement of individual CAFs within the layer. This immobilization allowed for the formation of supracellular units consisting of CAFs connected by fibronectin stitch adhesions. These units subsequently generated unique force patterns at defects. The force pattern at comet defects was similar to those observed in MDCK at comet defects where cell extrusion occurs <sup>22</sup>. In tumors, the topological organization of ECM and CAFs correlates with the invasive stage of the tumor and is termed tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. TACS-2 is identified in non-invasive regions of the tumor and is characterized by CAFs and the ECM running parallel to the tumor edge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. On the other hand, TACS-3 is associated with invasive regions where CAFs and the ECM are organized perpendicular to the tumor edge, where they serve as highways for tumor dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that CAF extrusion occurs at the comet defects, which could be followed by a reorientation of these CAFs from parallel to perpendicular to the tumor periphery, and thus switch from TACS2 to TACS3.</p><p id="P34">The force pattern at triangle defects suggests that the CAF layer could potentially pinch the substrate and tumor cells below. This could result in a piercing of the CAF layer and consequently facilitate cancer invasion. Considering the lengthy nature of tumor invasion, the immobilized state of defects could inadvertently promote this invasive activity.</p><p id="P35">In the future, it would be interesting to investigate where cancer cells breach the CAF barrier during cancer invasion. If the breach occurs at defects, understanding the precise mechanisms leading to invasion at these locations could help devise strategies to combat it, potentially preventing metastasis formation in patients.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P36">For this study, we have used CAFs isolated from colon tumor samples of a patient treated at Institut Curie Hospital, Paris, with the patient's written consent and approval of the local ethics committee.

BISM is based on strong statistical hypotheses such as the Gaussian distribution of the stresses. Tests performed by Vicent Nier have shown that BISM is robust and could be applied to different systems as long as they validate the height condition. Only defects inside the layer were taken to avoid boundary issues. In addition, the height condition was validated in this study as the fields of view are 825.6 μm by 598.56 μm, and CAFs height is about 10-15 μm, so BISM can be applied.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Defects averaging</title><p id="P43">Matlab was used to do the analysis.

Finally, for each time point and condition, means of the velocity fields were taken and plotted over time to show the evolution of the fluid flow.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS191539-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d144aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the DMV lab and Pascal Silberzan for helpful discussions.
