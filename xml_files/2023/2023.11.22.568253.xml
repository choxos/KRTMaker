The TGN-localised golgins golgin-97 and golgin-245 capture transport vesicles arriving from endosomes via the protein TBC1D23 that forms a bridge between the golgins and endosome-derived vesicles. The C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 is responsible for vesicle capture, but how it recognises a specific type of vesicle was unclear. A search for binding partners of the C-terminal domain surprisingly revealed direct binding to carboxypeptidase D (CPD) and syntaxin-16, both known cargo proteins of the captured vesicles. Binding is via a TLY-containing sequence present in both proteins. A crystal structure reveals how this “acidic TLY motif” binds to the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23. An acidic TLY motif is also present in the tails of other endosome-to-Golgi cargo, and these also bind TBC1D23. Structure-guided mutations in the C-terminal domain that disrupt motif binding in vitro also block vesicle capture in vivo. Thus, TBC1D23 attached to golgin-97 and golgin-245 captures vesicles by a previously undescribed mechanism: the recognition of a motif shared by cargo proteins carried by the vesicle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The transport of proteins between the organelles of the secretory and endocytic pathways is mediated by tubular/vesicular carriers that bud off donor organelles and then fuse with destination organelles. The process by which the vesicles recognise their correct destination involves tethering factors that mediate the initial capture the vesicle prior to the SNARE proteins in the vesicle and destination membranes forming a complex that then drives membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Depending on the transport step, these tethering factors are long coiled-coil proteins or large protein complexes that are located to a specific organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In the case of the Golgi apparatus these tethers include a set of long coiled-coil proteins called ‘golgins’. They are located to specific parts of the Golgi stack via C-terminal domains that either bind small GTPases or form a single transmembrane domain that spans the Golgi bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Their role as tethers has been clearly demonstrated by the finding that replacing their C-terminal domains with one that directs targeting to mitochondria results in the accumulation of specific Golgi-destined carriers at this ectopic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The ability of golgins to capture vesicles raises the question of how these and other tethers can recognise the correct vesicles. In the case of the golgins, conserved N-terminal regions are necessary and sufficient to mediate vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Three golgins, golgin-97, golgin-245 and GCC88 can capture endosome-to-Golgi carriers, and the first two share a closely related vesicle capture motif at the N-terminus. This motif binds to a cytosolic protein, TBC1D23, a member of the TBC family of Rab GAPs that is unlikely to have GAP activity as it lacks the conserved catalytic residues necessary for stimulating GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). TBC1D23 is located to the Golgi in a manner that is dependent on the presence of golgin-97 and golgin-245, and it can by itself capture vesicles when relocated to mitochondria indicating that it forms a bridge between the golgins and endosome-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In addition to the TBC domain, TBC1D23 has a rhodanese domain, and a C-terminal domain that is related to PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The TBC/rhodanese N-terminal region of the protein binds directly to the N-terminus of golgin-97 or golgin-245, and the C-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient for vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Between these two regions there is a linker region, part of which binds to a complex of three proteins FAM91A1, WDR11, and C17orf75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The function of this complex is unknown, and the part of TBC1D23 that it binds is not required for vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The ability of the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 to capture a specific class of vesicles means that it must recognise a feature shared by these vesicles. Previous studies have shown that the C-terminus can bind to the endosomal WASH complex via the FAM21 subunit which has a long C-terminal tail that also binds several other WASH interactors and regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, WASH is thought to be involved in retromer and retriever-based carrier formation at endosomes, including carriers that are destined for the Golgi and others destined for the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This led to the suggestion that TBC1D23 is able to bind to an additional factor that allows it to specifically capture carriers destined for the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In this paper we describe the application of an unbiased affinity chromatography approach to identify interaction partners of the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 and the report that it can bind directly to the cytoplasmic tails of several of cargo proteins that are found in endosome-to-Golgi carriers. This provides a mechanism by which TBC1D23 and its associated golgins can capture and tether endosome-derived carriers as they arrive at the Golgi.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TBC1D23 binds directly to the cytoplasmic tail of the endocytic cargo carboxypeptidase D (CPD)</title><p id="P5">To identify binding partners for the C-terminal PH-like domain of TBC1D23, we immobilised on beads a GST fusion to the domain and performed affinity chromatography of lysates from 293T cells. Mass-spectrometry of the bound proteins revealed, as expected, that the C-terminal domain could selectively enrich the subunits of the FAM91A1 complex along with the WASH complex subunit FAM21, whilst the N-terminal domain bound to its partner golgins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As is typical for GST fusion-based purifications, the proteins bound to the C-terminal domain contained several abundant chaperones and cytosolic enzymes that are likely to reflect non-specific interactions, but in addition to these we identified carboxypeptidase D (CPD). This metalloprotease is broadly expressed and removes C-terminal basic residues following the action of furin and related proteases on diverse substrates including neuropeptides and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). CPD is known to be primarily localised to the TGN and to recycle through endosomes and the plasma membrane. CPD is a type I protein with a 60-residue cytoplasmic tail, and so to validate this interaction we used a GST fusion to the tail for affinity chromatography from 293T cell lysates. This showed that TBC1D23 has a strong preference for the tail of CPD over that of a control protein - the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), another abundant protein that recycles between endosomes and the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The interaction between TBC1D23 and CPD could be recapitulated with proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, demonstrating that it is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), and use of truncated forms confirmed that it is the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 that binds to the CPD tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the cytoplasmic tail of CPD can form a stable complex with residues 559-684 of TBC1D23, the C-terminal domain that mediates vesicle capture.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TBC1D23 is required for normal trafficking of CPD</title><p id="P6">To test whether TBC1D23 is required for the trafficking of CPD we used CRISPR-Cas9 to remove the TBC1D23 gene from both human 293 cells and the rat insulinoma line INS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S1A</xref>). CPD cycles between endosomes and the Golgi, and for some such proteins it has been found that perturbation of retrieval from endosomes results in their destabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In both knockout cell lines, the steady-state level of CPD was reduced, and this could be rescued by expression of TBC1D23-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In rat INS-1 cells, it was possible to detect CPD by immunofluorescence, and the levels of the protein in the TGN were reduced in the absence of TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Again, this phenotype was rescued by expression of TBC1D23-GFP but not a form lacking the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S1, B to D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 has been previously reported to bind to the FAM21 subunit of the WASH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, removal of FAM21 from 293T cells did not affect the steady state levels of CPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). This indicates that the role of TBC1D23 in CPD traffic does not depend on the presence of FAM21. In contrast, deletion of the two golgins that bind TBC1D23 did reduce overall CPD levels as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S1E</xref>). Taken together, these results show that TBC1D23 is required to maintain steady state levels of CPD in the TGN, and that performing this function involves an activity of TBC1D23 that is distinct from its ability to bind FAM21.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conserved residues in CPD mediate the interaction with TBC1D23</title><p id="P8">To gain more understanding of the interaction between TBC1D23 and CPD, we mapped the region of the CPD tail that is required for binding and found that a C-terminal 16 residue region is necessary and sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). The residues Leu<sup>1375</sup> and Tyr<sup>1376</sup> are particularly important, with upstream conserved acidic residues also contributing which becomes more apparent when several are mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). NMR analysis of the CPD tail showed that the presence of TBC1D23 affected the residues in the C-terminal region around the acidic TLY motif, confirming it binding to this region in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TBC1D23 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of multiple cargoes of endosome-derived vesicles</title><p id="P9">The finding that TBC1D23 can bind directly to the cytoplasmic tail of CPD, a protein that is known to recycle from endosomes back to the Golgi, raised the possibility that this interaction could mediate the capture of endosome-derived vesicles by TBC1D23. However, the capture of such vesicles by TBC1D23 ectopically relocated to mitochondria still occurred in cells from which the CPD gene had been deleted, indicating that binding to CPD is not sufficient to account for vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S3, A to C</xref>). To find further factors that might contribute to vesicle capture in addition to CPD we used GST-TBC1D23 (559-684) for affinity chromatography of HEK-293T cell lysates. As expected, we identified CPD and subunits of the WASH complex amongst the interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Also enriched was the SNARE syntaxin-16, a known cargo of endosome to Golgi carriers, along with one of its interacting partners, the SM protein VPS45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We confirmed that syntaxin-16 is present in vesicles captured by either TBC1D23 or golgin-97 when they are relocated to mitochondria in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S3, D and E</xref>). The syntaxin-16 cytoplasmic domain bound directly to the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain in vitro, and residues 151-225 of syntaxin-16 are both necessary and sufficient for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). CPD binds to TBC1D23 via the sequence EEETLY, and interestingly syntaxin-16 contains a similar sequence: <sub>209</sub>DDNTLY in the exposed linker between the SNARE domain and the Habc domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Mutating the TLY sequence in syntaxin-16 to AAA abolished its binding to TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). While the steady state-levels of syntaxin-16 were not detectably altered in ΔTBC1D23 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S3F</xref>), the Golgi-localised pool of the protein was reproducibly reduced, and this could be rescued by expression of TBC1D23-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, H and I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S3G</xref>). Taken together, our results show that TBC1D23 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of at least two proteins in the vesicles that it captures and thus raise the possibility that this capture could occur via direct and specific interaction with a subset of vesicle cargoes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structural basis of the interaction between TBC1D23 and syntaxin-16</title><p id="P10">To understand how the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 recognises the tails of vesicle cargo we used a combination of X-ray crystallography and biochemistry. Peptides corresponding to the relevant regions of syntaxin-16 and CPD showed robust enthalpic-dominated binding to the C-terminal domain by Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with affinities of ~1.4 and 10.6 μM respectively and a stoichiometry of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Crystallisation of the C-terminal domain in the presence of the syntaxin-16 peptide yielded crystals which diffracted to 3.3 Å resolution and were solved by molecular replacement using the previously published apo structure (6JM5) in space group P6<sub>2</sub>22 (Table S1). Four C-terminal domains were present within the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S4A-C</xref>). Two of the domains dimerised via strand exchange in the same manner as that seen in the peptide-free structure with reciprocal C-terminal tails (VLDALES) inserting between strand 5 and the helix 2 of the other domain, but with no sign of the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In the third domain, the electron density was unclear, but for the final domain density corresponding to a single syntaxin-16 peptide was visible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig S4D</xref>). This peptide density was in the same position that was occupied by the cross-dimerising, C-terminal tail in the first two molecules of the asymmetric unit.</p><p id="P11">Given the above results, we generated a version of the C-terminal domain lacking the last seven residues (VLDALES). Crystals of this truncated domain in the presence of the syntaxin-16 peptide diffracted to higher resolution (2.2 Å) and were solved in space group P6<sub>5</sub>22 again by molecular replacement with unliganded 6JM5 (Table S1). The asymmetric unit contained two copies of the domain with both having density corresponding unambiguously to the syntaxin-16 peptide in the previously proposed binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S4E</xref>). The previously observed strand-exchanged dimer was absent with the homodimeric C-terminal tail-mediated interface being replaced by the peptide. Thus, the structure elucidates how the syntaxin-16 peptide binds to the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The peptide extends TBC1D23’s β sheet by adopting a twisted β augmentation mode of interaction with strand 5, and buries ~670 Å<sup>2</sup> of the C-terminal domain’s solvent accessible surface area, a similar sized interface to those seen previously for other trafficking motif-binding proteins that have a similar K<sub>D</sub> of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The Thr<sup>212</sup> in the acidic TLY motif of syntaxin-16 packs its methyl group against the alkyl chain of Lys628 which orients the hydroxyl group towards the solvent to stabilise a somewhat strained backbone conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). This allows the sidechains of the leucine and tyrosine residues to be splayed apart and simultaneously buried into neighbouring hydrophobic pockets in the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). As a result, the acidic residues Asp<sup>209</sup> and Asp<sup>210</sup> of syntaxin-16 are in close proximity to three basic residues (lysines 632-634) in the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23, which would allow a direct electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mutants in the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain and the syntaxin-16 peptide perturb binding</title><p id="P12">The structure indicates that recognition of the acidic cluster and the TLY triad are the critical factors in driving peptide binding and specificity. To validate this, a series of point mutations was designed in the C-terminal domain and initially assessed for folding by yield and circular dichroism. Two of the residues that form parts of the hydrophobic pockets that bind the L and Y of the peptide (I<sup>629</sup> and I<sup>639</sup>), are also part of the domain’s core hydrophobic residues and their mutation caused misfolding (I629S, I639S). The remaining mutants were assayed for binding to the syntaxin-16 peptide by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). K<sup>672</sup> of TBC1D23 hydrogen bonds via its amine group to the carboxyl peptide bond of L<sup>213</sup> in the TLY in syntaxin-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>); mutation to alanine (K672A) weakened binding ~20 fold (K<sub>D</sub>~30 μm). Mutation of Val<sup>626</sup>, which packs against the aromatic ring of reside Y<sup>214</sup>, to aspartate (V626D) abolishes peptide binding. The binding pocket in TBC1D23 for Y<sup>214</sup> was obstructed by mutating one of its lining residues (I675W), and again this reduced binding to below detectable levels (K<sub>D</sub> &gt;300μM). Finally, mutation to alanine of lysines 632-634, which are adjacent to the TLY-binding hydrophobic grove, also abolished peptide binding, indicating that their interaction with the acidic cluster in syntaxin-16 is important. Thus, mutations which either remove interactions with the peptide, or protrude into the binding pocket strongly affect peptide binding confirming that the interactions seen in the crystal also occur in solution.</p><p id="P13">Mutations were also made in the syntaxin-16 peptide to further validate the interactions observed in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). ITC assays confirmed a role in binding for all three of the residues in the acidic TLY motif and for the two adjacent acidic residues, with R<sup>216</sup> making a smaller contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). The acidic TLY motif is absolutely conserved between syntaxin-16 and CPD, and so to determine if conservative changes in the motif can be tolerated, we tested variants of these three residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S4F</xref>). Mutation of T<sup>212</sup>, which holds the leucine and tyrosine in a strained position to allow engagement with their pockets, to serine (T212S) reduced binding ~20 fold to K<sub>D</sub>~30 μM. Changing L<sup>213</sup> to the smaller alanine (L213A) or the larger phenylalanine (L213F) both caused a reduction of binding of &gt;100 fold, consistent with the side-chain fitting into a size-specific hydrophobic pocket in the structure, i.e. a medium sized hydrophobic residue is required at this position. Finally, Y<sup>214</sup> is more tolerant of conservative mutation with Y214W and Y214F peptides having K<sub>D</sub>S of ~7 μM and ~15 μM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Use of the C-terminal-domain binding motif to identify further binding partners</title><p id="P14">Although both syntaxin-16 and CPD bind to the C-terminal domain through a closely related motif, the only functional property that they share is the fact that they are both in vesicles that recycle between endosomes and Golgi and can be captured by TBC1D23. We thus wondered if there were further proteins in these vesicles that also have an acidic TLY motif that can bind TBC1D23. Peptide motifs that are recognised by proteins are rarely invariant, and so other versions of the motif are likely to be functional. From the above mutagenesis experiments and the nature of the interactions seen in the structure, we chose [DE]<sub>&gt;=3/5</sub>[TS][LIV][YFW] as being a loose but plausible definition of the core binding motif for the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain and used this to search the predicted cytoplasmic tails of all membrane proteins in the human proteome. In addition, we looked for membrane proteins amongst the interactors reported for TBC1D23 in the BioPlex protein interaction screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The latter approach identified four membrane proteins, three of which are reported to be in the endosome/Golgi system, and one of unknown location. The former approach identified 19 membrane proteins of which 10 are reported to be endosomal or Golgi, with two proteins found by both approaches (Table S2). We thus tested the ability of the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain to bind to peptides corresponding to the TLY-like region from several of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig.

KIAA0319 is a neuronal protein linked to dyslexia, and although its function remains unknown, it has been reported to recycle from the surface back to the Golgi region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The peptide from KIAA0319 peptide showed weaker, but detectable binding with K<sub>D</sub>~ 35 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig. S5</xref>). FAM174A and its paralogues FAM174B and FAM174C are small membrane proteins of unknown function that have been reported to be in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). All have a TLY-like motif and the peptide from FAM174C bound with an affinity of 16 μM. Finally, TVP23B/C is a small polytopic membrane protein known to recycle between endosomes and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), and its 34 residue cytoplasmic tail bound to the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain with this interaction disrupted by mutating the three lysine residues in TBC1D23 that we have shown to be required for binding CPD and syntaxin-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In contrast, no binding was seen with peptides from CIMPR, which also traffics between Golgi and endosomes and has an acidic region in its tail but no TLY-like motif, and SLAMF7 which has a TLY-like motif but smaller acidic cluster that contains a proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, multiple proteins that recycle between endosomes and Golgi have sequences in their cytoplasmic tails that can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Residues in TBC1D23 that are required for binding the acidic TLY motif are also required for vesicle capture in vivo</title><p id="P16">The presence in endosome-to-Golgi vesicles of diverse proteins with a TLY-like motif in their cytoplasmic tails raises the possibility that TBC1D23 can capture these vesicles by binding to the tails protruding from the vesicle. TBC1D23 is sufficient to capture vesicles when relocated to mitochondria, and so we tested the effect on this capture of mutations that disrupt peptide binding in vitro. Relocation of vesicles by the constructs was quantified with BioID proximity biotinylation by using a promiscuous biotin ligase fused to TBC1D23 along with the mitochondrial targeting signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). When wild-type TBC1D23 was expressed on mitochondria, vesicle cargo was efficiently biotinylated as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). However, mutation of the residues that disrupt peptide binding in vitro resulted in a near complete loss of biotinylation of vesicle cargo proteins indicating that vesicle capture was also disrupted. This is not simply due to the vesicle being docked by a different mechanism, as immunofluorescence demonstrated that these cargo proteins were no longer accumulating on the TBC1D23-coated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the same part of TBC1D23 that binds to the tails of vesicle cargo in vitro is required for vesicle capture in vivo, consistent with a model in which TBC1D23 can capture the incoming vesicle by recognising its cargo proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">The C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 was known to be sufficient to capture one or more of the classes of carrier that mediate transport of membrane proteins from endosomes to Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Our search for binding partners of this domain has now revealed that it can bind directly to the cytoplasmic tails of several of the cargo proteins that are present in these vesicles via a conserved acidic TLY motif. This interaction provides a mechanism by which TBC1D23 displayed on the ends of golgin-97 and golgin-245 can recognise specific vesicles and thus tether them to the trans Golgi prior to subsequent SNARE engagement and vesicle fusion. For both CPD and syntaxin-16, their predicted structures indicate that the acidic TLY motif is likely to be located at some distance from the TMD and hence the vesicle membrane. The unstructured tail of CPD or the α-helical bundle of syntaxin-16 are predicted to place the motif ~15 nm away from the membrane which would allow recognition to be unimpeded by the vesicle surface.</p><p id="P18">The direct binding of a tethering factor to the cargo carried by a vesicle has not been previously proposed as a mechanism for vesicle capture but it would certainly ensure that only a specific set of vesicles is recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Like all such tethering interactions, the mechanism requires that the tether binds only to the vesicle and not to the organelle from which the cargo-laden vesicle budded. It is possible to imagine several ways in which this could be achieved. TBC1D23 is primarily localised at the Golgi as determined by both immunofluorescence and organelle fractionation, indicating that the interaction of its N-terminal domain with golgin-97 and golgin-245 is the dominant factor in determining its localisation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In addition, the golgins are homodimers and so each golgin is likely to display two copies of TBC1D23 which would increase the avidity of the interaction with the tails in the vesicle over that of a monomer of TBC1D23 that was free in the cytoplasm. Indeed, it may be that interaction between TBC1D23 and the cargo proteins is only strong enough to capture a vesicle when an array of TBC1D23 presented on multiple golgins can interact with multiple TLY-containing proteins that are concentrated in a single vesicle and hence the avidity of the interaction is increased even further.</p><p id="P19">Another mechanism that could account for TBC1D23 only recognising cargo proteins that are present in vesicles is that the acidic TLY motif in the cargo proteins could be masked in some way when the cargo is in endosomes and other compartments. This could occur if the coat proteins that sort them into the retrograde pathway rapidly sequester them into forming carriers, and that the interaction with the coat prevents recognition of the acidic TLY motif by TBC1D23 until the carrier has budded and uncoated. The identity of the coat that makes the carriers captured by TBC1D23 is as yet unresolved as there are multiple routes back from endosomes to the Golgi, with both clathrin coats with the AP-1 adaptor and also sorting nexins with retromer proposed to be involved in generating carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the acidic TLY motif includes a stretch of acidic residues, and acidic clusters can act as sorting signals for packaging into clathrin/AP-1 coated carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Both CPD and syntaxin-16 are known to be enriched in AP-1-dependent clathrin-coated vesicles, although whether such vesicles are delivering cargo to or from the trans Golgi also remains to be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P20">There are known to be multiple classes of vesicle arriving at the Golgi from endosomes, and although TBC1D23 appears to responsible for the capture of at least some of these, the mechanism by which the others are captured is unknown. The golgin GCC88 captures at least one such set of vesicles even though it does not bind TBC1D23, but how this is achieved is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This multiplicity of endosome to Golgi routes with only some carriers being captured by TBC1D23 is consistent with human mutation of TBC1D23 resulting primarily in neurodevelopmental defects despite being widely expressed in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). It may be that when TBC1D23-dependent tethering is lost, other capture mechanisms can partially compensate, or some cargo proteins can return to the Golgi by some of the alternative routes.</p><p id="P21">The enrichment of a particular set of proteins in each specific type of transport vesicle is only one type distinguishing feature that would allow the specific recognition necessary to ensure the fidelity of intracellular traffic. For most trafficking steps, vesicle recognition remains poorly understood. In some cases Arf or Rab GTPases are believed to play a role, although they too are likely to be present on donor organelles resulting in the same issues of vesicle versus donor organelle identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Our finding that a tethering factor can recognise a set of cargo proteins in the carriers that it captures not only sheds light on endosome to Golgi traffic but could also illuminate other membrane trafficking routes where the mechanism of vesicle recognition remains to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P22">Details of the plasmids used in this report, together with the cloning methods used to generate are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">data S3</xref>.

Peptides mapped to known contaminants and reverse hits were removed, and only protein groups identified with at least two peptides, one of which was unique, and two quantitation events were considered for data analysis. Each protein had to be detected in at least two out of the three replicates. Missing values were imputed by values simulating noise using the Perseus’ default settings. To calculate p-values, t-tests was performed.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Expression of <sup>15</sup>N labelled CPD(1321-1380) for NMR analysis</title><p id="P38">The GST-CPD(1321-1380) fusion contains a PreScission protease cleavage site downstream of the GST tag.

Excess of glutathione-Sepharose beads (500 μL of bead slurry per litre of 2xTY culture) were incubated with the clarified bacterial lysate for 1h at 4°C.

The assignment of backbone NH, N, Cα, Cβ and C’ resonances of the 86 μM <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C CPD (residues 1321-1380) sample was completed using standard 3D datasets acquired as pairs to provide own and preceding carbon connectivities, and between 20-40% non-uniform sampling to aid faster data acquisition. Both the HNCO and HN(CA)CO experimental pair and the CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB pair were collected with 1024, 64 and 96 complex points in the proton, nitrogen and carbon dimensions respectively. Nitrogen connectivities were established using (H)N(COCA)NNH and (H)N(CA)NNH experiments with 2048, 64 and 96 complex points in the proton, direct and indirect nitrogen dimensions respectively.

The backbone assignment was completed using MARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Binding of TBC1D23 to the CPD construct was observed by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY. Unlabelled TBC1D23 was added to <sup>15</sup>N labelled CPD with a final concentration of both proteins at 38 μM. The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY spectrum was compared to a second spectrum recorded for a 38 μM sample of free <sup>15</sup>N CPD. While some small peak perturbations were observed the main differences caused by TBC1D23 binding were line broadening. This was quantified by taking the peak height ratios of the bound and free spectra. To analyse the chemical shift perturbations the following equation was used to report calculated the distance between each peak in the bound spectrum when compared to the assigned, free CPD: Δδ“total”= ((δH)^2+ (δN/5)^2)^0.5, With the smallest value reported as the minimal chemical shift perturbation.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry</title><p id="P40">Experiments were performed using a Nano ITC machine from TA Instruments. TBC1D23 C-terminal domains were gel filtered into buffer composed of 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 1 mM TCEP. Peptides were dissolved in the same batch of buffer. Both the WT and mutant C-terminal domains were concentrated to 100 μM (1.4 mg/ml) with peptide concentration varying between 0.8 and 5 mM (depending on a peptide). Peptides were titrated into TBC1D23 C-terminal domains with 20 injections of 2.4 μl each separated by 300 second intervals. Experiments were conducted at 20°C. A relevant syringe-peptide-into-buffer blank was subtracted from all data and for constructs which displayed measurable binding, three independent runs that showed clear saturation of binding were used to calculate the mean K<sub>D</sub> of the reaction, the stoichiometry (n), and the corresponding SEM values using NanoAnalyze. Both curves and trace data were subsequently exported for figure generation in Prism.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Protein expression and purification for structural analysis</title><p id="P41">Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 plyS <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in shaking 2xTY media at 37°C.

Structures were solved by molecular replacement with PHASER MR using a single copy of the TBC1D23 C-terminal domain of (6JM5) with zinc and water molecules removed as a search model. REFMAC5 was used for iterative rounds of refinement interspersed by manual rebuilding of the model using COOT. Crystallographic programs were ran using the CCP4i2 package and figures were rendered using UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarised in Table S1. Electron density of the full length TBC1D23 domain structure in the presence of syntaxin-16 peptide clearly showed C terminal tails bound in two molecules, syntaxin-16 bound in a third with the fourth being somewhat ambiguous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">fig.

Deletion of the C-terminal tail (VLDALES) and inclusion of syntaxin-16 peptide resulted in a structure whose electron density when solved by MR using 6JM5 minus the VLDALES as the search model, unambiguously showed the syntaxin-16 peptide bound in all molecules.
