Using live-imaging of mouse embryos between gastrulation and heart tube formation, we tracked individual mesodermal cells and reconstructed their lineage trees for up to five cell divisions. We found independent unipotent progenitors emerging at specific times, contributing exclusively to either left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progenitors differentiated early to form the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors later generated the heart tube’s inflow tract during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent progenitors with broad potential, illustrating early developmental plasticity. Sister cells from bipotent progenitors displayed greater dispersion and more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm than those from unipotent progenitors. Bipotent progenitors contributing to extraembryonic mesoderm (ExEm) exhibited the fastest and most dispersed migrations, whereas those giving rise to endocardial, LV/AVC, and pericardial cells showed a more gradual divergence, with late-stage behavioural shifts: endocardial cells increased in speed, while pericardial cells slowed relative to LV/AVC cells. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">How cell fate specification and morphogenesis are coordinated in time and space to generate tissues and organs of unique forms and functions is central to developmental biology.

Unipotent <italic>Mesp1+</italic> progenitors are solely destined for the left ventricle (LV) and atria myocardium can be distinguished from unipotent endocardium progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Additional clonal analysis of <italic>Hand1+</italic> progenitors located at the embryonic/extraembryonic boundary in the early gastrulating embryo identified bipotent and tripotent progenitors. These progenitors generated LV/AVC myocytes in addition to pericardium, epicardium, and extraembryonic tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">One limitation of clonal analysis, however, is that the history of the cells is <italic>deduced</italic> by analysing descendants at the endpoint. It does not allow the identification of the progenitors’ initial locations or subsequent migratory paths in the embryo. Single-cell tracking in live-imaging is needed for this and is the most rigorous approach to reconstituting cell lineages, identifying when cardiac progenitors become lineage-restricted during gastrulation and enabling migration analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">A recent live-imaging analysis uncovered the dynamics of mesodermal cell migration during mouse gastrulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed that cells dispersed extensively in the embryo, with clearly separate movements of daughter cells, suggesting cell identity may not be fixed but instead influenced by the position of the cells at the end of the migration period. However, as Dominguez et al. discussed, the motility of mesodermal cells is unlikely to be completely random <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. There may be some regulation of directionality of individual cell migration to ensure progeny migrate to their correct locations and establish spatial patterns, including the cardiac crescent and distinct LV/AVC and atrial progenitor domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Indeed, a previous migration analysis showed mesodermal cell migrate with directionality during mouse gastrulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, early mammalian mesoderm migration may exhibit some degree of determinism. This phenomenon is reminiscent of an evolutionarily distinct species, the ascidian, in which a small number of genealogically related and determined heart progenitors migrate with predetermined directionally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, it is not known whether progenitors adopt more stereotypical migratory trajectories, once committed to specific cardiac fates in the context of mammalian gastrulation.</p><p id="P6">Here, through long-term live imaging and single-cell tracking in mouse embryos, spanning from the initiation of gastrulation to the stages of heart tube formation, our goal was to reconstitute the lineage tree of cells and assess how the migratory paths of cells relate to their eventual cardiac fate within the seemingly unorganised migration pattern.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development and characterisation of <italic>cTnnT-2a-eGFP</italic> mice</title><p id="P7">To track cardiomyocytes in vivo, we developed a knock-in mouse reporter line <italic>cTnnT-2a-eGFP</italic> where the <italic>eGFP</italic> sequence is inserted downstream of the endogenous <italic>cardiac troponin T</italic> (<italic>cTnnT</italic>) loci.

At later somite stages (E8.25), the cardiac crescent has generated the heart tube. The heart tube has an inverted Y shape, and the two arms of the Y -or inflows-, positioned inferiorly, are fated to become the atria, with the stem of the Y becoming the left ventricle (LV) and atrioventricular canal (AVC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Doses of tamoxifen (0.02 mg/bw) were administered at successive gastrulation stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Early administration at E6+7h resulted in sparse tdTomato+ labelling of myocytes, endocardial, and pericardial cells in the cardiac crescent (n=3/3 embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-H</xref>), as well as in the endoderm. Later administration at E6+21h showed similar sparse labelling in most cases (n=7/10 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Fii</xref>), while in some cases (n=3/10 embryos), no contribution to GFP+ myocytes cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Fiii</xref>). As previously noted, variability in embryonic stages within litters at E6+21h likely explains these differences, with some embryos at more advanced stages having already downregulated <italic>T/Bra</italic> expression in cardiac crescent progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">For both E6+7h and E6+21h tamoxifen regimens, a higher number of tdTomato+ <italic>cTnnT-2a-eGFP+</italic> myocytes were labelled compared to endocardial and pericardial progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). This disparity suggests that the initial T/Bra-expressing mesoderm contains a greater number of myocyte progenitors. This finding likely explains the higher number of myocytes in the cardiac crescent relative to endocardial and pericardial cells. In some cases (n=5/13 embryos), we observed a large number of tdTomato-labeled GFP+ myocytes (between 57 and 127 cells) with rare or no corresponding tdTomato-labeled endocardial cells (between 0 and 8 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Giii</xref>).

These results are consistent with a previous Foxa2 lineage tracing study, which identified independent <italic>Foxa2+</italic> progenitors contributing to ventricular myocytes, pericardium, and epicardium, but not the endocardium with a similar tamoxifen regimen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">When tamoxifen was administered at E7+7h, we observed a rare contribution of tdTomato+ cells to myocytes in the cardiac crescent (n=3/8 embryos, mean 10 tdTomato+ myocytes per embryo) and no contribution to endocardial or pericardial progenitors for all embryos analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Giii</xref>). At the heart tube stage, however, there was a strong contribution of tdTomato+ cells to inflow myocytes (&gt;100 cells in all embryos analyzed, n=4/4 embryos), and inflow endocardial cells (39 cells on average, n=4/4 embryos) which are destined to form the atria during later development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Ii-ii</xref>). This finding suggests an independent source of T/Bra-positive late mesodermal cells contributing to inflow myocytes and endocardium, as indicated in previous lineage tracing studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Determining the clonal relationship between these cell populations will require tracing individual progenitors from their mesodermal origins to their final positions in the heart tube. As previously noted in a similar experiment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we also observed cases with sparse tdTomato+ endocardial cells in the ventricular regions, without any tdTomato+ cells in the ventricular myocyte GFP+ layer (n=2/4 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Iii</xref>). This observation further supports the idea that independent sources exist for myocyte and endocardial progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Establishing long term light-sheet live microscopy for cardiac lineage analysis</title><p id="P14">We employed live imaging and single-cell tracking, using the cardiomyocyte-specific cTnnT-2a-eGFP reporter, to reconstruct the lineage trees of mesodermal cells.

Embryos were imaged at 2 minutes intervals. Raw data amounts to 5-7 terabytes per experiment, representing up to half a million images. To correct for drift during acquisition, BigStitcher <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> was used to register the datasets in 4D as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Each movie contains up to ~1200 time points, and a small percentage (&lt;1%) of linkage inaccuracy between cells could lead to lineage misinterpretation that propagates over the course of the movie.

To obtain accurate cell lineages, we manually tracked single <italic>T/Bra</italic> lineage positive cells by visualising them at successive time points from the beginning to the end of the movie using Massive Muti-view Tracker (MaMut) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

A substantial number of mother cells (n=111) produced at least one progeny whose fate could not be determined. In these cases, we could not determine if the mother cells were unipotent or multi-potent. This limitation may be due to some cells not reaching the GFP threshold required for classification as myocytes, likely influenced by their position in deeper embryo sections. Finally, the locations of the myocyte <italic>cTnnT-2a-eGFP</italic>+ cells within the LV/AVC and inflow regions of the heart tube indicated their fates.

These findings suggest that while many mesodermal progenitors are committed to a myocyte fate, a substantial proportion of bipotent progenitors also exist.

In contrast, bipotent progenitors contributing to endocardial, LV/AVC and pericardial cells showed a more gradual divergence in migratory paths. This divergence was characterized by a late-stage increase in speed for endocardial cells, while pericardial cells exhibited a concurrent decrease in speed relative to LV/AVC progenitors.

While progenitors are seen giving rise to only one cardiac cell type, they could potentially generate additional cardiac fates when no longer constrain by positional cues.

This balance enables cells to follow specific developmental pathways while also maintaining the flexibility needed to adapt to changing external cues.</p><p id="P56">Together, our live-imaging analysis of migration and cardiac lineages provides evidence that some regulation of directionality of cell movements and fate allocation may exist early within the mesoderm.

Progenitors’ coordinates were sampled at two distinct time points: at the end of migration and during the stages when the heart tube forms. We only considered branches lasting at least 4 hours into the cell cycle to allow sufficient cell migration. The migration period for early proximal mesoderm cells, which include the LV/AVC, ExEm, endocardial, and pericardial cells, was defined as the time from the beginning of the movie until the completion of cell migration, marked by the mean differentiation time of the LV/AVC region. The mean differentiation times for LV/AVC cells were 20.7 hours for Movie 1, 20.8 hours for Movie 2, 17.3 hours for Movie 3, 16.3 hours for Movie 4, and 11.5 hours for Movie 5. The subsequent heart tube morphogenesis period extended from the end of the migration phase until the end of the movie, corresponding to the stages of heart tube formation. For atrial cells, the migration period concluded at the mean atrial differentiation time. The mean differentiation times for inflow cells were 29.1 hours for Movie 1, 26.8 hours for Movie 3, 23.3 hours for Movie 4, and 19.8 hours for Movie 5.
