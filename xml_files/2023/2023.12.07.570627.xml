The C-terminal proline rich domain (PRD) of these proteins binds Sec23A and affects COPII assembly at ERES. These PRD interactions were replaced with light-responsive domains to control the binding between TANGO1S-ΔPRD and Sec23A. TANGO1SΔPRD was dispersed in the ER membrane but relocated rapidly, yet reversibly, to pre-exiting ERES by binding to Sec23A upon light-activation. Prolonged binding of these two proteins concentrated ERES in the juxtanuclear region by a microtubule dependent process, blocked secretory cargo export and relocated ERGIC53 into the ER, but had limited impact on Golgi complex organization. Under these conditions, bulky collagen VII, and endogenous collagen I were collected at less than 47% of the stalled ERES, whereas small cargo molecules were halted uniformly across the ER, indicating that ERES differentially adapt to cargo size. We suggest these differences in cargo-accumulation at ERES permit cells to balance trafficking of cargoes of different sizes and optimize secretion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A third of the cellular proteome enters the endoplasmic reticulum, and most of this pool is exported from specialized domains called ER exit sites (ERES).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> The export process is mediated by coat proteins (COPII) complex. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Sec12 located in the ER membrane, catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the cytoplasmic protein Sar1.

The LOV2 domain undergoes a reversible conformational change in blue light and exposes the SsrA peptide. The now accessible SsrA peptide forms a dimer with its binding partner SspB. When blue light is removed, the domain undergoes a reversible conformational change, masking the SsrA peptide and causes a separation of the two peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> As a blue light source, either a 488nm laser (for live imaging) or an in-lab designed blue LED set up (for fixed cells) was used. The N-terminus of Sec23A was tagged with EGFP-SspB while the C-terminus of TANGO1S and TANGO1SΔPRD were tagged with SsrA (also indicated as mCherry-iLID or mCh-iLID, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The modified TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID is localized uniformly throughout reticular and nuclear envelop membranes of the ER. The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the expected effect of blue light on proteins generated by our procedures. During light-activation TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID binds to EGFP-SspB-Sec23A, and this dimerization is reversed in the absence of the blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">A stable U2OS cell line co-expressing TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and EGFP-SspB-Sec23A was developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-C</xref>). In the absence of blue light (BL), EGFP-SspB-Sec23A is localized as discrete puncta and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID is distributed throughout the ER. The zoomed overlay image on the right shows EGFP-SspB-Sec23 puncta, marked by yellow arrowheads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). When cells are exposed to blue light, the activation of SsrA (iLID) on the TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID enables it to bind to EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and localize to the ERES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Live cell imaging revealed this reposition of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID to EGFP-SspB-Sec23A puncta occurred within few seconds. The zoomed overlay image shows ERES marked by yellow arrowheads, which are now populated by both EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID, observed as white puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Within 3 min of turning off the blue light, the entire pool of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID dissociates from EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and is dispersed throughout the ER. EGFP-SspB-Sec23A still remains localized to puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Blue light irradiation did not have any effect on the stability of modified proteins in the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). The average number of newly formed puncta of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID (210 ± 70) was comparable to the average number of puncta of EGFP-SspB-Sec23A (212 ± 55) after exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). There was a small but significant increase in the number of puncta marked by EGFP-SspB-Sec23A before and after blue light, which suggested that TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID recruitment to puncta, was accompanied by enhanced assembly of EGFP-SspB-Sec23A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The average Feret diameters of puncta of both the proteins were estimated to be around 0.5 μm, suggesting similar organization of the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). To confirm that puncta marked by EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID are ERES, we further investigated the composition of these sites.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Real time recruitment of TANGO1SΔPRD to ERES by opto-genetics</title><p id="P9">Using the system described above, U2OS cells co-transfected with EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID were exposed to blue light, fixed, and stained with antibodies against ERES markers (Sec16A and Sec31A), cTAGE5.

Sec16L-GFP was observed as discrete puncta at ERES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) while the ER-distributed TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) was recruited to Sec16L-GFP containing puncta after 3 min exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar observation was made for stable cells transfected with Sec13-GFP, which was observed as discrete puncta as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID populated these ERES with blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">These experiments confirm that puncta formed by TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID were majorly a result of its accumulation at pre-existing ERES (marked by Sec16L and Sec13) while it remained bound to SspB-Sec23A. The average number of the ERES marked by Sec16L-GFP and Sec13-GFP were 300 ± 136 and 235 ± 38 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3F, G</xref>), and their average Feret diameters were ~0.5μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3H, I</xref>) respectively, albeit enhanced recruitment of these component after blue light was not significant. These quantifications matched the features of puncta observed for TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). Overall, our data suggests that we achieved spatial and temporal control over the binding between TANGO1S and the COPII inner layer (Sec23) while both localize to ERES.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Optogenetically formed ERES undergo fusion and fission and their formation requires Sar1 activity</title><p id="P13">ERES have been previously shown to undergo fusion and fission events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> Similar events were also observed in our system. Upon exposure to blue light, the discrete puncta formed by accumulation of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and EGFP-SspB-Sec23A exhibited dynamic fission and fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-3C</xref>). It has been reported that the fusion within two distinct ERES are identified by an increase in fluorescence intensity of Sec23A post fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> In our observations of visible ERES coalescing events, the mean gray values of EGFP-SspB-Sec23A and TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID per ERES (post fusion) revealed a ~1.5-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity, implicating an increase in number of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, the persistent association of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and EGFP-SspB-Sec23A at ERES, driven by blue-light does not alter the dynamic nature of ERES. For this reason, our data suggest that the fusion events do not rely on the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis by the small GTPase Sar1 and rather are more akin to the physical behavior of protein-protein phase separation at ERES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">We also observed that ERES transiently associate into continuous structures (indicating fusion) that contain both TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and EGFP-SspB-Sec23A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow dotted oval).</p><p id="P15">The recruitment of Sec23/Sec24 to the ER membranes begins with insertion of Sar1-GTP into the outer leaflet of the ER membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> H89 inhibits the recruitment of Sar1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and its activation on ER membranes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> directly affecting the formation of ERES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The highly dynamic nature of COPII coat at ERES negates prolonged COPII-MT interactions and long-range movement. However, ERES at the juxtanuclear region close to Golgi are more abundant in number, and hence many ERES are visible in that region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Here we suggest that prolonged binding of TANGO1S to Sec23 upon blue light exposure potentially stabilizes dynein-ERES interactions. This lack of dynamics led to the accumulation of ERES in the juxtanuclear region, now visible as fused structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Treatment with nocodazole which depolymerizes microtubules, does not alter the binding of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID to EGFP-SSPB-Sec23A, upon blue light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, the ERES remain spread out and do not move to the juxtanuclear region, indicating their movement in cells is microtubule dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The results suggest that COPII-MT motor binding leads to the mobilization of TANGO1S-containing ERES toward the MTOC. The physiological roles for an “in membrane” movement of ERES in sorting and traffic remains to be defined. The results further suggest that COPII dynamics is inhibited during light activation. We therefore studied the consequences of stabilizing the ERES on cargo sorting and traffic.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Prolonged TANGO1SΔPRD-Sec23A interaction interferes with cargo export from ERES</title><p id="P17">It has been proposed that the sorting at ERES is processive, where the turnover of COPII is utilized to concentrate and sort cargo at ERES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> Previous studies however utilized prolonged expression of mutant Sar1 proteins or in vitro reactions where the GTPase activity of Sar1 was inhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> As an alternative approach, we utilized our optogenetic tools to investigate the effects of prolonged (but reversible) TANGO1S-Sec23 binding on cargo secretion. We chose a model cargo, FM4-EGFP-PAUF, a fusion protein of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Up-regulated Factor (PAUF) that contains a self-dimerizing domain, DmrD causing its aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. When expressed in cells, it is accumulated in the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). Upon adding a D/D solubilizer, the aggregates dissociate, and the soluble cargo moves to the Golgi within 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). We combined this synchronized transport of FM4-EGFP-PAUF with the optogenetic tool. FM4-EGFP-PAUF in its aggregated state labels the ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> marked by yellow arrowheads). As previously shown, continuous irradiation with blue light for 20 min, leads to clustering of ERES to the juxtanuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), however, this does not affect cargoes trapped in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The mean Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and FM4-EGFP-PAUF was measured at juxtanuclear region marked by yellow dotted box (details in methods and materials). The PCC shows no statistical difference with time in absence of D/D solubilizer, as the FM4-EGFP-PAUF remains in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, empty bars; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). Upon removal of blue light, TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and SspB-Sec23A dissociate, and within few minutes TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID dispersed in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Continuing the same experiment (in the same cell) D/D solubilizer (1.0 μM) was added and immediately cell was exposed again to blue light for 20 min. The D/D solubilizer dissociates the aggregates of FM4-EGFP-PAUF, and the soluble form is available for secretion from the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). However, upon stabilization of TANGO1S-Sec23 by blue light, the now solubilized FM4-EGFP-PAUF accumulated at ERES that clustered at the juxtanuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Upon TANGO1S-Sec23 dissociation (turning off the blue light), the soluble FM4-EGFP-PAUF left the ER and was trafficked to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). A significant change in mean of PCC between TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and FM4-EGFP-PAUF was evident for the time points 15 min and 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, filled bars, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the selective concentration of traffic-competent, disaggregated FM4-EGFP-PAUF at ERES, progressed over time. This contrasts with the lack of concentration of traffic-incompetent aggregated FM4-EGFP-PAUF at ERES during such experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Prolonged stable binding of TANGO1S to Sec23 results in a block in secretion of cargo from ER, concentrating the cargo at ERES. Thus, processive activity of the coat inner layer was not required for concentrating FM4-EGFP-PAUF at ERES but blocked ER exit.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Anterograde transport of ERGIC53 is blocked but retrograde transport is unaffected by prolonged TANGO1SΔPRD-Sec23A binding</title><p id="P18">The lectin ERGIC53 is a transmembrane cargo receptor that cycles between the ER and ERGIC and is predominantly visible as tubulovesicular clusters near Golgi, in the juxtanuclear region (shown in zoom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Clearly, there was a link between these tubular structures and ERES and given the exit from ER is hindered (which means that collagen I has not left the ER), it is suggested that collagen I was accumulated at a distinct region that separated ERES from the ER. The exact nature and classification of this ERES-ER connecting region needs to be further investigated and is beyond the scope of this study. However, the current block of ER exit and increased accumulation of bulky cargo at ERES was essential to elicit such interactions at ERES. These ERES were marked by components of a physiological ERES, and we demonstrated that there is a difference in accumulation of small vs large cargoes as diffused vs tubular accumulation, respectively. Additionally, the persistent accumulation of large cargoes at only a specific subset of ERES shows strong evidence of ERES’ inherent heterogeneity towards cargo collection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S11"><title>Optical trapping of ERES</title><p id="P28">The underlying mechanism of how cargoes are collected at ERES prior to their exit from the ER is not fully understood.

Given the distinct distribution of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and FM4-EGFP-PAUF, with the former localized predominantly at the ERES (after blue light exposure), and at MTOC region (at 20 min), and the latter predominantly at ER, we tailored our calculations of PCC to only the MTOC region shown in the zoom of the figures. This approach was adopted for specified and relevant assessment of correlation. Hence the analysis was aimed to capture the spatial relation between TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID and FM4-EGFP-PAUF only in the MTOC region, and the other regions of the cells were excluded from the PCC calculations to avoid dilution in the potential PCC. This approach was extended in calculating the PCC of TANGO1SΔPRD-mCh-iLID with other proteins like ERGIC53-GFP and ManII-GFP as well.</p><p id="P57">For the timelapse shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the primary aim was to monitor the effect of blue light on FM4-PAUF-EGFP with and without D/D solubilizer, in the same cell during the different time points. However, due to rapid response to D/D solubilizer to disaggregation of FM4-PAUF-EGFP, monitoring same cell became challenging. Hence the data reported is comprehensive result of:</p><sec id="S27"><title>Single-Cell Measurements</title><p id="P58">The cell where we monitored the response of cargo to D/D solubilizer in the same cell was used for representation in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.

While this approach might introduce variability due to lack of single cell data acquisition, it was essential to capture the rapid dissolution of FM4-PAUF-EGFP with D/D solubilizer, and its accumulation at the ERES. It was found that the variations in the data sets obtained from multiple cells were not significant. These results were used for measuring the PCC values and have been show in the plots.</p><p id="P60">For measurement the mean value of PCC at time points 0 was chosen as a reference (hypothetical) point, and a one-sample t-test was applied.
