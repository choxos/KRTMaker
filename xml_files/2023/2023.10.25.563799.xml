Sexual stages or gametocytes are the only stage competent for transmission to mosquitoes. Formation of flagellated male gametes from gametocytes requires rapid rounds of genome replication. Here we discovered a non-canonical <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex essential for DNA segregation during male gametogenesis. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 dynamically localizes within the nucleus to the endomitotic spindles and interacts with a kinetochore protein. Deletion of key Arp2/3 subunits or interfering with actin polymerisation leads to the formation of sub-haploid male gametes and a complete block in transmission through delayed developmental arrest at the oocyst stage. Our work identified an evolutionary divergent protein complex in malaria parasites that offers potential targets for transmission-blocking interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4"><italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, is an evolutionary distant single-celled apicomplexan parasite. It undergoes a complex life cycle between vertebrate and mosquito hosts where it constantly differentiates into uniquely adapted cellular forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). While transcription factors governing most of these changes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), the molecular mechanisms driving most differentiation processes are not well understood. One third of the predicted <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins have no homology outside of apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In addition, evolutionary conserved proteins and protein complexes governing fundamental biological processes can be hard to recognize, such as the nuclear porins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), or they are thought to be absent, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) or the actin nucleator actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites undergo gamete formation and sexual replication in the mosquito. Among the many differentiation processes of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, male gametogenesis is a particularly complex, fast, and intriguing process, in which eight flagellated microgametes emerge from a parent cell within just 10-15 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). To achieve this rapid formation of gametes, the cytoplasmic formation of eight axonemes is paralleled in the nucleus by three rounds of closed mitosis without chromosome condensation or nuclear division (endomitosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Axonemes and mitotic spindles are connected by a bipartite microtubule organising centre that spans the nuclear envelope and contains a basal body on the cytosol and a spindle pole body like structure in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Once axonemes gain motility, the eight gametes swim out of the parent cell, each pulling a genome along in a process that is both error-prone and poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Nuclear division is thought to occur only during gamete budding, and faithful genome segregation from the octoploid nucleus is thus essential for the formation of fertile gametes. However, in absence of a known canonical spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), it is unclear how the parasite safeguards correct chromosome segregation during the rapid rounds of endomitosis and gamete formation.</p><p id="P5">The actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex is a seven-subunit complex consisting of Arp2, Arp3 and five supporting subunits ARPC1-5 that together nucleate actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In the cytoplasm of most metazoa, the Arp2/3 complex mediates lamellipodia formation and endocytic trafficking, among other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Nuclear functions of Arp2/3 are less well studied and differ between species, but they include DNA damage repair, nucleation of spindle actin during mitosis and meiosis and chromosome capture and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Despite the evolutionary conservation of Arp2/3 across the eukaryotic kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), it was assumed that the complex has been lost in apicomplexan species, except for a single subunit, annotated as ARPC1/ARC40 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here we discovered that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ARPC1 constitutes part of a highly divergent, non-canonical Arp2/3 complex, which associates with mitotic spindles in activated male gametocytes and is essential for genome segregation into budding gametes. Disruption of the complex results in a delayed death phenotype in oocysts leading to a complete transmission block within mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PbARPC1 is essential for male gamete fertility and hence mosquito stage development</title><p id="P6">Previous phylogenetic studies identified <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ARPC1/ARC40, from here on named ARPC1 to be consistent with the most common Arp2/3 complex subunit nomenclature, as the sole conserved subunit of the Arp2/3 complex in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. In the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>P. berghei</italic> PbARPC1 (accession number PBANKA_0929300, PF3D7_1118800 in the human malaria parasite, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) is a 41 kDa protein predicted to fold into a WD40 repeat domain with two alphahelical loops extending from the doughnut-shaped β-propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>). The ARPC1 protein sequence is conserved across the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic> but shows less than 20% identity to other ARPC1/ARPC1 proteins from model species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B, C</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ARPC1 has also low sequence identity to a predicted ARPC1 homologue of <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, the only other ARPC1 protein predicted to be present in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Tagging ARPC1 C-terminally with GFP in <italic>P. berghei</italic> wildtype (WT) parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A, B</xref>) revealed that the protein is predominantly expressed in gametocytes and in ookinetes, the stage of the parasites penetrating the mosquito midgut epithelium, indicating a potential role during transmission to the mosquito (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2C</xref>). In both stages, PbARPC1 localises to the nucleus. A weak ARPC1-GFP signal was also observed in late-stage oocysts.</p><p id="P7">To interrogate ARPC1 function we generated a knockout (KO) of PbARPC1 in the Pb<sub>820</sub>WT background (Pb<sub>820</sub>ARCP1(-), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A, B</xref>). Pb<sub>820</sub>WT expresses cytosolic RFP in female gametocytes and GFP in male gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), allowing to track asexual replication and gametocyte formation by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4A</xref>). After inoculating mice with 1000 infected red blood cells (iRBC), we found no difference in asexual growth rate or formation of female or male gametes between Pb<sub>820</sub>WT and Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4B, C</xref>). However, when testing transmission capacity of Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) infected mosquitoes, we found that mice could not be infected by mosquito bites, indicating that ARPC1 is essential for parasite development in the mosquito (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To further investigate the specific developmental block within mosquitoes and to facilitate phenotyping <italic>Plasmodium</italic> across multiple life cycle stages, we created another PbARPC1 KO in the reporter line Pb<sub>473</sub>WT, which expresses RFP constitutively throughout the life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A, C</xref>). We first probed the formation of ookinetes, the motile zygote that forms in the mosquito midgut after a blood meal. Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) and Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) ookinetes developed normally and exhibited-WT-like morphology and motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4D, E</xref>). Yet curiously, we noted that the DNA content of ookinete nuclei was reduced by about 30% in Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) compared to Pb<sub>473</sub>WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Ookinetes were fully infective, as infecting mosquitoes with Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) led to WT-like infection rates (prevalence) and oocyst numbers at early development (6 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). However, oocyst numbers dropped significantly during later oocyst development (12 dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Notably, none of the oocysts sporulated, and we detected no sporozoites in midguts or salivary glands. In line with this observation, none of the mice bitten by Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) infected mosquitos became infected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We imaged WT and KO oocysts at 4, 6, and 12 dpi and found Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) oocysts to be significantly smaller compared to WT at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, H</xref>). Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) oocysts also exhibited a lower DNA content than WT oocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). Complementing the Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) line by reintroducing the <italic>ARPC1</italic> gene into the same locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A, D</xref>) fully restored oocyst size, sporulation, and parasite transmission, confirming that the observed phenotype is caused by deletion of the <italic>ARPC1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5, Table S1</xref>). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PbARPC1 is required for normal oocyst growth and sporozoite development, and deletion of ARPC1 leads to a complete block in transmission.</p><p id="P8">In the mosquito, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites undergo sexual replication, and many defects during mosquito stage development are inherited from one sex only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). To investigate if ARPC1 function is sex-specific, we crossed Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) parasites with either Pb47(-) parasites that do not produce fertile females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) or with Pb48/45(-) parasites that do not produce fertile males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Only crossing with female-deficient (male-competent) Pb47(-) restored oocyst size at 6 dpi, while oocysts of the cross with male-deficient (female-competent) Pb48/45(-) parasites remained small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). ARPC1 is thus required for male, but not female fertility. To test whether PbARPC1 expression is restricted to males, we tagged PbARPC1 with an HA-tag in the gametocyte reporter line Pb<sub>820</sub>WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6A, B</xref>). Both RFP-positive female and GFP-positive male gametocytes expressed ARPC1-HA in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6C</xref>), confirming the original observation with the PbARPC1-GFP line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2C</xref>). However, we detected both by IFA and by flow cytometry a stronger ARPC1-HA signal in males compared to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6C, D</xref>), indicating a higher protein expression in the male lineage, in line with the male phenotype of PbARPC1(-).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PbARPC1 is required for correct chromosome condensation and segregation into male gametes</title><p id="P9">In the mosquito midgut, male gametocytes undergo gametogenesis, during which they rapidly replicate their DNA three times by endomitosis and form eight axonemes in the cytoplasm, before finally eight flagellated gametes bud of the parent cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Imaging ARPC1-GFP during male gametogenesis revealed that ARPC1 relocalises from the nucleoplasm at 0 minutes post activation (mpa) to an area surrounding the mitotic spindle at 3 mpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, full figure in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7</xref>). ARPC1 then followed the spindle dynamics, localising to two spindles at 7-8 and to four spindles at 12 mpa. At 15 mpa, ARPC1 was found either at eight distinct foci surrounding the homogeneous DNA signal, or within the residual body beneath eight condensed DNA foci or the emerging flagella. To investigate if spindle formation, DNA replication or DNA condensation are impaired in ARPC1(-), we next imaged Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) gametocytes at 3 mpa and at 15 mpa. At 3 mpa, both Pb<sub>473</sub>WT and Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) gametocytes contained a spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). At 15 mpa, Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) gametocytes formed axonemes and replicated their DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, we observed differences in DNA localisation. In Pb<sub>473</sub>WT gametocytes, about half of all male gametocytes contained an enlarged nucleus with a homogeneous DNA distribution, in about 30% of cells the DNA was condensed into eight foci, and 20% of cells were exflagellating, with DNA localising to the emerging flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). In the remaining cells, DNA was localised in an irregular pattern, likely representing an intermediate step in the process of DNA segregation (i.e., between homogeneous distribution and the condensed localisation). In contrast, only few Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) gametocytes had condensed DNA foci while the majority exhibited an irregular DNA pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J, K</xref>). In exflagellating Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) gametocytes, a large proportion of the DNA was retained in the residual body and only a part of the DNA localised to the flagella. Altogether, our data suggests that ARPC1 is not required for spindle or gamete formation but involved in the process of DNA condensation right before budding of the flagellated gamete.</p><p id="P10">To investigate if the change in DNA localisation also results in defects in DNA segregation into the eight progeny cells, we labelled fixed gametocytes 20 mpa for DNA and tubulin and quantified the DNA content of activated male gametocytes (strong nuclear signal and a strong tubulin signal of the axonemes wrapped around the nucleus) and free male gametes (single tubulin-positive axoneme) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-H</xref>). DNA signal was normalised to that of female gametocytes/gametes (single nucleus and diffuse tubulin signal) on the same slide. Notably, only about 30-60% of all microgametes contained any detectable DNA signal, supporting previous notions that DNA segregation into male gametes is an error-prone process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Activated male gametocytes of both Pb<sub>820</sub>WT and Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) lines had the expected octoploid DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). DNA-positive WT microgametes had an average DNA content of 1C, indicating that DNA segregation during exflagellation is an all-or-nothing process. In contrast, while for Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) microgametes, the proportion of DNA-positive microgametes did not differ from WT, their DNA content was reduced to approximately 0.4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). Deletion of ARPC1 hence results in sub-haploid microgametes that contribute less than one complete genome to the zygote, suggesting that ARPC1 is responsible for proper DNA segregation into the developing male gametes.</p><p id="P11">In the midgut, male gametes fertilise female gametes to form a zygote that within four hours undergoes DNA replication and meiosis to then develop into the ookinete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Accordingly, we found in a time course experiment that in Pb<sub>820</sub>WT, the DNA content roughly doubles from non-activated gametocytes to zygotes at 1 hours post activation (hpa), after fertilisation occurred, and then further increases to 4C at 4 hpa (after meiosis) to remain at that level in ookinetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8B</xref>). In contrast, in Pb<sub>820</sub>ARPC1(-) parasites, the C value only increased to 1.2C after fertilisation, consistent with the decreased DNA content provided by the male gamete to the zygote. Nevertheless, the DNA content approximately doubled to about 2.8C at 4 hpa and remained at this level in ookinetes. To further investigate if nuclear architecture or meiosis is affected by the deletion of PbARPC1, we imaged mature Pb<sub>473</sub>WT and Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-) ookinetes by EM tomography and reconstructed their nuclei in 3D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8C</xref>). In both Pb<sub>473</sub>WT and Pb<sub>473</sub>ARPC1(-), four spindle pole bodies together with four hemispindles were present.

However, the Arp2/3 complex is postulated to be absent in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and PbARPC1 has low similarity to canonical ARPC1 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>). To further investigate the function of PbARPC1 and identify putative interaction partners, we performed immunoprecipitation of ARPC1-GFP from purified non-activated and activated gametocytes. PbGFP<sub>con</sub> gametocytes that constitutively express nucleocytosolic GFP served as control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). While in non-activated PbARPC1-GFP gametocytes, only ARPC1 was identified to be significantly enriched, we found five additional proteins to be enriched in PbARPC1-GFP activated gametocytes compared to PbGFP<sub>con</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These proteins included two actin-like proteins, annotated as Alp5a (PBANKA_0811800) and Alp5b (PBANKA_1007500), two proteins of unknown function (PBANKA_1014200 and PBANKA_1229300), and the apicomplexan-specific kinetochore protein 7 (AKiT7, PBANKA_0612300) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). All the identified proteins are conserved across <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and are specifically expressed in male gametocytes according to the malaria cell atlas, a single cell RNA-seq resource (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We also compared the predicted structures of ARPC1 and the two unknown <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins to those of the human ARPC subunits using the DALI algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We found not only structural conservation between ARPC1 and hARPC1 as suggested by previous annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), but also between PBANKA_1014200 and hARPC2 as well as between PBANKA_1229300 and hARPC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Intriguingly, we observed that PBANKA_1229300 contains an additional domain. While its C-terminal domain is predicted with high confidence by Alphafold and aligns very well with the structure of HsARPC4, the large N-terminal domain of around 40 kDa in size is predicted with very low confidence and consists of disordered loop regions with little secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). In canonical Arp2/3 complexes, Arp2 and Arp3 nucleate the new actin filament by interaction with actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).

Including PbARPC1 itself, we thus identified structural homologues to five out of seven subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, including the core proteins Arp2 and Arp3, which suggests the presence of a non-canonical, minimalistic Arp2/3 complex in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p><p id="P14">To test if the identified ARPC1 interaction partners form a complex and function in a similar manner as PbARPC1, we first tagged PbARPC2 (PBANKA_1014200) internally with YFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11A, B</xref>). Imaging PbARPC2-YFPint revealed a gametocyte-specific expression and a localisation mirroring that of ARPC1: After activation, PbARPC2 relocalises from the nucleoplasm to the spindle, to ultimately retreat to the residual body upon DNA condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We also generated a knockout line of Alp5b (PbArp3) in Pb<sub>473</sub>WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11C-D</xref>). As for ARPC1(-) parasites, this parasite line showed no decrease of blood stage growth or gametocyte production but imaging of activated Pb<sub>473</sub>Alp5b(-) gametocytes and gametes revealed a significant decrease in the DNA content of male gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We next treated gametocytes with CK-666, a drug known to target canonical Arp2/3, or its non-active control CK-689 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

At a higher concentration of 250 µM, however CK-666 drastically impaired overall exflagellation rates, and the few gametes formed often did not contain DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

However, DNA-positive microgametes were haploid, indicating that CK-666 did not affect DNA segregation in the same manner as deletion of Arp2/3 components does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 complex is highly diverse and thus not bound by the canonical Arp2/3 inhibitor.</p><p id="P16">Canonical Arp2/3 nucleates actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and structural modelling predicted that Alp5a (PbArp2) and Alp5b (PbArp3) can interact with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).

Taken together, the co-localisation of ARPC1 with F-actin and the sensitivity of male DNA segregation to cytochalasin D suggest that the divergent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 complex indeed nucleates nuclear F-actin to facilitate genome segregation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Early mosquito stages are a major bottleneck in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle and thus a prime target for novel transmission-blocking intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). They also provide a large scope for discovery of divergent eukaryotic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Here we have identified a non-canonical <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 complex that is essential for DNA segregation during male gametogenesis in the mosquito (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The Arp2/3 complex localises to the spindle during male endomitosis and remains in the residual body upon gamete formation and exflagellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In absence of the Arp2/3 complex subunit ARPC1, male gametes are sub-haploid, and while they can still fertilise females to form motile ookinetes, ARPC1(-) parasites arrest in a delayed-death like manner at the oocyst stage, leading to a complete block in transmission. Similarly, deletion of Alp5b results in formation of sub-haploid gametes. ARPC1 colocalises with F-actin and inhibiting actin polymerisation phenocopies ARPC1 deficiency. We therefore conclude that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 nucleates actin, much like canonical Arp2/3 complexes. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> encodes for two actin isoforms, actin 1 and actin 2. Actin 2 is essential for male gametogenesis, localises both to the cytoplasm and the nuclear spindle and in its absence, gametocytes do not exflagellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). While complementation of actin 2 with actin 1 restores gamete formation and exflagellation, parasites still arrest in early oocysts, strongly suggesting that actin 1 complements cytoplasmic, but not nuclear functions of actin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). It is thus likely that Arp2/3 nucleates polymerisation of actin 2 along the spindle during male gametogenesis. Like Arp2/3, Actin 2 is only found in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and not in other apicomplexans suggesting a specialised function of this actin isoform with the Plasmodium Arp2/3 complex.</p><p id="P18">Without Alp5b or ARPC1, parasites form male gametes containing only half of the genome, i.e., the equivalent of approximately seven instead of 14 chromosomes. Two mutually compatible mechanisms could underlie <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Canonical Arp2/3 is important for DNA damage repair and to safeguard replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 may perform a similar function during male gametogenesis, as the three rapid rounds of DNA replication are possibly highly prone to replicative stress and DNA breaks. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 could thus ensure that double strand breaks occurring during male DNA replication are repaired rapidly. In absence of Arp2/3, DNA double strand breaks might accumulate, and upon emergence of gametes, chromosome fragments might remain in the residual body. A second possibility is that Arp2/3 ensures correct attachment of kinetochores to the spindle. In absence of Arp2/3, some chromosomes might not connect to the spindle and thus remain in the residual body. The localisation of Arp2/3 components to the spindle and the interaction with the kinetochore protein AKiT7 argue in favour of this hypothesis, suggesting a unique function for the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 complex. Intriguingly, AKiT7 has weak homology to mitotic arrest deficiency 1 (MAD1), a core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Other putative spindle assembly checkpoint proteins have not been identified in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and a canonical spindle assembly checkpoint is thought to be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 together with AKiT7 constitutes a spindle-assembly-checkpoint-like mechanism that ensures that kinetochores are attached to the spindle before mitosis proceeds, yet without stalling progression of gamete formation in its absence.</p><p id="P19">A core protein connecting the kinetochores to the spindle during male gametogenesis is end-binding protein 1 (EB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Deletion of EB1 in <italic>P. berghei</italic> resembles the phenotype of ARPC1(-), with an arrest in a delayed-death like manner in early oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). In contrast, deletion of EB1 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. yoelli</italic> leads to the formation of gametes that were entirely deficient of DNA and incapable of fertilising females, highlighting interesting species-specific differences in DNA segregation in male gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). A paternal phenotype followed by an early oocyst arrest has also been described for other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite lines lacking proteins such as the formin-like protein MISFIT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), the microtubule motor kinesin-8X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), the aurora kinase Ark2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and for a parasite line that expresses actin 1 in place of actin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). While their precise connection to the Arp2/3 complex or Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization remains to be determined, a unifying feature of these paternal defects is that they do not affect ookinete development but arrest parasites only in the oocyst stage. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of Ark2 and EB1 revealed many interacting proteins including Akit7 but not a single subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), suggesting a dynamic interplay between the kinetochores and the Arp2/3 complex.</p><p id="P20">The delayed-death-like developmental arrest of ARPC1(-) parasites in early oocysts remains puzzling. ARPC1(-) oocysts are still functionally diploid, meaning all genes are present and provided by the female genome, regardless of the nature of the missing male DNA. It is possible that the aneuploidy of the oocyst leads to activation of a yet unknown post-meiotic replication checkpoint, leading to an arrest in the cell cycle. Alternatively, gene expression levels could be affected in absence of the male genome, causing gene dosage mediated developmental defects. A set of paternally imprinted genes could also be expressed from the paternal genome only, possibly regulated through unknown epigenetic effects. Finally, the Arp2/3 complex could have a separate function during oocyst development. Yet, Arp2/3 expression was not detected in early oocysts at the time point of arrest, but only during sporogony in late oocysts. Notably, we detected ARPC1 expression in the nucleus of females and ookinetes. While crossing with a female-deficient line rescued the oocyst growth phenotype, it cannot be excluded that female-derived ARPC1 expression is essential at a later stage of oocyst development. The observed heterogeneous arrest of ARPC1(-) oocysts might also be a combination of all three possible effects.</p><p id="P21">Phylogenetic analyses across Apicomplexan parasites for Arp2/3 components and the apparent lack of branched actin in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> led to the prevailing assumption that the Arp2/3 complex had been lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here we report discovery of a non-canonical Arp2/3 complex that differs substantially at sequence, structural and functional level from canonical Arp2/3. While the canonical Arp2/3 complex consists of seven subunits, we have only identified five orthologues. These subunits differ markedly on a sequence level from their canonical counterparts, yet their structural core is conserved. Canonical Arp2/3 complexes are recruited and activated by nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) that either belong to the Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) or the WISH/DIP1/SPIN90 (WDS) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, we could not identify any orthologues to these proteins in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The mode of Arp2/3 activation thus remains to be determined. Intriguingly, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ARPC4 contains a long, N-terminal extension that does not align to any Arp2/3 subunit. Possibly, this extension either compensates for one of the missing subunits of Arp2/3, or it connects the complex to the spindle, compensating for missing NPFs. The discovery of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 raises the question if non-canonical Arp2/3 complexes are present in other apicomplexan lineages. While we did not find any orthologues of Arp2/3 subunits using the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> orthologues as query, an ARPC1 orthologue has been annotated in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and we found ARPC2 orthologues by structure search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, <italic>Eimeria</italic> and <italic>Neospora.</italic> It is therefore likely that the Arp2/3 complex has assumed a specialised function in Apicomplexa that resulted in major sequence divergence while structural features remained conserved.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, we present the discovery and characterisation of a non-canonical, divergent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Arp2/3 complex that is essential for malaria parasite transmission to the mosquito. This study not only sheds light on the mechanisms of the unconventional cell division of male gametes, but also provides a new target for transmission-blocking interventions. While further work is required to elucidate the precise mode of action and evolution of this non-canonical Arp2/3 complex, interfering with Arp2/3 function could provide a building block to break the vicious cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Ethics statement and mice</title><p id="P23">All experiments were performed in accordance with GV-SOLAS and FELASA guidelines and have been approved by the German authorities (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe) or according to the guidelines defined by the Home Office and UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the UK Home Office (project license P6CA91811) and the University of Glasgow animal welfare and ethical review body.
