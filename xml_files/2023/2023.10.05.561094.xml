While combinatorial binding is well established, a comprehensive view of tissue-specific TF combinations at active enhancers during human embryonic development is still lacking. Using a two-step pipeline to detect co-occurring TF motifs in developmental enhancers across 11 human embryonic tissues, we found that motifs recognized by ubiquitous TF families, including TEAD, TALE, ETS, and STAT, are enriched near tissue-specific sequence signatures in developmental enhancers across multiple tissues. In human heart enhancers, TEAD and GATA motifs frequently co-occur, and in the developing mouse heart TEAD1 and GATA4 co-occupy a set of genomic regions, which are also preferentially bound by CHD4, a component of the NuRD complex involved in transcriptional repression. Consistently, TEAD1 attenuates enhancer activation in vitro, with this repressive effect dependent on tissue-specific activators. Overall, our findings reveal universal patterns of TF connectivity within organ-specific transcriptional networks and highlight a broad, previously unrecognized role for TEAD in coordinating organ growth and differentiation across multiple tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Gene expression programs determine and maintain cellular identity and function in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, and their dysregulation causes a broad range of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Gene expression is largely controlled by transcription factors (TFs), which bind to distal enhancers (in the linear genome) to facilitate recruitment of RNA Pol II at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">TFs operate in highly interconnected networks. Examples from animal development or cellular reprogramming indicate that transcriptional regulation is commonly mediated by distinct combinations of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). This combinatorial mechanism allows the integration of multiple biological inputs at cis-regulatory elements, resulting in highly diverse regulatory outputs in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), as well as precise fine-tuning of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Combinatorial TF binding is closely linked with TF cooperativity, where the binding of one TF increases the likelihood or affinity of another TF binding to a nearby site. Several mechanisms of TF cooperativity have been described. In direct cooperativity TFs interact through direct protein-protein contacts, forming hetero- or homodimers that establish more stable, higher-affinity interactions with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In contrast, indirect cooperativity is a less specific mechanism and likely explains the widespread occurrence of combinatorial TF binding on chromatin. In this case, TFs rely on mutual interdependence while engaging with their respective sites on chromatin. Single TFs cannot effectively compete with nucleosomes, but multiple TFs that recognize closely spaced binding sites (within ∼150 bp) synergistically act through ‘mass action’ to displace the same nucleosome. Consequently, they indirectly aid and enhance the binding of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This extensive cooperativity between TFs at the levels of DNA binding explains why enhancers tend to contain clusters of multiple TF recognition sites.</p><p id="P5">While the concept of TF combinatorial binding is well established, a systematic exploration of tissue-specific TF combinations during human embryonic development is still missing. Most documented cases of TF combinatorial binding occur in specific contexts, such as distinct cell types or developmental stages. To fully understand how TF synergy shapes transcriptional regulation, it is essential to take a comprehensive view across various tissues and organs. This broader perspective could reveal universal patterns of TF interactions within organ-specific transcriptional networks and enhance our ability to predict the functions of regulatory sequences.</p><p id="P6">TF combinatorial binding is identified in the genome by the co-occurrence of TF sequence motifs within active regulatory regions. Histones associated with active enhancer regions are often marked by post-translational modifications, notably H3K27ac, which is deposited by p300/CBP enzymes and is predictive of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). TFs bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner through highly conserved DNA-binding domains. These recognition sequences are represented by position weight matrices (PWMs), which specify the TF’s relative preference for each base at each position in the binding site and enable predictions of TF binding based on DNA sequence. Several methods are available to explore the co-occurrence of TFs at regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Some require ChIP-seq data of target TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) or integrate TF and H3K27ac ChIP-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These approaches are relatively context-specific as they rely on the occupancy of individual TFs. Other methods do not require TF ChIP-seq experiments, but largely focus on direct cooperativity, promoter regions rather than enhancers or use chromatin accessibility data as input instead of H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we systematically investigate TF combinatorial binding at tissue-specific enhancers active during human organogenesis. We designed a two-step pipeline using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify context-specific, co-occurring TF motifs. This approach reveals both novel and well-established TF interactions. By analyzing the combinatorial TF landscape of developmental enhancers, we found that homotypic motif co-occurrence is a prevalent feature in tissue-specific enhancers. We also identified combinatorial binding of ubiquitous and tissue-specific TFs as a general characteristic of developmental enhancers, with an enrichment of motifs recognized by ubiquitous TF families, including TEAD, TALE, ETS, and STAT, near tissue-specific sequence signatures across multiple tissues. To address the functional role of ubiquitous TFs on organ/cell type-specific transcriptional programs, we focused on the broadly expressed TEAD TFs, identified as combinatorial partner of tissue-specific TFs in heart ventricle, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), lower limb, kidney, brain, pancreas and palate. Our results indicate that TEAD1, together with its coactivator YAP, attenuates tissue-specific enhancer activation, pointing at a broad, so far unrecognised effect of TEAD on cell type-specific transcriptional programs. We propose that TEAD may link transcriptional programmes controlling organ growth and differentiation in multiple tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of context-specific co-occurring motifs in human developmental enhancers</title><sec id="S4"><title>Human transcriptomic and epigenomic data</title><p id="P8">RNA-seq data was originally presented in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and reanalysed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).

Hierarchical clustering was performed using the base R function hclust, which uses the “complete” agglomeration method as default. A distance tree was plotted, and a cut-off height of 0.5 was used to obtain 79 clusters of motifs. A height of 0.5 was chosen based on the representation of known families.

The most prominent family or subfamily within the group was used. TF subfamilies were used when possible. This was mainly the case for clades of basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) factors and some Zinc Finger (Zf) subfamilies. In the case where TFs belonging to the same family but spanning across different subfamilies were clustered together, the family and a number were assigned, e.g. Nuclear Receptors (NR) were NR_1, NR_2, NR_3, NR_4, NR_5. Clusters containing only two TFs which belonged to different families were labelled as “other”.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identification of ‘Second Search’ TFs co-occurring with ‘First Search’ TFs</title><p id="P12">Firstly, the query motif’s (referred to as ‘First Search’ TF motif) PWM was obtained from the HOMER motif library file. Next, the scanMotifGenomeWide.pl script, from HOMER (v4.11, 10-24-2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) was used to obtain a bed file of genomic coordinates belonging to the ‘First Search’ motif in the genome build of interest (e.g. hg38). BEDtools intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) was used to select input and background coordinates for motif enrichment analysis. Input coordinates consist of ‘First Search’ TF motif coordinates that lie within human embryonic H3K27ac-specific 1kb bins. BEDtools random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) was then used to generate a set of 1kb background regions from the same genome build. The background was filtered to regions containing ‘First Search’ TF motifs. The final background set contained approximately double the number of regions as the foreground set. HOMER uses a binomial distribution to score motifs, which works well when the background sequences outnumber the target sequences, which is why the starting number of random genomic bins is twice the number of tissue-specific bins available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Background optimisation was performed before selecting random genomic coordinates as the final background. Backgrounds tested were: 1) random ‘First Search’ TF coordinates as background, 2) non-tissue-specific enhancers consisting of 1kb bins from the human genome acetylated in all tissues studied from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) 3) HOMER default background consisting of random sequences with matching GC-content distribution as the target sequences and 4) all other putative tissue-specific enhancers from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Motif enrichment analysis was performed using the findMotifGenomeWide.pl script, from HOMER using a size parameter of “200”, to search for enrichment motifs 100nt either side of the ‘First Search’ motif coordinates found within context-specific regulatory regions compared to random instances of the “First Search” motif. A p-value cut-off of 1x10<sup>-5</sup> was used and only motifs occurring in 5% or more of foreground regions in HOMER results were considered. Significantly enriched motifs from the HOMER results were substituted by their corresponding cluster of HOMER PWMs. When HOMER results included more than one motif belonging to the same cluster, the motif with lowest p-value was used. The R package ggplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) was used to produce bubble plots for network visualization, where negative log p-value determine bubble size. To understand the frequency at which each cluster appeared in the Second Search, a heatmap depicting number of times each cluster appeared as Second Search TF was created using pheatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Each frequency was normalised by number of motifs in the cluster and the heatmap was scaled by column.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Validation of ventricle results with VISTA enhancers</title><p id="P13">Human experimentally validated heart, limb and forebrain enhancers were downloaded from the VISTA enhancer browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Only enhancers active in exactly one of the three tissues were selected for further analysis resulting in 254 heart enhancers, 400 forebrain enhancers and 258 limb enhancers. Coordinates of ventricle-specific, limb-specific and brain-specific co-occurring motifs predicted using the two-step pipeline described above within each set of VISTA enhancers were identified. This was done by intersecting all instances of the ‘First Search’ motifs in the hg19 genome identified using the HOMER scanMotifGenomeWide.pl script with the VISTA enhancers coordinates using BEDtools intersect. Regions of 100nt either side of the First Search motifs within VISTA enhancers were selected. Finally, these 200nt windows were intersected with all instances of the corresponding ‘Second Search’ TFs, to identify VISTA enhancers containing each pair of predicted ‘First Search’ and ‘Second Search’ TFs within 100nt of each other. The hypergeometric distribution was calculated using the R stats package, to identify whether a pair of co-occurring motifs significantly appeared within 100nt of each other more frequently in one tissue compared to the other two.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Validation of GATA4 ventricle results with GATA4 ChIP-seq</title><p id="P14">An embryonic mouse ventricle GATA4 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (GSE52123) was used to validate predicted functional co-occurring motifs with GATA4 in the human embryonic ventricle (peak calling is described in the following section). Motif enrichment analysis performed on 1) mouse GATA4 200nt peak summits (“peaks”), 2) 100nt either side of GATA4 motifs within mouse GATA4 200nt peak summits (“flanks”), 3) “flanks” within human heart ventricle-specific H3K27ac regions (“H3K27ac”), were compared to the results presented in this manuscript using GATA4 and ventricle-specific H3K27ac bins as input, in other words ventricle ‘Second Search’ results (vSS).

In the first step, we targeted the identification of key events driving acquisition of tissue specificity in distinct tissues. Cell fate and identity hinges on precise gene expression programs directed by lineage-specific TFs. Therefore, our first key step was to identify distinctive sequence signatures linked to individual tissues and their cognate tissue-restricted TFs, or ‘First Search TFs’. This was followed by the identification of TFs potentially cooperating with tissue-restricted TFs, or ‘Second Search TFs’. To identify tissue-specific regulatory regions, we conducted a comparative analysis of H3K27ac ChIP-seq data across 11 embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Notably, the H3K27ac histone modification, which marks active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), exhibited significantly more distinct and tissue-selective patterns compared to other modifications associated with active transcription. The genome was parsed into 1kb bins and tissue-specific H3K27ac-positive bins were identified using a thresholding method based on read counts. Candidate tissue-specific enhancers were bins present in both replicates of one tissue but not replicated in any other tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This approach enabled us to isolate and curate developmental enhancers specific to each tissue, whose number varied across the 11 tissues under investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Next, we scanned each set of tissue-specific enhancers for enriched motifs using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and, for each tissue, selected the top 20 signature sequence motifs for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). To optimise the discovery of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms, we prioritised cognate TFs based on expression. We analysed tissue-matching transcriptomes to identify tissue-restricted TFs across the developing human embryo. Briefly, RNA-seq counts corresponding to TFs listed in Vaquerizas et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) were normalised by median expression across tissues and clustered into tissue-restricted (tissue-specific) and ubiquitous (non-specific) TF clusters using k-means clustering (k = 10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). The largest cluster, including TFs whose expression levels remained mostly constant (determined visually) across samples was removed, leaving 9 clusters of TFs with tissue-restricted patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Furthermore, to be classified as restricted to a particular tissue, expression of the TF must be approximately 150-fold higher than its median value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Those TFs demonstrating tissue-restricted expression (as per the method above) and which recognise motifs contained in the top 20 enriched motifs in enhancers active in the same tissue, are catalogued as ‘First Search’ TFs. Due to the similarity in their DNA-binding domains, TFs within the same family often recognize closely resembling motifs. Consequently, our method generated an extensive catalogue of motifs that exhibited significant redundancy. We collapsed all similar motifs in the HOMER motif database and obtained 79 motif clusters by unsupervised classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). If multiple motifs belonging to the same cluster appeared in the top 20 results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>), the PWM motif with the lowest enrichment p-value was used as input. This approach led to the identification of the key transcriptional regulators governing cell fate in individual tissues/organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). In the example of the heart ventricle, GATA4, HAND1, MYOG (which binds the AP4 motif) and TBX20 were identified as ‘First Search’ TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) and their PWM motifs, obtained from the HOMER known motif enrichment analysis results, were used as input for the identification of ‘Second Search’ TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). In some cases, like in the RPE, multiple ‘First Search’ TFs were represented by the same motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In a second step, we identified TFs potentially cooperating with tissue-restricted TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). For this, we scanned sequences flanking the ‘First Search’ TF motif coordinates in tissue-specific enhancers to identify binding sites for co-binding TFs or ‘Second Search’ TFs. While our ‘First Search’ was tailored to identify tissue-specific regulatory events, the ‘Second Search’ adopted a more permissive approach to accommodate instances of direct and indirect TF binding cooperativity. Specifically, we searched for enriched motifs 100nt either side of the coordinates of the ‘First Search’ motif identified within tissue-specific enhancers, contrasting against random instances of the same motif. We only selected high-confident ‘Second Search’ TF occurrences (p-value cut &lt;1x10<sup>-5</sup> and foreground motif occurrence &gt; 5%). Significantly enriched motifs derived from the HOMER outcomes were substituted by their corresponding clusters of HOMER PWMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>The network of co-occurring motifs in enhancers active during human organogenesis</title><p id="P25">Utilizing our two-step pipeline across a diverse spectrum of embryonic tissues provides a panoramic view on the collaborative interactions among TFs. We structured our ‘First’ and ‘Second Search’ outcomes to construct an expansive network delineating the co-occurrence of TF motifs across distinct developmental tissues of the human embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). The network was built using stringent cut-offs to select highly significant instances of TF motif co-occurrence (foreground enrichment &gt; 5% and p-value &lt; 1e<sup>-5</sup>). We observe well described TF-TF interactions in tissue specification and differentiation in our network, suggesting that our approach is indeed capable of detecting instances of functional TF combinatorial binding. For instance, in the brain, we detected instances of co-binding of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and SOX TFs (ASCL1 and OLIG2 bind a glia-specific enhancer with SOX10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>)) and of NEUROD and bHLH TFs (NEUROD1 and TCF12 cooperate to drive corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>)). Additional examples of functional interactions, present in the network, include GATA4 and HAND2 cooperativity to activate the expression of cardiac-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), and TBX20, NKX2.5 and GATA4 interaction during heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Analysis of liver enhancers identifies the well-established cooperation of FOXA2, GATA4 and HNF4a that primes enhancers for the activation of a liver-specific gene programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), as well as co-binding of HNF4A with RXR nuclear receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Notably, ‘First Search’ TFs belonging to the same tissue do not share the same ‘Second Search’ TFs. This indicates that our two-step approach shows resolution beyond motifs enriched in the entire 1kb bins. For example, in the heart ventricle clusters EBF and RFX_2 only co-occur with TBX20, STAT_1 only co-occurs with GATA4 and ETS only co-occurs with MYOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Our methodology relies on the classification of enhancers based on the presence of H3K27Ac histone modification. Although this histone modification commonly occurs at active enhancer sites, it singularly lacks the ability to conclusively denote functional enhancers, i.e. enhancers that activate gene expression. Consequently, our conclusions might be influenced by the potential misclassification of H3K27Ac-positive sites as functional enhancers when employing H3K27Ac markers alone. To determine the reliability of our results, we examined the occurrence of ‘First’ and ‘Second Search’ TFs within experimentally validated enhancers sourced from the VISTA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We selected heart, forebrain and limb enhancers and performed hypergeometric tests to assess whether ventricle-specific motif pairs identified in our network co-occurred within 100nt of each other significantly more often in heart enhancers, compared to forebrain and limb enhancers. We focused on the following predictions identified in our network: GATA-TEAD, GATA-MEF2, GATA-TBX (TBX clustered within the Zf Snail group) and GATA-NKX. We also used the brain prediction bHLH-RFX, and the limb prediction HOX-PITXEBOX (Pitx1:Ebox clustered within the BHLH_cAB cluster). As expected, GATA-TEAD, GATA-MEF2 and GATA-NKX pairs (co-occurrence within 100nt) were significantly enriched in heart enhancers, compared to limb and brain enhancers (p-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). In addition, we found the limb signature pair HOX-PITXEBOX, significantly enriched in the limb compared to brain and heart enhancers. We could not detect a significant enrichment of bHLH-RFX in brain enhancers compared to the heart and limb enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). This could be explained by the observation that the bHLH motif CAGCTG is enriched in active enhancers across most tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p id="P27">As an additional validation of our findings, we searched for ‘Second Search’ TFs using experimentally determined TF binding sites. We compared motif enrichment analysis of GATA4 ChIP-seq peaks in mouse embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) with heart ventricle ‘Second Search’ TF results (vSS), using GATA as ‘First Search’ TF. We generated three datasets from GATA4 ChIP-seq: GATA4 ‘peaks’ (200nt centered on the peak summit); GATA4 ‘flanks’ (200nt sequences flanking any GATA4 motifs contained in GATA4 ‘peaks’); and ‘H3K27ac’ (GATA4 ‘flanks’ that also overlap the set of human ventricle-specific enhancers converted to mouse coordinates). Using motif enrichment analysis, we observed a significant overlap between the top ten enriched motifs present in ‘peaks,’ ‘flanks,’ and ‘H3K27ac’, and ‘vSS’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref>). The heatmap shows negative log p-values for the top significantly enriched motifs in the four datasets (TEAD, MEF2, TALE, TBX, GATA). TEAD is the top co-occurring motif in ‘peaks’ and ‘flanks’, while MEF2 is the top motif in ‘vSS’ and ‘H3K27ac’. As MEF2 also appears as the top motif in ‘H3K27ac’, this discrepancy is potentially explained by a higher enrichment of GATA-MEF2 sites in active enhancers (relative to all GATA4 binding events). In sum, the analysis of GATA4 occupancy in the heart confirms that GATA4 preferentially bind with MEF2, TALE, TBX, and TEAD, with a tendency for GATA4 and MEF2 to co-occupy active ventricle-specific enhancers. These observations, combined with the identification of known cases of TF cooperativity, suggest that our network provides highly reliable predictions of functional combinatorial binding at tissue-specific enhancers.</p><p id="P28">Amongst the predictions of our two-step pipeline, we find that sequences surrounding GATA and Forkhead (FOX) motifs in liver enhancers (assigned to GATA4/GATA6 and FOXA3/FOXA2 respectively) are enriched in largely distinct motif clusters. FOX motifs, but not GATA motifs, co-occur with basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) motifs (recognized by ATF, JUN, CEBP and DMRT), and Nuclear Receptor (NR) motifs (particularly clusters NR_1 and NR_4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>). We observe GATA recognition motif, but not FOX motif, to co-occur with zinc finger (ZF) motif clusters, such as those recognized by GLI, KLF, SP, MAZ and ZIC and with BHLH Ebox motifs (BHLH_cAB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>). The observation that GATA4 and FOXA2 motifs in liver enhancers are flanked by distinct collections of sequence motifs suggests that GATA4 and FOXA bind to different groups of liver enhancers. Corroborating this hypothesis, the expression patterns of <italic>Gata4</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> transcripts exhibit only a partial overlap in mouse liver development: <italic>Gata4</italic> expression precedes liver specification, whereas <italic>Foxa2</italic> expression persists throughout hepatic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). There is contrasting evidence about the role of the AP-1 complex (formed by TFs such as JUN) as a pioneer TF in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). We find AP-1 motifs to significantly co-occur with FOXA motifs, supporting the hypothesis that AP-1 does not have inherent pioneer abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and that its apparent pioneer abilities could be due to co-binding with FOXA, a well-established family of liver pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Regulatory patterns in human tissue-specific developmental enhancers</title><p id="P29">Our panoramic overview of TF combinatorial binding in diverse embryonic tissues offers a unique opportunity to identify universal trends and common patterns of TF interactions within developmental enhancers. By analysing the combinatorial TF landscape of developmental enhancers, we identified homotypic motif co-occurrence as a prevalent feature in tissue-specific developmental enhancers. Homotypic motif pairs predominantly occur across diverse TF families, namely bHLH, AP-1, SOX, ZIC, FOX, HOX, GATA, PAX, NR and Regulatory Factor X (RFX) families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D</xref>). While TFs belonging to most of these families can bind DNA as homo- or hetero- dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), these findings are also consistent with previous studies on enhancer grammar, which have reported homotypic co-occurring motifs to be common, and to occur independently of dimerization events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We explored if organ-specific transcriptional networks share patterns of TF functional connectivity. One way to address this is to quantify the occurrence of ‘Second Search’ TF clusters among tissue-specific developmental enhancers. A heatmap of counts of all the ‘Second Search’ TF sites identified in human tissue-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>) clustered ‘Second Search’ TF motifs in three groups: high co-occurring, medium co-occurring and low co-occurring. We found that TFs belonging to the bHLH family are the most frequent ‘Second Search’ TFs in developmental enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). E-box motifs (consensus sequence CAGCTG belonging to the cluster bHLH_C_A_B) are found within 100 nt of the ‘First Search’ TFs in developmental enhancers in eight out of the eleven tissues studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). BHLH TFs play critical roles in the establishment of tissue- and cell-identity in a wide range of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). While these observations highlight a widespread cooperativity of bHLH TFs with tissue-restricted TFs as a key feature of human developmental enhancers, the large size of the bHLH family (&gt; 100 members) can also contribute to the observed high connectivity of BHLH TFs.</p><p id="P31">Tissue- and cell type-specific patterns of expression can be indicators of TF functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). TFs can be classified into two groups based on their expression patterns: ubiquitous TFs and tissue-restricted TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). For our analysis, we used hierarchical clustering (k = 10) to distinguish between 9 clusters of TFs with variable expression across tissues and one larger cluster containing ubiquitous TFs whose expression remain constant across tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). We identify enrichment of motifs recognised by ubiquitous TF families, TEAD, TALE, ETS and STAT, proximal to tissue-specific sequence signatures across multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3AB</xref>). Notably, the TEAD family is classified in the high co-occurrence group, while the other three are in the medium co-occurrence group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). TEAD recognition motifs are significantly enriched in the vicinity of tissue-specific sequence signatures in ventricle, lower limbs, brain, kidney, RPE, pancreas and palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). TEAD binding sites occur in combination with sixteen ‘First Search’ TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Five of the ‘First Search’ TFs recognise a homeobox cluster motif, suggesting that TEAD TFs widely co-bind with homeodomain TFs. In sum, motifs recognized by families of broadly expressed TFs form a central component of the landscape of tissue-specific developmental enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>TEAD1 binds tissue- and cell type-specific enhancers</title><p id="P32">We focused on TEAD TFs to explore the functional relevance of ubiquitous TF binding at tissue-specific enhancers. The small size of the TEAD family, comprising only four members, TEAD1-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), simplifies PWM assignments. In addition, the high number of potential interactions involving TEAD suggests a broad and significant role of TEAD at developmental enhancers. As a first step, we investigated if ubiquitously expressed TEAD TFs bind tissue-specific enhancers. We compared TEAD1 binding in adult mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), mouse embryonic ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and human primary keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Overlap of high-confident TEAD1 peaks, centred on their top TEAD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), shows that most TEAD1 binding is tissue-or cell type-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). While the majority of tissue-specific TEAD1 peaks occur at intronic or distal intergenic regions, as expected for enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>), a high proportion of overlapping (non-tissue-specific; n=440) TEAD1 peaks occur at promoters. Tissue-specific TEAD1 peaks are associated with tissue-specific biological processes and mouse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C-E</xref>). In contrast, shared TEAD peaks are associated with the hippo signalling pathway and with tumorigenic mouse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>), consistent with the well-established role of TEAD, and its coactivator YAP, in the hippo pathway and in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). Moreover, tissue-specific peaks are enriched in motifs recognised by tissue-specific TFs, such as NKX and TBOX in ventricle peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A-C</xref>), matching our predictions of TEAD binding partners. Compared to tissue-specific peaks, shared non-tissue-specific TEAD1 peaks are enriched in high affinity TEAD site, suggesting that shared peaks may contain higher affinity versions of TEAD binding sites or multiple TEAD motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3D</xref>). Overall, these results support our network predictions and suggest that TEAD act in concert with tissue-specific TFs at tissue-specific enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>TEAD1 attenuates tissue-specific enhancer activation</title><p id="P33">While TEAD1 motifs are enriched in active developmental human enhancers, motif discovery alone cannot confirm whether TEAD binds to these enhancers during their active state. To address this, we overlapped TEAD1 binding (E12.5 mouse heart ventricle) to chromatin acetylation (E11.5 mouse heart H3K27ac ChIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). We discovered that around 70% of TEAD1 binding is not acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). To investigate the functional significance of TEAD co-binding with tissue-restricted TFs, we performed de novo motif searches on both acetylated and non-acetylated TEAD1 peaks. Our results show that motifs recognized by cardiac TFs co-binding with TEAD in our network (such as TBX, HAND, GATA, MYOG) are more enriched in non-acetylated TEAD1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4AB</xref>). Conversely, acetylated TEAD regions are more enriched in motifs recognised by ubiquitous TFs like TALE TF MEIS and MEF2, which are not associated to TEAD motifs in our human developmental enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>). These findings suggest that TEAD1 may co-bind with cardiac-restricted TFs at non-active enhancers, which appears to contradict our identification of TEAD combinatorial binding in acetylated human enhancers. However, it is important to consider that our ventricle-specific enhancers were sampled at a single time point and likely represent enhancers that are selectively active in different cell types and developmental stages, given the heterogeneity of cell types in the ventricle. NKX2-5, TBX5 and GATA4, whose motifs are enriched in TEAD1 non-acetylated peaks, recruit CHD4, a core component of the NuRD complex, to developmental enhancers to suppress non-cardiac cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Notably, YAP, a well-established coactivator of TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), directly recruits CHD4 in different contexts, and this recruitment requires TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Together these observations suggest that TEAD, in concert with cardiac-restricted transcriptional regulators, may contribute to the recruitment of CHD4. Supporting this hypothesis, the subset of NKX2-5, TBX5 and GATA4 peaks that overlaps with CHD4 binding in the mouse embryonic heart shows a strong enrichment for TEAD motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In contrast, the fraction of NKX2-5, TBX5 and GATA4 peaks that do not overlap with CHD4 lacks this enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Indeed, when overlapping TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and CHD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>) occupancy in the mouse embryonic heart, we found that shared TEAD1-CHD4 peaks are enriched in GATA motifs, while peaks exclusive to TEAD1 are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). In line with this observation, the intersection of GATA4, TEAD1 and CHD4 occupancy in the mouse heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>) shows that GATA4 occupies the majority (69%) of peaks bound by TEAD1 with CHD4 compared to TEAD1-only peaks (32% overlap) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). Regions co-occupied by GATA4-TEAD1 and CHD4 are associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation (such as cardiocyte differentiation and cardiac muscle cell differentiation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5F</xref>). Conversely, regions occupied by GATA4 -TEAD1 without CHD4 are associated with vasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>). Collectively, the preferential co-occupancy of GATA4 and TEAD1 at non-acetylated regions bound by CHD4, suggests that TEAD, alongside GATA, may play a role in attenuating the activity of enhancers involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p><p id="P34">To explore this possibility, we investigated the combined effect of TEAD and tissue-specific regulators at developmental enhancers. GATA motif is recognised by six family members, three of which, GATA4, GATA5, and GATA6, are highly expressed in cardiac tissues. To identify high-confident instances of GATA-TEAD co-binding in vivo, we overlapped human ventricle-specific H3K27ac bins with TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), GATA4 binding in mouse embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), and GATA6 binding in mouse posterior pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Notably, de novo motif discovery performed on GATA6 peaks in the pharyngeal arches, (which contribute to the anterior pole of the heart) identifies TEAD amongst the top enriched motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We prioritised regions 1) shared across the three datasets; 2) containing TEAD and GATA motifs within a distance of 100nt and; 3) associated with genes with cardiac phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). We obtained five high-confident ventricle enhancers, four of which also intersected with CHD4 ChIP-seq peaks in the embryonic mouse ventricle. All the selected enhancers, cloned upstream of a minimal promoter and reporter gene, respond to their tissue-specific activator (GATA6 and GATA4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5AB</xref>). In all cases tested, addition of TEAD1 attenuates enhancer activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A</xref>). Levels of inhibition by TEAD1 varied across enhancers (Fig S5C). We observed an additional decrease in enhancer activation when YAP and TEAD were co-transfected together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, disruption of the TEAD-YAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), resulted in higher GATA activation for all the enhancers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with the presence of endogenous nuclear TEAD/YAP in 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5D</xref>). The identification of TEAD motifs close to tissue-specific TFs in developmental enhancers suggest that TEAD/YAP complex exerts its effect by binding to the enhancer. To address this, we generated mutant versions of one cardiac enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). We observed that the repressive effect of TEAD/YAP complex is impaired in the absence of a canonical TEAD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>), suggesting that TEAD/YAP ability to modulate enhancer activity is dependent on TEAD binding to the enhancer. Ruling out transcriptional repression as a generalised effect of our experimental system, TEAD and YAP increase luciferase activity driven by the <italic>CCN2</italic> promoter, a well-established TEAD target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5E</xref>). Finally, we assessed CHD4 occupancy at the <italic>RAMP1</italic> enhancer. Supporting a role for TEAD/YAP in recruiting CHD4 to this enhancer, we observed higher levels of CHD4 at the <italic>RAMP1</italic> enhancer when GATA6 was transfected together with TEAD/YAP complex, compared to GATA6 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>).</p><p id="P35">To generalise our findings, we chose a co-occurring partner of TEAD in a different tissue, CRX in the RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). For CRX-TEAD, given the lack of available CRX and TEAD1 binding information in the RPE, we selected high-confident RPE enhancers using RPE-specific H3K27ac bins and CRX peaks in the retina as a proxy, and association with genes expressed in the visual system. Three enhancers were prioritised for downstream analysis, using less stringent selection criteria than those adopted for ventricle enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). We found that in all cases tested, addition of TEAD1 attenuates enhancer activation by CRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). Again, levels of inhibition by TEAD1 varied across enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). A mutant version of one RPE enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>), similarly to the mutated cardiac enhancer, showed that the repressive effect of TEAD/YAP is impaired in the absence of a TEAD canonical site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that TEAD/YAP binding at developmental enhancers can negatively interfere with their activation by tissue-specific TFs and uncover a broad, so far unrecognised, effect of TEAD on cell type-specific transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">Gene expression is largely controlled by TFs, which determine the global state of the cell. TF cooperativity is well established and widespread across TF networks. However, our knowledge of TF combinatorial binding largely derives from specific contexts (e.g. cell types or developmental time points). Here we provide a global overview of tissue-specific TF combinations at active enhancers in the developing human embryo. We present a range of evidence that supports our ability to detect functional co-occurring TF motifs. There are, however, limitations to using bioinformatics methods that rely on PWMs to predict functional binding events. The main one is that co-expressed TFs belonging to the same TF family recognise the same or very similar sites, limiting the accuracy of the predictions.</p><p id="P37">Our analysis identifies universal patterns of functional connectivity, shared by enhancers active in distinct tissues. A key finding is the recurrent co-occurrence of ubiquitous and tissue-specific TF motifs in active developmental enhancers. We find that tissue-specific enhancers from various, unrelated tissues are significantly enriched in motifs for the ubiquitous TFs TEAD, located near motifs recognised by tissue-specific TFs. TEAD TFs lack an activation domain and serve as a binding platform for coactivators, particularly YAP/TAZ. The hippo pathway regulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of YAP and the formation of the TEAD-YAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>). During mouse organogenesis, hippo signalling regulates cell proliferation and organ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>) across multiple organs, including the heart, craniofacial structures, lung, eye, brain, kidney and bile duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>). Consistently, we identify enriched TEAD motifs in developmental enhancers active in the heart ventricle, palate, RPE, brain, kidney, lower limb and pancreas. By testing a subset of cardiac and RPE developmental enhancers, we find that TEAD1, together with its coactivator YAP, attenuates tissue-specific enhancer activation. The TEAD/YAP complex is widely recognized for its role as a transcriptional activator, yet it can also function as a transcriptional repressor through various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>), including the recruitment of CHD4 and the NuRD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). The preferential binding of TEAD1 with cardiac regulators at non-acetylated regions occupied by CHD4, suggests that combinatorial binding of TEAD1 with cardiac-enriched TFs attenuates enhancer activity via CHD4 recruitment. Supporting this hypothesis, TEAD1 repressive function in vitro relies on the presence of an activator; the TEAD/YAP complex does not repress enhancer activity per se and requires TEAD binding to DNA for this effect. Alongside the observed reduction in enhancer activity upon adding TEAD-YAP to transfected enhancers, CHD4 levels are increased at these enhancers. While our results point to cooperation of tissue-specific regulators with TEAD to recruit CHD4, the molecular contribution of each TFs to CHD4 recruitment, as well as the temporal dynamics of this process, are unclear. Additional studies on developmental enhancers in their genomic context, are required to fully elucidate TEAD role as a repressor.</p><p id="P38">The TEAD/YAP complex typically functions at early differentiation stages, in progenitor cells, and becomes downregulated at terminal stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>). In addition to regulating cell proliferation, this complex also impacts cell differentiation: loss of function experiments targeting TEAD or YAP result in decreased cell proliferation and rapid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>) while gain of function experiments produce the opposite effect - aberrant differentiation and increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>). Our findings suggest a broad role for TEAD in regulating type-specific transcriptional programs. We propose that TEAD TFs, while promoting proliferation of precursor cells, also restrain their differentiation by recruiting CHD4, in collaboration with tissue-specific regulators, to lineage-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>). Supporting this model, cardiac genomic regions co-occupied by GATA4, CHD4, and TEAD1 are primarily associated with the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, the main cell type in the heart. This suggests that TEAD1 may attenuate the activity of enhancers that control cardiomyocyte differentiation. In a developing organism, the timely differentiation of proliferating progenitors is essential for proper organ composition and size. Therefore, the attenuation of cell type differentiation programs by TEAD TFs may be a vital mechanism to prevent premature differentiation of progenitors ensuring the production of an adequate number of differentiated cells and contributing to appropriate organ size.</p><p id="P39">Understanding general principles of transcriptional networks is essential for deciphering how cell states are established and maintained, as well as for identifying the precise sequence codes that determine when and where genes are expressed. Beyond TEAD, we also identified the co-occurrence of other motif clusters recognized by ubiquitous TF families, such as TALE and ETS, alongside ‘First Search’, tissue-specific TFs. Our observations suggest that ubiquitously expressed TFs play a crucial role in shaping the chromatin landscape of developmental enhancers during human organogenesis.</p><p id="P40">The main focus of tissue-specific acquisition research revolves around the expression of tissue-specific TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>). Tissue-specific TF expression is central to stem cell differentiation protocols, reprogramming protocols and in developmental disease diagnostics. Our findings reveal that non-tissue-specific TFs may also contribute to tissue-specific gene regulation. Consistently, analysis of co-occurring motifs enriched in promoters of differentially expressed genes uncovered a potential involvement of non-tissue-specific TFs in driving tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>). Given that enhancers have higher tissue specificity than promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>), the recurring enrichment of ubiquitous TF at tissue-specific enhancers highlights the significance of these TFs in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. This insight raises important questions about the role of ubiquitous TFs in cell differentiation, lineage determination, and their overall impact on the acquisition of tissue specificity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS189363-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS189363-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank members of the Bobola lab for their scientific and technical insights, and the Bioimaging Facility at the University of Manchester for help with the imaging performed in this project.</p><sec id="S26"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Medical Research Council (MRC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc.ukri.org">http://www.mrc.ukri.org</ext-link>) studentship to AGM, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bbsrc.ukri.org">http://www.bbsrc.ukri.org</ext-link>) grants BB/N00907X/1 and BB/T007761/1 to NB.

Human embryo showing tissue/organs used in this study. Samples collected ranged from Carnegie Stage 14 to 21. Black lines connect each organ/tissue to its corresponding number of H3K27ac-positive bins; 1kb bins replicated only in one tissue were used as putative tissue-specific enhancers as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Each tissue is labelled with the same colour code across the manuscript. B. HOMER known motif enrichment analysis of heart ventricle-specific H3K27ac bins. In this representative example, the top 10 motifs of the list are shown. For analysis, the top 20 known enriched motifs in each set of tissue-specific H3K27ac bins were used. C. Heatmap showing patterns of expression of tissue-restricted TFs across embryonic tissues. All tissues were duplicated except for pituitary, muscle and skin. Raw counts were down sampled based on the 75th percentile and only genes with total expression value over 75 were considered. Expression of each TF was divided by its median expression across all tissues and log median-normalized expression was used to plot the heatmap. TFs whose expression remained constant across tissues were removed. The heatmap of all TFs present in the list obtained from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and represented in the RNA-seq data from is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S1A</xref>. D. Heatmap showing the expression of ventricle-restricted TFs. TFs with expression higher than approximately 150 times their median expression in one tissue, were considered restricted to that tissue. Those ventricle-restricted TFs, whose recognition motifs are within the top 20 motif enrichment analysis results shown in 1B were considered ‘First Search TFs’. GATA4, HAND1, MYOG and TBX20 are ventricle-restricted TFs that bind a motif contained in the top 20 enriched motif in ventricle-specific enhancers (1B), namely GATA6, HAND2, AP4 and TBX20 motifs. E. Pipeline to identify ‘Second Search’ TFs co-occurring with ‘First Search’ TFs. Motif enrichment analysis was performed using ‘First Search’ TF motif coordinates within tissue-specific regulatory regions as foreground, and ‘First Search’ TF motif coordinates within random regions as background. Motif enrichment analysis was performed 100nt either side of the ‘First Search’ TF’s motif to identify TF motifs that co-occur with the ‘First Search’ TF motif in tissue-specific regulatory regions. Co-occurring motifs are labelled as ‘Second Search’ TFs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189363-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Global network of TF co-binding at tissue-specific developmental enhancers.</title><p>Network of co-occurring TF motifs at active tissue-specific enhancers in human embryonic development.

Heatmap showing number of co-occurring events for each ‘Second Search’ TF cluster. Clustering by number of co-occurrences assigns ‘Second Search’ clusters to three groups: high co-occurring, medium co-occurring and low co-occurring. bHLH clades A and B have the highest number of co-occurring events. ‘Second Search’ clusters of motifs recognised by ubiquitous TFs are abundant (found in the high/medium co-occurring groups). For instance, TEAD cluster presents high levels of co-occurring events, whilst TALE and ETS are found in the medium co-occurring cluster. B. Heatmap showing patterns of expression of TFs belonging to TEAD, STAT, ETS and TALE TF families. All tissues were duplicated except for pituitary, muscle and skin. Raw counts were down sampled based on the 75th percentile. Expression of each TF was divided by its median expression across all tissues and log median-normalized expression was used to plot the heatmap.

Significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey test for multiple comparisons of the means calculated for each enhancer plasmid (significance results are shown in black). In addition, unpaired t-tests were used to compare two conditions across enhancers (significance results shown in red/cyan), **** = P &lt; 0.0001, ** = P &lt; 0.01, * = P &lt; 0.05, ns = P &gt; 0.05. F. Working model. In progenitor cells, TEAD alongside YAP binds tissue-specific enhancers nearby tissue-specific activators and attenuates enhancer activity, reducing the expression of tissue-specific genes and slowing down cell differentiation. We propose that attenuation of enhancer activity is due to recruitment of CHD4 by the TEAD/YAP complex and tissue-specific activators. Reduced activity of TEAD in differentiated cells, possibly due to either TEAD no longer binding to the enhancer, or to its inability to recruit CHD4, results in full enhancer activation and sustained expression of tissue-specific genes. This mechanism could be part of a wider role of TEAD/YAP to slow down differentiation and maintain appropriate pools of progenitor-like cells to achieve correct organ size during organogenesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189363-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
