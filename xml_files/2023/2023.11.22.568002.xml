These methods demand specialist equipment and expertise that often render custom high-grade glass optics inaccessible. We aimed to develop a low-cost, accessible, and reproducible method to manufacture high-quality three-dimensional (3D) printed lenses using consumer-grade technology. Various planoconvex lenses were produced using a consumer-grade 3D printer and low-cost spin coating setup, and printed lenses were compared to commercial glass counterparts. A range of mechanical and optical methods are introduced to determine the surface quality and curvature of 3D printed lenses. Amongst others, high-resolution interference reflection microscopy methods were used to reconstruct the convex surface of printed lenses and quantify their radius of curvature. The optical throughput and performance of 3D printed lenses were assessed using optical transmissivity measurements and classical beam characterisation methods. We determined that 3D printed lenses had comparable curvature and performance to commercial glass lenses. Finally, we demonstrated the application of 3D printed lenses for brightfield transmission microscopy, resolving sub-cellular structures over a 2.3 mm field-of-view. The high reproducibility and comparable performance of 3D printed lenses present great opportunities for additive manufacturing of bespoke optics for low-cost rapid prototyping and improved accessibility to high-quality optics in low-resource settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Open Microscopy</kwd><kwd>Additive Manufacturing</kwd><kwd>Optics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Additive manufacturing, in particular 3D printing, has resulted in a range of innovative open hardware solutions for optical imaging applications. The variety of printing modalities, commitment to open sharing by users, low barrier-to-entry, and rapid evolution of 3D printing technologies has provided new opportunities to make imaging more accessible, particularly in low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Open microscopy initiatives have aimed to provide improved access to 3D printed microscopy hardware for use in the field or in rapid clinical diagnostics, such as the OpenFlexure project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, such initiatives routinely focus on 3D printing the mechanical parts of the microscope, such as the chassis, focusing assemblies, or specimen mounts, mainly using fused deposition modelling (FDM) printing to manufacture parts from heated plastic filaments. The optical elements in these applications still use glass objectives or plastic camera lenses. There is a need for accessible and robust methods to produce high-quality optical elements.</p><p id="P5">Optical imaging has relied on the use of ground glass lenses to manipulate light for centuries[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Manufacturing such glass lenses is a subtractive process that can be prohibitively expensive for custom optics, requires specialist equipment and expertise, and produces a product that is delicate and easily damaged. Additive manufacturing, specifically 3D printing, has the potential to mitigate each of these barriers. Recently, additive manufacturing methods using injection moulding, magnetorheological, and molten glass printing have successfully produced bespoke optical elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In the latter, glass filaments are heated and extruded as in FDM printing, annealed, and cured in a kiln to produce the final product. However, this process is prohibitively costly owing to the specialist equipment and expertise required to manipulate glass in such ways. Resin-based printing techniques provide a viable solution to create bespoke optical elements for use in open hardware and imaging applications.</p><p id="P6">A variety of resin-based printing methods are available, mainly based on stereolithography (SLA) techniques. Two-photon polymerisation is routine for microfabrication of lenses, particularly for microlens arrays and x-ray imaging optics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. However, the requirement for specialist ultrashort pulsed laser sources and expensive printing instrumentation serves as a barrier to entry for these methods. Masked SLA (MSLA) printing is one of the most accessible SLA techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. This method uses a proprietary mix of methacrylate-based resin that is available in transparent and opaque forms and photoinitiated cross-linkers to polymerise under irradiation using 405 nm light. The illumination pattern is provided by an array of UV light emitting diodes, which can be collimated to provide homogeneous illumination over the entire build area. A liquid-cyrstal display (LCD) screen then masks the structure of discrete layers of the print design, changing in unison with the axial position of a buildplate mounted to a motorised stage to create a printed 3D structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Recent studies have produced MSLA 3D printed lenses for spectrophotometry applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and described methods to quantify their material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]; however, the optical performance of 3D printed lenses remains uncharacterised. Current advances in consumer-grade MSLA printer technology enable printing with a lateral resolution of up to 18 μm and an axial resolution of up to 10 μm.</p><p id="P7">We aimed to create a robust method to manufacture and characterise the optical performance of transparent 3D printed high-quality bulk optics using a consumer-grade printer and commercially available resin. We used a low-cost MSLA 3D printer and employed a spin-coating method render the lenses transparent by minimising surface imperfections and reduce scattering and refraction from step structures originating from the printing process (the so-called ‘staircase effect’). We printed a range of planoconvex lenses of various optical prescriptions, we characterised their surface profile in comparison to their commercial glass counterparts, and we assessed their optical performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>3D printing</title><p id="P8">All 3D printing was conducted using a consumer-grade Mars 3 printer (Elegoo, China) fitted with a magnetic build plate attachment for easy print removal (Sovol, China). Clear resin (Clear Resin V4; Formlabs, USA) was used as the substrate for all prints. The print settings were optimised using the Cones of Calibration test print (TableFlip Foundry) and the print quality was verified using the Ameralabs Town test print (MB Labsamera, Lithuania) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). All lens prints were conducted using the parameters detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>, with the planar side of the lenses printed directly on the buildplate surface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphical overview of the manufacturing process for 3D printed lenses.</p><p id="P9">Planoconvex lens designs (each with a lens diameter of 12.5 mm) were acquired from the manufacturer (Thorlabs, USA or Edmund Optics, USA) as .STEP files. Files were imported into Fusion 360 (v2.0.16985; Autodesk, USA) and the polygon count was increased to the maximum available before being exported as .STL files. Files were then imported into LycheeSlicer (v5.2.201; Mango3D, France), where the print parameters were applied, and the print files were exported as .CTB files. The .CTB lens files were printed with a raft surrounding the lens perimeter which provided a handling surface to avoid touching the lens surface. This increased the total diameter of the print to 25 mm, and ensured the print would fit in a standard 25 mm diameter optical mount (LMR1S; Thorlabs, USA). Four planoconvex lens prescriptions of different focal lengths (<italic>f</italic>) were selected, based on commercial glass counterparts; <italic>f</italic> = +12.5 mm (37-385; Edmund Optics, USA), <italic>f</italic> = + 19.9 mm (LA1074; ThorLabs, USA), <italic>f</italic> = + 35.0 mm (37-791; Edmund Optics, USA), and <italic>f</italic> = + 49.8 mm (LA1213; ThorLabs, USA).</p><p id="P10">Following printing, the lenses were removed from the magnetic build plate and washed with neat isopropanol (10592921; FisherScientific, USA) for 9 minutes in a Mercury X washing station (Elegoo, China). The prints were removed and carefully air-dried using a compressed Ultra Pure Duster (Thorlabs, USA) before a post-print UV curing step for 20 minutes in a Mercury X curing station (Elegoo, China).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spin Coating and Lens Preparation</title><p id="P11">The printed lenses were rendered optically transparent by spin coating a thin layer of resin over both the curved and planar surfaces, minimising layer artefacts and surface structures from the printing process. For the convex surface, a spin coater (L2001A3-E463; Ossila, UK) was fitted with a custom 3D printed chuck with a 25 mm diameter well to accommodate a printed lens. The printed lens was cleaned again prior to coating with 100% isopropanol, airdried using compressed air, and placed in the chuck. 100 μl of Clear UV Resin (4<sup>th</sup> Generation; VidaRosa, China) was deposited on the apex of the lenses (50 μl for <italic>f</italic> = + 49.8 mm to accommodate the shallower curvature) and spun for 10 seconds at 2000 rpm. The coated lenses were stored in darkened conditions for 30 minutes to allow the liquid resin to settle and were subsequently cured for 20 minutes using the Mercury X curer as described above.</p><p id="P12">For the planar surface, the spin coater was fitted with a 76 mm x 26 mm microscope slide chuck and a clean microscope slide placed in the chuck. A thin resin layer was created by depositing 100 μl of Clear Resin (v4; Formlabs, USA) on the slide and spinning for 10 seconds at 2000 rpm. The cleaned planar slide of the printed lens was carefully placed on to the resin-coated slide to avoid introducing air bubbles and was placed in a vacuum chamber (2 L,; Bacoeng, USA) fitted with a vacuum pump (Capex 8C; Charles Austen Pumps Ltd, UK). The assembly was maintained under a vacuum on 0.9 bars for 30 minutes before curing for 20 minutes as described above. The melded lens-slide combination was stored at -20°C for 3 minutes and carefully levered from the slide, relying on the differential thermal expansion of the glass and resin to remove the lens from the microscope slide.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Spin-coat Thickness Measurements</title><p id="P13">To determine the thickness of the spin coated layers, coumarin-30, a non-polar green-emitting organic fluorophore, was prepared as a 10 mM stock in 100% isopropanol and mixed with 1 ml of Clear UV Resin (4<sup>th</sup> Generation; VidaRosa, China) at a final concentration of 100 μM. Lenses from each of the four test prescriptions were spin coated and cured as described above.</p><p id="P14">The thickness of the fluorescent spin coated layer was measured by acquiring a 3D image stack using a confocal laser scanning microscope. An Olympus IX81 inverted microscope coupled to an FV1000 confocal laser scanning unit (Olympus, Japan) was used for imaging. Excitation of fluorescence was performed using a 488 nm argon laser (GLG3135; Showa Optronics, Japan) and fluorescence emission from coumarin-30 was detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a detection spectral window of 500 nm to 550 nm. Coated lenses were placed with the curved surface in contact with a Type 1.5 coverglass and imaged using a 10×/0.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective lens (Olympus, Japan). All images were acquired at the axial Nyquist sampling rate for the imaging objective (Δ<italic>z</italic> = 1.53 μm). The thickness of the fluorescent layer was measured using a linear plot profile of the fluorescence intensity in orthogonal (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>z</italic> and <italic>y</italic>,<italic>z</italic>) views of the 3D image stack using FIJI (v1.53t) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Analysis was conducted using three replicate printed lenses with each focal length.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>White Light Interferometry and Stylus Profilometry</title><p id="P15">Methods for measuring the surface profile of planoconvex lenses include non-contact white light interferometry and contact stylus profilometry, with contact measurement approaches often only reporting the curvature of a linear trace instead of providing a 3D reconstruction of the specimen topology. Non-contact surface profiles were obtained using a white light interferometer (Wyko NT1100; Veeco Instruments Inc, USA) which used coherent light to generate interference fringes which are axially shifted through the optical surface, providing two-dimensional surface roughness and uniformity measurements. The interferometer was used in a vertical scanning interferometry configuration where an internal translator axially scanned in one direction during the measurement as the in-built camera detector recorded each frame. The non-contact approach provides an approximate 300 x 200 μm surface area measurement using a 20x objective, with a colour gradient to indicate height (Δ<italic>z</italic>) changes as well as read-out line profiles to provide sub-nanometre-scale surface roughness across the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axes of the specimen. The contact approach utilised a stylus profiler (Alpha-Step IQ; KLA Corp., USA) with 5 μm tip diameter for one-dimensional surface topology. The stylus profilometry technique provides millimetre-range one-dimensional measurements with sub-nanometre height resolution for curvature and roughness analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Interference Reflection Microscopy (IRM)</title><p id="P16">The underpinning theory of IRM relating to imaging of plano-convex lenses has been explained elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Briefly, the printed lens specimens were placed convex side down on a Type 1.5 coverglass, bridging the stage insert of an IX81 inverted microscope coupled to an FV1000 confocal laser scanning unit (Olympus, Japan). An 80/20 beamsplitter was used in place of the dichroic filter in the confocal microscope, which facilitated a configuration to detect reflected light from the specimen plane. A 458 nm argon laser (GLG3135; Showa Optronics, Japan) provided incident light, which was reflected from refractive index boundaries at the specimen plane (i.e., coverglass-air and air-lens interfaces). Reflected light from each interface coincided, leading to constructive and destructive interference depending on the optical path difference of the two reflected beams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). The resulting image provided a 2D projection of the 3D topography of the specimen surface, where interference orders were separated along the optical axis. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">2</xref> describe the axial separation of destructive and constructive interference orders, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], where <italic>z</italic> = fringe spacing, <italic>N</italic> = order, <italic>λ</italic> = wavelength of incident light, and <italic>n<sub>m</sub></italic> = refractive index of the imaging medium. <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>Eq. 1</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>Eq. 2</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> IRM images were acquired using a 10x/0.4 NA objective lens (Olympus, Japan) and the reflection signal was detected using a PMT with the detection limited to 458 nm ± 5 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Reconstructing 3D Surface Curvature and Quantifying Radius of Curvature from 2D IRM Image Data</title><p id="P17">All computational analyses of IRM data were performed using FIJI and Python 3.8.10 (64-bit) in a Spyder IDE 5.3.2 environment on an Elitebook 840 G7 (Hewlett-Packard, USA) running a 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise operating system with an Intel<sup>®</sup> Core™ i5-10310U 1.70GHz quad-core processor with 16 GB of 2666 MT/s DDR4 RAM.</p><p id="P18">The IRM image data were exported as .OIB files and pre-processed using FIIJ. The images were cropped to ensure the apex of the lens was centred in the image, and a median filter (σ = 2) was applied to remove any high-frequency noise in the data. Images were contrast adjusted using the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) plugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] (blocksize = 127, histogram bins = 256, maximum slope = 3.00) and converted to .PNG files for analysis.</p><p id="P19">A custom Python pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] was created to generate 3D reconstructions of the surface of the lens specimens from 2D IRM images and calculate the median radius of curvature for each lens.

The principle of Tolansky interferometry relies on two opposing highly reflective surfaces (in this case, an aluminium-coated coverglass and aluminium-coated 3D printed lens) which generate multiple reflected beams that undergo constructive and destructive interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The multiple beam combination acts to modify the Haidinger rings formed at the focus of the objective lens such that the nodal spacing is not altered, but the intensity distribution of the interference orders is changed. This effectively increases the axial resolution compared with IRM, such that topological features as small as 5 Å, or better, can be resolved within the interference maxima [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Moreover, uncoupling the reflective specimen from the reflective coverglass provides a means to translate the interference orders through the optical axis, in turn ‘scanning’ the topography of the convex lens surface in a way that IRM cannot.</p><p id="P23">A 3D printed lens (<italic>f</italic> = + 19.9 mm) and a Type 1.5 coverglass were vapour coated with a thin layer of aluminium using a thermal evaporator coating system (E306A; Edwards Vacuum, UK).

The aluminium-coated coverglass was bonded to the top of the collar using a thin layer of epoxy resin around the circumference of the objective lens housing. An adjustment screw was included in the collar to facilitate the positioning of the collar-coverglass assembly relative to the focal length of the objective lens (approximately 3.1 mm). The aluminium-coated lens specimen was suspended over the stage insert of an inverted IX81 microscope coupled to a confocal laser scanning unit (Olympus, Japan). Two glass microscope slide spacers were inserted to raise the test lens so that the modified objective underneath could be focussed near to the lens surface. Tolansky interferometry was performed using the same reflection setup as in IRM experiments but employed z-scanning which uncoupled the specimen from the coverslip. Altering the relative distance between the coverglass and lens specimen resulted in axial translation of interference orders and provided a means of visualising the curved apical surface by merging images acquired at different axial positions into a single hyperstack colour-coded by depth using FIJI.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Optical Transmission Measurements</title><p id="P25">The percentage transmission of the printing resin was measured by comparing the mean intensity of transmitted light through resin blocks of varying thickness compared to the transmission through a single Type 1.5 coverglass.

The blocks were placed on a Type 1.5 coverglass and imaged using an IX81 inverted microscope coupled to an FV1000 confocal laser scanning unit (Olympus, Japan) configured to detect scanned transmitted light. The transmissivity of unprocessed and processed blocks (i.e., naïve and spin coated, respectively) was measured using three discrete wavelengths across the visible spectrum sequentially; a 458 nm argon laser, a 515 nm argon laser, and a 633 nm helium-neon laser (GLG3135; Showa Optronics, Japan). Images were acquired using a 4×/0.1 NA objective lens (Olympus, Japan), with dimensions 64 × 64 pixels and Kalman averaging (n = 5 frames) to minimise contributions to the image from print structures. The mean intensity across the field was measured using FIJI and compared to the optical throughput of the coverglass alone. Linear fits were conducted using Prism.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Beam Profilometry</title><p id="P26">An optical setup was constructed to measure the focusing ability of 3D printed lenses compared to their commercial glass counterpart.

Moreover, we have characterised and compared the quality of 3D printed lenses against commercially available glass counterparts of the same prescription. A spin-coating method was employed to obviate the stepped print structure and to render the printed lenses smooth and transparent, resulting in a thin surface coating on the order of 35 μm thick. White light and stylus profilometry were used to assess the surface quality of printed lenses, while confocal IRM was used to reconstruct the surface topology of 3D printed lenses with high axial resolution and quantify the radius of curvature, which matched that of glass lens counterparts. It is important to note that, while IRM in confocal scanning mode provides increased contrast due to coherent illumination and the rejection of out-of-focus light by a pinhole aperture, widefield IRM also presents feasible and accessible method to achieve similar, albeit lower-contrast, IRM data. Tolansky multiple beam interferometry corroborated the profilometry data by revealing the curved topology of the apex of the convex lenses. The printing and processing steps facilitated comparable optical throughput to glass lenses, with greater than 90% transmission across the visible spectrum.</p><p id="P37">The optical performance of 3D printed lenses was determined by measuring their ability to focus a beam of light. Shorter focal length printed lenses were observed to have the same focal length as their glass counterparts, with moderately increased beam diameters and Rayleigh ranges. The performance of 3D printed lenses was limited in longer focal length printed lenses (i.e., <italic>f</italic> = + 49.8 mm), which exhibited extended focal lengths indicative of spherical aberration. However, our findings present 3D printing as a viable option for the manufacturing of high-quality lenses for optical instrumentation and rapid prototyping as a less costly and more accessible alternative to bulk glass optics. Finally, we demonstrated the use of 3D printed lenses for brightfield transmission imaging. Despite the aberrations observed during beam profilometry experiments using printed <italic>f</italic> = + 49.8 mm lenses, the imaging results were promising. Sub-cellular spatial resolution was achieved with high contrast over a 2.3 mm field of view, showing great promise for the use of 3D printed optics in microscopy.</p><p id="P38">Previous studies developing 3D printed optics have used a variety of additive manufacturing methods, these with most of these typically being costly, requiring specialist equipment, or being mainly focussed on using consumer-grade printers to produce micro-optics. Fused deposition modelling, where thin glass filaments are melted, extruded and cooled into the shape of a lens, has resulted in 3D printed glass bulk optics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. However, the silicon dioxide substrate requires careful mixing with titanium dioxide and a complex series of drying, burnout and sintering steps performed at over 1000 °C that limit users without access to specialist equipment. Alternative filament-based methods have used CO<sub>2</sub> lasers to print transparent glass lenses from a single mode optical fibre and fused quartz filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. However, these molten glass methods often result in layering defects that reduce optical performance.</p><p id="P39">Stereolithography approaches have resulted in various techniques to manufacture resin-based optics. These methods routinely use a two-photon polymerisation-based platform to manufacture microlens arrays (MLAs) and optics, although print sizes are typically limited to only a few mm in diameter. Moreover, two-photon-based instrumentation can be prohibitively costly and presents a barrier to entry for accessible 3D printed optics. Printed lenses using, for example, a Nanoscribe printer have recently been produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] but they retain microstructures and layering artefacts resulting from the printing process and curvature defects that ultimately impact on their optical performance. Moreover, these techniques are often limited by their small print sizes and high materials and instrument costs, somewhat restricting their use to MLAs and other micro-optics. Recent developments in two-photon microprinting have successfully been used to fabricate bespoke micro-optics, such as 30 μm-diameter Fresnel elements for x-ray microscopy, using photopolymerising resins on a supportive silicon nitride membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Foveated compound microlenses have also recently been produced using femtosecond direct laser writing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], but all two-photon methods require a costly and complex ultrashort pulsed laser source. Microlens arrays have been printed using UV-induced photopolymerisation, with recent improvements seeing expansion of MLAs over large flexible substrates to improve optical performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and the introduction of vibrating projection lenses during printing to smooth the surface of 3D printed micro-optics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Aspheric lenses have been manufactured using UV photopolymerisation, however these specialised lenses required assembly with corrective quartz substrates and refractive index matching liquids in order to focus light, but suffered from both chromatic and spherical aberration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Each of these 3D printing methods are based on inaccessible and specialist equipment, which often produce 3D printed lenses that do not compare to the performance of their commercially produced glass counterparts.</p><p id="P40">We have described an accessible, low-cost, and reproducible method for manufacturing bespoke 3D printed lenses and a suite of characterisation methods that demonstrate their comparable performance to glass lenses. We implemented profilometry methods centred on IRM that provide high-resolution topographical reconstructions of the lens geometry, which offer alternative analysis methods for IRM and standing wave microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Using 458 nm illumination for IRM and 633 nm light for beam profiling ensured that the material properties of the printed lenses did not change during observation, as the resin absorbance peak is noted as 405 nm. The Tolansky interferometry mapping, together with white light and stylus profilometry data, suggest that the enlarged zeroth order present in IRM images was an inherent interference artefact, perhaps contributed by subtle refractive index differences between the printed layers caused by compounding exposure to light during printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. However, despite this apparent interference artefact across all lenses, it did not impact on their optical performance. Short focal length lenses with inherently higher curvatures performed in line with their commercial glass counterparts, but longer focal length lenses on the order of <italic>f</italic> = 50 mm were subject to optical aberrations. This suggests that future applications creating 3D printed multi-lens systems would better suit the inclusion of shorter focal length elements. Overall, the beam waist radius and Rayleigh range were increased compared to glass lenses, however this did not impact the ability of 3D printed lenses to effectively focus light.</p><p id="P41">The potential for additive manufacturing for bespoke optics, rapid design prototyping, and field diagnostics is huge. Our data show that high-quality optical elements can be produced at low cost with consumer grade equipment, totalling approximately £300. The only additional outlet would be a spin coater, which can be procured for less than £1,000. The total cost in producing a single 3D printed lens was approximately £0.11, as opposed to upwards of £50 for commercial high-grade lenses. The demonstrated optical performance of 3D printed lenses shows great promise for optical imaging and prototyping optical instrumentation. Moreover, we have shown separately that 3D printed lenses can be implemented in bioimaging applications, using both absorption and fluorescence imaging modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. The potential impact of these accessible and open manufacturing methods could also impact across low resource settings for rapid diagnostics of blood smears, for example, where 3D printing has already made significant impacts. The combination of previous 3D printed microscope chassis with 3D printed lenses would be a natural evolution to produce the first fully 3D printed optical microscope.</p></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P42">We present an accessible 3D printing method to manufacture high-quality optical lenses and provide characterisation methods to quantify their performance. With the prohibitive cost of bespoke bulk glass optics and difficulties in their manufacture, 3D printing offers a viable method to produce a range of lenses with a high degree of reproducibility. The quality of 3D printed lenses was determined by comparing their surface curvature, optical throughput, and ability to focus light compared to their commercial glass counterparts. Glass and 3D printed lenses were observed to behave similarly for a range of short focal length prescriptions, but longer focal lengths introduced a high degree of spherical aberration. The same trend was true for the surface curvature, where highly curved lenses conformed to the radius of curvature of their glass counterparts, while the surface coat thickness was routinely on the order of 35 μm. The transmissivity of 3D printed lenses was comparable to that of bulk N-BK7 glass across the visible spectrum. Moreover, 3D printed lenses were implemented in a brightfield transmission microscopy setup and facilitated high-quality imaging that demonstrated promise for future applications. Each of these observations concluded that 3D printing is a viable approach to reproducibly producing large volumes of high-quality optical elements that provide promise for prototyping, imaging applications, and field diagnostics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191535-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Authors would like to thank Dr Ross Scrimgeour (Institute for Cancer Research, UK) for his helpful comments on the IRM analysis code, Mr Rian MacDonnchadha (University of Glasgow, UK) for his insights on 3D printing instrumentation, and Miss Kay Polland for her assistance with figure preparation.</p><p>The schematics and workflow presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> were prepared using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://app.biorender.com/">BioRender.com</ext-link> (Licence Number: SR25JKZ3PC).</p><p>LMR, SF, and WBA were funded by the Leverhulme Trust.
