This process starts already in early fetal development and is highly active until the involution of the thymus in adolescence. To map the micro-anatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- vs. post-natal states, we undertook a spatially resolved analysis and established a new quantitative morphological framework for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis. Using this axis in conjunction with the curation of a multimodal single-cell, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging atlas, we show that canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cells are highly organised and fully established by post-conception week 12, pinpoint TEC progenitor states, find that TEC subsets and peripheral tissue genes are associated with Hassall’s Corpuscles and uncover divergence in the pace and drivers of medullary entry between CD4 vs. CD8 T cell lineages. These findings are complemented with a holistic toolkit for spatial analysis and annotation, providing a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">T cells play a central role in adaptive immunity, aiding the development of the humoral immune response, eliminating infected and cancerous cells through T cell-mediated killing, and regulating specific and targeted immune responses while avoiding prolonged inflammation or autoimmunity. This is achieved by distinct T cell subtypes, which include conventional helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as well as unconventional T cell types, such as yδT cells, Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CD8αα intraepithelial lymphocytes (lELs), that exhibit innate-like characteristics in their antigen recognition and effector functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. All T lineage cells originate from bone marrow-derived precursors but develop in the thymus, which originates from the bilateral thymic primordia that migrate and attach to the pericardium in post-conception week (pcw) 8 of human embryonic development, giving rise to the two lobes of the organ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the tissue is seeded by lymphoid precursors as well as vascular and mesenchymal cells, and the precursors of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) begin to differentiate into different functional subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Previous reports by us and others have suggested pcw 12-14 as the earliest time point when mature T cells are first released into the periphery and indicated that a clear morphological division between the internal medulla and the surrounding cortex is established around pcw 12-16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Although thymopoiesis remains highly active until adolescence, degeneration and involution of the tissue starts already during paediatric development and involves the gradual infiltration with peripheral lymphocytes and adipocytes, which eventually results in a loss of clear demarcation of cortex and medulla and severe reduction in thymic output in the aged thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The cortex marks the region where bone marrow-derived precursor cells commit to the T lymphocyte lineage, first becoming CD4- CD8- double negative (DN), then CD4+ immature single positive (ISP), and later CD4+ CD8+ double positive (DP) T lineage cells that undergo V(D)J recombination of their T cell receptor (TCR) loci. This is followed by the positive selection of DP thymocytes with a functional TCR through interactions with peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) ligands on cortical TECs (cTECs). Intracellular signals arising from these interactions prompt the lineage bifurcation into CD4+ and CD8+ single positive (SP) thymocytes. Upon migration of positive selected cells into the thymic medulla, they undergo a pruning process termed negative selection, where cells that strongly respond upon TCR engagement with self-ligands found on medullary TECs (mTECs) and other antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), are deleted or converted into suppressive Tregs to enforce tolerance to self<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Beyond the coarse division into cortex and medulla, the thymus harbours secondary morphological structures, such as medullary Hassall’s Corpuscles (HCs), which have been suggested to play an important role in tolerance generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and less clearly defined regions like the cortico-medullary junction (CMJ), which is highly vascularised and thus often referred to as perivascular space (PVS). The thymus is surrounded by a capsule, which exhibits extensions of connective tissue, called trabeculae/septae, that separate individual thymic lobules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Our understanding of the thymic architecture and key steps of T cell development is the result of decades of research since the discovery of the thymus as an immunological organ in the 1960s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> using a range of increasingly sophisticated and higher resolution methods, from flow cytometry to bulk transcriptomics and more recently single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Genetically engineered mouse models and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems have helped elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive differentiation from bone marrow-derived precursors into the diverse array of mature T cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Finally, histologic analyses have provided spatial information on the organ subregions in which the various developmental and antigen-driven steps of these maturation processes occur.6,1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Recent efforts by us and others to comprehensively catalogue the full range of cell types present in the human thymus using single cell RNA-seq6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> have indicated an unexpectedly high degree of diversity not just in the T lineage, but also in other hematopoietic cell types and in the stromal compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To this end, mapping efforts by the Human Cell Atlas (HCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and others have identified more than 50 cell types in the paediatric human thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and have been essential for profiling the cellular composition of the human thymus throughout the first two trimesters of prenatal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The results of these studies raise new questions about the fine-grained organisation of hematopoietic and stromal cells within the thymic lobules and the resulting niches and local chemokine microenvironments that are expected to drive the maturation and migration of thymocytes. These key points are difficult to address with conventional low-throughput spatial technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, the advent of robust methods for spatial genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> together with highly multiplexed RNA/protein imaging approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> provides the necessary level of resolution to investigate these questions in detail, offering a comprehensive and unbiased view of the cellular and molecular processes taking place in the different compartments of the human thymus.</p><p id="P7">Still, direct inter-sample comparisons, especially for human material, have been impeded by the variability in tissue morphology and sampling methodology. This represents a substantial hurdle for data alignment and integration between collaborating research groups and within larger consortia, and hampers comparisons across independent studies. In addition, the lack of a common coordinate framework (CCF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, similar to the one established for the mouse brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas">http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas</ext-link>), has so far limited spatial annotations to discrete structures or morphological compartments. This hinders the exploration of inter-region variance or intrinsic gradients and restricts the ability to model thymocyte maturation in continuous space, especially at the interface between histological structures and cellular neighbourhoods. To overcome these obstacles, we set out to create a continuous CCF for the human thymus. This enabled us to establish consistent structural annotations that can be used as a reference for future thymus studies and to obtain a more holistic portrait of this critical immunological organ throughout early human development. Additionally, it serves as a platform to directly compare and integrate biological observations across modalities, replicates, unpaired samples, and different institutions.</p><p id="P8">To provide an in-depth cellular and spatial atlas covering pre-natal development to three years of age, which represents the early to peak stage of the organ function prior to the slow degeneration of the thymus, we integrated several types of thymic spatial data with the largest multi-modal single cell annotation reference of the human thymus to date, spanning more than 500K cells. By applying a newly developed computational tool set for reproducible image annotation (TissueTag) and analysis (ImageSpot), we have derived a mathematical model for a continuous scale- and rotation-invariant morphological CCF (OrganAxis) of the thymus lobules, the “cortico-medullary axis” (CMA). We show that this axis captures the major transcriptomic variance in pre- and post-natal tissue sections and across multiple spatial modalities in each sample individually and collectively.</p><p id="P9">Through this approach, we describe the organisation of the thymus at a resolution beyond the typically annotated morphological compartments. By comparing pre- and post-natal thymi, we show that broad cytokine/chemokine gradients and cellular sub-zonations are established and constant from as early as pcw 12. We identify a relatively homogeneous cellular distribution in the cortex as opposed to a highly structured organisation of the medulla with a gradient composed of different stromal cell types. Furthermore, we find specific marker gene expression profiles associated with HCs that are independent of the general layering of the thymic medulla. Finally, we show that thymocytes developing along the CD4 and CD8 lineages express different chemokine receptors and correspondingly show divergent timing of cortico-medullary migration.</p><p id="P10">Beyond these and other biological findings of our study, this combination of high content, multi-resolution data and computational analysis involving a substantial set of fetal and paediatric tissues provides a rich, spatially resolved atlas and CCF of the human thymus for future studies. Importantly, since our spatial tool set and modelling framework are based on tissue landmarks exclusively, it can be adapted to any tissue in 2D or 3D, brightfield or fluorescent images, multiplex antibody-based optical imaging and any spatial transcriptomics platform, thereby serving as a universal tool for continuous spatial annotation and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Combining multimodal spatial and single cell data with novel computational tools to generate an integrated thymus atlas</title><p id="P11">To robustly map and characterise the cells in the thymus, we first expanded the current coverage of dissociated single cell data sets and refined their annotation, focussing on fetal samples from pcw 10 to 21 and post-natal samples from early infancy until 3 years of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To expand stromal cell representation, we integrated our previous single cell atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> with two recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> that had specifically enriched for epithelial, endothelial, myeloid, and fibroblast lineages. Additionally, we added <italic>de novo</italic> generated data from 9 paediatric donors, resulting in a data set totalling over 500K high-quality cells, including TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) for more than 100K cells as well as 120K cells with paired CITE-seq and scTCR-seq data, and 38K cells from CITE-seq experiments, for which only RNA could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 1A-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To link these single cell types with the landscape of the thymus, we implemented three complementary spatial technologies to generate rich data sets matching the two developmental windows that had been sampled in the dissociated single cell data. Specifically, we applied the 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics platform using tissues from paediatric and fetal thymus samples, and incorporated 3 fetal thymus Visium sections that were published in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, totalling 28 sections (fetal: 12 sections from 7 donors, paediatric: 16 sections from 6 donors)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Additionally, we generated high-resolution, single-cell thin-section protein imaging from post-natal thymi using the IBEX method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> with a 44-plex antibody panel curated specifically for TEC and stromal analysis (8 sections from 8 paediatric donors), as well as RareCyte 14-plex broad immunological protein staining from both fetal (6 sections, 2 donors) and paediatric tissue samples (3 sections, 3 donors)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To generate consistent image annotations from all spatial data sets, we developed TissueTag (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nadavyayon/TissueTag">https://github.com/nadavyayon/TissueTag</ext-link>), a Jupyter notebook-based interactive image annotation tool. TissueTag is powered by the Bokeh python library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/">https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/</ext-link>) and provides an annotation solution of tissue regions at subpixel resolution from various image types (brightfield, fluorescence, simulated, etc.) as well as for spatial transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <bold>see Methods</bold>). Annotation of the reference image overcomes resolution constraints (e.g., resulting from the Visium spot size (55 μm) and spacing (100 μm)), thus preserving the spatial sampling resolution across different samples by focusing on absolute scaling. TissueTag creates discrete annotations (“cortex”, “medulla”, etc.) as well as multi-objects (e.g., annotating individual lobules as “lobule 0,1,2…n”). To generate consistent analysis pipelines across samples and technologies based on TissueTag annotations, we developed ImageSpot-toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Teichlab/thymus_spatial_atlas/ImageSpot">https://github.com/Teichlab/thymus_spatial_atlas/ImageSpot</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), which consists of 2 components: (1) the custom processing pipelines “VisiuMator” for Visium data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 2A-D</xref>) and “IBEXtractor” for IBEX imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 3A-B</xref>). These tools enable pre-processing for Visium and 2D/3D cell segmentations for IBEX data and build on TissueTag annotations to gain spatial insights, as well as (2) “OrganAxis”, a mathematical continuous spatial modelling approach, which is used to derive and analyse a landmark-based CCF.</p><p id="P14">To study both broad and specific morphological structures of the thymus, we generated image annotations at multiple levels. Major anatomical structures, such as capsule, cortex, and medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), were annotated as “level 0”, and additional, fine morphological structures, e.g., PVS and HC, were stored in “level 1” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B- D</xref>). Additionally, we recorded discrete lobules with “object_annotator” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3A</xref>). Finally, TissueTag also generates “continuous annotations” by calculating the position of each cell/spot according to its relative distance to a histological annotation in (e.g., capsule, cortex and medulla) with adjustable resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>).</p><p id="P15">To gain single cell resolution and overcome challenges with single cell segmentation in the dense thymic tissue, we extracted two levels of information from IBEX imaging data sets: (1) 3D nuclear segmentations from thin section (6-8 μm) Z stacks and (2) a 50 μm hexagonal grid mask to unbiasedly quantify the protein expression levels of structural protein markers and structural features that are not captured well using nuclear segmentation (e.g., large, branched cells such as thymic epithelial cells or vessels). This grid-based analysis also enables a more direct comparison to Visium data, which is restricted to a grid of hexagonal spots of 55 μm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Establishment of a CCF for the human thymus using OrganAxis</title><p id="P16">A major consideration for spatial tissue atlas construction is the establishment of a common reference framework that permits the proper integration of spatial data from diverse samples and experimental modalities, irrespective of biological variability between different donors or technical discrepancies in image acquisition. We aimed to construct such a continuous CCF for the thymus to map and compare the microenvironments that individual thymocytes encounter throughout their maturation and to ask whether the thymus exhibits internal organisation beyond broad morphological structures.</p><p id="P17">Due to the complex multi-lobular nature of the thymus, it is not possible to simply draw a line connecting thymus landmarks from the capsule across the CMJ to the middle of the medulla, or to use discrete mapping or assignment to “capsular”, “cortical”, or “medullary” locations without losing potentially important information about relative positioning within each micro-compartment. Moreover, using 2D sections limits the ability to identify core features, such as the centre of a medullary region, due to its irregular shape and depth. Finally, it is difficult to annotate discrete lobules as they vary dramatically in size and shape, and the sectioning plane will determine where one lobule ends and the next one starts, irrespective of the full 3D connectivity of these structures.</p><p id="P18">Consequently, we developed a spatial model that is “boundary-centred” and is computed using a sigmoid weight function that increases resolution close to the junction between two structures. In practice, the model uses TissueTag-derived continuous annotations to the three major histological structures in the thymus (capsule, cortex and medulla)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and takes a weighted combination of two different normalised distances (capsule-to-cortex and cortex-to-medulla). This metric, which we termed the Cortico-Medullary Axis (CMA), uniquely defines the relative location of any cell or spot within the thymus macrostructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). The model assumptions are that the relative position within a structure will depend (sigmoidally) on the immediate proximity to a neighbouring structure/landmark, e.g., medullary regions that are relatively far from capsular/cortical areas would be ranked as “deeper” than medullary areas that are closer to capsular/cortical regions and will thus be ranked as “shallow” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Through the assignment of relative positions, the CMA also resolves cases where Visium spots are located at the interface of two discrete structures and cannot unambiguously be assigned to one or the other. Since the CMA is calculated using relative distances to morphological landmarks, this permits a direct comparison of different samples with distinct spatial modalities, section sizes, donor ages or resolutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">3</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To estimate how well the CMA captures biological variance within samples, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the batch corrected Visium and IBEX data sets and calculated the Spearman correlation of the first 9 principal components to the CMA as well as to the total number of counts (the most significant technical factor in Visium samples) or total marker expression levels in IBEX. To get a relative estimate of variance, we further normalised the regression coefficient by the cumulative explained variance. We found that the CMA was highly correlated to the first principal components and, more importantly, explained similar degrees of variance in both fetal and paediatric Visium data sets indicating a consistency in representation of transcriptomic diversity across both developmental stages regardless of their clear morphological difference. For IBEX data sets, the association with the CMA was higher for the 50 μm grid data compared to single nuclei segmentations, indicating that the former captures a higher degree of spatial variability. This suggests that single nuclei segmentations lack local environment information that is represented by the location along the axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The T cell developmental trajectory is largely conserved between fetal and paediatric thymus</title><p id="P20">Substantial differences in the architecture of the thymus are observed throughout development; for instance, the fetal thymus is much smaller in size and has segregated bud-like cortical lobules that are interconnected by the medullary space, whereas the paediatric thymus has much larger cortical regions that are fused together or separated by a thin capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To obtain matching spatial annotations for fetal and paediatric tissue sections despite these macromorphological variations, we mapped all spots in the Visium data to the CMA to derive continuous spatial localisation values. Furthermore, for the axis to serve as a common reference and to aid with visualisation, comparison and enrichment score analysis within larger compartments, we defined subregions along the CMA corresponding to the major anatomical structures (capsule, sub-capsule, cortical CMJ, medullary CMJ) and then further subdivided the cortex and medulla into layers using specific axis values (cortical levels I-III, medullary levels I-II)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <bold>see Methods</bold>).</p><p id="P21">To compare the same cell types and states from both fetal and paediatric T cell maturation trajectories and resident cell distributions, we integrated fetal and paediatric single cell data sets and generated common cell annotations based on marker genes identified in previous atlases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 5A-C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

Relative cell abundances in both fetal and paediatric thymus were also consistent with biological events, with cell numbers increasing due to proliferation in the DP stage and decreasing following selection events at the αβT(entry) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The thymic entry of lymphoid progenitors has previously been described to occur in the medulla or at the CMJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and our Visium-derived CMA prediction did indeed pinpoint the Early T cell Progenitor (ETP) stage to the medulla in both fetal and paediatric tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The subsequent DN(early) differentiation stage was predicted to predominantly localise to the subcapsular region of the fetal thymus, whereas in the paediatric tissue this thymocyte subset was still mostly medullary, although both stages showed substantial migratory activity as reflected by the wide distribution across all thymic layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Since the cortex notably increases in size and cellular density throughout development due to the substantial expansion of the cortical DP population, we speculate that the apparent differences in the DN(early) localisation are a consequence of the relative reduction in the proportion of these cells in the cortex due to the overwhelming number of cortical DP thymocyte in the paediatric thymus. We found that the subsequent maturation stages followed the conventional circular migration path<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, highlighting the (sub-)capsular localisation of DN and proliferating DP(P) cells, followed by a more distributed cortical pattern in the more mature quiescent DP(Q) thymocytes that are in the process of TCR α-chain rearrangement. Cells undergoing positive selection αβT(entry) were still cortically located, but enrichment in the medulla was observed upon commitment to the CD4 or CD8 T lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, we show that by applying the CMA to spatial transcriptomics data and integrating this with a scRNA-seq reference, we are able to track the entire spatial trajectory of T lineage differentiation and demonstrate that it is already broadly established by pcw 12-18.</p><p id="P23">To elucidate possible driving forces governing this migration process, we explored cytokine/chemokine expression in our Visium data set.

We then performed hierarchical clustering of these distribution profiles, detecting six co-expressed cytokine groups in the paediatric Visium data. Cytokine spatial organisation patterns were generally conserved between fetal and paediatric thymus samples, as was the expression of the major chemokines known to direct thymocyte migration, such as the cortical chemokines <italic>CCL25</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic> that serve as ligands for <italic>CCR9</italic> and <italic>CXCR4</italic> respectively, and the medullary chemokines <italic>CCL19</italic> and <italic>CCL21</italic> that act as ligands for <italic>CCR7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Based on the keratin expression profile of mcTECs in the scRNA-seq data (<italic>KRT8</italic>- <italic>KRT5</italic>+ <italic>KRT14</italic>+ <italic>KRT15</italic>+), we were also able to further validate putative mcTEC niches in the capsule and at the CMJ of the paediatric thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, inset 1 and inset 4), whereby KRT15 expression was not seen in the capsular TECs, suggesting potential differences between the capsular and CMJ mcTEC populations. Interestingly, Visium mapping of fetal mcTECs predicted them to be strongly enriched in the capsule or subcapsular regions and not at the CMJ, which was independent of their proliferative activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To further test this prediction, we carried out single molecule FISH (RNAscope), which confirmed a clear capsular localisation of cells expressing the mcTEC markers <italic>DLK2</italic> and <italic>IGFBP6</italic> in the fetal thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Figure 10C</xref>). Finally, multiplexed RareCyte protein imaging indicated the presence of proliferating epithelial cells (MKI67+ CD45- PanCK+) in very distinctive, early fetal (pcw 12) subcapsular zones, which may further indicate the location of the putative proliferating mcTEC niche. No similar cells were detected in the paediatric capsule, but some PVS regions in CMJ and medulla were found to contain non-proliferating epithelial cells (MKI67- CD45- PanCK+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Overall, our data are consistent with a recent report identifying the PVS and subcapsular region as niches of TEC progenitor cells in the paediatric thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. In addition, we report exclusive (sub-)capsular localisation and increased proliferative activity of putative TEC progenitors, mcTECs, in the fetal thymus.

Moreover, the overarching similarities in the distribution of developing T cells and supporting stroma, myeloid, and B cells across fetal and paediatric thymus, despite considerable morphological and transcriptional differences of the tissue, further emphasised the usefulness of the CMA for comparison of different biological samples. Together, this has revealed (sub-)capsular regions as a “cell type hub” of the fetal thymus, harbouring putative TEC progenitor cells, most fibroblasts and vascular cell types as well as a range of DN and DP thymocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Specific mTEC subsets show increased association with Hassall’s Corpuscles</title><p id="P38">HCs are medullary structures formed from keratin layers composed of post-AIRE mTECIII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> that arise in mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In contrast to the CMA, which is non-linearly anchored by three reference landmarks (capsule, cortex, medulla) and describes relative localisation, the HC distance is linearly dependent on a single landmark and is hence better suited for studying proximal associations with different cell types. Taking into account the average size of the medullary regions that contain HCs, we had to limit the range of distances examined to a maximum of 350 μm to include only medullary spots and we further decreased our range to 0-150 μm to consider biologically meaningful interactions, given the close proximity between individual HCs in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P40">In our analyses, we observed that different mTECs, B cells, aDCs, mature T cells, and NK cells were distributed in proximity to the HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), but we also noted a general enrichment of these cells in medullary level III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figures 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">8I</xref>). To better resolve associations of cells with the deep medulla vs. to HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), we calculated the mean weighted CMA position vs. mean weighted HC distance for all medullary cell types, based on the deconvolved paediatric Visium data set (see Methods). Similar to our earlier observations, mTECI showed the most dispersed and superficial localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). mTECII were found deeper along the CMA and relatively close to HCs, while mTECIII were the deepest and predominantly located in close proximity to HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), as expected based on previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. In addition, the specialised TEC-ciliated, mTECI-trans and TEC-neuro were close to the HCs after accounting for medullary depth. Of all medullary TECs, TEC-myo were least associated with HCs. Other antigen presenting cell types displayed a more superficial medullary localisation and no direct association with HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We speculated that there might be a link between proximity to the HCs and the degree of specialisation of TECs with respect to their expression of peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs). To address this question, we investigated the medullary genes that were restricted in their expression to a single cell type in our paediatric scRNAseq data set, hereafter referred to as specialisation genes (SGs)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>, see <bold>Methods</bold>). Out of 851 genes with medullary expression, 138 genes were identified as SGs. mTECII, which express AIRE and consequently a broad range of PTAs, were found to express a substantial (22) but, surprisingly, not the highest number of SGs. The highest number, 77 SGs, was determined to be expressed in mTECIII, while 18 SGs were found in myo-TECs and only 21 SGs were associated with the remaining medullary cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). This highlights the canonical role of TECs as specialised antigen-presenting cells in the human thymus. Weighted spatial mapping of SGs to the CMA and HC distance revealed that mTECII and mTECIII SGs were highly enriched in the deep medulla but also close to the HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). In contrast, myo-TEC SGs were mapped to the deep medulla but did not show a specific association with HCs. Finally, SGs from the other cell types were detected in more superficial medullary regions and further from HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>).

A subset of Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC) that are known to be responsible for terminal differentiation and cornification of keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> were expressed in mTECIII and were among the SGs with highest HC association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P42">To further investigate the relationship between spatial proximity to the HC and mTECIII differentiation state, we performed an unbiased trajectory analysis using the scFates package on the combined mTECII and mTECIII subsets and only specified the root. This suggested the existence of mTECII and mTECIII transitioning states and two distinct branches in the mTECIII population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">I</xref>). One branch population that we termed mTECIII-muc which was characterised by the robust co-expression of SGs, such as <italic>CXCL17</italic> and <italic>SLPI</italic>, as well as <italic>PSCA</italic> and <italic>MUC4</italic> marking the end of the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>), which are known to be expressed by the mucosal epithelia of the gut, lung, stomach, kidney and other organs according to the single-cell evidence from the Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.

We further find evidence that within the mTECIII subset, additional differentiated subtypes expressing mucosa- (mTECIII- muc) and skin-related PTAs (mTECIII-skn) can be identified, which also show strong association with HCs.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>CITE-seq permits fine grained annotation and high-resolution spatial mapping of the T lineage</title><p id="P44">Traditionally, studies of thymic T cell development have relied on surface markers for flow cytometric or imaging-based spatial analysis. While scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into continuous cell states, quantitative differences in abundance as well as delay between transcription and cell surface expression of marker genes impede relating antibody-derived findings to RNA-based cell annotations. To overcome this issue, we performed CITE-seq, which enables paired quantification of transcripts and surface protein levels at single cell resolution. We used a 143-plex customised antibody panel to cover a broad range of cell surface markers commonly used in thymocyte research (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) and further combined this with scTCR- seq to leverage insights into the <italic>TRA</italic> and <italic>TRB</italic> locus rearrangement status in T lineage cells.

We identified a subset of quiescent DP thymocytes, which was characterised by a low frequency of <italic>TRB</italic> rearrangements and CD31 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11A-C</xref>) and thus resembles a previously described CD31<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8a<sup>+</sup> CD8β- stage, that has been associated with TCR β-selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.

In addition, uncommitted thymocytes also showed some enrichment in the upper layers of the medulla, which aligns with the mapping of ETPs to the medullary layers seen in our scRNA-seq based annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11D</xref>).</p><p id="P46">We were further able to resolve cells that had undergone positive selection (CD69<sup>hi</sup>, <italic>RAG1/2</italic><sup>lo</sup>), which was followed by a CD4<sup>hi</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> stage, during which cells have already received the signalling cues instructing their lineage fate but do not yet exhibit a clear lineage-specific transcriptional programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Both of these post-selection stages were still predicted to be localised in the cortex but already showed a shift in their spatial distribution towards the CMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11D</xref>). Following the lineage bifurcation, CD4+ and CD8+ SP thymocytes could be distinguished in their maturation progress based on commonly used markers, e.g. CD1A, CD69, CD27, CD45RO and CD45RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11B</xref>). Spatial mapping indicated a change in localisation to the thymic medulla for all subsets except immature CD8SP thymocytes, which were still mainly detected in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11D</xref>). The CITE-seq profiling was critical for the distinction of several Treg stages and subsets, such as CD103+ CD8+ Tregs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> as well as recirculating Tregs (CD39+ CD31-, “Treg_recirc”)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">12A</xref>), all of which were predicted to reside in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Figure 12B</xref>). We were further able to annotate several unconventional T cell subsets, such as CD8αα(I) and CD8αα(II) cells, as well as differentiating and recirculating yδT cells, with immature cells mapping to the cortex/CM, and mature cells found in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">12A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">12B</xref>).

Through the distinction of immature, semi-mature, and mature stages for thymocytes of the CD4 and CD8 lineage, we were able to map cells at this final stretch of thymic differentiation with increased resolution. This suggested a difference in the localisation of immature CD8 vs. immature CD4 thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Figure 11D</xref>), which prompted us to further leverage our multimodal data sets to investigate the cortico-medullary transition of thymocytes following their positive selection and lineage decision in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). For this purpose, we carried out trajectory analysis on the weighted combined RNA and protein modalities in the CITE-seq data to predict the differentiation pseudotime of CD4 and CD8 lineage cells from initiation of positive selection to full maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>, <bold>see Methods</bold>). Additionally, to obtain more continuous spatial mapping of the cells, we used high-resolution Leiden clustering to unbiasedly group cells according to their gene expression profiles. These clusters were mapped to the paediatric Visium data with cell2location to obtain mean CMA values of each cluster, which were then transferred back onto the cells comprising the different clusters (see Methods). This approach enabled us to locate cells in both space and developmental time, independent of discrete annotations, and thus explore the relationship between differentiation and migration.</p><p id="P48">For easier visual interpretation and comparison, we segmented the differentiation pseudotimes of each lineage into four matching phases based on the surface expression of CD4, CD8, and various maturation markers and beginning with the earliest stage seen upon initiation of positive selection: (1) CD4/8 inversion and increase in CD69 and CD44; (2) continuous CD8 downregulation and plateau in maturation marker expression; (3) adoption of the lineage-specific CD4/CD8 profile and increase in CD27 and CD44; and (4) strong increase in CD45RA and drop in CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). We found that cells in phase 1 that had just passed positive selection were still clearly located in the cortex. In the subsequent CD4<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>lo</sup> stage some cells had already transitioned to the thymic medulla, although the majority of cells at this lineage bifurcation stage were still located cortically, as indicated by the median CMA value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, top panel). CD4SP immature thymocytes were enriched in the medulla, as were CD4 semi-mature and CD4 mature cells, indicating that for this lineage the cortico-medullary migration predominantly occurs in early phase 3 and thus in parallel with the induction of the lineage-specific transcriptional and phenotypic programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, top right panel, purple shading). In contrast, the majority of immature CD8 cells were still predicted to remain in the cortex in early phase 3, while they underwent co-receptor reversal to establish their complete CD8+ CD4- phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">E</xref>, top left panel, blue shading). Similarly, semi-mature CD8 cells in late phase 3 were still found in the cortex in substantial numbers and only mature CD8 cells in phase 4 were finally primarily detected in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, top left panel).</p><p id="P49">To further validate this relative delay in the cortico-medullary transition of CD8 lineage cells, we sought to identify the localisation of the corresponding cells in the IBEX imaging data. To this end we used our previously applied KNN matching approach to annotate IBEX T cells and infer developmental pseudotimes using the CITE-seq data as a reference. Since a delay occurs between changes in RNA and protein expression, which can be particularly noticeable in differentiating cells that continuously change their transcriptional and phenotypic profiles, we leveraged the fact that 19 protein targets were covered by both the CITE-seq and IBEX antibody panels. This allowed us to directly compare protein expression for these markers, while the corresponding transcript levels were used for the remaining IBEX targets, yielding an RNA/protein hybrid reference data set to ensure accurate cell annotation of IBEX single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <bold>see Methods</bold>). Remarkably, this cell type inference and pseudotime imputation resulted in a predicted spatial distribution of CD4 and CD8 lineage cells that was highly similar to that previously obtained from Visium data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, middle panel). CD4<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells were predominantly found in the thymic cortex, whereas CD4 lineage cells seemed to transition to the medulla at the immature stage in early phase 3. This was determined to happen considerably later for CD8 lineage cells at the semi-mature stage in late phase 3, as predicted by the Visium-based mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, middle panel, purple shading).</p><p id="P50">Next, we aimed to explore which chemokines may be involved in this lineage-specific migration pattern. In line with previous studies demonstrating a role of CXCR4 in cortical retention and transient downregulation of the chemokine receptor (CR) after positive selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, we observed an initial drop in the RNA levels of this receptor in phase 1-2 in both lineages, followed by continuous upregulation from phase 3 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Notably, the corresponding chemokines for these two receptors, <italic>CXCL12</italic> and <italic>CCL25</italic>, were strongly expressed in the capsule and cortex but not in the medulla, which suggests contributions to localisation of DP thymocytes to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Figure 12C</xref>). <italic>CCR7</italic> (encoding CD197), which mediates responses to CCL19 and CCL21, is essential for medullary homing and negative selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. This CR was upregulated in early phase 3 for CD4 lineage cells but only in late phase 3 for the CD8 lineage, coinciding with the main medullary migration window of each lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). This delay in <italic>CCR7/</italic> CD197 expression during CD8 differentiation matches observations in a recent mouse CITE-seq study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> and points to a potential role of this receptor in the timing of the cortico-medullary transition.</p><p id="P51">Expression of <italic>CCR4</italic>/CD194 increased throughout phase 1 in CD4<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, but while cells of the CD4 lineage remained CD194-high until the end of their migration window, CD8 lineage thymocytes exhibited a swift reduction in the receptor RNA and protein levels in phase 2-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).

These observations are matched by those in a recent report on mouse thymocytes, which describes the staggered upregulation of CCR4 and CCR7, resulting in the migration of immature and mature SP thymocytes, respectively. In line with our results, the authors further showed a temporal delay in the differentiation of CD8 lineage cells after the TCR stimulus, downregulation of CCR4 upon co-receptor reversal, and delayed medullary accumulation compared to CD4 lineage thymocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P52">Finally, <italic>CXCR3</italic> (encoding CD183) was not detected in CD4 lineage cells but was upregulated in the CD8 lineage in phase 4, which could indicate a role in the late stages of medullary entry or even intra-medullary migration for this lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Alternatively, CD183 expression on mature CD8 T cells could be related to gut homing, since a population of CXCR3+ CD45RA<sup>hi</sup> CDαβ+ human thymocytes with properties of CD8αα+ gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P53">In summary, by using two highly different spatial technologies in conjunction with a multimodal single cell reference atlas we could reproducibly detect a substantial difference in the timing of thymocyte migration from cortex to medulla for the CD4 vs. CD8 lineage cells that matched differing expression profiles for the medullary homing receptors <italic>CCR4</italic>/CD194 and <italic>CCR7</italic>/CD197.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussions"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P54">Large scale efforts of international consortia like the HCA and HuBMAP have emphasised the need for constructing extensive tissue atlases to offer a basis for deeper understanding of cell and human biology.

However, harmonisation of spatial datasets remains a challenge and represents a major hurdle for multi-group consortia. Here, we offer a new integrative computational approach to spatial transcriptomics analysis and implement these novel tools to both spatial transcriptomics and multiplex protein imaging methods. Combined with newly generated multimodal single-cell data and previously published data sets, we have created a thymus spatial atlas spanning fetal and early paediatric life that was curated specifically to cover developing T cells as well as thymic hematopoietic and stromal cell subsets and states at higher resolution and diversity than previously achieved.</p><p id="P55">By conducting CITE-seq and scTCR-seq we have gathered whole transcriptome readouts, protein expression of 143 cell surface markers, and TCR rearrangement status for over 30 stages of conventional and unconventional T cell development in the human paediatric thymus. This trimodal data set can serve as a critical bridge between classic methodological approaches and recently developed methods, e.g., antibody-based applications, such as flow cytometry or immunofluorescence imaging, and nucleic acid-based approaches, like scRNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics, through imputation of the missing modality. We further integrated a large cohort of fetal and early paediatric Visium spatial transcriptomics data and RareCyte multiplex imaging with an extensive paediatric IBEX 44-plex imaging data set based on a custom TEC- and T cell-focussed antibody panel to chart both micro- and macroscopic tissue architecture and spatial cellular compositions. These data can be used to directly compare protein and RNA for cell types in their local environment as well as larger structural anatomical features. Beyond these reference datasets, we have developed an extensive computational tool set for annotation, processing, and analysis of imaging and spatial transcriptomics data (TissueTag and ImageSpot). All of these data sets and computational analysis pipelines will be made available to the broader community for further application, exploration and analysis.</p><p id="P56">The thymus is a dynamic organ, in which the majority of cells are constantly moving, while the organ itself can undergo rapid macro-morphological changes within the course of days, e.g., during infection, as well as more gradually during ageing. Changes to the relative size of various classically defined compartments within the organ as well as the migration patterns of the constituent cells make it difficult to determine the preferred spatial location of cell types and distinguish random from consistent spatial associations. Here, we establish a new spatial approach, OrganAxis, which leans on a combination of distance functions derived from tissue landmarks to generate a rotation- and scale-invariant, continuous CCF for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis (CMA). The CMA maps the relative position of a given cell or spot within the thymus and thus permits biological comparisons across distinct spatial data sets obtained from different donors, experimental approaches and institutes. Since the CMA is expression-independent and solely based on morphological landmarks, it does not require cell annotation for the analysis of transcriptional gradients and niches in spatial data. For this reason, our tool set for continuous spatial annotations can be adapted to any tissue that has consistent landmarks and applied to a broad variety of spatial technologies. We show the ability of this axis to bridge technical, sample, technique and developmental gaps while preserving biological diversity. By comparing cell/gene distributions along the CMA between IBEX and Visium data we were able to conduct highly useful cross-platform validation of our observations. At the same time, it is important to note that despite the ability of the CMA to regularise comparisons across samples that vary in size and overall cellularity, our study of the earliest stages of T cell development points to a need for additional refinement of the approach to more fully account for issues such as the relative proportion vs. absolute cell count in an anatomical region.</p><p id="P57">Because it is well established that the thymus undergoes dramatic changes over an individual’s lifetime, culminating in the onset of adipose involution around adolescence, we focussed our analyses on fetal and early paediatric periods, during which the organ is functioning at peak capacity in terms of T cell generation. We found that, despite large-scale macrostructural deviations between the fetal and paediatric thymus, the spatial maturation trajectories and major TEC distributions are established as early as pcw 12 and maintained over the first year of post-natal life. This ontologic conservation of trajectories was also seen in transcriptional patterns of key chemokine genes, whose products guide the thymocytes within and between compartments. Future studies using many of the tools we introduce here and the baseline spatial atlas emerging from our work will be essential to chart the changes during later life and the mechanisms controlling the involution process.</p><p id="P58">While the patterns of cell movement were largely preserved across age, our detailed investigation revealed an unexpected difference in the timing of cortico-medullary migration of maturing conventional CD4+ vs. CD8+ αβ T cells after positive selection. We show that the pattern of downregulation of <italic>CCR4</italic>/CD194 and upregulation of <italic>CCR7</italic>/CD197 differs as cells mature along the two opposing developmental trajectories, whereby a CD8 lineage-specific CD194-CD197- phase substantially retarded the migration of developing CD8SP thymocytes from the cortex to the medulla. These differences were seen in both Visium and IBEX data, demonstrating how multimodal data sets can be employed to derive cross-validated interpretations regarding a cell’s maturation state, its local environment, and its position in a tissue. Our findings directly align with two recent studies that suggest a slower maturation of CD8 lineage cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. Moreover, our observation that co-receptor reversal in CD8 lineage cells coincides with the cortical retention window further indicates that CD8SP thymocytes may require more time to initiate the lineage-specific differentiation programme, which in turn could impact the timing of intercompartmental cell migration. Additionally, the cortex may provide the specific microenvironment and signalling cues that CD8 lineage cells need to initiate their maturation. Finally, in accord with Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> we found that ligands for CD194 and CD197 were predominantly expressed on hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells and mTECs, respectively, which implies that the observed differences in CD194 and CD197 expression between the two T cell lineages may influence which medullary cell types attract and interact with CD4SP vs. CD8SP thymocytes.</p><p id="P59">The maturation and selection of T cells in the thymus is critically supported by TECs and the origin and location of TEC progenitors needs to be identified to understand thymus growth or to potentially leverage this information for therapeutic applications. Our data revealed the fetal capsule/subcapsular region as a niche that houses TEC progenitor proliferation, organ growth, and vascularisation. Postnatally, many of these cell types and processes seem to be shifted to the PVS and medulla, suggesting the possibility that the specialised fetal subcapsular region is remodelled to form the paediatric capsule and PVS during late stages of fetal development. However, because our data does not cover the 3rd trimester of fetal development, further studies are needed to carefully explore this concept.</p><p id="P60">Interestingly, the fetal deep cortex or “cortical layer ll/III” was distinct from that in the paediatric thymus in cTECII distribution as well as late DP cells, CD8αα(entry) and yδ T cells. In addition, fetal cTECII show the strongest expression of MHCII, which resembles perinatal cTECs in mouse that have upregulated MHCII and LY51 and were recently shown to localise in deep cortical regions and mediate positive selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Perinatal cTECs decrease with age, which may explain the disappearance of this deep cortical niche in the post-natal human thymus. In contrast to these changes between fetal and paediatric samples in terms of the cortex and more in line with our observations on thymocyte maturation, there was a conserved level of internal organisation of the thymic medulla in both the fetal and the paediatric thymus.</p><p id="P61">The medulla is the site where T cells are screened for their potential to recognise auto-antigens through numerous interactions with PTA-presenting cells and our analyses suggest that the various hematopoietic and stromal cells involved in this task show a distinct structural organisation. Several studies have noted an enrichment of various antigen-presenting cells in proximity to HCs and the latter have been implicated in the induction of tolerance. This led us to investigate whether the medullary organisation and HCs are linked. By distinguishing between medullary depth and proximity to HCs, we found that specific gene families, which are expressed by subsets of <italic>AIRE+</italic> mTECII and post-AIRE mTECIII, were highly associated with the HCs. We further found two mTECIII differentiated keratinocyte sub-lineages representing distinct body boundaries: mTECIII-skn (<italic>KLK</italic>+, <italic>KRT10</italic><sup>hi</sup>), which show similarities to terminally differentiated skin keratinocytes in line with the previously suggested role of HC cells, and mTECIII-muc (<italic>MUC4</italic>+, <italic>CXCL17</italic>+, <italic>PSCA</italic>+), which is defined by mucosa-related genes. Both specialised mTECIII subsets were found in very close proximity to HCs. This level of medullary organisation might hint at how negative selection occurs in an efficient manner capable of promoting central tolerance by rare mimetic cells and/or rarely expressed PTAs under AIRE control.</p><p id="P62">Overall, we report here a large collection of reference data for the fetal and paediatric human thymus and demonstrate that these data both reconcile prior findings while also leading to a series of novel biological insights in the areas of stromal cell organisation and T cell maturation and migration. We expect that beyond the observations we detail here, there is still much to uncover using these data sets. We have further illustrated the usefulness and applicability of the CMA and hope that this CCF can support future thymus studies by offering a common language of reference for the community, especially when discussing hard to define structures like the CMJ and subcapsular region. Finally, the computational tools and specifically OrganAxis translates well to other organ systems in 2D, 3D and even 4D (time), enabling accurate spatial modelling and CCF construction, hopefully providing valuable resources to the broad scientific community.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Data generation by institute</title><p id="P63">Metadata about single-cell RNA-seq samples can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

However, the boundaries and distributions of cells within these discrete structures are determined by orchestrated signalling events during development, differentiation, or migration, following autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signalling driven by molecular diffusion. The OrganAxis approach establishes a continuous axis that accounts for local distances within and between structures, without compromising discrete compartmentalisation. To achieve this, we derive the relative distances of each point from the boundary between structures using the following steps: We first define a spatial sampling frequency and a geometric point space by superimposing a non-overlapping hexagonal grid on each image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 4A</xref>, tissue_tag.generate_hires_grid()). Any discrete tissue annotations are then translated to hexagonal grid units, which is preferable to a pixel-based representation since resolution varies dramatically within and between data sets and would impose computational constraints, which are unnecessary given that the most informative spatial variance of the thymus typically spans ∼1 mm in scale.

Next, as much liquid as possible was removed from the sample and, if necessary, the tissue was trimmed to fit into a cryomold. The sample was placed in a cryomold (Tissue-Tek AGG4581) filled with OCT (Leica biosystems 14020108926) and positioned according to the desired orientation using thin forceps. The cryomold was then placed in isopentane that had been equilibrated to -60°C and left to fully freeze for 2 min. The sample was then rested on dry ice to allow draining of the isopentane. Finally, the cryomolds were wrapped in foil and stored at -80°C. On the day of sectioning, samples were removed 1h before sectioning and placed in the cryostat (Leica biosystems) at -18°C to equilibrate. Tissue was sectioned at 7-10 μm thickness and sections were placed on Visium slides according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and imaged at 20X magnification (hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT). Libraries were further processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slide &amp; Reagent Kit, 10x Genomics, PN-1000184)(see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for permeabilisation times).

We also developed our own fiducial image registration pipeline for increased accuracy with cellpose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellpose.org/">https://www.cellpose.org/</ext-link>) and RANSAC affine registration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-image.org/">https://scikit-image.org/</ext-link>) of reference fiducial frame (provided by 10x Genomics).

Cortex and medulla pixels were predicted with a random forest pixel classifier (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) by generating training annotations based on spots that showed the highest gene expression of <italic>AIRE</italic> (for medulla) and <italic>ARPP21</italic> (for cortex). These initial annotations were corrected with the TissueTag manual annotation tool “annotator” and the “capsule/edge” annotations were added manually based on H&amp;E. Tissue regions that showed substantial freezing or sectioning artefacts were also labelled manually. The annotation categories for “annotation_level_0” were cortex, medulla, edge and artefact, which were later used for calculations of the cortico-medullary axis. In addition, finer tissue structures such as Hassall’s Corpuscle (HC), Perivascular space (PVS), and adipocytes in paediatric samples or lymph aggregates in fetal samples were manually delineated and stored as “annotation_level_1”. Finally, we used TissueTag’s “poly_annotator” to mark individual lobules, which were saved as “annotation_lobules_0”. All annotations were saved as TissueTag output format, which logs the annotation resolution, the pixels per μm (ppm) as well as pixel value interpretation of annotation names (e.g., 1 = “Medulla”) and colours (e.g., “Medulla”: “magenta”). To robustly and efficiently migrate TissueTag annotations to the Visium objects, we first transferred TissueTag annotations from pixel space to a high-resolution hexagonal grid space (15 μm spot diameter and 15 μm point-to-point centre distance with no gap between spots) based on the median pixel value of the centre of the spot (radius/4) in the annotated image. Next, to generate continuous annotations for Visium data we measured for each spot in the hexagonal high-resolution grid the mean Euclidean distance to the 10 nearest points from each annotated structure in annotation_level_0 as well as the distance from the closest point for structures in annotation_level_1. All annotations were mapped to the Visium spots by proximity of the spot annotation grid to the nearest corresponding spot in the Visium array.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Spatial Visium mapping with cell2location</title><p id="P85">For cell2location mapping, all Visium objects (keeping fetal and paediatric separate) were concatenated into a single object as described in the cell2location tutorial.

Finally, the tube was centrifuged again at 14.000g for 10 min at 4°C and 25 μl of the supernatant was used per sample (2×10<sup>^</sup>6 cells in 200 μl).</p><p id="P124">13 TotalSeq-C antibodies (Biolegend) were titrated individually via flow cytometry using PE-conjugated versions of the same antibody clone as recommended by Biolegend. After choosing a suitable concentration for each antibody, a master mix was prepared for cell staining. For this, all antibodies were initially diluted in the Cell Staining Buffer to obtain a concentration 100-fold higher than the desired final staining concentration. 2 μl of each diluted antibody substock were then combined in a master mix, which was added to the cells for labelling in a total volume of 200 μl.

After resuspending in PBS, cells were passed through a 70 μm strainer to remove clumps. Enrichment for viable cells was achieved using a magnetic bead-based dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi, 130-090-101). For this, cells were pelleted as before, washed with 1X Binding Buffer (part of kit, prepared with sterile distilled water) and resuspended in Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads (part of kit) at a concentration of 10<sup>^</sup>7 total cells/100 μl beads. After incubation at RT for 15 min, cells were applied to an LS column (Miltenyi, 130-122-729), which was pre-rinsed with 3ml 1X Binding Buffer. The column was washed 4x with 3 ml Binding Buffer and the flow through containing viable cells was collected. Cells in the flow through were pelleted and viability was confirmed using trypan blue. 2×10<sup>^</sup>6 viable cells were used for TotalSeq-C and anti-CD3-PE antibody staining. For this purpose, cells were washed with Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, 420201), pelleted at 600 g for 10 min at 4°C, and resuspended in 90 μl Cell Staining Buffer. 10 μl Human TruStain FcX Blocking solution (Biolegend, 422301) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at 4°C. The TotalSeq-C Human Universal Cocktail 1.0 (Biolegend, 399905) was resuspended as described above, centrifuged at 14.000 g for 10 min at 4°C and 25 μl of the supernatant was added to the blocked cells. Individual TotalSeq-C antibodies were prepared as described above and 26 μl of the master mix was added to each sample. To facilitate enrichment of immature and mature thymocytes via FACS, 10 μl anti-CD3-PE (clone SK7, Biolegend, 344805) was added and samples were topped up with 40 μl Cell Staining Buffer resulting in a total staining volume of 200 μl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. To wash off unbound antibody Cell Staining Buffer was added to the samples, and cells were pelleted for 10 min at 600 g at 4°C. All supernatant was removed, cells were resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer, transferred to a new tube and pelleted as before. Cells were again resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer and pelleted and this wash step was repeated once more before cells were resuspended in 200 μl MACS buffer (PBS + 2% FCS + 2mM EDTA) in preparation for sorting. 1 μl PI was added for detection of dead cells and samples were sorted on a BD FACSAria III or BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter using a 100 μm nozzle and a maximum flow rate of 4. Cells were gated using forward/side scatter to remove doublets and debris, then dead cells were excluded based on PI staining. CD3- and CD3+ cells were collected separately in cooled IMDM + 50% FCS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). Upon completion of the sort, collection tubes were topped up with DPBS and cells were pelleted at 400 g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended at an estimated concentration of 1500 cells/μl in PBS + 0.04% BSA (Miltenyi, 130-091-376), of which 16.5 μl was used in the GEM generation step. The Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Kit v2 (10x Genomics, 1000265) and the manufacturer’s protocol CG000330 Rev A were used to prepare the reaction master mix, and load cells, gel beads and partitioning oil on a Chip K (10x Genomics, 1000286). GEMs were generated using a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics), transferred to a tube strip and the reverse transcription was carried out in a BioRad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler according to the protocol.

For the retained high-quality cells, ADT data was then denoised using dsb v1.0.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. For this purpose, empty droplets were identified in the unfiltered mapping output and used as reference for estimation of noise and antibody background levels. Approximately 1.4 million droplets were selected based on RNA count &lt; 240 reads, ADT count between 120 and 240 reads, and &lt; 5% mitochondrial reads to ensure that damaged cells were not included in the subset. During denoising and normalisation with “DSBNormalizeProtein”, ADT data from droplets was used for background correction and the 7 isotype control antibodies included in the TotalSeq-C Human Universal Cocktail were used to determine technical variation. Data was scaled based on the background by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation of the empty droplets.

MNN correction was applied to the PCA loadings matrix via the “reducedMNN” function from the Batchelor package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup> to reduce batch effects between samples. To integrate both modalities, multimodal neighbours and modality weights were identified and a weighted neared neighbours (WNN) graph <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup> was constructed using “FindMultimodalNeighbors” based on the PCA. The number of PCs to be used was determined based on the difference in variation of consecutive PCs being higher than 0.1%. A UMAP visualisation was generated based on the WNN graph to represent the weighted combination of both modalities. In addition, a supervised PCA (sPCA) was carried out on transcriptome data using the “RunSPCA” function of the Seurat package, to obtain a dimensionality reduction for the RNA modality that represents the structure of the WNN graph<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P129">To identify cell types and developmental stages we performed Leiden clustering at a low resolution based on the sPCA using the Seurat functions “FindNeighbors” and “FindClusters”. The obtained clusters were then subsetted and analysed individually starting with the most immature cluster, which was identified based on high expression of the marker CD34. For each subset, normalisation and scaling for RNA and ADT data was repeated as described above and a new WNN UMAP and sPCA were constructed. A combination of Leiden clustering on the sPCA and thresholding of protein levels was used to identify cell types. In addition, to identify proliferating cells, cell cycle scoring was carried out using the G2M and S phase markers supplied in the Seurat package. The “FindMarkers” function (Seurat) and the package singleCellHaystack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref></sup> were used to identify differentially expressed genes and surface markers in a cluster-based and cluster-independent manner, respectively.

Cell2location deconvolutes spots by unique expression profiles from a single-cell reference, based on discrete cell annotations. Here, In order to investigate the continuous spatio-temporal nature of CD4/CD8 cell lineages at increased resolution we performed high-resolution Leiden clustering on the CITE-seq data via scanpy.tl.leiden(gex,resolution=35,key_added=’hyper_leiden’), resulting in 624 cell clusters. These cell clusters were then mapped to Visium data with cell2location as described above and further detailed here To measure the position of each cell cluster across the CMA, we selected Visium spots with the highest cluster label abundance (above percentile 95%) and calculated the weighted mean CMA values for these spots. This values was then assigned this to the cells comprising the associated cluster in the single cell AnnData object.
