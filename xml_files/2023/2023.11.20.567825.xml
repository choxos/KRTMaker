These tissues, also called organoids, can be derived from pluripotent stem cells or tissue-resident fetal and adult stem cells. However, it has remained difficult to understand the precision and accuracy of organoid cell states through comparison with primary counterparts, and to comprehensively assess the similarity and differences between organoid protocols. Advances in computational single-cell biology now allow the integration of datasets with high technical variability. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptomes from 218 samples covering organoids of diverse endoderm-derived tissues including lung, pancreas, intestine, liver, biliary system, stomach, and prostate to establish an initial version of a human endoderm organoid cell atlas (HEOCA). The integration includes nearly one million cells across diverse conditions, data sources and protocols. We align and compare cell types and states between organoid models, and harmonize cell type annotations by mapping the atlas to primary tissue counterparts. To demonstrate utility of the atlas, we focus on intestine and lung, and clarify ontogenic cell states that can be modeled <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further provide examples of mapping novel data from new organoid protocols to expand the atlas, and showcase how integrating organoid models of disease into the HEOCA identifies altered cell proportions and states between healthy and disease conditions. The atlas makes diverse datasets centrally available, and will be valuable to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states, and streamline protocol development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Human cell atlas</kwd><kwd>Single-cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Organoid</kwd><kwd>Endoderm</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">It is a major goal to model complex aspects of human tissues in controlled conditions. Such in vitro human model systems can be used as inroads into human-specific biology and disease, as well as accurate alternatives to animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Loewa et al., 2023</xref>). Organoids are 3D cell cultures derived from pluripotent, fetal, or adult stem cells (PSCs, FSCs, ASCs) that recapitulate important aspects of cell composition, cytoarchitecture, and functional properties of the tissue counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Organoid protocol development and engineering methodologies are rapidly emerging, such that there is strong variation in culture conditions and stem cell origin. It remains challenging to assess how well the complexity of cell states and interactions that occur in vitro reflect counterparts in vivo. The rapidity of organoid protocol development makes it difficult to compare between studies and protocols, hampering the assessment of correlation between previously generated and newly presented organoid datasets. An additional challenge is that datasets are not centrally compiled and protocols are not consistently reported, which makes it difficult to assess the similarity of different organoids to primary tissue, identify off-target or missing cell types, and predict genetic drivers that guide cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Camp et al., 2018</xref>). Overcoming these obstacles would lead to new insight into basic human biology, as well as new opportunities for therapy development and rigor in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bock et al., 2020</xref>). Advances in technology have led to the growth of single-cell transcriptome datasets, both in terms of dataset size and quantity. This has prompted collaborations to create extensive reference atlases for adult and developing human organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bock et al., 2020</xref>; Tabula Sapiens Consortium* et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jain et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Han et al., 2020</xref>). Organoids offer the opportunity to deepen our understanding of health and disease, by providing avatars of diverse developmental stages, genetic variation, and disease states that will complement primary tissue atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bock et al., 2020</xref>). However, the scale of generating a comprehensive organoid atlas within individual research groups is currently impractical. Therefore, the integration of datasets generated by the wider research community becomes crucial.</p><p id="P5">The endoderm represents the innermost of the three primary embryonic germ layers formed during gastrulation. It contributes to the development of the epithelial lining of a variety of different organs including thyroid, esophagus, lung, pancreas, liver, biliary system, stomach, small intestine and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>). Complex endodermal three-dimensional (3D) organoids from epithelial ASCs were first established after the discovery of tissue-resident intestinal stem cells (ISCs) marked by the expression of Lgr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Barker et al., 2007</xref>). In vivo, these stem cells reside in the intestinal crypt niche and underlie the renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Lgr5+ ASCs can be isolated and propagated in vitro in a 3D matrix to form organoids where media composition such as growth factors can promote stem cell proliferation and differentiation into intestinal epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>). Tissue-resident ASCs have been discovered in a variety of endoderm-derived adult epithelial tissues, and protocols with specific combinations and concentrations of growth factors have been developed to propagate and differentiate ASCs into diverse cell types of corresponding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Protocols have also been developed to cultivate FSCs from developing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sprangers et al., 2021</xref>) or to differentiate PSCs into various endodermal tissue types, enabling exploration of human ontogenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">McCauley and Wells, 2017</xref>). In order to calibrate organoid fidelity, it is necessary to have a relative comparison of the cell state landscapes across the diversity of organoid protocols and sources.</p><p id="P6">Here, we present an integrated single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human endoderm-derived organoids encompassing nine different tissues, combining data from 55 publications and 218 individual single-cell sequencing experiments (datasets), comprising a total of 806,646 cells from ASC, FSC, iPSC, and ESC-derived organoids. After benchmarking multiple integration approaches, we integrated the datasets using a label-aware deep representation learning approach, and then performed re-annotation to establish a consensus cell type reference, enhancing our understanding of the endoderm-derived organoid systems and their relevance for disease modeling. Using intestine and lung organoids as examples, we compared cell states from diverse stem cell origins, uncovering insights into the functional relevance of these organoid systems. We applied the atlas to integrate and assess multiple new organoid protocols (129,254 cells from 2 tissues, 5 datasets, and 31 samples), validating the atlas as a valuable resource for analyzing future organoid data and expanding our knowledge of organoid development. We use the atlas to map data from organoid models of disease, which facilitated rapid assessment and comparison of control and diseased samples. Overall, our study provides a roadmap for constructing and utilizing organ and organoid cell atlases to explore human-specific biology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Data integration constructs the organoid atlas for endoderm-derived organs</title><p id="P7">To create an endoderm-derived organoid cell atlas, we assembled single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from 55 datasets, including 1 newly generated dataset containing 45,281 cells collected from 11 separate samples (small and large intestine, stomach and liver organoids) and 54 published datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, Extended Data Table 1). These datasets encompass samples from 218 experiments conducted on organoid models of nine different organs (lung, liver, biliary system, stomach, pancreas, small and large intestine, prostate, salivary glands) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Data were obtained using multiple scRNA-seq protocols, including plate-based methods such as Smart-seq, CEL-seq, and Sort-seq, as well as commercialized droplet-based methods (e.g. 10X Genomics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Based on availability, we incorporated organoid datasets that model healthy states primarily of human endoderm-derived tissues, with source material from ESCs, iPSCs, FSCs, or ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Notably, we obtained data of each stem cell source from intestine, lung, liver, and biliary system organoid models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b and d</xref>). In total, we collected 806,646 cells to be utilized for downstream integration and analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-d</xref>). This extensive cell collection will serve as a valuable resource, providing opportunities to explore diverse technical and biological phenomena and extract meaningful insights through comparisons across datasets.</p><p id="P8">Consensus cell type definitions from scRNA-seq data across studies are currently insufficient, particularly for different organoid developmental states. To define organoid cell types, we employed an annotation method that first clusters cells in each dataset at a high resolution and assigns cluster annotations based on known marker gene expression and differential expression compared to other clusters (Extended Data Table 2). To assist with label-aware integration, we established a three-level hierarchical cell type annotation (level 1 = class, level 2 = type, level 3 = subtype) (Extended Data Fig. 1). To effectively address batch effects and achieve a robust integration of the atlas, we assessed nine different data integration methods using single-cell integration benchmarking on ten randomly chosen samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Polański et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lopez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Büttner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">De Donno et al., 2023</xref>) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Aggregate scores based on batch correction and conservation of biological structure suggested that the label-aware integration method scPoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Deprez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Luecken et al., 2022</xref>) achieved the most successful integration (Extended Data Fig. 1a-b). Utilizing scPoli, we generated an integrated embedding that encompassed all organoid cells, enabling a cohesive representation of the diverse data. This integration overcame batch effects (batch correction = 0.43 and biology conservation = 0.98) and generated a unified view of the HEOCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 1b). We re-annotated high-resolution clusters of the integrated atlas based on the most frequently occurring cell type per cluster resulting in 5 cell classes at level 1, 48 cell types at level 2, and 51 cell subtypes at level 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 1c-d).</p><p id="P9">Overall, we observed that epithelial cells from different organs clustered together within the integrated atlas, and that many clusters were composed of cells from different stem cell sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e and i</xref>). This observation suggests different cell types in the same organ model from different protocols share more similarity compared to cell types from different types of organoids. However, we also identified certain cell types with contribution from multiple organoid models. For example, goblet cells were found in both intestine (67.05%) and lung (32.95%), with a minor presence in other organs (0.01%). Similarly, basal cells were observed in the lung (76.59%), salivary gland (12.52%), intestine (9.11%), and thyroid (1.25%) models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). These results suggest the existence of cell types that exhibit partial or shared characteristics across different organ models within the atlas, and also may indicate off-target cells within organoids. We identified markers for each integrated cell type, which could be used to distinguish cell types across the diverse datasets and protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>, Extended Data Table 3). For example, OLFM4 and TP63 marked stem cells and basal cells, respectively, across organoid models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). We note that there are cases that were difficult to explain, where cells derived from organoid models of a certain organ clustered with cells annotated as from a different organ. Given the difficulty in precisely controlling organoid development, especially PSC-derived organoids, it is known that there can be off-target cells in organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, basal cells are not observed in adult human intestinal tissues. However, our analysis revealed that approximately 9% of basal cells within HEOCA originate from intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). This observation suggests that organoids can contain cell types that are not the desired target for a specific organoid protocol (off-target cells) - alternatively, there could also be instances where organoids derived from primary FSCs or ASCs are contaminated due to handling or to adjacency of tissues during the tissue acquisition, or cell states could be different from the tissue of origin due to stem cell plasticity. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies to compare organoid cells to reference counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reference atlas comparison to assess organoid fidelity</title><p id="P10">To evaluate cell states observed in the HEOCA, we obtained published scRNA-seq data on human endoderm-derived organs from adult (small and large intestine, lung, liver, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tabula Sapiens Consortium* et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>) and fetal (small and large intestine, lung, liver, pancreas, stomach) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cao et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>) specimens. In adult and fetal datasets, we identified major cell types from each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>), and then compared organoid cell types and states to these primary tissue references using neighborhood graph correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ton et al., 2023</xref>). This analysis revealed a spectrum of maximum correlation values to neighborhoods found in the adult and fetal datasets, with a general higher similarity to adult tissue cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 2). We quantified the proportion of cell types in each organoid sample and compared the similarity of each cell type to counterparts in the adult and fetal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f-h</xref>) and found that ASC-derived and PSC-derived organoids had the highest similarity to adult and fetal counterparts, respectively, with FSC-derived organoid cell states having an intermediate distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To assess off-target cells within organoids, we projected organoid cells to the fetal and adult primary tissue atlases, and calculated the majority tissue type of the 100 nearest primary tissue neighbors, normalized by total number of cells of a given tissue type. Our analysis revealed that PSC-derived organoids have a lower on-target percentage in both fetal and adult primary tissues compared with FSC- and ASC-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-h, and j</xref>). For more specific downstream analyses, we focused on intestine and lung organoids, where there are multiple datasets from different stem cell sources. FSC and ASC-derived intestine organoids demonstrated high on-target percentages, with an average of 80% in FSC-derived organoids and 99% in ASC-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). In contrast, PSC-derived organoids displayed median on-target percentage of between 25% and 50% depending on fetal or adult reference atlas comparison, however this is likely a low estimate as datasets from early organoid time points are difficult to assess using this reference comparison metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). In the lung organoids, we observed a median on-target percentage of 75% in ASC-derived organoids. In contrast, PSC and FSC-derived organoids exhibited lower on-target percentages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). Notably, the on-target percentage of intestine organoids in relation to fetal primary tissue closely mirrored that of adult tissue, with percentages of 55%, 80%, and 99% in PSC, FSC, and ASC-derived organoids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>). Focusing on colonic epithelial cell types, ASC-derived organoids exhibited a higher similarity with adult colonocytes, while PSC-derived intestine organoids showed a higher similarity with fetal intestinal epithelial cells, and we note that there is variation in maturation levels between protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m-n</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Integrated intestinal organoid atlas reveals developing and adult physiology</title><p id="P12">To explore organoid cell states of different stem cell origin, we focused on intestinal organoid models, where there is substantial coverage from PSC, FSC, and ASC-derived organoid cells. This subset consisted of 98 samples from 23 different publications representing 353,140 single cell transcriptomes of duodenum, ileum, and colon tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3a, Extended Data Table 1). We re-integrated all cells and defined five cell types at level 1, 26 cell types at level 2, and 32 cell types at level 3 within the atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3b-c). This integrated intestinal organoid atlas (HIOCA) covers epithelial states from the duodenum, ileum, and colon and PSC-derived organoids additionally contain a large fraction of mesenchymal cells, and minor populations of neural, endothelial, and immune cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). The integrated atlas provides opportunities to explore differentiation trajectories across protocols, and could be used to identify variant and invariant gene expression profiles. (Extended Data Fig. 3d-f).</p><p id="P13">In order to build a reference to assess intestinal organoid fidelity and maturation we next integrated time series scRNA-seq data of duodenal development (ten time points ranging from 59 days to 132 days after fertilization) with adult intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Elmentaite et al., 2021</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The integrated reference atlas revealed distinct fetal and adult stem cell to enterocyte differentiation trajectories, while demonstrating similar cell states between fetal and adult in other epithelial cell types, such as goblet cells, tuft cells, M cells, and enteroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f-g</xref>). To validate the reliability of this integration, we downloaded an additional 18 fetal and 5 adult samples from two publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Elmentaite et al., 2021</xref>) and mapped cells to the primary embedding (Extended Data Fig. 3g-j). The mapping indicated that an average of 95% of fetal stem cells and enterocytes aligned with the fetal trajectory, while an average of 98% of adult stem cells and enterocytes aligned with the adult trajectory (Extended Data Fig. 3g-j). This analysis confirms that the integration of primary adult and fetal intestine tissue scRNA-seq data can discern fetal and adult cell states, providing a resource for investigating organoid maturity. We used scPoli to query small intestine organoid epithelial cells to the primary reference data and observed distinct similarity patterns among different stem cell sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Specifically, PSC-derived organoids exhibited a higher proportion of cells resembling fetal primary tissue, while FSC-derived and ASC-derived organoids displayed a high similarity to adult primary tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). This finding supports previous observations that FSC-derived intestinal organoids may undergo a transition in their identity and lose fetal characteristics upon extended culture in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Edgar et al., 2022</xref>). We provide information on the proportion of cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), adult projection probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>), fetal or adult projection proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>), and similarity to each adult and fetal cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3k) for each PSC, FSC, and ASC-derived organoid sample. Collectively, these metrics show substantial variation between intestinal organoid samples. For example, PSC-derived organoids increase in complexity and reference similarity over time in culture, and after xenografting into a mouse host for maturation, the organoids obtain higher cellular diversity and similarity to primary tissue differentiated enterocytes. In addition, in these datasets FSC-derived organoids presented less cell type diversity than ASC-derived organoids, and there was variation in diversity and similarity between datasets from the same stem cell source type. These findings reveal the diversity of cell composition and cell maturation within organoids from different sources, time points, and protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lung organoid data uncovers differences between organoids of varying stem cell origins and shows specific correlation to primary tissue</title><p id="P14">To complement our analysis of intestinal cell states, we created and analyzed a singular integrated object of lung organoid cells, representing the second most abundant tissue type in the HEOCA. This subset atlas consisted of 225,490 cells obtained from 52 samples and 13 different publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For this, we employed an approach similar to our intestinal organoid analysis, involving integration, re-clustering, and re-annotation of these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The integrated human lung organoid cell atlas (HLOCA) encompasses cell types and states derived from PSCs, FSCs, and ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Predominantly composed of epithelial cells, the lung organoid samples are further divided into 9 distinct cell types through higher-resolution clustering (Extended Data Fig. 4i). The UMAP representation showed expected integration of the diverse publications and samples into a shared embedding (Ext. Data Figure 4a-b) with undifferentiated stem cells positioned centrally surrounded by more differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) exhibiting cluster-specific expression of canonical markers of lung epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Cell type composition analysis per organoid revealed cell type variation depending on the stem cell of origin, reflecting the diversity of culture and isolation protocols among the datasets in the atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Organoids derived from PSCs displayed a higher proportion of lowly-differentiated LGR5-, OLFM4- and ASCL2-defined stem cells, which were largely absent in the ASC-derived organoids. In turn, organoids obtained via ASC-protocols frequently contained a relevant proportion of club cells, whereas a high incidence of goblet and neuroendocrine cells was primarily observed in samples produced using FSC-protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Overall, inter-publication and inter-sample differences in cell type composition suggest effects from protocol, media, and growth factors. We provide a detailed structured account of the publicly available information on the organoid datasets included in the atlas and have initiated a resource containing accumulated published data on protocol components and intervals, which can be linked to the shared HLOCA object.</p><p id="P15">Next, through trajectory analysis by diffusion pseudo-time, we simulated developmental pathways from central stem cells towards predicted peripheral terminal cell states (Extended Data Fig. 5d-e). Within these trajectories, we identifed putative driver genes associated with selected terminal states for each cell type and charted their expression patterns across pseudotime (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Notably, the late-pseudotime expression peaks of this analysis aligned well with known canonical markers of terminal cell states, such as SFTPB and LPCAT1 in AT2s, LYZ in goblet cells, KRT15 in basal cells and LCN2 in club cells. Additional genes that were uncovered by this analysis, such as INSM1 and RAB26 in neuroendocrine cells, warrant further investigation into their roles in development. We conducted analogous analyses for the intestinal cells of the HIOCA and found several highly cell fate correlated genes previously reported to have an association with the developmental trajectory of the respective cell type (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). This included, among others, genes coding for fatty acid and triglyceride binding proteins such as FAB1, FAB2 and RBP2 in enterocytes. For intestinal goblet cells, canonical markers like MUC2, SPINK4, CLCA1, and FCGBP were observed. In enteroendocrine cells, secretogranins (SCG2, SCG3) and transcription factors (NEUROD1, FEV) were present. Specific markers such as advillin were detected in Tuft cells (AVIL) and the ETS transcription factor SPIB was found in microfold cells.</p><p id="P16">To gain insights into how the assembled lung datasets correspond with primary tissue, we integrated a unified reference of primary adult and fetal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Deprez et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 4d). The query to reference mapping of our lung organoid data led to preferential integration of the PSC-derived and most of the FSC-derived organoids into the fetal portion of the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, 4h</xref>). In turn, with the caveat of mapping uncertainty and distance to the reference being relatively high in some of the included samples (Extended Data Fig. 4g-h), a relevant proportion of the ASC-derived organoid cells showed an additional similarity to the adult cells present in the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, 4h</xref>). We evaluated the correlation of differential neighborhoods derived from Milo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dann et al., 2022</xref>) between HEOCA lung organoids and the adult and fetal reference (Extended Data Fig. 4e-f). Projecting the difference in correlation between PSC- and ASC- and between FSC- and ASC-derived organoids on the neighborhood representation confirmed that ASC-derived organoids had the highest similarity to adult tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). Conversely, PSC-derived and FSC-derived cells had a higher similarity to fetal cells, with PSC-derived cells possessing a slightly higher correlation to many regions of the combined reference embedding. To quantify these observations, we generated ranked ridgeline plots depicting cell type and organoid type specific correlations within the HEOCA lung subset in relation to adult and fetal reference neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>) as well as correlations resolved by primary cell type and organoid type (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Our analysis indicated that, with the exception of ciliated and airway secretory cells, either ASC- or PSC-derived organoids tended to resemble the primary reference cells more closely than FSC-derived ones across most lung organoid cell types, in relation to both adult and fetal tissue. While, in relation to adult tissue, club cells demonstrated the highest average correlation across all organoids, the peak of correlation was formed by a portion of the ASC- and FSC-derived ciliated cells. In examining the best-represented primary tissue cell types, our results reaffirmed the higher resemblance of fetal primary tissue cell types to PSC- and FSC- and of adult primary tissue cell types to ASC-derived organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4c). The highest scoring primary cell type, when compared against the different organoid types, were adult ciliated and different secretory cells for ASC-derived organoids, fetal ciliated and secretory cells for FSC-derived organoids and mid tip, mid stalk and early tip cells for PSC-derived organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4c).</p><p id="P17">Lastly, differential abundance analysis of the annotated cell types between the organoids detailed that PSC-derived organoid samples lack club, basal and AT2 cells compared to those derived from ASC protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>). While neuroendocrine and goblet cells were particularly found in FSC-derived organoid samples, the rest of the cell types were missing in samples derived from this stem cell compared to those from ASC protocols. Yet, FSC-derived organoid samples were found to have more AT2, club and basal cell states compared to PSC-derived samples, which are predominantly missing in samples generated by PSC differentiation protocols. In summary, these results and analyses offer a comprehensive integrated atlas for lung organoids (HLOCA) serving as a complement to the HEOCA for the study of lung 3D-cultures at a single tissue level. Moreover, by further downstream analysis of the gathered data, we identify differences in cell type composition and abundance, trajectories and associated genes, explore resemblances to fetal and adult primary tissue and provide novel information about the current representation of primary tissue cell types in lung organoids derived from various stem cell sources.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Assessment of new protocols and extension of the organoid cell atlas with new datasets</title><p id="P18">New organoid protocols are emerging frequently and the HEOCA offers a unique opportunity to assess these organoids via single-cell transcriptomics. To incorporate new datasets into the organoid atlas, we developed an integration model based on scPoli that provides a harmonized annotation and toolkit for downstream analysis and exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To examine the performance of our model, we accessed an unpublished dataset from a scRNA-seq (10X Genomics) time course of colon organoid development (days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10), where organoids were grown in a new media combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) Oost et al. in revision. Cells were projected onto the HEOCA, and annotated based on label transfer of the nearest organoid neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Analysis of predicted cell type proportions revealed a decrease in the proportion of stem cells from day 3 (99.69%) to day 10 (62.39%) concomitant with an increase in differentiated goblet cells (0.26% to 3.44%), enteroendocrine cells (0.04% to 7.43%), and colono-cytes (0.02% to 33.41%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). It is noteworthy that the day 1 sample was in a recovery, regenerative stage after organoid passaging, and exhibited a higher proportion of mature cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Comparison of each cell to the adult and fetal reference atlas confirmed a temporal increase in adult cell type similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e-f</xref>), and integration analysis indicated near perfect cell type prediction as intestine-derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We incorporated five additional datasets (three published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Frum et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Conchola et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mitrofanova et al., 2023</xref>) and one unpublished), encompassing two additional colon ASC-derived organoid (colon 2 and colon 3) and two lung ASC-derived organoid protocols (lung 1 and lung 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 6). In the colon 2 dataset, we examined colon organoids derived from three healthy individuals cultured with or without IL-22 for three days before analysis Maciag et al. in revision. HEOCA comparison revealed that control samples exhibited a higher proportion of mature colonocytes (5.72%) compared to the IL-22 treated samples (1.53%) suggesting that the presence of IL-22 affects colonocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h-i</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). In the colon 3 dataset, colonic epithelial tissue was generated through seeding human colon ASC-derived organoids on a scaffolded hydrogel within a fluidic chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mitrofanova et al., 2023</xref>). This dataset also provides two control samples culturing organoids in either matrigel or matrigel supplemented with 20% collagen. The integration analysis demonstrated that this new protocol led to the maturation of colonocytes, as indicated by a significantly higher proportion of colonocytes compared to the control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h-i</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 6d-f). Specifically, the day 4 control samples displayed a 30.32% proportion of colonocytes, compared with 48.20% and 66.14% at day 14 and 21, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6d).</p><p id="P20">Interestingly, this on-chip protocol has an advantage to conventional organoid protocols as it provides access to the apical and basal side of the epithelium and can be kept for many weeks in culture while maintaining stem and differentiated cell types.</p><p id="P21">Lung 1 and lung 2 datasets consisted of time courses of lung progenitor organoids differentiated to alveolar or airway organoids. The results demonstrated that an average of 99.27% and 95.56% of cells from these datasets were successfully integrated into the existing lung data within the atlas (Extended Data Fig. 6g-n). In the alveolar dataset, cells showed increased mapping to alveolar epithelial (AT1/AT2) identities over the course of differentiation. This was accompanied by a loss of cells mapping to undifferentiated identities in the reference, demonstrating that the reference atlas accurately assigned cells to alveolar epithelial identities and resolved the distinction between uncommitted progenitors and differentiating cells in the organoids. Likewise, lung progenitor organoids differentiated towards airway were accurately mapped to cell identities specific to the airways including SCGB3A2+ airway progenitors, basal and secretory cells, consistent with prior descriptions of these organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Conchola et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Miller et al., 2020</xref>) and were minimally mapped to alveolar epithelial identities (Extended Data Fig. 6g-n). Altogether, these results highlight the utility of the HEOCA for integrating new data and assessing the effects of different experimental conditions or culture protocols on the maturation and cell type composition across diverse organoids.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mapping organoid disease models to the HEOCA illuminates disease-associated states</title><p id="P22">We next wanted to assess the utility of the integrated atlas to understand organoid models of disease. Through comparison to the HEOCA we assess cell proportion, identify disease-associated states, and perform differential expression analysis against the atlas data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). As a proof of principle, we first explored colorectal cancer (CRC) using a dataset composed of CRC organoids from a patient resection and normal organoids from adjacent healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). After mapping to the HEOCA via scPoli, cell proportion analysis showed that CRC samples exhibited a significantly lower percentage of mature colonocytes, but a higher proportion of stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7a-b). Interestingly, we also observed the emergence of mesothelial cells in the CRC samples, consistent with the published findings that CRC can lead to an increase in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We next calculated the mean distance of the top 100 nearest neighbors of each adjacent normal and cancer cell to the integrated atlas, and discovered that this distance metric could distinguish between normal and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7c). Stem cells and colonocytes exhibited more pronounced deviation from atlas states, whereas goblet cells displayed fewer differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). We subsetted and integrated colonocytes from both adjacent normal organoid and cancer organoid samples, and discerned two distinct colonocyte groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). The first group comprised a mixture of normal and cancer organoid cells, while the second consisted exclusively of a subset of cancer organoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-f</xref>), which possessed a significantly larger distance to the HEOCA relative to the mixed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g-h</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis revealed heightened expression levels of CRC markers such as CEACAM6, MMP7, TGFBI and RSPO3 in the cancer cell group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7d). Notably, recurrent R-spondin (RSPO) gene fusions have been described in certain CRC patients and this event potentiates Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Seshagiri et al., 2012</xref>). These analyses show the utility of distance measures to the HEOCA as a strategy to elucidate cell states that deviate healthy or otherwise normal states.</p><p id="P23">In a second assessment, we used a publicly available dataset of two different organoid types generated from cells of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>). These were derived from nasopharyngeal and bronchial stem cells of these patients respectively. Intriguingly, both samples mapped to lung populations within the HEOCA, however there were substantial differences in the bronchial and nasopharyngeal mappings between normal and COPD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j</xref>). Nasopharyngeal COPD organoids exhibited cell type composition similar to the healthy samples in the atlas, however bronchial organoids had a much larger proportion of annotated club cells and much fewer basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j-k</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7e-f). As was observed with the CRC organoids, distance to HEOCA states served as a strong metric to distinguish between normal and disease conditions, with a strong effect in the COPD-derived bronchial organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6l</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7g). These results matched with the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>), which showed similar differences in cell type composition and reported differences in resistance to viral infection between the bronchial and nasopharyngeal COPD organoids. Based on atlas similarity, we observed that the nasopharyngeal normal and COPD samples showed relatively minor differences across all cell types, whereas basal cells in the bronchial COPD samples displayed a bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6m</xref>). Distance to HEOCA states identified one basal cell population indicative of a disease state, which was further clarified in a heterogeneity analysis of basal cells from healthy and bronchial organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6n-p</xref>). Differential expression analysis revealed decreased TP63 expression, and high expression of genes known to be upregulated in COPD such as BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6q</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7h). Together these data show that the HEOCA can be used to place cell states observed in organoid disease models into a larger context, which helps to better understand holistic effects on cell composition and gene expression patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Single-cell transcriptome sequencing technologies have advanced organoid research by offering a powerful set of experimental and computational tools to investigate cell types present in these complex 3D models. Despite the immense progress, it remains a challenge to understand and quantify organoid fidelity and to place variation between organoid datasets into a larger context of human physiology. To begin to address these challenges, we have built the first integrated cell atlas of organoids that model endoderm-derived tissues, incorporating organoid datasets that have been generated from multiple different types of stem cells and protocols. We have established a framework for integration and harmonized cell type annotation, which makes interpreting cell heterogeneity between organoid datasets tractable. Single-cell transcriptome data from diverse experimental designs can introduce strong technical noise due to batch effects, protocol variation, genomic method, and other technical biases, making data integration challenging. To overcome this, we evaluated ten existing integration methods and identified an approach with excellent performance. This integration method, scPoli, is structured to incorporate newly generated data, enabling rapid comparison of novel datasets across the nearly 1 million organoid cells in the current atlas. Consolidation and integration of such a diversity of organoid cell states provides new inroads into quantifying fidelity. Indeed, we find that there is significant variation in organoid cell composition, prevalence of off-target cells, and overall cell state similarity. This variation, and comparison to available reference atlases, revealed that current organoid technologies cover a large diversity of human cell types and states. This result clarifies the use of human organoid technologies to explore development, model disease, and identify therapeutics.</p><p id="P25">Through cross-organ, multi-organoid integration, it was possible to identify off-target cells, a particular problem in PSC-derived organoids due to incomplete specification, as well as to distinguish cell states that significantly differed from states present in the atlas. This ability to distinguish non-present states is helpful to assess new protocols, as well as to identify features of disease models that are non-variable in normal, healthy organoids. Indeed, the integrated HEOCA presents a first opportunity to place a new endodermal organoid dataset into a relationship with the accumulated other datasets generated to date. There is still a major challenge with organoid fidelity quantification, as there is not yet a complete and integrated atlas of human cell type diversity during development and adulthood from primary tissues. Comprehensive integrated reference atlases across the human lifespan, in health and disease, together with diverse organoid models in normal and perturbed conditions, will help to clarify the full potential of the human genome. Altogether, the HEOCA will serve as a valuable resource for the organoid research community and a foundation to expand the ability to model human biology.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Generation and culture of PSC-derived human intestinal organoids</title><p id="P26">All PSC lines were cultured with mTESR/mTESR-plus (STEMCELL Technologies 85850/ 100-0276) media on Matrigel (Corning, 354277) coated plates.

Mix 2 was added to the tube, and every 10 minutes for another 20-30 minutes, the mix was agitated with a P1000 pipette tip. The cells were then filtered through a 70 μm strainer and washed three times at 400g for 5 minutes with 1% BSA in HBSS. Cell counting was performed using Countess and the process was immediately continued with 10x Chromium for single-cell droplet generation. The libraries were prepared using the NextGEM Single Cell 3’ v3.1 kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina’s Novaseq6000 system.

Next, DMEM+++ is added until a total volume of 7 ml is reached before centrifuging the tube at 400 rcf for 4 min at 4°C. Supernatant is discarded and organoids are resuspended into 2 ml of prewarmed 0.05% Trypsin + EDTA (gibco, 25300-054) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Trypsinization is stopped using 2 ml of a trypsin-inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17075029) as well as 3 ml of DMEM+++ after reaching a single-cell suspension. Singularized organoids are then centrifuged at 600 rcf for 5 min at 4°C and supernatant is discarded subsequently. Next, the cell pellet is resuspended into START medium and then filtered through a 40 μm filter to remove large debris and cell clumps. Optional: FAC-sorting for single cells to remove remaining smaller debris as well as doublets. Cells are then counted before being further processed. Finally, the cell-suspension is diluted to 25-50 cells/μL into a 60% Matrigel : 40% START medium mixture (we have tested dilutions with a Matrigel proportion of 50 to 70%). Here, lower seeding densities between 25 and 50 cells per μL are recommended as very dense plating affects the morphology and growth of organoids negatively – this needs to be optimized for every line.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the normalized data, and the top 30 principal components were chosen for calculating the K Nearest Neighbors (KNNs). Using the KNNs, a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was generated to visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space. To cluster the data, the Leiden clustering method with a resolution of 2 was applied. This clustering approach helped to identify distinct groups of cells based on their gene expression patterns. Previously defined marker genes associated with specific cell types were used to guide the annotation process. To annotate cell types within each cluster, the snapseed method was employed. This method calculates the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and fold change values for each marker gene in relation to the cluster. If multiple markers were available for a particular cell type, the maximum AUC and fold change values were selected. The average AUC and fold change values were used to represent the specific cell type, and the most specific cell type was annotated for each cluster based on these criteria.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Data integration benchmarking</title><p id="P42">To benchmark and compare different integration methods, 10 random samples were selected from the dataset.

We computed the transcriptional similarity graph for the primary tissue reference using 30 nearest neighbors and the UMAP representation of latent representations of integrated primary tissue cells. To compute the transcriptional similarity graph for the organoid reference, we used the 30 nearest neighbors and the UMAP representation of integrated embedding of organoid cells. Single cell organoid data were integrated using scPoli and 3000 highly variable genes as described earlier. We used the default parameters for all the remaining computational steps in building the neighborhood graphs. We then used the R package scrabbitr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ton et al., 2023</xref>) to compute the correlation between each pair of neighborhoods in the primary tissue and organoid reference and annotate the results at cell type or tissue level. The neighborhood correlations were computed using 3000 highly variable genes that were found in the highly variable genes in the primary tissue single cell reference atlases. This step results in two neighborhood correlation matrices: a primary tissue-correlation matrix where each entry marks the correlation of the expression profile of a given neighborhood in the primary tissue with the HEOCA, and an organoid-correlation matrix that stores the correlation of expression profiles in each neighborhood of the organoid atlas with the primary tissue atlas. This procedure was additionally repeated for each organoid derivation protocol, that is Adult Stem-Cell, Fetal Stem-Cell and Pluripotent Stem-Cell derived protocols. To compare the correlation between cell states in the primary tissue and between organoid derivation protocols, we subtracted the primary tissue-neighborhood correlation matrices computed with respect to neighborhoods for each derivation protocol. This approach of comparing primary tissue and organoid by correlation of neighborhood graphs is more reliable than the alternative reference mapping strategy, as it removes the dependance of the reliability and accuracy of the conclusions to mapping uncertainty, and allows for computing correlation statistics on graphs that are constructed based on transcriptional similarity of cells in each data source.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Organoid off-target analysis</title><p id="P47">For each organoid sample, the same set of variable genes used in the primary tissue atlas (adult or fetal) was chosen, and the scPoli query was executed using identical parameters to those employed in the primary tissue atlas training model.
