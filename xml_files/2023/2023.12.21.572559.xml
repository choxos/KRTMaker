While they are currently in clinical trials for solid cancers, biomarkers to predict the response to SAC inhibitors are still lacking. We recently reported that aneuploid cancer cells are preferentially sensitive to SAC inhibition. Here, we investigated the molecular determinants of the response to SAC inhibition that underlies the differential sensitivity of aneuploid cells to these drugs. We found that this response was largely driven by the expression of CDC20, a main activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), rather than by APC/C itself. Mechanistically, we discovered that CDC20 depletion prolonged metaphase duration, diminished mitotic errors, and reduced sensitivity to SAC inhibition. Aneuploid cells expressed high levels of CDC20 and experienced shorter metaphases and multiple mitotic errors, resulting in increased long-term sensitivity to SAC inhibition. Our findings propose high CDC20 expression as a favorable biomarker for SAC inhibition therapy and as an aneuploidy-induced therapeutic vulnerability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC)</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>SAC inhibition</kwd><kwd>chromosomal instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), also known as the mitotic checkpoint, is a key cell cycle regulator that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. In the presence of abnormal mitotic spindles that will lead to errors in chromosome segregation, the SAC is recruited and arrests cell division, allowing time for error correction and restoration of normal division. The SAC is composed of a series of proteins that recruit an effector complex, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). The MCC, which is composed of BUB1B, MAD2L1 and BUB3, prevents progression into anaphase by sequestering CDC20, the main activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Curtis et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kops et al, 2005</xref>). When unbound by the MCC, CDC20 forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C, and the complex tags various substrates for degradation by ubiquitination. Notable CDC20-APC/C substrates are Securin, whose degradation allows sister chromatid separation; Cyclin B1, whose degradation also promotes mitosis culmination; and CDC20 itself, which is negatively regulated by the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Musacchio &amp; Salmon, 2007</xref>). However, when the SAC is active, the MCC binds CDC20 and progression into anaphase is blocked, allowing time for error correction and restoration of normal division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Musacchio &amp; Salmon, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, prolonged cell cycle arrest or failure to divide normally will eventually lead either to cell death or to mitotic slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sinha et al, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rossio et al, 2010</xref>) – cell division despite the presence of an altered spindle and an active SAC – which would lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidization.</p><p id="P5">SAC inhibitors are drugs that disable the SAC, enabling cells to complete erroneous divisions and causing the equivalent of mitotic slippage. Consequently, these drugs induce chromosomal instability and lead to the acquisition of aberrant and unfit karyotypes in the treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">He et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mason et al, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kawakami et al, 2019</xref>). We recently showed that SAC inhibition is more detrimental for aneuploid cells than for diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>). SAC inhibitor drugs – and specifically, MPS1 inhibitors – are currently in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of solid cancers <styled-content style="color:#9900FF">(NCT02792465, NCT03568422, NCT05251714)</styled-content>, either alone or in combination with microtubule-disrupting agents such as paclitaxel. Despite the emerging clinical utility of these drugs, no biomarker predicting patient response has yet been confirmed, and the molecular mechanism behind the response to these drugs is only partially understood. Several papers suggested that low expression levels or dysfunction of the APC/C are associated with resistance to SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sansregret et al, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thu et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wild et al, 2016</xref>). However, in this work we refine the proposed mechanism underlying the response to SAC inhibition, suggesting that CDC20 regulates this response. We further propose that CDC20 underlies the differential sensitivity of aneuploid cells to these drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cdc20 is strongly associated with the response to SAC inhibition</title><p id="P6">To identify genes and pathways that are involved in the response to SAC inhibition, we performed two independent CRISPR-Cas9 screens in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, looking for genes whose depletion promoted cell proliferation under SAC inhibition using the Mps1 inhibitor reversine, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A,B</xref>. Comprehensive lists of the resultant candidate genes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Searching for cellular pathways enriched in the top ranking 10% of candidate genes from both CRISPR screens, we found that three out of ten pathways were directly related to anaphase promotion by the APC/C, and a fourth pathway contained the APC/C complex genes among other nuclear ubiquitin-ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the top significant gene whose loss conferred resistance to SAC inhibition in both screens was Cdc20, the protein co-activator of the APC/C during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the core members of the APC/C were among the candidate genes, their effect was much weaker than that of Cdc20 in both of the screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). To validate the role of Cdc20 levels in promoting resistance to SAC inhibition, we knocked down or knocked out Cdc20 in NIH-3T3 cells using shRNA or CRISPR, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D-F</xref>), and assessed sensitivity to the SAC inhibitor reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Santaguida <italic>et al,</italic> 2010</xref>). Indeed, Cdc20 depletion reduced sensitivity to SAC inhibition, evidenced by increased cell viability following exposure to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1G</xref>). Together, these findings suggest a strong association between Cdc20 expression and sensitivity to SAC inhibition, with Cdc20 depletion leading to increased resistance to these drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CDC20 expression, but not APC/C expression, predicts sensitivity to genetic and chemical SAC inhibition</title><p id="P7">Several studies suggested that resistance to SAC inhibition is associated with lower expression levels of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sansregret et al, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thu et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wild et al, 2016</xref>). However, our CRISPR screen suggested that it was Cdc20, rather than the APC/C core members, that determines the sensitivity to SAC inhibition. Indeed, while knockout and knockdown of Cdc20 reduced the sensitivity of NIH-3T3 cells to SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1G</xref>), knockdown and knockout of a representative APC/C subunit, Anapc4, did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A-E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To further explore the respective roles of CDC20 and the APC/C in the response to SAC inhibition, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,700 human cancer cell lines from the cancer Dependency Map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tsherniak et al, 2017</xref>). We used an APC/C transcriptional signature previously reported by Thu et al. to be associated with sensitivity to SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thu et al, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2F</xref>) to assign an APC/C expression score to each cell line, and correlated the APC/C expression with sensitivity to genetic perturbation of the core SAC components MAD2L1 and BUB1B. Indeed, a lower APC/C expression score was correlated with lower sensitivity to genetic SAC perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, left panels). However, we noticed that the gene signature used by Thu et al. to define the APC/C contained not only the core APC/C subunits but also CDC20, which acts as the main APC/C co-activator during mitosis. Intriguingly, this correlation was lost or severely weakened when we removed CDC20 and used a signature containing only the APC/C subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yamano, 2019</xref>), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, middle panels). In contrast, expression of CDC20 alone was strongly correlated with sensitivity to genetic SAC perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, right panels). Next, we used the human cell line data to study the association between gene expression and sensitivity to chemical perturbation of the SAC. Here as well, increased CDC20 expression was correlated with increased sensitivity to SAC inhibitor drugs (Mps1 inhibitors MPI-0479605 and AZ3146), while APC/C subunit expression was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Overall, the human cancer cell line data suggest that elevated levels of CDC20, but not of APC/C, expression is associated with increased sensitivity to both genetic and chemical disruption of the SAC.</p><p id="P9">To validate these findings in the context of human cancer cells, we knocked out CDC20 and ANAPC4 in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2G, H</xref>), and assessed cell survival and proliferation under SAC inhibition. Similar to the observations with the mouse cells, CDC20 depletion led to a substantial decrease in the cellular sensitivity of human cancer cells to SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, ANAPC4 knockout did not exert a similar effect on drug response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggest that both in mouse and in human cells it is CDC20 expression, rather than expression of the APC/C core components, that mediate the cellular response to SAC inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Increased CDC20 expression is associated with the preferential response of aneuploid cells to SAC inhibition</title><p id="P10">We recently found that aneuploid cells are more sensitive to SAC inhibition than diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the expression levels of CDC20 differ between diploid and aneuploid cells, and if so, whether this underlies their differential drug sensitivity. We therefore compared CDC20 and APC/C mRNA expression levels between the top and bottom aneuploid quartiles of human cancer cell lines in the DepMap database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tsherniak et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>). We found that highly-aneuploid cell lines over-express CDC20, but under-express most of the core APC/C subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yamano, 2019</xref>) in comparison to near-diploid cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was surprising given that expression patterns of cell cycle genes are usually strongly correlated across cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fischer et al, 2022</xref>). We therefore examined highly-aneuploid and near-diploid cell lines separately and found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of CDC20 and the APC/C subunit ANAPC4 were indeed strongly correlated in the near-diploid cell lines, but this correlation was completely lost in highly-aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the increased susceptibility of aneuploid cells to SAC inhibition in comparison to diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>), these results further support the notion that the cellular response to SAC inhibition is primarily determined by quantitative changes in CDC20 expression rather than by the expression of the APC/C subunits.</p><p id="P11">To validate the role of the increased CDC20 levels in the increased sensitivity of aneuploid cells to SAC inhibition, we knocked out CDC20 or ANAPC4 in two highly-aneuploid derivatives of HCT116, HPT1 and HPT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kuznetsova <italic>et al,</italic> 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), and assessed their cellular sensitivity to reversine. In both aneuploid cell lines, CDC20 knockout decreased the cellular sensitivity to SAC inhibition, whereas ANAPC4 knockout did not have the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CDC20 expression levels determine the prevalence of mitotic errors and metaphase duration</title><p id="P12">Next, we set out to mechanistically explore the association between aneuploidy, CDC20 expression levels, and the response to SAC inhibition. We quantified CDC20 protein levels in two isogenic cellular systems of near-diploid human cell lines – the colon cancer cell line HCT116, and the non-transformed retinal cell line RPE1 – and their highly-aneuploid derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kuznetsova et al, 2015</xref>). As CDC20 protein levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Foe et al, 2011</xref>), they were quantified at their peak, during metaphase, in dividing single cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. In both systems, highly-aneuploid cells expressed significantly higher levels of CDC20 compared to their near-diploid counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). Importantly, this over-expression of CDC20 during mitosis in individual cells indicates that the elevated expression of CDC20 that we previously observed in cell populations does not merely reflect changes in their proliferative capacity, but rather changes at the single cell level. We previously found highly-aneuploid cells to exhibit more mitotic errors and linked their CIN to their elevated response to SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the elevated CDC20 expression levels may be associated with the elevated CIN of the aneuploid cells.</p><p id="P13">To test this, we compared CDC20 protein expression in cells undergoing normal and erroneous cell divisions and found that in both isogenic systems – regardless of ploidy background – cells undergoing aberrant mitosis presented higher levels of CDC20 during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). These results suggest a link between increased CDC20 expression and chromosome missegregation, which is both a cause and a consequence of the aneuploid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Pfau &amp; Amon, 2012</xref>; Ben-David &amp; Amon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Holland &amp; Cleveland, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To test whether CDC20 expression was directly linked to SACi-induced CIN, we characterized the effect of CDC20 levels on the overall rate and severity of mitotic errors in mouse and human cells using live cell imaging. To this end, we quantified mitotic aberrations in control and CDC20 knockout cells, with or without SAC inhibition, and scored the mitotic aberrations on a severity scale of 0-5, with 0 (green) representing normal division and increasingly higher scores (warmer colors) representing more severe mitotic aberrations, as has been done in previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Crozier et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thu et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Huis In ’T Veld et al, 2019</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> section). Both in NIH-3T3 and HCT116 cells subjected to SAC inhibition, CDC20 knockout significantly reduced the prevalence and the severity of reversine-induced mitotic aberrations, thus alleviating SAC-inhibition-induced CIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C and Figure 4D</xref>, respectively). Similarly, CDC20 knockout alleviated CIN in the highly-aneuploid HPT1 and HPT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>, respectively). In contrast, ANAPC4 knockout in NIH-3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), HPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) and HPT2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>) did not significantly affect the prevalence of mitotic aberrations following SAC inhibition. In HCT116 cells, ANAPC4 knockout even led to an increase in the severity of mitotic aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate a causal relationship between CDC20 expression, and the degree of CIN induced by SAC inhibition. Specifically, reduction in CDC20 levels is associated with decreased severity and overall rate of mitotic aberrations in mouse and human cells of various transformation and ploidy statuses.</p><p id="P15">Low expression and activity of CDC20 are expected to prolong mitosis, which might underlie the association that we observed between CDC20 and CIN levels. We thus quantified metaphase duration following gene knockout in all cell lines. CDC20 knockout significantly prolonged metaphase duration in NIH-3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), HPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) and HPT2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4D</xref>) cells. In contrast, all cell lines except HCT116 did not present a significant change in metaphase duration after ANAPC4 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4D</xref>). The differences in mitotic phenotypes and duration in the NIH-3T3 and HCT116 cell lines with and without CDC20 and ANAPC4 knockout can be observed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Videos 1-10</xref>. All in all, CDC20 depletion, but not depletion of the APC/C subunit ANAPC4, results in prolonged metaphase and reduced prevalence of mitotic aberrations across mouse and human cell lines with various ploidies. These results indicate that CDC20 is the key player in the cellular response to SAC inhibition, and that it acts by altering metaphase duration and affecting the overall level of chromosomal instability induced by SAC inactivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Aneuploidy and CIN are associated with cancer progression and drug response. CIN and aneuploidy were previously linked to increased drug resistance to many anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lee et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Replogle et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ippolito et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lukow et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>), but they can also lead to increased sensitivity to specific therapies, such as SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>), KIF18A inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cohen-Sharir et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marquis et al, 2021</xref>), Src1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schukken et al, 2020</xref>), IL-6R inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hong et al, 2022</xref>), MAPK signaling inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zerbib et al, 2023</xref>) and proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ippolito et al, 2023</xref>). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate the associations between CIN/aneuploidy and drug response can guide the development of new therapies and promote our basic understanding of cancer.</p><p id="P17">SAC inhibitors operate by inactivating the chromosome segregation-control mechanism, culminating in a cascade of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy that ultimately leads to cellular death. Biomarkers that enable predicting which patients respond well to SAC inhibitors are urgently needed. Previous studies have suggested that the response to SAC inhibition is driven by the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sansregret et al, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Thu et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wild et al, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the response is mostly driven by the expression and function of the main APC/C activator during mitosis, CDC20, rather than by the APC/C itself.</p><p id="P18">We show that CDC20 expression, but not APC/C expression, is significantly correlated to sensitivity to multiple forms of SAC inhibition and to the aneuploid state. Furthermore, we show that CDC20 depletion decreases the sensitivity to SAC inhibition in both mouse and human cells, while depletion of a representative APC/C subunit does not. Mechanistically, we show that CDC20 overexpression is significantly associated with mitotic errors, while CDC20 depletion results in prolonged metaphases and decreased prevalence and severity of mitotic errors under SAC inhibition. These results suggest that cells with lower CDC20 levels delay anaphase onset and spend more time in metaphase, allowing for more time to correct spindle abnormalities. This would lead to the observed decrease in mitotic error rate and severity, to the acquisition of more fit karyotypes and to the overall better survival of the cells under SAC inhibition.</p><p id="P19">Our study provides a molecular link between aneuploidy and the sensitivity to SAC inhibition. We show for the first time that aneuploid cells overexpress CDC20 and that this upregulation is correlated with an increased rate of mitotic aberrations, presumably leading to increased inherent chromosomal instability in these cells and to their enhanced sensitivity to the excess CIN caused by SAC inhibition. Therefore, the upregulation of CDC20 in aneuploid cells could be important for their adaptation to the aneuploid state, and at the same time mediate their increased sensitivity to SAC inhibition.</p><p id="P20">Effectively, SAC inhibition and CDC20 overexpression result in a similar outcome – they both lead to higher effective concentrations of uninhibited APC/C-CDC20 complexes in the cells, allowing cell division to continue even in the presence of malformed spindles. Therefore, each of these two conditions individually leads to chromosomal instability and aneuploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Weaver &amp; Cleveland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mondal et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mason et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adell et al, 2023</xref>). Combined, we show that these conditions lead to excessive chromosomal instability and the formation of unfit karyotypes, which is poorly tolerated by the cells. In contrast, CDC20 downregulation reduces the overall levels of chromosomal instability in the cells, allowing them to better tolerate the effects of SAC inhibition, thereby making them more resistant to this class of drugs.</p><p id="P21">CDC20 overexpression is known to be a negative prognostic marker in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Xian et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wu et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Karra et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kato et al, 2012</xref>), possibly due to its association with higher cell division rate of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shang et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chu et al, 2019</xref>). Here, we show that CDC20 overexpression might be a favorable prognostic marker of the response to SAC inhibitors, and perhaps even more so in highly-aneuploid tumors. Our findings are highly clinically relevant as several SAC inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, with one of them being fast-tracked by the FDA (NCT05251714). In a broader context, CDC20 may be a potential biomarker for predicting the cellular response to other CIN-inducing therapies, which needs to be validated in follow-up work.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>CRISPR-Cas9 screen and Validation</title><p id="P22">NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 system using lentiviruses.

Following transfection, cells were selected with 400µg/ml neomycin and monoclonal Cas9-expressing cells were isolated in 96-well plates.

The required number of iCas9 NIH-3T3 cells (377 million) was calculated as follows: the required minimal complexity (500X) multiplied by library complexity (188,509 sgRNAs) divided by minimal surviving fraction of cells at an MOI of 0.3 (25%).</p><p id="P24">Cells were then selected with puromycin for 5 days and frozen or maintained at a minimal complexity of 500X (94 million cells after puromycin selection). To identify sgRNAs enriched under reversine treatment, cells were expanded and seeded at 94 million cells per replicate (2 replicates per condition) with either DMSO (0.1%; Sigma) or 250 nM reversine (R3904; Sigma-Aldrich) on 15 cm dishes (833903; Sarstedt) and cultured for 5 days with treatment after which the treatments were removed.</p><p id="P25">Cells were then maintained and passaged for three more weeks when necessary (DMSO-treated cells ~every 3 days, and reversine-treated cells once or twice at later time points), always ensuring a minimal number of 94 million cells per replicate.

At the end of the screen, DNA was isolated from a minimum of 94 million cells for each replicate to determine sgRNA distribution.</p><p id="P26">Genomic DNA was isolated from samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen; 56404). DNA was fragmented using Ndel and SacII restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and hybridized overnight with biotinylated capture oligos for selective DNA targeting. The hybridized DNA was captured using Streptavidin T1 Dynabeads (ThermoFisher; 65601) and non-hybridized oligos were removed by Exonuclease I digestion. sgRNAs were amplified by two rounds of PCR. The first round used unique barcoded forward primers, allowing for sample identification in pooled sequencing, while the second round attached necessary adapter sequences for sequencing compatibility.

This script searches for a key sequence (CGAAACACC), which precedes the sgRNA sequences. This key sequence was detected within a certain window (bases 16-44). When found, it extracts the sgRNA sequences which are the 20 bases just after the key sequence or the 20 bases after a G base that sometimes follows the key sequence. When one of the two sequences matched with the list of known sgRNA sequences, the count of this sgRNA was raised by one.

Next, a differential analysis was performed on the sgRNA level (counts) between the two conditions (reversine and DMSO) with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Love et al, 2014</xref>). A paired design was implemented to account for differences between the samples while estimating the effect due to the condition (design=~ replicate + condition). The median of ratios method was used for the normalization of the sgRNA counts. This analysis resulted in a log2 fold change value, a p-value, and a test statistic for each sgRNA. sgRNAs with a zero count in all samples were excluded. The results were subsequently ranked on the test statistic putting either the most enriched or depleted sgRNA on top.
