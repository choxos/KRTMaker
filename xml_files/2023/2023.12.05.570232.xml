The J-domain proteins Pam16 and Pam18 regulate the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, their counterparts are TbPam16 and TbPam18, which are essential for the procyclic form of the parasite, though not involved in mitochondrial protein import. Here, we show that during evolution, the two proteins have been repurposed to regulate the replication of maxicircles within the intricate kDNA network, the most complex mitochondrial genome known. TbPam18 and TbPam16 have inactive J-domains suggesting a function independent of heat shock proteins. However, their single transmembrane domain is essential for function. Pulldown of TbPam16 identifies a putative client protein, termed MaRF11, the depletion of which causes the selective loss of maxicircles, akin to the effects observed for TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover depletion of the mitochondrial proteasome results in increased levels of MaRF11. Thus, we propose a model for a membrane-bound regulatory circuit that controls maxicircle replication in response to an unknown nuclear signal. This model posits that MaRF11 directly mediates maxicircle replication, that its level is controlled by proteasomal digestion, and that it is protected from degradation by binding to the TbPam18/TbPam16 dimer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The parasitic protist <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> has a unique mitochondrial biology. As in other eukaryotes, more than 95% of its mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into and across the mitochondrial membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, the trypanosomal mitochondrial protein import machineries show significant differences to the prototypical systems of yeast and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The largest differences are found in the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the TIM complex. Essentially all eukaryotes have two TIM complexes, termed TIM22 and TIM23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The TIM22 complex mediates insertion of proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IM) that have multi-spanning membrane domains, such as mitochondrial carrier proteins (MCPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The TIM23 complex imports presequence-containing proteins across or into the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To import its substrates into the mitochondrial matrix, TIM23 associates with the matrix-exposed presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM). The PAM consists of five essential and highly conserved subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>: the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, its J-domain-containing co-factors Pam18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and Pam16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, Tim44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In contrast, <italic>T. brucei</italic> has a single TIM complex only, which with minor compositional variations, imports both types of substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the only trypanosomal TIM component sharing homology to a subunit of TIM complexes in yeast or mammals is TbTim17. TbTim17 is an orthologue of the Tim22 subunit of the TIM22 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To import presequence-containing proteins, the trypanosomal TIM complex associates with a PAM module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> containing the trypanosomal mHsp70 orthologue (TbmHsp70), which is essential for the import of presequence-containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>T. brucei</italic> contains <italic>bona fide</italic> orthologues of Pam18 and Pam16, termed TbPam18 and TbPam16. However, while they are essential for normal growth of procyclic form (PCF) trypanosomes, they are not involved in mitochondrial protein import<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Instead, the function of Pam18, and likely Pam16, in the trypanosomal PAM is carried out by the non-orthologous, essential, J-domain-containing integral IM protein TbPam27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Based on these observations, an evolutionary scenario was proposed that aims to explain the transition from two ancestral TIM complexes, found in most eukaryotes, to the single TIM complex of trypanosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It posits that in the ancestor of kinetoplastids, TbPam27 fortuitously interacted with TbTim17. This allowed mHsp70 to bind to the resulting TbTim17/TbPam27 complex forming a rudimentary PAM. As a consequence, the TbTim17-containing, TIM22-like TIM complex acquired the capability to import both, presequence-containing proteins and MCPs. Thus, the previously essential TIM23 complex became redundant and its subunits were lost. However, the proposed scenario cannot explain why TbPam18 and TbPam16 were retained during evolution and why they are essential for the growth of PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The single mitochondrion of trypanosomes contains a single unit genome, termed kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), which is the most complex mitochondrial genome known in nature. The kDNA consists of two types of DNA rings: maxicircles (ca. 25 copies, 23 kb each) and heterogenous minicircles (ca. 5000 copies, 1 kb each) that are arranged in a large intercatenated network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Maxicircles encode 16 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, two mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs) and two rRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Twelve of their transcripts require RNA editing to become functional mRNAs. This process is mediated by small guide RNAs (gRNAs), which are the only genes encoded on the minicircles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The kDNA network consists to 90% of minicircles, which are highly topologically interlocked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Maxicircles are also interlocked with each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and in addition, interwoven into the minicircle network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The resulting kDNA disk in the mitochondrial matrix is physically connected to the flagellum’s basal body in the cytosol via the tripartite attachment complex (TAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Minicircle replication begins with their release into the kinetoflagellar zone (KFZ), located between the kDNA disk and the IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. It occurs unidirectionally via theta structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Replicated minicircles migrate to the antipodal sites, which are protein complexes at opposing sites of the kDNA disk, where gaps are repaired and minicircles are reattached to the periphery of the network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Maxicircles replicate like minicircles, but always remain interlocked with the kDNA. However, the details of the process and the factors required for it are not well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Minicircle release and reattachment causes concentration of the catenated maxicircles in the center of the disk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The concomitant replication and segregation of the kDNA network, mediated by the TAC and the basal bodies, results in the formation of a maxicircle-containing filament between the two minicircles networks, termed Nabelschnur. Completion of kDNA segregation requires cleavage of this Nabelschnur, to unlink the daughter kDNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Altogether, replication of the single kDNA network involves up to 150 different proteins and is tightly coordinated with the nuclear cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of this coordination is presently unknown. What has been shown is that the mitochondrial proteasome TbHslVU, composed of the two subunits TbHslV and TbHslU, acts a negative regulator of minicircle and maxicircle copy numbers and its depletion thus causes accumulation of giant kDNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, up to date, only a single TbHslVU substrate has been identified, the maxicircle replication factor TbPIF2, whose levels are increased in TbHslVU depleted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Here, we show that TbPam18 and TbPam16, while not involved in mitochondrial protein import, are required for the replication of the maxicircle component of the kDNA.

To identify what this function might be, we quantified global changes in the mitochondrial proteome caused by the ablation of either of the two proteins. Previously established tetracycline-inducible TbPam18 and TbPam16 RNAi cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> were analyzed by stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). Surprisingly, neither TbPam18 nor TbPam16 were detected in the two SILAC RNAi experiments. However, using a TbPam16 antibody, we found that after only one day of RNAi induction, TbPam16 levels were strongly reduced in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, we conclude that i) the stability of TbPam16 depends on TbPam18, suggesting the two proteins form a heterodimer as in yeast, and ii) that RNAi against TbPam16 is very efficient.</p><p id="P11">916 and 893 mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> were detected in the SILAC RNAi datasets and the levels of 12.4% and 13.2% of them were reduced more than 1.5-fold in the TbPam18 and TbPam16 RNAi cell lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The most affected proteins included mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, of which 58.6% and 62.5% were depleted more than 1.5-fold in the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <italic>top panels</italic>). Furthermore, we found that 15.3% and 16.3% of all detected components of the OXPHOS pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> were reduced more than 1.5-fold in the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom panels</italic>). In both experiments, complex IV was affected the most, followed by complexes I and III, whereas the levels of complex II and V subunits were not or only marginally decreased.</p><p id="P12">A common feature of the mitoribosome and the OXPHOS complexes I, III and IV is that some of their subunits are encoded on the kDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.

For complexes I, III and IV the number of maxicircle-encoded subunits is six, three and three, respectively. In contrast, only a single complex V subunit is encoded on the kDNA and all complex II subunits are encoded in the nuclear genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Taken together, the SILAC RNAi results presented here indicate that the ablations of TbPam18 and TbPam16 could affect the kDNA.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Depletion of TbPam18 and TbPam16 leads to the loss of maxicircles</title><p id="P14">To investigate the fate of the kDNA upon TbPam18 or TbPam16 depletion, we analyzed DAPI-stained RNAi cells by fluorescence microscopy. In line with the SILAC-RNAi analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>), we found that after four days of RNAi induction, many TbPam18 and TbPam16 RNAi cells had smaller kDNAs compared to uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). A quantification of the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>) showed in both cell lines a time-dependent decrease of the kDNA size to 90% and about 60% after three (prior to the onset of the growth retardation) to five days of RNAi induction, respectively. Shrinkage of the kDNA disk has been observed previously when proteins involved in kDNA replication were ablated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">To study the effects on the kDNA in more detail, we performed Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Total DNA was extracted from uninduced and induced RNAi cells, digested by restriction enzymes and separated on an agarose gel. The resulting blot was hybridized with mini- and maxicircle specific probes. Already after three days of RNAi induction, maxicircle levels are significantly reduced to about 39% in both cell lines. After five days they are almost undetectable. In contrast, the levels of minicircles are not significantly changed over five days of RNAi induction. The same experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) was repeated using PCR, to detect the changes in mini- and maxicircle levels and the same results were obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The observation that the depletion of maxicircles is detected prior to the onsets of growth retardations (which occur at day four)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> suggests that TbPam18 and TbPam16 are directly involved in maxicircle replication or maintenance.</p><p id="P16">Since minicircles make up 90% of the kDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the massive network shrinkage seen in the DAPI stains of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> cannot be explained by a selective loss of maxicircles only <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. One way to explain the constant levels of minicircles during TbPam18 and TbPam16 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) is that they are released from the kDNA disk that progressively gets depleted from maxicircles.</p><p id="P17">To detect potential changes in free minicircle levels, digitonin-extracted, mitochondria-enriched pellets from uninduced and induced TbPam18 and TbPam16 RNAi cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin. Subsequent centrifugation resulted in pellets containing kDNA networks and supernatants containing free minicircles. PCR analysis of the DNA extracted from these fractions showed that maxicircles were only present in the pellets and that their levels decreased over time of induction as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Minicircles behaved very differently. In uninduced cells they were almost exclusively found in pellet fractions and thus in the kDNA networks. However, during the course of the RNAi, the amount of detected minicircles completely shifts to the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Thus, ablation of TbPam18 and TbPam16, and the accompanying loss of maxicircles, does not inhibit the release of minicircles from the remaining kDNA network, nor their replication. But it appears to prevent their reattachment to the maxicircle-depleted networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TbPam18 and TbPam16 have procyclic form-specific functions</title><p id="P18"><italic>T. brucei</italic> has a complex life cycle alternating between an insect vector, the Tsetse fly, and a mammalian host. One of the replicative stages in the insect vector is the PCF, which contains an extensively reticulated mitochondrion that is capable of OXPHOS. The replicative stage in the mammalian host is the bloodstream form (BSF), which has a less reticulated mitochondrion that cannot perform OXPHOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. The BSF produces its energy exclusively by glycolysis. But because the mitochondrial membrane potential in BSFs is maintained by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase working in reverse, a subunit of which is encoded on the kDNA, an intact kDNA network is essential not only in the PCF but also for the BSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">It was therefore surprising that RNAi-mediated ablation of TbPam18 in the New York single marker (NYsm) BSF strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> did not affect growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, the interpretation of this result is complicated, because even efficient RNAi never eliminates all mRNAs. It could be that the small amount of TbPam18 still present in these cells is sufficient for growth. To not run into the same issue with TbPam16, we established a TbPam16 NYsm double knockout (dKO) cell line, whose growth was indistinguishable from its parent cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This demonstrates that the function of TbPam16 is indeed specific for PCF trypanosomes and that its role in maxicircle replication is redundant in BSF cells or taken over by another protein. For unknown reason we were not able to produce a dKO cell line for TbPam18, not even a conditional one. However, based on the results of the TbPam18 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and the observation that TbPam16 and TbPam18, as Pam18 and Pam16 in yeast, likely form a heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), we conclude that the function of TbPam18 is also redundant in the BSF.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Integral membrane localization of TbPam18 and TbPam16 is functionally relevant</title><p id="P20">TbPam18 and TbPam16 are integral IM proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, which raises the question whether this feature is essential for their function. To find out, we expressed RNAi-resistant (RNAi-res.) TbPam18 and TbPam16 variants lacking their predicted transmembrane domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> (TMDs) as well as their short IMS exposed N-termini (4 aa for TbPam18 and 33 aa for TbPam16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

Both truncated variants were N-terminally fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of trypanosomal TbmHsp60, to ensure their import into mitochondria. Since the TbPam16-HA and ΔN-TbPam16-HA variants were tagged, their import could be verified biochemically using digitonin extractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>).

Thus, the change in function of TbPam18 during evolution must have allowed the inactivation of the conserved tripeptide from HPD to HSD indicating that TbPam18 and TbPam16 function independently of mHsp70.

Instead, the SILAC CoIPs recovered the two essential proteins MaRF11 and TbCOQ8 indicating they might be client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>).

TbPam18 and TbPam16 protect MaRF11 from complete degradation by HslVU. MaRF11 RNAi: absence of MaRF11 depletes maxicircles and causes a shrinkage of the remaining kDNA network. Free minicircles accumulate. TbPam16/18 RNAi: depletion of either of the two proteins results in a decrease of MaRF11 levels and therefore causes the exact same phenotype as is observed after MaRF11 depletion. TbPam16/18-ΔTMD: expression of TbPam16/18 lacking their transmembrane domains in the background of TbPam16/18 RNAi does not restore maxicircle copy number. HslVU RNAi: depletion of HslVU activity results in accumulation of MaRF11 and enlarged kDNA networks as observed before.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192606-f010"/></fig></floats-group></article>
