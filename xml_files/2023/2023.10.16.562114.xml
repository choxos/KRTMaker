Using common clinical laboratory measures in ~30,000 individuals from the MGB-Biobank, we developed a robust, predictive biological aging phenotype, <italic>EMRAge</italic>, that balances clinical biomarkers with overall mortality risk and can be broadly recapitulated across EMRs. We then applied elastic-net regression to model <italic>EMRAge</italic> with DNA-methylation (DNAm) and multiple omics, generating <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, respectively. Both biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with chronic diseases and mortality that outperform current biomarkers across our discovery (MGB-ABC, n=3,451) and validation (TruDiagnostic, n=12,666) cohorts. Through the use of epigenetic biomarker proxies, <italic>OMICmAge</italic> has the unique advantage of expanding the predictive search space to include epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data while distilling this in a measure with DNAm alone, providing opportunities to identify clinically-relevant interconnections central to the aging process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>biological aging</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>clock</kwd><kwd>biobank</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">A major goal of aging research is to define biomarkers of aging that capture inter-individual differences in functional decline, chronic disease development, and mortality not identified through chronological age alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Both molecular and clinical data have been used to quantify various attributes of the biological aging process. Multiple molecular biomarkers of aging, or “clocks”, have been developed as proxies for these hallmarks of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These biomarkers have been variously based on telomere length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, neuro-imaging data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, immune cell counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and large-scale omics including DNA methylation (DNAm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, metabolomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, glycomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>.</sup></p><p id="P3">Over the last two decades, electronic medical records (EMR) have been widely used in clinical research, in particular for precision medicine, enabling deep phenotype mining from dense, comprehensive time-dependent data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. By utilizing comprehensive EMR data, we can capture clinical physiological changes over time that robustly illustrate phenotypic changes in real-time health status. Capitalizing on EMRs provides a unique opportunity to quantify the aging process in a reproducible way across clinical settings. While healthy aging encompasses both quality of life and life span, metrics of biological age have traditionally focused on using either clinical data to quantify quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, or mortality risk to quantify life span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, resulting in biological phenotypes that are optimized to one of these attributes, while not fully capturing the other. With the wealth of data captured via EMRs, biological aging phenotypes that incorporate both dense clinical data and mortality can be created to synthesize these important attributes of aging into a single measure.</p><p id="P4">While clinical data are essential in creating aging phenotypes, connecting these phenotypes to the molecular underpinnings of the aging process is equally important. We do so by combining EMR data with comprehensive ‘omic profiling to assess the biological processes that ultimately govern aging. The strong molecular link between DNA methylation (DNAm) and the aging process has resulted in the widespread development and success of DNAm clocks with various biologic aging phenotypes aimed at reflecting clinical biomarkers (e.g. PhenoAge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>), mortality (e.g. GrimAge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>), and the rate of aging (e.g. DunedinPACE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P5">Despite their broad use across both research and commercial settings, DNAm clocks have notable limitations. One such limitation is the difficulty of accurately reducing dimensionality due to the technical noise in measuring individual CpGs, which subsequently affects the precision <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The heterogeneity of immune cell subsets is also a confounder of DNAm aging estimates, and whilst cellular deconvolution methods have been applied, to date immune deconvolution has considered a limited number of cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Further, the inclusion of a CpG in a predictive aging clock does not necessarily imply causality nor functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and identifying causal CpGs from DNAm clocks remains a challenging task, one that limits their biological potential.</p><p id="P6">Proteomics and metabolomics are more directly related to biological phenomena and may have utility as components of aging clocks. The proteome is altered by hallmarks of aging including loss of proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, altered intercellular communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Further, blood plasma contains circulating proteins derived from nearly all organs and cell types, making it possible to associate findings in peripheral blood with specific tissues and organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The metabolome not only provides critical information about metabolic processes, but it also provides measures of environmental exposures, including xenobiotics, that may be critically linked to the aging process. Further, the peripheral blood metabolome carries information from multiple tissues across the body, increasing the potential aging information of metabolomics compared to methylation and transcriptomic clocks of blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Despite the important advantages of other omics, the development of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic clocks for biologic aging phenotypes has been limited. Initial work has demonstrated that while individual omics clocks share commonalities, each omic data type provides a distinct window of features that illustrate the aging process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting that the best and most clinically informative approach would harmonize combined information from multiple omic measurements to create an optimized aging clock. However, the integration of multiple omics into a multi-omic clock or to optimize and further inform upon the biological processes of improvement upon DNAm clocks remains an area of unfulfilled clinical potential.</p><p id="P8">Using ~30,000 participants from the Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB) Biobank, we developed and validated three distinct and clinically relevant measures of biological age: 1) <italic>EMRAge</italic>, a clinically-based and versatile death mortality predictor that can be broadly recapitulated across EMRs; 2) <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic>, a DNA methylation aging biomarker trained to predict <italic>EMRAge</italic>; and 3) <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, the first DNA methylation-based multi-omic aging biomarker trained to predict <italic>EMRAge</italic>, that integrates proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data through the use of Epigenetic Biomarker Proxies (EBP) (i.e., methylation surrogates) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. By outperforming current methylation-based clocks in associations with chronic disease outcomes and mortality, we demonstrate the value of <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic>, and <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, while further substantiating the biological relevance and value of integrating multiple omic data into one biological aging phenotype.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Overview of Study Design</title><p id="P9">To develop and validate <italic>EMRAge, DNAmEMRAge</italic>, and <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, we used participants in the Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB) Biobank.

A subset of these individuals who had available omic data were used to develop <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and <italic>OMICmAge</italic> (MGB Aging Biobank Cohort (MGB-ABC), n=3,451). Finally, we validated these aging biomarkers using an independent cohort, the TruDiagnostic Biobank (n=12,666) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The additional clinical characteristics and demographics for these cohorts are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Extended Table S1</xref>.

A Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) model was fitted in the training set to estimate the weightings of the 19 selected features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Extended Table S7</xref>). In a manner analogous to the GrimAge approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we converted the linear combination of estimated weights and predictor values into an “age” metric (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Method</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficient between <italic>EMRAge</italic> and chronological age was found to be greater than 0.75 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Extended Figure S2</xref>). We validated the <italic>EMRAge</italic> predictors by re-training the algorithm at four time points in 2-year increments: January 1st of 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. The four derived equations were then applied to participants (N=11,673) on January 1st of 2016. The Pearson correlations amongst these estimates were nearly 1, affirming the robustness of the <italic>EMRAge</italic> predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that all aging-related health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, type-2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and any type of cancer, are significantly positively associated with higher <italic>EMRAge</italic>. The highest hazard ratio was seen for all-cause mortality (HR = 1.10 with 95% CI [1.10, 1.11]), followed by stroke and COPD. For the odds ratio, type-2 diabetes (OR = 1.08 with 95% CI [1.08, 1.09]) showed the highest values, followed by CVD and COPD. The training and testing sets showed very similar results for all the health outcomes. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, participants with older <italic>EMRAge</italic> and older PhenoAge exhibit a markedly higher mortality risk than their younger counterparts. However, <italic>EMRAge</italic> more effectively discriminates between populations with high versus low survival probabilities, particularly among the oldest demographic. Furthermore, after adjusting for covariates, <italic>EMRAge</italic> has higher HR for all aging-related outcomes, with the exception of Type 2 Diabetes, when compared with <italic>PhenoAge</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development of <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic></title><p id="P11">After developing the <italic>EMRAge</italic> measure, we created a DNAm surrogate predictor of <italic>EMRAge, DNAmEMRAge</italic>, using DNA methylation data in an elastic net regression model (alpha=0.1) to select the CpGs that are most predictive of <italic>EMRAge</italic> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Method</xref>). The model for <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> included 1,097 CpG sites and age as predictors. A 25-fold cross validation showed an R<sup>2</sup>=0.827, suggesting good concordance in prediction. However, to further assess the agreement between <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and the <italic>EMRAge</italic>, the data was resampled to identify a new training data set composed of samples used to generate the model and samples not in the model (N=2,762).

We also found significant associations between traditional disease biomarkers and EBPs, including positive associations between EBP(glucose), EBP(HbA1c) and type 2 diabetes and negative associations between EBP(FEV1) and COPD. Together, the directionality of these EBPs and their associated disease states are consistent with clinical disease biomarkers in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). We observed more significant disease associations with EBPs in the MGB-ABC, which is likely due to the decreased health in MGB-ABC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Extended Table S1</xref>). We observed multiple associations between lifestyle factors and EBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Overall, the direction of effect for these associations was consistent with the known biological knowledge for the relationship between the actual metabolite, protein, and clinical measurements and the specific chronic disease and lifestyle features being tested.

Recognizing that both clinical measures that reflect overall health and the overall risk of death are critical yet distinct attributes of aging, we developed <italic>EMRAge</italic>, a hybrid aging phenotype that distills measures of both health and wellness and mortality into a single measure, as demonstrated by the robustness of <italic>EMRAge</italic>. We created a predictive model of time until death using 27 clinical EMR measures and mortality data from ~30,000 individuals in the MBG Biobank, spanning up to 30 years. When assessing mortality, we found that <italic>EMRAge</italic> demonstrates more accurate mortality risk prediction than either chronologic age or <italic>PhenoAge</italic> over a 10-year period. By creating multiple predictive models of <italic>EMRAge</italic> at different points in time in the EMR, we found strong reproducibility of <italic>EMRAge</italic> as an aging phenotype trained with common laboratory measures. We then created both DNAm and multi-omic biomarkers for aging for <italic>EMRAge, DNAmEMRAge</italic>, and <italic>OMICmAge</italic>. We demonstrate that both <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and <italic>OMICmAge</italic> have strong associations with chronic diseases and mortality and outperformed current DNAm aging biomarkers. Importantly, we observe strong associations with multiple age-related diseases across two diverse cohorts representing poor to moderate overall health (MGB-ABC) and moderate to excellent overall health (TruDiagnostic Biobank) as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Extended Table S1</xref>. Furthermore, we demonstrate marked improvements in the accuracy of both 5- and 10-year mortality risk. While both <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and <italic>OMICmAge</italic> have similar overall performance, through the use of EBPs, the generation of <italic>OMICmAge</italic> has expanded the predictive search space to consider age-relevant proteins, metabolites, and clinical data while being generated through DNA methylation data alone. This expanse of biological input via multiple omics provides new translational opportunities for identifying clinically-relevant interconnections that are central to the aging process.</p><p id="P18">To date, aging clocks have been generated predominantly using singular omic data types, with varying degrees of accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. It is clear that DNA methylation is one of the strongest predictors of aging phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>; however, other omic data - in particular proteomics and metabolomics - have also demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and add the distinct advantage of providing more tangible biological insights into the aging process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While the epigenome is a central mechanism for aging, the biological functions of epigenetic perturbations are often less clear to identify. In contrast, proteins capture a broad range of age-related biology, including immune function and inflammatory processes that are often well-understood and have clear clinical implications for treatment and/or modification. Changes in oxidative stress, hormones, and lipid profiles are just a few examples of the metabolic processes captured via the metabolome that reflect specific biology relevant for aging processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. As such, by including the metabolome, proteome, epigenome, and clinical data into predictive space for <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, our modeling approach captures the aging processes on multiple levels of systems biology that may further elucidate relevant biological aging functions.</p><p id="P19">One ongoing challenge with multi-omic approaches is the complexity of integrating different omic data together and the subsequent interpretation of the findings. Moreover, final biological models that include multiple omic data types are most often impractical from a clinical perspective due to high costs, logistical difficulties, and time delays from multiple assay measurements. While our development of <italic>OMICmAge</italic> incorporates metabolomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and clinical data, we distilled <italic>OMICmAge</italic> into a single DNAm based aging algorithm through the creation and inclusion of EBP for associated metabolites, proteins, and clinical measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The resulting algorithm, <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, showed several important improvements over previous epigenetic biomarkers. First, <italic>OMICmAge</italic> had stronger associations with all cause mortality relative to the other epigenetic based aging biomarkers we evaluated. We also observed increased accuracy of 10-year death prediction when compared to GrimAge. Notably, we observed strong associations between OMICmAge and major age-related diseases across two distinctly different cohorts. This consistency suggests its broad applicability to population outcomes in a clinical setting. Furthermore, the congruence in our findings remains noteworthy even when considering the use of both ICD9/10 codes and self-diagnoses for prevalent diseases. Besides, high levels of reproducibility has previously been an issue with epigenetic biomarkers which has traditionally only been improved through the inclusion of summary features such as principal components 22<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. With <italic>OMICmAge</italic> alone, we observed high ICCs, demonstrating the strong reproducibility of this metric.</p><p id="P20">The inclusion of EBPs into the feature space and predictive model for aging biomarkers expands the biological processes that may be represented in epigenetic aging biomarkers. Previously, these biomarkers have had difficulty explaining why aging biomarkers might be accelerated or decelerated in an individual. This has limited the utility of aging biomarkers in clinical practice, as the large heterogeneity in accelerated aging can manifest through many different biological mechanisms. Through the measurement of <italic>OMICmAge</italic> and EBPs, we may better identify the specific biology associated with aging that is captured via the metabolome, proteome, or other clinical factors and assess their overall relationship with <italic>OMICmAge</italic>. The strong correlations between EBPs and the biological measures they are predicting as well as the observed associations with relevant disease and lifestyle factors suggests that some EBPs capture important biology of what they are predicting through DNAm alone.</p><p id="P21">The relationships between aging and several of the protein and metabolite EBPs selected in <italic>OMICmAge</italic> are well-known. Albumin was selected as the largest weighted EBP in <italic>OMICmAge</italic> and is a protein known to decrease with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>OMICmAge</italic> also included the androsterone sulfate. Androsterone sulfate is a well-known androgenic steroid that declines with age in men and women due to andropause and menopause that was also retained as a EBP in <italic>OMICmAge</italic>. However, <italic>OMICmAge</italic> also selected proteins and metabolites EBPs with little or no known relationship with aging, such as ribitol which has been identified as a metabolite predictive of mortality but has very little mechanistic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that all EBPs and CPGs retained in the predictive model for <italic>OMICmAge</italic> are not causal; nor do they necessarily have the strongest overall associations with <italic>OMICmAge</italic>. They are merely included as predictive variables; further functional work and/or causal modeling via Mendelian Randomization is necessary to infer causality.</p><p id="P22">There are several limitations which need to be addressed in future work. First is the notion that, while our <italic>EMRAge</italic> model is predicated on EMR data, it’s essential to recognize that real-world data, such as EMRs, might not match the quality of data derived from clinical trials or surveys. This discrepancy arises because EMRs are primarily tailored for clinical care rather than research objectives. The quality of our data was influenced by three primary factors: 1) the absence of complete clinical lab values on the plasma collection date; 2) potential selection bias due to reliance on a singular data source, which could impact the broader applicability of <italic>EMRAge</italic>; and 3) the unavailability of lab test results in the initial study phase, attributed to the limited use of sophisticated analyzers. To mitigate the first concern, we calculated the median lab test value from a five-year span surrounding the collection date, ensuring a robust sample size for <italic>EMRAge</italic> development. The validity of our chosen <italic>EMRAge</italic> predictors was further reinforced by the near-perfect pairwise correlations among four reconstructed <italic>EMRAge</italic> estimates. To address the third limitation, we prioritized commonly conducted lab tests as <italic>EMRAge</italic> predictors. While this strategy might introduce a new selection bias, it effectively maximizes the sample size and maintains a manageable predictor pool. To circumvent the second limitation, we introduced <italic>OMICmAge</italic> and <italic>DNAmAge</italic> models, subsequently corroborating their strong associations with various aging-related diseases across two diverse cohorts. More work will continue to improve the accuracy and precision of EBPs. There are also important considerations with regard to omic data. The profiling platforms for both proteomics and metabolomics do not provide absolute quantification of proteins or metabolites which prevents EBPs from reflecting clinical levels of each variant. Refinement and the use of targeted assays will improve the accuracy of the EBPs. Furthermore, proteomic and metabolomic EBPs could be improved by regressing out known genetic proteinQTL and metaboliteQTL effects from the protein/metabolites levels prior to generating the EBPs. This should be done to preclude the signatures being driven by common SNP data that are invariant across the lifespan. Finally, there is room to expand upon the EBPs that were included into the feature space for <italic>OMICmAge</italic>, both with additional metabolites/proteins and also with other omics. While our omic profiling platforms covered a broad range of metabolites/proteins, we only included 396 EBPs with a significant correlation with <italic>EMRAge</italic>. Future analyses we will expand upon the EBPs in the training of <italic>OMICmAge</italic>. Finally, additional validation of <italic>OMICmAge</italic> across diverse populations will continue to highlight potential limitations in our phenotype. By identifying a healthy biobank cohort, we purposely selected a validation cohort that was distinctly different from MGB-ABC, which had more comorbidities than the general population. We found consistency in the observed associations in our findings, suggesting that <italic>OMICmAge</italic> is robust; however, further interrogation will continue to inform upon our overall understanding of this phenotype.</p><p id="P23">Overall, we believe the creation of <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> and <italic>OMICmAge</italic> represents a step forward in the evolution of improvement of epigenetic aging clocks. <italic>EMRAge</italic> is the first clinical biomarker based clock trained using EMR data to the phenotype of time until death. This provides a unique EMR resource to quantify aging and longevity in large EMR populations. Additionally, <italic>OMICmAge</italic> is the first epigenetic clock that integrates metabolomic, clinical, and proteomic data via EBPs.

We then evaluated the Pearson correlation of <italic>EMRAge</italic> to chronological age in the training and testing sets.</p><p id="P41">Since the <italic>EMRAge</italic> predictors (i.e., clinical phenotypes) were selected based on imputed data, we validated their robustness by re-training the algorithm at four different time points: Jan 1st of 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. During each time point, we replaced the values of the selected phenotypes with the median values of observations within a one-year timeframe, ensuring no overlap of data scans. To make a sensible comparison, we excluded the Charlson Comorbidity Index indicators because they are less sensitive to time in our data. As a result, we had 4 estimating equations trained using the same predictors but different data. Then we applied these equations to calculate the <italic>EMRAge</italic> value of the participants (N=11,673) with complete data of predictors around 1-year centered on January 1st of 2016, and then checked Pearson’s correlations among these four estimates.</p><p id="P42">We then assessed the relationship between <italic>EMRAge</italic> and both incident and prevalent aging-related health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, type-2 diabetes, COPD, depression, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and any type of cancer. We used the following criteria based from the patient EMRs for a positive diagnosis of an age-related health outcome: 1) at least 2 relevant ICD-9/10 codes were recorded in the patient’s EMR, and 2) the first and last dates of the relevant ICD codes should be at least 1 day apart. We estimated the incident risk of the <italic>EMRAge</italic> for all prospective adverse events in the Cox-PH model, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status and alcohol consumption. We also estimated the odds ratio of the <italic>EMRAge</italic> for all prevalent morbidities in the logistic regression model, adjusting for the same covariates.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Comparison of EMRAge and PhenoAge</title><p id="P43">We compared the incidence and prevalence of age-related health outcomes between <italic>EMRAge</italic> and PhenoAge by applying the same linear models described above with PhenoAge as the outcome. We calculated PhenoAge for our MGB Biobank cohort using the established toolkit, as initially proposed by Levine et al. (2018) and developed by Belsky and Kwon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Although PhenoAge is derived from eight clinical lab metrics, one specific parameter, C-reactive protein, is not frequently ordered in routine clinical settings. To maximize sample retention, we employed the same strategy to retain the median value of observations over a 5-year window centered on the plasma collection date. Following this imputation, our sub-cohort consisted of 17,093 participants, with 11,945 samples in the training set and 5,148 in the testing set.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Development of DNAmEMRAge</title><p id="P44">After developing the <italic>EMRAge</italic> measure, we next created a DNAm surrogate predictor of <italic>EMRAge</italic> using matched EPIC array data (<italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic>). To this end, we used the MGB-ABC cohort, which is a subset of the MGB Biobank that was created with the aim of possessing a proportionate aging biobank population. DNA Methylation was generated from a total of 4,803 samples using the EPICv1 array. To allow for training, samples were then selected for having <italic>EMRAge</italic> quantified and the availability of chronological age and sex information, which retained 3,451 samples. To develop <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic>, the normalized DNA methylation dataset was transposed so that CpG sites were considered features, and trained to <italic>EMRAge</italic> values. Using an 80-20 train to test split, the <italic>glmnet</italic> R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (version 4.1-8) was used to train a Gaussian penalized regression model using an alpha parameter of 0.1. Using a cross validation fold number of 25, an optimal lambda was selected based on the alpha parameter. Sex was classified as Gender_M (males) and Gender_F (females) using one-hot encoding, and was included as penalized features along with chronological age and the relative cell proportions of 12 immune cell types. All CpGs and the covariates mentioned were included as penalized features. Those features that showed a non zero coefficient were selected for the final model.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Development of Epigenetic Biomarker Proxies (EBP) models</title><p id="P45">To generate EBPs elastic net models, the normalized DNA methylation dataset was transposed to which the features were considered to be CpG sites. CpGs were not pre-filtered, and all CpGs that passed QC were used for training. Training was conducted to each significant clinical, metabolite, and protein group values. To ensure the best model associated with <italic>EMRAge</italic> was generated, the <italic>glmnet</italic> R package was used to train Gaussian penalized regression models across all measures. In order to maximize the number of CpGs, an alpha value of 0.1 was utilized. However, for three clinical values (smoking pack years, total bilirubin, and total cholesterol), an alpha of 0.5 was applied as they produced the highest correlation between predicted and observed values. Using a cross validation fold number of 25, an optimal lambda was selected at each alpha threshold and implemented to select the features. Sex was classified as Gender_M (males) and Gender_F (females) using one-hot encoding, and was included as penalized features along with chronological age. Features that showed a non zero coefficient were selected for each EBP. EBPs with a significant (p&lt;0.05) Pearson correlation greater than 0.2 were selected to include as features in the model to train <italic>OMICmAge</italic>.</p><p id="P46">We assessed the association between the EBPs and multiple chronic disease and lifestyle outcomes in both MGB-ABC and TruDiagnostic Biobank cohort. Specifically, we standardized all EBPs and utilized a generalized linear regression model with disease/lifestyle as the outcome and each individual EBP as the predictor variable, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and tobacco smoking.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Development of OMICmAge</title><p id="P47"><italic>OMICmAge</italic> was developed using the individuals used to develop <italic>DNAmEMRAge</italic> (N = 3,451), and applying a similar 80:20 train:test split. Penalized regression models using an alpha of 0.1 and the optimal lambda identified after a 25 cross-validation were used to train a single composite model among the train samples. For training, the following values were inputted as penalized features regression model and trained to <italic>EMRAge</italic>: all CpG sites present in the first and second generation of Illumina EPIC arrays; all selected clinical, metabolite, and proteins EBPs estimates from the training samples; relative estimates of 12 cell immune cell subtypes; and the demographic information (Age, sex, and BMI). For sex, a similar one-hot encoding was used to identify males (Gender_M) and females (Gender_F). Features which showed non-0 coefficients were kept in the final multivariate model.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Comparison of OMICmAge, EMRAge and Previous Clocks</title><p id="P48">For comparison of <italic>OMICmAge</italic> and <italic>EMRage</italic> clocks to previous methods of biological age prediction, we chose to analyze PCHorvath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, PCHannum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, PCPhenoAge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, PCGrimAge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and DunedinPACE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

We also employed the logistic regression model to assess the association between each clock and prevalent age-related diseases. Each model was adjusted for age, gender, race, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol drinking habits. Furthermore, to predict the 5-year and 10-year survival probability, we used a simple logistic regression model with a binary survival flag as the outcome and each clock as the sole predictor. We drew ROC curves and estimated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) based on this model.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>.
