potentially life-ruining conditions associated with numerous comorbidities. A previously-identified genetic risk association for psoriasis and PsA lies in a non-coding region at chromosome 1p36.23, and as such functional validation is required to determine the genetic mechanism contributing to psoriatic disease risk.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P2">rs11121131 – a variant in tight linkage with rs11121129, the lead GWAS variant for the 1p36.23 association – lies in a putative enhancer active in keratinocytes but not in immune cells. Promoter-capture Hi-C and H3K27Ac HiChIP showed keratinocyte-specific interactions between 1p36.23 and the <italic>TNFRSF9/PARK7/ERRFI1</italic> gene locus ˜200Kb upstream of the risk locus. Deletion of the enhancer in HaCat keratinocytes led to a reduction in transcript levels of the gene <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, a negative regulator of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling. CRISPR activation of the enhancer also affected <italic>ERRFI1</italic> levels, but paradoxically showed that steady-state activation led to repression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, accompanied by significant deposition of H3K27Me3 histone marks at both the enhancer and the <italic>ERRFI1</italic> gene locus. ERRFI1 levels were shown to be increased in inflamed skin from a mouse model of psoriasis, further suggesting its involvement in disease.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P3">These data indicate rs11121131 lies in an enhancer which modulates <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression in keratinocytes, providing a likely risk mechanism for the 1p36.23 risk association. <italic>ERRFI1</italic> represents a novel gene in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA – improving our understanding of these diseases – and the ERRFI1/EGFR signalling axis may therefore be a target for new treatment modalities for psoriatic disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P4">Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) in autoimmune diseases have shown that approximately 90% of genetic variants which contribute to disease risk lie in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Determining the mechanisms and target genes of these regulatory risk loci is inherently difficult compared to coding variants. Non-coding variants often affect the regulation of distal genes, and can do so by disruption of a variety of regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Furthermore, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the lead variant and other common variants at GWAS loci, determining the true causal variant for an association remains challenging.</p><p id="P5">Psoriasis (Ps) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, with an estimated prevalence of between 0.09% and 5.1% amongst populations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Approximately 1 in 5 psoriasis patients go on to develop an associated inflammatory arthropathy, termed Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), which is functionally distinct from other common arthritides such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These conditions can significantly affect quality of life and mortality, and are associated with several comorbidities such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P6">While GWAS and rare variant analyses have identified around 126 loci associated with psoriasis and around 20 directly associated with PsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), the functional mechanisms underlying many of these risk associations are still not fully understood. This is particularly true for PsA, where clinical heterogeneity and small cohort sizes have limited the power of GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and direct functional follow-up of genetic risk loci has been rare. While there are effective treatment strategies for psoriasis, these generally entail systemic immunosuppression – leaving patients at risk of systemic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). For PsA, response to conventional first-line treatments is poor compared to other arthritides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and therefore there is an unmet need for new and effective therapies. The clinical heterogeneity of PsA also makes diagnosis and early prediction of onset difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). It is likely that a greater understanding of the functional and genetic basis of these diseases will improve their treatment and diagnosis, and perhaps lead to new treatment modalities.</p><p id="P7">Advances in CRISPR-Cas technologies have revolutionised the analysis of non-coding risk loci, allowing for direct perturbation of DNA regions in their endogenous genomic context, to empirically validate variant-gene associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Here, we apply Hi-C and CRISPR-Cas technologies to the analysis of a psoriasis and PsA risk association at 1p36.23, tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11121129. This was identified via GWAS as a psoriasis risk locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and later replicated in a PsA cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) in studies utilising the Immunochip fine-mapping genotyping array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Through our analysis, we find that a SNP in tight LD with the lead GWAS variant lies in a putative keratinocyte-specific enhancer controlling expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> – a feedback inhibitor of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, we show that there is an increase in levels of ERRFI1 in inflamed skin from a mouse model of psoriasis, providing further evidence for the role of ERRFI1 in psoriatic inflammation. In doing so, this work functionally implicates <italic>ERRFI1</italic> – and its aberrant control in skin cells – as a potential novel gene in the pathogenesis of both Ps and PsA, providing a likely causal gene and variant for the 1p36.23 risk association for these conditions. By implicating <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, this study provides further evidence for the emerging importance of the EGFR signalling pathway in psoriasis and for the first time directly associates this pathway with PsA. These findings may have implication for the treatment of these conditions and may justify repositioning of previously approved EGFR inhibitors, which have been used extensively in cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA. Providing evidence for the roles of the EGFR/ERRFI1 signalling axis in psoriatic disease also furthers our general understanding of these conditions and may open new avenues for study of their pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>Bioinformatic analysis of 1p36.23 region</title><p id="P8">The lead SNP for the 1p36.23 risk association – rs11121129 – has previously been shown to be significantly associated with Ps and PsA susceptibility in several GWASs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To determine a lead causal SNP for the association, a prioritised list of variants was assembled by taking all SNPs in LD with rs11121129 with an R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8. This comprised a list of 10 variants spanning an interval of ˜13Kb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To identify SNPs which may lie in putative regulatory elements, prioritised SNPs were mapped against the genome with key epigenetic markers (ENCODE histone modifications (H3K27Ac, H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3), DNase hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>)) using the UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). While rs11121129 did not appear to overlap any key marks of regulatory chromatin, rs11121131 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9687) overlapped a DHS and peaks of H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac – the classical signature of an enhancer element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) – in a number of cell types. Of note, the site is highly enriched for H3K27Ac in the epithelial, endothelial and structural cell types in the ENCODE dataset (Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK), Human Skeletal Muscle Myoblasts (HSMM) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)) but shows minimal enrichment in bone marrow and lymphoid cell types (K562, GM12878) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This implied that the putative enhancer was active in endothelial and epithelial cells rather than immune cell types. To verify, the variants were also overlayed onto imputed group averages for H3K27Ac and ATAC-seq peaks from the EpiMap primary cell data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Again, the rs11121131 element was enriched for open chromatin and H3K27Ac histone marks in the Epithelial and Endothelial cell sample groups, but not the Blood &amp; T-cell sample group (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). ChromHMM chromatin state analysis from the EpiMap dataset also showed that the rs11121131 regulatory element was – on average – represented by highly active chromatin states (Enhancer A1 (EnhA1)) in epithelial and endothelial cell types, while it was most typically represented by inactive or bivalent chromatin states (Bivalent enhancer (EnhBiv) or Weakly repressed polycomb (ReprPCWk)) in blood and immune cell types (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that rs11121131 may be the causal SNP for the 1p36.23 locus, and that it lies in a putative regulatory element which is active in the epithelium and endothelium rather than immune cell types.</p><p id="P9">Analysis of the rs11121131 element with the JASPAR transcription factor (TF) binding site dataset (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), showed the presence of binding sites for transcription factors important in skin and epithelial proliferation and homeostasis, such as the Transcriptional Enhanced Associate Domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors – which are involved in EGFR and Hippo signalling in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) – and Krüppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4), which our group has previously linked to Ps and PsA in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). While rs11121131 does not appear to alter any core TF binding motifs, it flanks several predicted TF binding sites. These include E74-Like ETS Transcription Factor 1 (ELF1) – which has suggested involvement in both psoriasis and systemic sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) – and ETS Homologous Factor (EHF), which has been implicated as a TF of potential importance in Ps and OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that variants flanking core binding motifs can still significantly affect TF binding, likely by altering the local shape of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), and therefore rs11121131 may still have some functional impact on the binding of these TFs.</p><p id="P10">To identify putative target genes for this locus, we analysed the locus in previously published promoter capture Hi-C and H3K27Ac HiChIP datasets from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). These experiments were carried out in both the HaCat keratinocyte cell line and the MyLa CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell line. Both Hi-C and H3K27Ac HiChIP showed that – in HaCat cells – looping could be observed between the rs11121131 regulatory locus and a gene locus ˜200Kb away containing 3 genes: Tumour Necrosis Factor Super Family 9 (<italic>TNFRSF9</italic>), Parkinsonism Associated Deglycase (<italic>PARK7</italic>) and ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (<italic>ERRFI1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). All 3 of these genes are of potential functional interest in psoriatic disease. <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> is a key co-stimulatory receptor in activated T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), <italic>ERRFI1</italic> is a negative regulator of EGFR signalling, which is a major driver of proliferation and differentiation in keratinocytes and other related cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), and <italic>PARK7</italic> has potentially important roles in cell cycle control and oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Interestingly, this chromatin looping between the 1p36.23 risk region and the <italic>TNFRSF9/PARK7/ERRFI1</italic> locus was not observed in MyLa cells, further supporting the non-lymphoid nature of this risk locus. In the H3K27Ac HiChIP experiment in particular – which captures loops between active regions of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) – looping was observed between H3K27Ac peaks at the rs11121131 element and the promoter of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). No enrichment of H3K27Ac or chromatin looping was observed at the 1p36.23 region in MyLa cells. It is also of note that rs11121131, along with the other SNPs in tight LD, is an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) for <italic>ERRFI1</italic> in cultured human fibroblasts (GTEx V8, P = 4.4x10<sup>-13</sup>), which indicates that being homozygous for the minor allele of rs11121131 leads to decreased levels of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>. This eQTL prioritises <italic>ERRFI1</italic> as a candidate causal gene for the 1p36.23 risk association, but requires validation as to causal SNP, enhancer, cell type and mechanism. We therefore applied a range of CRISPR-Cas9 based techniques to functionally dissect the locus to determine both the true causal regulatory element and causal gene for this risk locus.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of putative regulatory regions within 1p36.23 in HaCat keratinocytes</title><p id="P12">Using classic cut-and-repair CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing we deleted the rs11121131 element in HaCat cells and measured the impact on surrounding gene activity.</p><p id="P13">Based on the ENCODE H3K27Ac signal from NHEK cells we decided to delete a 2.1kb region – 1kb either side of rs11121131 – to remove the whole putative regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We designed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) on either side of the region to be deleted, and both sgRNAs were delivered as <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpCas9) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes together with a plasmid homology donor template to replace the intervening region with a Cre-excisable puromycin resistance cassette via homology-directed repair (HDR) (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). After selection of edited cells via puromycin, transduction of cells with an AAV vector expressing Cre recombinase and GFP allowed removal of the puromycin cassette and single-cell sorting of transduced cells. This results in the deleted region being replaced by 134bp of sequence containing a single loxP site. The other allele in the cells may be repaired by a second HDR event or simply by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) driven deletion between the two sgRNAs.</p><p id="P14">For comparison, a region surrounding another SNP – rs7548511 – was selected for deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), as this SNP does not lie in a putative regulatory element.</p><p id="P15">6 single cell clones were selected for the rs11121131 deletion (rs111_HDR) and 5 single cell clones for the rs7548511 deletion (rs754_HDR). PCR to detect amplicons in the deleted region showed that 5/6 rs111_HDR clones had biallelic deletions, as did all 5 rs754_HDR clones (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). In each case, the samples were also assayed for the non-deleted region to help control for large deletions which may have removed both SNP regions. Removal of the Puromycin selectin cassette was confirmed by PCR. In all cases where biallelic deletion was observed, no amplicon of the size corresponding to an intact puromycin resistance cassette was observed (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The 5 homozygous deletion clones for each region were taken forward for Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. Cells were assayed for expression of <italic>TNFRSF9, PARK7, ERRFI1</italic> and <italic>RERE</italic> – the closest gene on the 3’ side of the 1p36.23 region. Solute Carrier Family 45 Member 1 (<italic>SLC45A1</italic>), another nearby gene, was discounted as it was undetectable by RT-qPCR in HaCat cells. Compared to normal HaCat cells, cells with the rs11121131 region deleted exhibited a significant ˜56% mean decrease in levels of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> mRNA across the 5 clones, which was not observed with the rs7548511 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). No significant effects were observed on the other 3 genes. It should be noted that <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> exhibited large, inconsistent changes in expression between clones. This is likely due to a low basal mRNA level of this gene, leading to small clonal differences in expression appearing more pronounced. This therefore is strong evidence that the enhancer containing the risk variant rs11121131 has a significant impact on the expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, and more so than the rs7548511 deletion.</p><p id="P17">As <italic>ERRFI1</italic> is a regulator of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, we decided to see how deletions affected expression of EGF-responsive gene across a time course when cells were stimulated with EGF. 3 rs111_HDR clones and 3 rs754_HDR clones were compared to normal polyclonal HaCat cells at 0, 2, 4 and 24hrs post-stimulation with 10ng/mL recombinant EGF. Clones where two different alleles could be seen on the agarose gel analysis were selected, as it was thought these were less likely to harbour unintended larger deletions. Cells were assayed by RT-qPCR for expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>, along with two EGF-responsive cell cycle regulators: <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>CCDN1</italic>. Data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model (nlme package in R), with fixed effects of deletion class (WT, rs111_HDR or rs754_HDR), time, and the interaction of deletion class and time. Sample ID was included as a random effect to minimise the impact of clonal differences not arising from the deletions. The rs11121131 deletion, but not the rs7548511 deletion, was shown to significantly lower expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> and significantly alter expression of <italic>MYC</italic> across the stimulation time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Although only the rs11121131-deleted clones impacted the expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> across the stimulation time course, deletion of rs7548511 did significantly alter expression of <italic>CCND1</italic> in the time course, which may point to some regulatory involvement. When the interaction effect of deletion class and time was analysed, it was discovered that both deletions significantly alter the way <italic>MYC</italic> expression changed between the 0hr and 24hr mark, which may again point to deletion of the rs7548511 region having some regulatory consequences, perhaps as a co-operative element in the control of the rs11121131 element or by altering local chromatin structure. For the time course samples, we also calculated the fold change in mRNA levels relative to controls at the 0hr timepoint for all genes. It was observed that both the rs11121131 deletion and the rs7548511 deletion significantly reduced levels of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, but other genes were not significantly altered at 0hr (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Taken together, these data suggest that the rs11121131 regulatory element contributes to the regulation of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression. Some regulatory changes were also observed upon deletion of the rs7548511 element in the time course, and this suggests it may also have regulatory roles affecting <italic>ERRFI1</italic> in certain circumstances, for instance here only detected 24hrs post-stimulation. Regardless, these observed effects were neither as pronounced nor as consistent as those observed with the rs11121131 element, positioning this putative enhancer as the likely driver of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> regulation in the region.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Perturbations of the 1p36.23 locus via CRIPSR activation and interference</title><p id="P19">As a complementary assay, we decided to perturb rs11121131 element and the rs7548511 region via CRISPR activation (CRIPSRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in HaCat cells.

In both cases, all 3 sgRNAs were designed to target the region deleted in previous experiments. sgRNAs were cloned into a lentiviral delivery vector co-expressing a Neomycin resistance gene (pLKO5.sgRNA.NeoR), to allow antibiotic co-selection of cells stably expressing the activator and the sgRNA. On-target sgRNAs were compared to two non-targeting sgRNA controls - the unmodified pLKO5.sgRNA.NeoR vector, in which there is a non-targeting spacer sequence to act as a placeholder for cloning (referred to as pLKO5.NeoR (empty) from here forward) and scrambled control sgRNA from the literature (“Scramble2”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We observed that targeting dCas9-p300 to the rs11121131 element led to significant upregulation of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), re-affirming the functional relationship between this putative enhancer and the gene. Similar upregulation of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> was also observed upon targeting the rs7548511 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), adding further support to the idea this may be a co-regulatory element at the 1p36.23 locus affecting <italic>ERRFI1</italic>.</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, we also observed milder upregulation of both other genes at this site – <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> and <italic>PARK7</italic> – in contrast to the enhancer deletion experiment which showed no effect on the activity of these genes.

As previous Capture Hi-C data shows a clear interaction between the 1p36.23 locus and the <italic>TNFRSF9</italic>/<italic>PARK7</italic>/<italic>ERRFI1</italic> locus, dCas9-p300 is possibly hyper-acetylating this region, thus driving expression of the other genes. This would also explain why we observed no significant effect on <italic>RERE</italic>, as no interactions between this gene and 1p36.23 were observed in the conformation capture assays. Indeed, others have seen similar non-specific regulatory effects when utilising dCas9-p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).

After validation of the activation potential of this cell line using a positive control sgRNA (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>), HaCat-dCas9-VPR cells were transduced with the same sgRNAs used in the dCas9-p300 experiment.</p><p id="P23">With the VPR system, no significant effects were observed on the expression of <italic>TNFRSF9, PARK7</italic> or <italic>RERE</italic> with the targeting sgRNAs, but there was a significant 35.8% to 48.4% decrease in <italic>ERRFI1</italic> transcript levels across all 3 sgRNAs at the rs11121131 locus, and a significant 46.7% to 53.6% decrease was observed across the 3 sgRNAs targeting the rs7548511 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Small but significant differences between the two control sgRNAs for <italic>ERRFI1</italic> and <italic>PARK7</italic> were also observed.

However, some significant increases in <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> expression were observed. While it should be observed that <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> is only detectable at low levels in HaCat cells, making accurate observations by RT-qPCR difficult, these may indicate some regulatory effect on <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> at this locus.

We performed ChIP-qPCR analysis of regions at both the <italic>ERRFI1</italic> promoter – both at the proximal promoter sequences of the main isoform (hereafter the main promoter) and also the sequences upstream of an annotated short isoform of the gene, which initiates partway through exon 2 – and the rs11121131 and rs7548511 SNP loci. ChIP was carried out for both H3K27Ac – a marker of active chromatin – and H3K27Me3, a reciprocal marker of transiently repressed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). For both rs11121131 and rs7548511, the sgRNA which had the most pronounced repressive effect was selected for ChIP-qPCR study, which was sgRNA 3 in each case.

This suggests that the regulatory effect observed from targeting rs7548511 was likely being driven through co-operative activation of the rs11121131 enhancer, either through a true regulatory mechanism or an artificial effect of the activator. Regardless, these data again point to the rs11121131 locus being the key regulatory element at 1p36.23. At the <italic>ERRFI1</italic> locus, a small significant decrease was observed at one of the main <italic>ERRFI1</italic> promoter sites when rs11121131 was activated, but no other significant changes in H3K27Ac were observed at the <italic>ERRFI1</italic> main promoter. Interestingly, a significant increase in H3K27Ac was observed at the short isoform promoter of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>. This isoform is not well described; however it should be noted that the TaqMan qPCR assay used for <italic>ERRFI1</italic> detection throughout this work does not target this isoform.</p><p id="P29">When H3K27Me3 signal was assayed, a large and significant deposition of H3K27Me3 marks could be observed across all target sites when dCas9-VPR was targeted to either the rs7548511 or the rs11121131 loci, substantially altering the ratio of H3K27Ac:H3K27Me3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with the repressive effect observed in the dCas9-VPR experiment. These results, taken together with the CRISPR activation and interference experiments, point to a more complex mechanism of regulation between the 1p36.23 risk locus and <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, and one which warrants further study.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Assessing the role of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> in skin inflammation <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic></title><p id="P30">We sought to investigate whether <italic>ERRFI1</italic> played a role in psoriatic skin inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> by utilising the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Psoriasis-like plaque formation was induced in C57BL/6 mice by topical application of 10mg Aldara cream (5% imiquimod W/W) to the ear. Onset of inflammation and development of psoriasis-like plaques were confirmed via scoring of skin thickening, scaling and redness, as well as flow cytometry analysis of immune cell infiltration and IL-17 production (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). Samples of inflamed skin were then taken from these mice for histological analysis to detect MIG-6 – the mouse homolog of ERRFI1 – alongside non-inflamed controls.</p><p id="P31">Immunofluorescent staining of ear skin sections from inflamed and non-treated animals revealed that inflamed tissue exhibited increased staining for MIG-6 in the epidermal layer when compared to non-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>; Additional File 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S11-S15</xref>).

These data provide evidence for the involvement of ERRFI1 in psoriatic inflammation. When considered in light of our GWAS and <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations – which suggest a genetic variant in a psoriasis-associated risk region modulates the expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> – these data strongly suggest a novel role for <italic>ERRFI1</italic> in the risk of psoriatic disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">The data presented here show that rs11121131 – a putative causal variant for the 1p36.23 Ps and PsA risk association – lies in an enhancer element which controls the expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>. While this regulatory region may have additional functions on other genes, perhaps indicating a role as a multi-gene enhancer, there is a clear and consistent effect on <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, strongly suggesting it is the main regulatory target of this risk locus.</p><p id="P34">Multiple strands of evidence suggest <italic>ERRFI1</italic> may be important in the development of Ps and PsA. <italic>ERRFI1</italic> knock-out mouse models exhibit skin phenotypes indicative of psoriasis, such as impaired differentiation and hyperplasia of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Furthermore, joint-restricted knockout and overexpression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> in mouse models led to osteoarthritis-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). It has also recently been shown that EGFR signalling – of which ERRFI1 is a key regulator – can enhance cytokine-driven IL-23 production in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), a key inflammatory modality in Ps. Thus, ERRFI1 and the EGFR signalling pathway are key to joint and skin homeostasis, and that disruption can produce phenotypes indicative of disease.</p><p id="P35">To provide further evidence for the role of ERRFI1 in psoriatic skin inflammation, we examined protein levels of the mouse ERRFI1 homolog MIG-6 in inflamed skin samples from Imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse models. We observed increased staining for MIG-6 in the epidermis of inflamed animals, suggesting an upregulation of this protein during the progression of psoriasis. Furthermore, the role of MIG-6/ERRFI1 as a negative feedback regulator of EGFR – and the fact that it is an early response gene for EGF signalling - further suggests increased levels of EGFR activation and signalling in the inflamed skin, driving the increased levels of ERRFI1. When we consider our experiments deleting the rs11121131 enhancer – which led to reduced <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression – along with the direction-of-effect of the GTEx eQTL observed for rs11121131 upon <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, it is likely that the risk variant at 1p36.23 reduces levels of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, thereby reducing the ability of ERRFI1 to inhibit EGFR signalling and leading to greater degrees of inflammation. However, in this study we were not able to directly assay the effect of different alleles of rs11121131 upon <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression, and therefore it is possible that rather than disrupting the enhancer in which it sits, rs11121131 may have a gain-of-function effect. However, given the known regulatory role of ERRFI1 upon EGFR, and the emerging role of EGFR signalling in psoriasis, the mechanism proposed above is still the most likely driver of psoriasis risk.</p><p id="P36"><italic>ERRFI1</italic> and the EGFR pathway have not previously been linked to the pathogenesis of PsA. For psoriasis, a study by Kubota and Suyama utilised public bioinformatic datasets to propose a link between <italic>ERRFI1</italic> and another SNP at 1p36.23 - rs72635708 – suggesting the SNP modulated AP-1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Their SNP is in tight LD with a SNP identified in a meta-analysis between European and Chinese population carried out by Yin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), and is only in moderate LD with rs11121131 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6331 in European populations, as calculated by LDProxy). It may be that this is another regulatory mechanism at the 1p36.23 locus, as it is likely that there are other regulatory elements which control <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression, perhaps in response to different stimuli. Regardless, while their study relies on bioinformatic approaches alone, our study provides direct functional evidence of the link between the rs11121131 enhancer element and <italic>ERRFI1</italic> expression. <italic>ERRFI1</italic> has also been linked to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and control of glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). These are both hallmarks of metabolic syndrome – the major co-morbidity of psoriatic disease – and suggest that the ERRFI1/EGFR regulatory axis may contribute to the link between these conditions.</p><p id="P37">An interesting observation of our study was that the region surrounding the SNP rs7548511 – which was initially chosen for comparison as it did not overlap any predicted regulatory elements – appeared to exhibit some regulatory effects upon <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, although these effects were milder and less consistent compared to perturbations of the rs11121131 locus. This result was unexpected, as the region immediately surrounding rs7548511 does not overlap any of the histone marks or ATAC-seq peaks normally associated with regulatory DNA in any of the sample groups from the EpiMap dataset. In the case of the CRISPRa data, ChIP-qPCR revealed that targeting either rs11121131 or rs7548511 led to H3K27 acetylation at rs11121131. This suggests that the regulatory effect of targeting rs7548511 with dCas9-VPR upon <italic>ERRFI1</italic> is likely facilitated through co-operative activation of the rs11121131 enhancer. In the case of the CRISPR deletion experiments, it is possible that deletion of the rs7548511 element also affects the regulatory properties of the rs11121131 enhancer, via altering the local chromatin environment and DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). It is also possible that the region surrounding rs7548511 represents a secondary member of an enhancer chain, its activity augmenting that of the main rs11121131 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). From these data, therefore, we cannot completely rule out the region surrounding rs7548511 as an independent or co-operative regulatory element. While the vast majority of cis-regulatory elements are marked by open chromatin, H3K27Ac histone marks or both, it has been shown that there can be rare exceptions to this rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). However, the rs11121131 enhancer both has the typical epigenetic profile of an active enhancer in keratinocytes, and exhibits a clear and reproducible effect on <italic>ERRFI1</italic> mRNA levels when perturbed. Therefore, it is most likely that the rs11121131 enhancer is the main driver of the Ps and PsA risk association at 1p36.23.</p><p id="P38">While we have provided strong evidence for the putative causal variant and target gene for the 1p36.23 risk association, the discrepancies in the direction-of-effect of regulation observed between the deletion experiment and the CRISPRa experiments point to a more complex regulatory mechanism at this locus which warrants further study. It is likely that the repressive effect and wide-spread deposition of H3K27Me3 observed in the dCas9-VPR experiments is due to some downstream negative feedback mechanism; a consequence of the steady-state activation of the locus. This mechanism may be better perturbed in future work using an inducible CRISPRa system, to allow temporal control of activation of the locus. We also hypothesise that the repression observed may be a consequence of activation of the long non-coding RNA at the 1p36.23 locus – <italic>LINC01714</italic> – as examples exist in the literature of non-coding RNAs exhibiting <italic>cis</italic>-repressive effects via recruitment of PRC2 and deposition of H3K27Me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). Important next steps would be to model the different variants of rs11121131 – either <italic>in vitro</italic> in cultured cells or <italic>in vivo</italic> in engineered mouse models – to determine the true mechanistic impact of this variant.</p><p id="P39">While this study was not able to elucidate the full regulatory mechanism of the 1p36.23 locus, or perturb the rs11121131 variant directly, the clear and reproducible effects of perturbing the rs11121131 enhancer on <italic>ERRFI1</italic> – combined with the strong evidence of links between the ERRFI1/EGFR axis and hallmark phenotypes of psoriatic disease - strongly suggests that the 1p36.23 risk association with psoriasis and PsA is driven by the rs11121131 enhancer and its control of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>. Furthermore, we have provided data which suggests a role for ERRFI1 in skin inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>, further strengthening the link between psoriatic disease and ERRFI1. This is a novel gene in the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and PsA and may offer new therapeutic opportunities to target the EGFR/ERRFI1 pathway in these diseases. Inhibitors of EGFR are used in treatment of a number of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and it is possible these drugs can be repositioned to treat PsA and Ps. Indeed, EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi) have been shown to be effective at treatment of collagen-induced arthritis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>), and psoriasis patients undergoing EGFRi treatments for cancer exhibited marked improvement in their psoriasis lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). More generally, the novel association of <italic>ERRFI1</italic> with PsA may help broaden our understanding of its pathogenesis. Functional studies of PsA have lagged behind those of other rheumatic conditions such as RA, which may explain the comparatively poor treatment responses in this condition. It is likely that other components of this signalling pathway are also important in PsA risk, and further exploration of the EGFR/ERRFI1 axis is therefore warranted in the disease.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P40">This study has shown that rs11121131, a SNP in tight LD with the lead GWAS SNP at 1p36.23, lies in an enhancer element which controls the expression of <italic>ERRFI1</italic>, and that ERRFI1 is upregulated during psoriasis-like inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In doing so, this work implicates <italic>ERRFI1</italic> as a novel gene in the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and provide a likely causal gene and variant for the 1p36.23 risk association for these conditions.

This work may broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease, providing a starting point for further investigation of the ERRFI1/EGFR signalling axis in psoriasis and PsA. These investigations may facilitate the development of new treatments targeting the EGFR/ERRFI1 signalling pathway or enable drug repositioning of current EGFR inhibitors.
