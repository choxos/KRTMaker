Here, we performed multiscale investigations to reveal virological features of newly emerging EG.5.1 variant. Our phylogenetic-epidemic dynamics modeling suggested that two hallmark substitutions of EG.5.1, S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T, are critical to the increased viral fitness. Experimental investigations addressing the growth kinetics, sensitivity to clinically available antivirals, fusogenicity and pathogenicity of EG.5.1 suggested that the virological features of EG.5.1 is comparable to that of XBB.1.5. However, the cryo-electron microscopy reveals the structural difference between the spike proteins of EG.5.1 and XBB.1.5. We further assessed the impact of ORF9b:I5T on viral features, but it was almost negligible at least in our experimental setup. Our multiscale investigations provide the knowledge for understanding of the evolution trait of newly emerging pathogenic viruses in the human population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Omicron</kwd><kwd>EG.5.1</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd><kwd>ORF9b</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">XBB is a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage emerged in the summer of 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. As of October 2023, some XBB sublineages bearing the F486P substitution in the spike protein (S; S:F486P), such as XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16, have become predominant worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/">https://nextstrain.org/</ext-link>). Because S:F486P significantly increased pseudovirus infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, it is assumed that the spread of F486P-bearing XBB subvariants is attributed to the increased infectivity from S:F486P.</p><p id="P3">Since July 2023, EG.5.1 (also known as XBB.1.9.2.5.1) has rapidly spread in some Asian and North American countries. On August 9, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In fact, our recent study showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a greater effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>) compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that EG.5. has the potential to spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants.</p><p id="P4">EG.5.1 bears two evolutionary characteristic mutations, S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T, absent in earlier predominant lineages such as XBB.1.5. These two substitutions convergently occurred in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/">https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/</ext-link>). Importantly, it has been reported that convergent mutations tend to increase viral fitness—the ability of virus to spread in the human population, quantified with the effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In fact, we have shown that the S:F456L in EG.5.1 confers resistance to the humoral immunity induced by XBB breakthrough infection (BTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This result suggests that S:F456L contributes to the increased viral fitness of EG.5.1 by enhancing immune evasion from the humoral immunity elicited by XBB BTI.</p><p id="P5">SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b is a viral antagonist that hampers the innate immunity to induce type I interferon (IFN-I) production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.

Of these, S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T are documented as convergent substitutions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/">https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/</ext-link>). ORF9b:I5T is already present in XBB.1.9, the ancestral lineage of EG.5.1, whereas S:F456L is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). EG.5.1.1, a major descendant lineage of EG.5.1, has an additional ORF1b:D54N substitution compared with EG.5.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To test whether the convergent substitutions S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T have contributed to the increased viral fitness of EG.5.1, we performed phylogenetic and epidemic dynamics analyses using the genome surveillance data obtained from GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gisaid.org/">https://gisaid.org/</ext-link>). First, we traced the occurrence events of ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions throughout the diversification of XBB lineages and investigate how often each substitution has occurred, which is likely to indicate the effect of substitution on viral fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. We reconstructed a phylogenetic tree of XBB lineage including 248 PANGO lineages. Subsequently, we inferred the state of presence or absence of ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions in ancestral nodes and pinpointed where each substitution occurred. We detected three and five occurrence events of ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions, respectively, supporting that these substitutions have occurred convergently during the XBB diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Considering the evolutionary path of EG.5 lineage, the ORF9b:I5T substitution occurred first in a common ancestor of XBB.1.9, XBB.1.16, and XBB.1.22 lineages, which share this substitution. The S:F456L substitution occurred later in the most recent common ancestor of EG.5 lineage.</p><p id="P9">Next, we estimated the effect of ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions on viral fitness (i.e., R<sub>e</sub>) using a Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic model, established in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This model can estimate the effect of an amino acid substitution on R<sub>e</sub> and predict the R<sub>e</sub> of a SARS-CoV-2 variant as a linear combination of the effects of individual substitutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. First, we retrieved amino acid substitution profiles of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage circulated in the USA from December 1, 2022, to September 15, 2023, and classified the SARS-CoV-2 into haplotypes, groups of viruses sharing a unique substitution profile. These resulted in 470 haplotypes according to the profile of 283 substitutions in the 12 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We then estimated the effect of each substitution on R<sub>e</sub> and predicted the R<sub>e</sub> of each haplotype using our model. Our modeling analysis suggests that ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions have the strongest and second-strongest positive effects on R<sub>e</sub> among the substitutions we investigated, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), whereas S:Q52H and ORF1b:D54N substitutions have a weaker positive effect on R<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that haplotypes with ORF9b:I5T or S:F456L substitutions tend to show higher R<sub>e</sub>. In particular, haplotypes with both ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L substitutions, including EG.5, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1 (XBB.1.9.1.1.5.1), exhibit the highest R<sub>e</sub> among the haplotypes we investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). FL.1.5.1 is a descendant lineage of XBB.1.9 harboring S:F456L substitution which is independent of the EG.5 lineage. Altogether, our analyses suggest that the increased viral fitness of EG.5.1 is primarily due to the ORF9b:I5T and S:F456L convergent substitutions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Growth kinetics of EG.5.1 and EG.5.1.1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P10">To investigate the growth kinetics of EG.5.1 and EG.5.1.1 in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture systems, we inoculated clinical isolates of Delta, XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, and EG.5.1.1 into multiple cell cultures.

These viruses were inoculated into human iPSC-derived lung organoids, a physiologically relevant model, and treated with three antiviral drugs.

The EG.5.1 S ectodomain was reconstructed as two closed states and a 1-up state at resolutions of 2.50 Å, 2.89 Å and 3.34 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The two closed states in EG.5.1 show structural differences in the orientation of the RBD and the loop structure at the protomer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), as observed in XBB.1 and XBB.1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, therefore, these two closed states were defined as closed-1 and closed-2, respectively. In addition, a 1-up state was also observed in EG.5.1, which could not be observed in XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. XBB variant was derived from recombination of BJ.1.1 with BM.1.1.1, a descendant of BA.2.75<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, two closed and a 1-up states are observed in BA.2.75 S like EG.5.1 S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, from BA.2.75 through XBB to EG.5.1, there exist conformational differences among the representative structures of the spike protein of these variants. To examine the reason for transition of spike protein conformation, we compared the structures of XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While closed-1 state of XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 share a nearly identical overall structure, the relative orientation of RBD in the closed-2 state show a minor displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). EG.5.1 has the Q52H substitution in the NTD and the F456L substitution in the RBD compared to XBB.1.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1D-E</xref>), especially the F456L substitution is located at the interface between protomers in the closed-2 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). When focusing on the interactions of F456L, in XBB.1.5 S, F456 was located at a distance of 3.8 Å from P373, whereas in EG.5.1, F456L and P373 exhibited a distance of 10.1 Å, thus resolving hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This structural difference suggests that the closed-2 state of EG.5.1 exhibits a weaker RBD packing compared to XBB.1/XBB.1.5, allowing for EG.5.1 S to more likely transit to the 1-up state. It has been previously reported that the F486 residue stabilizes the 1-up conformation by interacting to the up RBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

Although some values of Omicron subvariants were different from that of WH1 with statistically significance, the anti-IFN-I activity was not clearly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We then experimentally addressed the growth kinetics, sensitivity to clinically available antiviral compounds, fusogenicity and pathogenicity of EG.5.1 and EG.5.1.1 variants. Our experimental results suggest that the virological features of EG.5.1 and EG.5.1.1 are almost comparable to that of XBB.1.5. We further reveal the structure of EG.5.1 S by cryo-EM and describe the structural difference between the EG.5.1 S and XBB.1.5 S. Moreover, we assessed the impact of ORF9b:I5T on the function of IFN-I antagonism by ORF9b, while its impact was negligible at least in our experimental setup. Furthermore, the experiments using the recombinant EG.5.1 viruses by reverse genetics showed that the impact of ORF9b:I5T on viral growth is not observed.</p><p id="P26">We have shown the evidence suggesting that the fusogenicity of S protein in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultures (particularly in Calu-3 cells) is closely associated with viral intrinsic pathogenicity in hamsters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with our assumption, we demonstrated the fusogenicity of EG.5.1 S is comparable to that of XBB.1.5 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the infection experiment using airway-on-a-chip showed that the potential of EG.5.1 to invade epithelial-endothelial barrier, which reflects viral fusogenicity, is similar to that of XBB.1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Moreover, in the experiments using hamsters, the intrinsic pathogenicity of EG.5.1 is also indistinguishable to that of XBB.1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results suggest that the viral virulence is not modulated by the mutations accumulated in the EG.5.1 genome when compared to XBB.1.5.</p><p id="P27">The ACE2 binding assay <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that the K<sub>D</sub> value of EG.5.1 S RBD is significantly higher than that of XBB.1.5 S RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we have previously found that the pseudovirus infectivity of EG.5.1 is also lower than that of XBB.1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, the growth kinetics of EG.5.1 does not outweigh that of XBB.1.5, while its extent is dependent on the cell types used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, in hamsters, the spreading efficiency of EG.5.1 is comparable to XBB.1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These observations suggest that the growth capacity of EG.5.1 is similar to that of XBB.1.5. On the other hand, as explained in the Introduction, recent studies including ours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> showed that EG.5.1 exhibits significantly greater immune resistance to the humoral immunity induced by XBB breakthrough infection than XBB.1.5, and the S:F456L substitution is responsible for this immunological phenotype. Altogether, these observations suggest that the epidemic spread of the EG.5.1 lineage by outcompeting an S:F486P-bearing XBB subvariants including XBB.1.5, is not due to increased viral growth capacity, but rather to increased immune evasion capacity from the humoral immunity induced by XBB breakthrough infection.</p><p id="P28">The structure of EG.5.1 S alone revealed in this study provides an opportunity to discuss the impact of the substitutions in S proteins occurring in variants since BA.2.75 on a series of conformational changes from BA.2.75 through XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 to EG.5.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It has been reported that the F486 residue stabilizes the 1-up state by hydrophobic interactions with the up RBD in the 1-up conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In XBB.1 S, the 1-up conformation is not optimal due to F486S substitution, a less bulky and hydrophilic residue. On the other hand, XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 S acquired commonly the F486P substitution, these variants are thought to have the potential to stabilize an up RBD conformation, but only EG.5.1 S was reconstructed in the 1-up conformation. This difference between XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 is probably related to the F456L substitution, which resolved the interaction between protomers in closed 2 in EG.5.1 and facilitated the transition from the closed state to the 1-up one. The amino-acid substitution-dependent conformational transitions illuminated by this study provide an understanding of metastable pre-fusions state of the spike protein in omicron subvariant, BA.2.75, XBB.1, XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1.</p><sec id="S14"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="P29">Our epidemic dynamics modeling analysis suggests that S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T enhance viral fitness in XBB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure. 1</xref>). S:F456L likely boosts viral fitness by improving the ability to escape humoral immunity induced by vaccination and natural infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. On the contrary, we failed to uncover any notable effects of ORF9b:I5T on the viral properties we examined, including viral replication in cell lines or airway organoids, or the inhibition of the IFN pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure. 7</xref>). This discrepancy regarding the ORF9b:I5T might be attributed to two potential explanations. First, the observed effect of ORF9b:I5T on viral fitness could be a false positive. However, this seems less likely since the positive effect of ORF9b:I5T on viral fitness was supported by two independent methods: our approach and a method developed by Bloom et al., which infers the fitness effect of a mutation based on its convergent acquisition level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The second explanation is that ORF9b:I5T might affect viral properties related to fitness, which we did not investigate experimentally. Indeed, our understanding of which properties of the virus are closely related to viral fitness is currently limited. For a deeper understanding of the mechanism by which the virus boosts its transmission potential, characterizing mutations in non-S proteins including ORF9b:I5T would be crucial.</p><p id="P30">In sum, our multiscale investigation revealed the virological characteristics of a most recently spreading SARS-CoV-2 variant, EG.5.1, particularly focusing on the effects of hallmark substitutions in the S (F456L) and non-S (ORF9b:I5T) proteins.
