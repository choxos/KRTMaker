These sperm have distinct morphologies, unique functions, and different proteomes. Their production is highly regulated, however very few genes with specific roles in production of one or other morph have been described. We present the first comparative transcriptomics study of precursors of eupyrene and apyrene sperm to identify genes potentially implicated in regulating or enacting the distinct differentiation programmes. Differentially expressed genes included genes with potential roles in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle and sperm morphology. We identified gene duplications generating paralogues with functions restricted to one or other morph. However phylogenetic analysis also revealed evolutionary flexibility in expression patterns of duplicated genes between different Lepidopteran species. Improved understanding of Lepidopteran reproduction will be vital in targeting prevalent pests in agriculture, and on the flip side, ensuring the fertility and thus survival of pollinator populations in response to environmental stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process that results in the generation of mature sperm with highly specialised morphology. In insects, the process typically involves continued production of sperm throughout the adult life of the male, sustained by a male germline stem cell population. Stem cell divisions generate spermatogonia committed to differentiation, which then undergo mitotic amplification before differentiating into primary spermatocytes and switching to a meiotic cell cycle. Post-meiotic morphological changes include spermatid elongation, nuclear reshaping, mitochondrial reorganisation, and growth of the axoneme. Each spermatogonium is enveloped by somatic cyst cells that form a squamous epithelium within which the germline cells differentiate. In Lepidoptera each male makes two distinct sperm types, a phenomenon known as sperm heteromorphism (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) for detailed reviews). Each ejaculate contains both fertilising eupyrene sperm and non-fertilising apyrene sperm. Eupyrene spermatogenesis initiates first, during larval life. In early pupal development a hormonally driven switch intiates apyrene spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Eupyrene and apyrene sperm are morphologically very distinct. Eupyrene sperm are longer, they remain bundled together in the ejaculate, only becoming separate within the female genital tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The shorter, apyrene, sperm lack both a nucleus and an acrosome, explaining their inability to fertilise eggs. Both sperm morphs are motile, and this motility is required for normal reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Consistent with these dramatic differences in the final sperm, the process of spermatogenesis differs between the two morphs. Early primary spermatocytes are bi-potential; those in larval testes proceed along the eupyrene differentiation programme. Early pupae produce an as yet unidentified hormone, termed ‘apyrene spermatogenesis inducing factor’ (ASIF). On receipt of ASIF, spermatocytes that are still bi-potential switch programme and eventually differentiate into apyrene sperm. Already committed eupyrene spermatocytes do not respond to ASIF, and remain on their eupyrene developmental trajectory. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Despite their different potential, primary spermatocytes on the two pathways are not morphologically distinguishable until they initiate the meiotic divisions.</p><p id="P5">Production of eupyrene spermatocytes involves a conventional meiosis I spindle, with robust microtubule arrays, a well-formed metaphase plate, and segregation of homologous chromosome in anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In contrast, the meiosis I spindle in cells destined to become apyrene sperm is much less robust, with reduced microtubule arrays and a poorly defined metaphase plate. There is extensive chromosome non-disjunction leading to aneuploid cells with dispersed micronuclei. As eupyrene spermatids elongate, the nuclei cluster at one end of the cyst, become needle-shaped and intimately associate with the overlying cyst cell. In contrast, micronuclei in apyrene spermatids cluster in the middle of the elongating cyst and are gradually degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Spermatid individualisation of both morphs involves peristaltic squeezing of cyst cells; removing excess cytoplasm from all spermatids, and forcing elimination of nuclei from apyrene spermatids.</p><p id="P6">The final product of this deliberate and orchestrated process is two morphs with different morphologies made with different proteomes, comprising some shared proteins and some proteins unique to one or other morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).

Based on the name of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homologue, <italic>wampa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we named the largely apyrene-enriched paralogue (LOC113513840) <italic>wimpa</italic>, and the eupyrene-enriched paralogue (LOC113515144) <italic>wompa</italic>.</p><p id="P26">HCR-FISH revealed the expression patterns of <italic>wompa</italic> (LOC113515144; eupyrene) and <italic>wimpa</italic> (LOC113513840; apyrene) in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larval and pupal testes. This confirmed a general pattern of high expression of <italic>wompa</italic> in larval spermatocytes, and high expression of <italic>wimpa</italic> in pupal spermatocytes, as expected from phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The clear upregulation of <italic>wimpa</italic> in pupal testes vs larval testes also corroborated the RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4, S5</xref>). HCR-FISH revealed <italic>wimpa</italic> and <italic>wompa</italic> co-expression in a small number of pupal cysts, predicted to be spermatocyte cysts committed to the eupyrene pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). <italic>wompa</italic> was relatively highly expressed across all primary spermatocyte samples in our RNA-seq dataset, with higher variation between pupal spermatocyte cyst samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). This could indicate that both <italic>wompa</italic> and <italic>wimpa</italic> paralogues are important in later stages of eupyrene sperm development, whilst <italic>wimpa</italic> alone is necessary for apyrene sperm development.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Divergent expression of β<italic>-tubulin</italic> family members in Lepidoptera</title><p id="P27">From our RNA-seq data, another gene significantly upregulated in pupal spermatocytes was a β-tubulin gene (LOC113522729) of unknown genealogy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). Many β-tubulin genes (e.g. LOC113519435) were also amongst the most highly expressed in the spermatocyte transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data File 3</xref>). β-tubulin proteins, along with α-tubulin, constitute the microtubule cytoskeleton, which acts as a structural framework in cells; crucial for cell morphology, cell division, intracellular transport and the axoneme. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, there are five β-tubulin genes. β<italic>2</italic> (β<italic>-tubulin 85D)</italic> is exclusively expressed in the male germline, is required for successful meiosis and axoneme elongation in spermatogenesis, and is abundant in the sperm proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). β<italic>-tubulin 65B</italic> is also expressed exclusively in the male germline, but its role in spermatogenesis has not been determined, and the protein has not been detected in the sperm proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). β1 (β<italic>-tubulin 56D</italic>) is expressed in both soma and male germline, and detected in the sperm proteome, while expression of both β3 (β<italic>-tubulin 60D</italic>) and β4 (β<italic>-tubulin 97EF</italic>) is restricted to the soma. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> has a similar β-tubulin gene tree, but has evolved two β4-tubulin paralogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, four β-tubulin family members have described, including two somatic β1-tubulin paralogues (β1a and β1b), testis-specific β2-tubulin and somatic β3-tubulin. Whittington <italic>et al.</italic> (2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) identified six β-tubulin proteins in the mature sperm proteomes of both <italic>M. sexta</italic> and <italic>D. plexippus,</italic> with differing sperm morph specificity. In <italic>M. sexta,</italic> one β-tubulin protein was apyrene-enriched while the remaining β-tubulin proteins were detected in both sperm morphs. Contrastingly, in <italic>D. plexippus,</italic> two eupyrene-specific β-tubulin proteins were identified, alongside one apyrene-specific β-tubulin protein and three shared proteins. We used phylogenetic analysis to resolve the evolutionary relationships of the sperm-morph specific β-tubulin proteins detected by Whittington <italic>et al</italic> (2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and the apyrene-specific β-tubulin <italic>G. mellonella</italic> gene.</p><p id="P28">A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of β-tubulin protein sequences is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. Identification of the major subfamilies was via published assignments and confirmed by analysis of the C-terminal sequences (Fig. S3). Before the divergence of Lepidoptera and Diptera, a duplication of the ancestral β<italic>4-tubulin</italic> gene (green circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), produced β<italic>4-tubulin</italic> (green box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), and β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> (red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Subsequent Lepidopteran-specific gene duplications expanded the β4<italic>-tubulin</italic> family. The apyrene-specific β-<italic>tubulin</italic> gene (LOC113522729) from our RNA-seq (red asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) is a semi-orthologue of the poorly characterised, germline-specific β<italic>-tubulin 65B</italic> from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (CG32396); both are β<italic>4B-tubulins</italic>. Whilst many β<italic>4-tubulin</italic> genes had low expression in the male germline, almost all the Lepidopteran β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> paralogues were highly expressed in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) (red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The exception was <italic>M. sexta</italic> β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> (LOC115455595), which was assumed to be somatic or lowly expressed due to absence from the sperm proteomic dataset. In contrast to <italic>wimpa/wompa</italic>, the β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> paralogue lineages in Lepidoptera have not evolved clear apyrene– or eupyrene-enriched expression patterns, suggesting that the β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> paralogues have independently acquired specific functions in sperm morph differentiation.</p><p id="P29"><italic>Β1-tubulin</italic> and <italic>Β3-tubulin</italic> family members in Lepidoptera also demonstrated a divergence in expression patterns between Lepidopteran species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data File 3</xref>). In contrast, almost all β<italic>2-tubulin 85D</italic> orthologues were expressed in the germline, with <italic>G. mellonella</italic> β<italic>2-tubulin 85D</italic> genes (LOC113519435, LOC113522728) showing very high expression levels in all spermatocyte samples (purple cluster, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data File 3</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there are two β<italic>2-tubulin 85D</italic> paralogues in Lepidoptera, however the bootstrap value is relatively low for this gene duplication (purple circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P30">HCR-FISH analysis confirmed the results from the RNA-seq analysis. β<italic>2-tubulin 85D</italic> orthologue (LOC113519435) expression was detected at very high levels in spermatocytes and spermatids in both larval and pupal testes, suggesting that it is required for differentiation of both sperm morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A &amp;B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). In contrast, <italic>in situ</italic> staining of apyrene-specific β4B-tubulin (LOC113522729) in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> testes revealed increased expression in pupal spermatocytes and spermatids vs larval spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C &amp; D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). A low expression level of the predicted apyrene-specific β4B-tubulin (LOC113522729) was detected by HCR-FISH in a subset of eupyrene primary spermatocyte cysts in the larval testes, with RNA-seq analysis also detecting a very low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). This suggests that β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> (LOC113522729) is of particular importance in apyrene sperm differentiation in <italic>G. mellonella</italic>. Overall, phylogenetic and expression analysis of β<italic>-tubulin</italic> genes revealed Lepidopteran-specific gene duplications which have not been previously identified. These β<italic>-tubulin</italic> duplications generated a suite of genes available for specialisation for different sperm morphs, but there was surprising variability of expression patterns of paralogues with respect to sperm morph between different moth and butterfly species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Sperm heteromorphism is present in almost all Lepidoptera, and the production of two sperm morphs is essential for fertility of moths and butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The non-fertilising morphs are generated through precise, regulated processes, rather than through a variety of defective deviations from “normal”. Whilst the proteomes of the sperm morphs contain many shared proteins, eupyrene and apyrene sperm also contain unique, specialised proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). How these differences are established earlier in spermatogenesis has not previously been described. In principle, production of two similar, but distinct, final cell morphologies can depend on genes i) expressed in both lineages, with the same timing but different absolute levels; ii) expressed exclusively in one or other lineage; iii) expressed in both lineages but with different temporal dynamics; iv) duplicated and subfunctionalised, such that the required protein function is provided by distinct isoforms. We validated examples of i (<italic>Taf4</italic>), iii (<italic>sxl</italic>) and iv (<italic>wompa/wimpa</italic>, and β<italic>-tubulin</italic>). With our sequencing data we cannot be sure of genes <italic>exclusively</italic> in one or other lineage, however we did find examples of single copy genes with dramatic differences in absolute expression level between cyst types. LOC113516308, a gene conserved across arthropods, with no known or predicted function had &gt;16 fold higher expression in larval spermatocytes than pupal spermatocytes. Meanwhile, LOC116412852, which encodes a predicted plasma-membrane associated CAP-domain containing protein conserved across Lepidoptera, had &gt;1000 fold higher expression in pupal spermatocytes than larval spermatocytes.</p><p id="P32">Our data confirms differential transcription of many genes, thus confirming that the unique sperm morphology is underpinned by differential transcription at the spermatocyte stage. Higher or lower expression of the general transcription factor Taf4, along with differential expression of other transcriptional regulators, may be implicated in establishing the distinct transcriptomes. Persistence of <italic>Sxl</italic> expression in the apyrene spermatocytes could affect RNA stability or could result in production of alternative splice variants in these cells. Among the DEGs we found several that could be regulate or enact the alternative meiosis seen in the apyrene differentiation programme (e.g. spindle proteins, cell cycle checkpoint proteins, meiotic recombination factors). Additionally, our DEG list includes many more examples of genes likely implicated in the differential elongation and final morphology. Validation of our RNA-seq dataset via phylogenetic analysis and identification of orthologous genes in published proteomic/ transcriptomic datasets demonstrates the predictive nature of early transcriptomic differences on the final proteomes and thus morphology of the mature sperm.</p><p id="P33">Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of gene families in Lepidoptera via gene duplications, allowing for the paralogues to adopt specialised functions in producing the sperm heteromorphism phenotype. For example, duplication of the ancestral sperm axoneme component <italic>Ccdc63</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), produced two paralogous genes with distinct expression patterns in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larval and pupal testes. They are predicted to play unique roles in eupyrene and apyrene sperm development, and have been termed <italic>wompa</italic> and <italic>wimpa</italic>, respectively. Ccdc63 has been duplicated to generate paralogues specifically for somatic axonemes and sperm axonemes in both Lepidoptera and Diptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), in addition to the sperm morph duplication in Lepidoptera. It may provide subtly different, but evolutionarily important, functionality to these distinct motile cilia, and comparative functional studies could be very interesting in the future.</p><p id="P34">A similar expansion of the well-known β<italic>-tubulin</italic> gene family was also observed in the Lepidopteran species studied. Lepidopteran-specific gene duplications of ancestral β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> and β<italic>2-tubulin</italic> genes has led to many germline-enriched β<italic>-tubulin</italic> genes. We, again, predict that these paralogues have undergone sub-functionalisation to play key roles in sperm heteromorphism evolution, and in the normal function of the different morphs. Although there is evidence for sperm-morph enriched expression for a small number of β<italic>-tubulin</italic> genes, overall β<italic>-tubulin</italic> paralogues have not evolved a specific bias towards fertile or infertile sperm development, as found for <italic>wimpa/wompa</italic> paralogues. This suggests that exact function of the β<italic>4B-tubulin</italic> and β<italic>2B-tubulin</italic> paralogues in enacting or regulating dichotomous spermatogenesis varies between Lepidopteran species, revealing evolutionary flexibility in the co-option of genes in the process.</p><p id="P35">Interestingly, our RNA-seq analysis found a higher number of upregulated genes in pupal spermatocytes compared to larval, which contrasts to previous findings that apyrene sperm possess a <italic>less</italic> diverse proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). While some of the differences could be species-specific, we note that Whittington et al. (2019) investigated mature sperm proteomes, whilst we have focused on the earlier spermatocyte transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). During dynamic processes, such as differentiation, there may be only a moderate correlation between transcript and protein levels due to post-transcriptional regulation, providing a possible explanation for the observed disconnect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Increased expression of regulatory proteins, that are required at higher levels in the apyrene spermatocytes during spermatogenesis, but are not included in the final mature sperm, could also contribute to the observed pattern. Furthermore, we hypothesise that the higher transcriptomic diversity of developing apyrene sperm may make evolutionary sense in an extension of the “out of the testis” phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>); apyrene spermatocytes may provide a playground to experiment with newly evolved genes in an environment with lower functional constraints in comparison to the fertilising eupyrene sperm. Differential signatures of selection have already been described for proteins differentially expressed between morphs, with apyrene sperm-specific proteins showing little evidence of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Our Lepidopteran model of sperm heteromorphism, the wax moth <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>, is an emerging model organism within the life sciences, predominantly as a model species for investigating the response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Genetic tools such as transgenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing are actively being developed in <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>, making it an attractive model species for future research into sperm heteromorphism regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Fundamental research into Lepidopteran reproduction has potentially wide-reaching implications in terms of controlling Lepidopteran pests in agriculture. Lepidopteran pests cause significant economic damage due to crop loss, with the problem increasing due to globalisation causing further spread of invasive Lepidopteran species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The wax moth <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> is a significant pest of honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). With the importance of biodiversity becoming increasingly prevalent in the public consciousness, innovative solutions are required to effectively target these pest populations. Seth <italic>et al.</italic> (2023) recently proposed the production of infertile apyrene sperm as a potential ‘Achilles heel’ to specifically target Lepidopteran pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Our data set provides a resource to mine to investigate novel genes implicated in sperm differential morphogenesis, and specifically target genes involved in apyrene sperm development. On the other hand, improved understanding of Lepidopteran reproduction could be important in the broader context of declines in Lepidopteran pollinator populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The possible future decline in fertility and hence survival of moth and butterfly pollinator populations due to these environmental factors may have devastating impacts on our ecosystems and global food production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplementary data file 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS192793-supplement-supplementary_data_file_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d263aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary data file 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS192793-supplement-Supplementary_data_file_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d263aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary data file 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS192793-supplement-Supplementary_data_file_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d263aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary data file 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS192793-supplement-Supplementary_data_file_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d263aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS192793-supplement-Supplementary_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d263aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the Galleria Mellonella Research Centre, University of Exeter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gmrcuk.org">www.gmrcuk.org</ext-link>), especially James Wakefield and James Pearce, for <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae and food, and for initial training in dissection, and helpful discussions through the project.

Germline stem cells and spermatogonia reside at the apical tip (green), and generate cysts of bipotential early spermatocytes (orange) encapsulated by cyst cells. In larvae these differentiate into late primary spermatocytes on the eupyrene sperm trajectory (blue in A, large arrow in C), which undergo meiosis and become secondary spermatocytes and then early spermatids (purple in A, small arrow in C). In pupal testes late spermatocytes (pink in B, large arrow in D) differentiate along the apyrene sperm trajectory, to generate secondary spermatocytes and spermatids (dark pink in B, large arrowhead in D). Pupal testes also contain a few eupyrene secondary spermatocytes (small arrow in D) and spermatids (teal in B, small arrowhead in D).

Both Lepidopteran and Dipteran species have evolved germline (purple box) and somatic (green box) paralogues.
