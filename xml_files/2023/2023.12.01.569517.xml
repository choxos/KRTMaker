It is a frequently observed phenomenon in everyday life which affects patients as well as healthy individuals. Motor fatigability can be measured using simple tasks like finger tapping at maximum speed for 30s. This typically results in a rapid decrease of tapping frequency, a phenomenon called motor slowing. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>), we showed that motor slowing goes hand in hand with a gradual increase of activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Previous electrophysiological measurements further suggested that the increase in SM1 activity might reflect a breakdown of inhibition and, particularly, a breakdown of surround inhibition which might have led to heightened coactivation of antagonistic muscles. It is unclear what drives the activity increase in SM1 caused by motor slowing and whether motor fatigability affects the dynamic interactions between SM1 and upstream motor areas like SMA and PMd. Here, we performed dynamic causal modelling to answer this question. Our main findings revealed that motor slowing was associated with a significant reduction in SM1 self-inhibition which is in line with previous electrophysiological results. Additionally, the model revealed a significant decrease in the driving input to premotor areas suggesting that structures other than cortical motor areas might cause motor fatigability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>motor slowing</kwd><kwd>repetitive movements</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>dynamic causal modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Motor fatigue is a condition which is frequently experienced in everyday life. However, elevated fatigue is a key symptom of many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kluger, Krupp, and Enoka 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Manjaly et al. 2019</xref>). Despite its high prevalence in clinical and non-clinical settings, the mechanisms causing motor fatigue are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on one specific aspect of fatigue, called “performance fatigability”, which is defined as an objectively measurable decline in outcome parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kluger, Krupp, and Enoka 2013</xref>). Performance fatigability can be studied using a simple finger-tapping paradigm: tapping as quickly as possible for 30s is characterised by a significant decrease in tapping speed, which we refer to as motor slowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). In this paradigm, the tapping speed reflects the objective outcome parameter and the reduction of tapping speed over time is a marker of fatigability. Motor slowing is an interesting paradigm to investigate which brain mechanisms underpin fatigability because neuromuscular and spinal factors have been shown to play only a minor role in mediating the decline of tapping speed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arias et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Madrid et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Madinabeitia-Mancebo et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In a recent study, we could show that motor slowing is associated with changes in the sensorimotor network and in the primary sensorimotor cortex in particular (SM1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). Despite a decrease in tapping speed, blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation increased significantly over time in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Neurophysiological measurements revealed that motor slowing is linked to a decrease in inhibition, and specifically surround inhibition within SM1, which correlated with an increase in coactivation of agonistic-antagonistic muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that motor slowing is associated with the breakdown of inhibitory mechanisms in the primary motor cortex. This proposition is consistent with a population coding model of the primary motor cortex whereby local inhibition can shape the broadness of population tuning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Georgopoulos, Schwartz, and Kettner 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Georgopoulos and Carpenter 2015</xref>): when surround inhibition is low, agonistic and antagonistic tuning curves are wider, resulting in a higher level of coactivation of involved and non-involved muscle groups.</p><p id="P4">It has been suggested that these local inhibitory mechanisms can be modulated by excitatory connections from other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mahan and Georgopoulos 2013</xref>). In our previous motor slowing study, we proposed that projections from areas upstream of SM1 may have altered the observed change in inhibition in SM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). Indeed, our functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed that motor slowing was also characterized by a significant activation increase in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA). Both areas have been shown to be involved in modulating descending motor commands (see review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Correia et al. 2022</xref>). It remains unclear, however, how PMd and SMA interact with SM1 while motor slowing arises, and how these areas contribute to shaping local inhibition in SM1.</p><p id="P5">To investigate premotor-motor interactions during motor slowing, we performed dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on the data from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). Previously, we investigated which brain areas show a change in BOLD activation, but we did not analyse how these brain areas interact. By estimating effective connectivity through patterns of causal interaction, DCM can reveal directionality of neural interactions.</p><p id="P6">We hypothesized that self-inhibition of SM1 changes during motor slowing which is in line with previous findings that local inhibition is altered with motor slowing. We further investigated whether motor slowing is associated with a change in effective connectivity between SM1, SMA, and PMd. Finally, we explored whether significant changes in effective connectivity correlate with the observed behavioural decrease in movement speed.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P7">The data used in this manuscript has been published previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>, experiment 6. The focus of the analysis in the previous publication was on changes in fMRI BOLD activation associated with motor slowing. Here, we re-analysed the data with an emphasis on network modelling with DCM. The behavioural task, fMRI preprocessing methods, and the general linear model (GLM) analysis of BOLD activity (i.e., parametric and block design-based analysis) is identical to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>. Relevant parts of the preprocessing are reiterated below for the reader’s convenience.</p><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P8">25 participants took part in the experiment and 24 (12 female, mean age: 23.8 +/- 3.3, right-handed) were included in the DCM analysis. One participant was excluded because they did not show any motor slowing, but rather an increase in tapping speed, indicating that they did not perform the task as instructed. All participants were free of medication, had no history of neurological or psychiatric disease and were naïve to the purpose of the experiment. All experimental protocols were approved by the research ethics committee of the canton of Zurich (KEK-ZH 2015-0537) and participants gave written informed consent to the study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Behavioural task and analysis</title><p id="P9">The experiment consisted of two different conditions: finger tapping for either 30 s (slowing condition) or 10 s (control condition), each followed by a 30 s break. Tapping was performed alternating between index and middle finger at maximum speed. Participants were informed about the condition prior to the start of tapping with a visual get-ready cue (randomly jittered between 2-3 s). The conditions were blocked within each fMRI run: One block was made up of four trials of the slowing condition, followed by four trials of the control condition, or vice versa. Each participant performed two fMRI runs consisting of two blocks each. This resulted in 16 trials per condition. The starting condition of the first run (slowing or control condition) was alternated across participants and the second run had a counterbalanced order in relation to the first run. Additionally, an implicit baseline of 20 s was measured after each block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Behavioural data was analysed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). Tapping and break intervals were divided into 10 s bins and movement speed was normalised to the average speed of the control condition per participant. This normalised movement speed was subjected to a linear mixed effects model with the fixed factor <italic>time</italic> (i.e., time bins) and the random factor <italic>participant</italic>. Motor slowing was defined as a significant main effect of <italic>time</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>fMRI acquisition and preprocessing</title><p id="P10">fMRI scans were acquired with a Philips Ingenia 3T whole body scanner. Prior to the functional runs, high resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were acquired (voxel size = 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, 160 sagittal slices, matrix size = 240x240, TR/TE = 8.3/3.9 ms). These anatomical scans were used for functional image registration and normalisation. During the behavioural runs 360 volumes were acquired in each run (voxel size = 2.75x2.75x3.3 mm, matrix size = 128x128, TR/TE = 2500/35 ms, flip angle = 82 degrees, 40 slices acquired in interleaved order for full brain coverage). Preprocessing was performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust) with default parameters and consisted of realignment to the average functional image, segmentation of the anatomical image, normalization to MNI space, and spatial smoothing (8 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel at full-width-half maximum).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>fMRI data analysis</title><p id="P11">fMRI analyses were also performed in SPM12. The first-level model of each participant consisted of a general linear model. The GLM design matrix included four regressors of interest: tapping, parametric modulation of tapping, recovery, and parametric modulation of recovery. The tapping regressor represented the time periods when the participant was tapping. The recovery reflects the 30 s rest condition after a tapping trial. The parametric modulation regressor consisted of a linear increase over the tapping periods (reflecting the increase in motor slowing) or a linear increase over the recovery period after a 30 s tapping trial (but not a 10 s tapping trial). The linear increase was the same across all participants and did not depend on the participant’s performance. Importantly, the parametric modulation regressor was orthogonalized with respect to the tapping regressor. Note that the 30 s slowing condition and the 10 s control condition were modelled together in each regressor. For the parametric modulator, the slowing condition consisted of a linear increase in six bins of 5 s, and the control condition was made up of a linear increase in two bins of 5 s. Regressors of no interest in the GLM consisted of get-ready periods and six head movement parameters (translation and rotation along the x, y, and z-axis). All regressors except the six head movement parameters were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The two regressors of interest were contrasted against the implicit baseline and were then subjected to a second-level random-effects analysis across participants. The second level analysis was a single one-sample t-test contrasting the regressors of interest against zero. P-values smaller than 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons were considered statistically significant. Localisation of functional clusters was aided by the anatomy toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eickhoff et al. 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dynamic causal modelling</title><p id="P12">To investigate the changes in effective (directed) connectivity with motor slowing, we performed DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003</xref>) using SPM12.

We therefore selected regions of interest which were associated with motor slowing. Specifically, we previously found that activity (pFWE &lt; 0.05) of the left SM1, left PMd, and bilateral SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>) were inversely correlated with motor slowing of the right hand: All these regions showed an activation increase with decreasing tapping speed. Based on this finding, we investigated here whether motor slowing is associated with changes in premotor-motor interactions. To that end we built several DCMs incorporating PMC, SMA, and SM1 (i.e., the three areas directly associated with motor slowing).</p><p id="P16">We extracted the BOLD signal time-series of our Effect of Interest from 4mm radius spheres centred on the following three regions of interest: SM1, PMd, and SMA. The Effect of Interest consisted of our four regressors of interest (tapping, parametric modulation of tapping, recovery, parametric modulation of recovery). All regions of interest were defined by taking the coordinates from the group-level analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 1</xref>) and then extracting the closest peak-level activation on the single subject level.</p><p id="P17">The endogenous connectivity matrix (matrix <italic>A</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation (1)</xref>) was defined by previous anatomical studies: Specifically, we assumed that all regions are connected bidirectionally based on previous anatomical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Luppino et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rouiller et al. 1994</xref>; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Michely et al. 2015</xref>). Also, all included regions were assumed to be self-modulatory. Self-modulations were chosen to represent two-state models and they can therefore be considered to be self-inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marreiros, Kiebel, and Friston 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The extrinsic regressor (term <italic>u</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation (1)</xref>) that modulates connectivity of the network (term <italic>B</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation (1)</xref>) reflected the effect of motor slowing. In the scope of this study, motor slowing was simplified as a linear change over time, as represented by the parametric modulation (see section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">fMRI data analysis</xref>) which served as input for this analysis. The driving input to the model was assumed to be a constant input from prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Michely et al. 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Model space and model families</title><p id="P19">As our main interest was to test whether self-inhibition of SM1 is crucial to explaining modulation of connectivity during motor slowing, we split the model space into model families with and without self-inhibition of SM1. Further, we wanted to investigate whether the premotor areas (SMA, PMd or both) shape the self-inhibition in SM1. Therefore, we set up multiple model families: (1) The top-down model family (in accordance with our main hypothesis outlined in the introduction), in which connections from SMA to SM1 and from PMd to SM1 were modulated. (2) The bottom-up model family, to verify whether our hypothesis may be inversed, meaning self-inhibition of SM1 may modulate SMA and PMd in a bottom-up fashion. In this model family, connections from SM1 to SMA and from SM1 to PMd were modulated. (3) The selective premotor model family, to test whether one premotor area is much more strongly involved in modulations of motor slowing: only SM1-SMA or SM1-PMd connections were modulated in these models. (4) The null model family. In this model family, none of the connections between any of the premotor areas and SM1 were modulated.</p><p id="P20">As mentioned, our main interest was to determine the necessity of self-inhibition in SM1, which is why these 4 model families were further specified as either having self-inhibition of SM1 modulated or not. This resulted in 8 model families: Top-down models without self-inhibition of SM1 (36 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), bottom-up models without self-inhibition of SM1 (36 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), selective premotor models without self-inhibition of SM1 (12 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), null models without self-inhibition of SM1 (6 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), top-down models with self-inhibition of SM1 (36 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), bottom-up models with self-inhibition of SM1 (36 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), selective premotor models with self-inhibition of SM1 (12 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), null models with self-inhibition of SM1 (6 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In all model families, the models were set up (i) with and without modulation of premotor interactions between SMA and PMd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue), and (ii) with the driving input set to either PMd, SMA, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, red). The main modulations of the selective premotor model family were either a bidirectional modulation of SM1-SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, purple) or SM1-PMd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, green). In both cases, the involved premotor area was modelled with self-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, orange). The top-down and bottom-up model family differed in whether the connections SM1-PMd, SM1-SMA, or both were modulated, with or without self-inhibition of the involved premotor area.

As the model selection did not reveal decisive evidence for a single winning model family (family exceedance probabilities &lt; 0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), all models across all model families were averaged through Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with an Occam’s window of 0.05 to inspect the model parameters. These BMA parameter estimates were then subjected to two further analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stephan et al. 2010</xref>). First, to identify the connections which were significantly modulated by motor slowing across participants, a group level post-hoc analysis on the maximum-à-posteriori (MAP) of the matrix <italic>B</italic> was performed using Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. Secondly, a stepwise linear regression was performed to identify which of these modulated connections were directly associated with individual differences in motor slowing as quantified by the behavioural data.

The variance explained by the models of this model family is on average 31.2% (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 3</xref> for variance explained per participant). However, evidence for this model family was not decisive (i.e., exceedance probability &lt; 0.95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

This observation is somewhat paradoxical, since higher cortical BOLD activity has been associated with higher tapping speed when tested in a non-fatigued state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rao et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schlaug et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sadato et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jäncke, Specht, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jäncke, Peters, et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Deiber et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agnew, Zeffiro, and Eden 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lutz et al. 2004</xref>). Here, we used DCM to test how motor slowing modulates the interaction between PMd, SMA, and SM1. Our main result shows that motor slowing was characterised by a significant decrease of (i) SM1 self-inhibition, and (ii) excitatory driving inputs to both premotor areas (SMA and PMd). We further observed an increase in SMA to SM1 connectivity at a trend level.</p><p id="P27">DCM revealed that self-inhibition of SM1 decreased during motor slowing. Interestingly, the driving inputs to the premotor areas decreased significantly, while interactions between premotor and motor areas only reached trend level significance for a connectivity increase from SMA to SM1. This suggests that the release of self-inhibition in SM1 is the major contributor to the increase of BOLD activity typically observed during motor slowing. This finding is in line with our previous neurophysiological results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>), but also with a larger body of research that used different fatiguing paradigms to show that intracortical inhibition is reduced after fatiguing muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benwell et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Maruyama et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hunter et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Latella et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We further found that the driving input to the cortical premotor areas decreases during motor slowing. Despite this finding being consistent with the reduction in tapping speed, the decrease in facilitatory input makes it unlikely that influences from other areas drive the high activity in SM1, PMd, and SMA. This is interesting because the driving input to premotor areas seems to play a more important role for motor slowing than premotor-primary motor interactions. Where these driving inputs originate has yet to be defined, but basal ganglia, thalamus, or the cerebellum are likely candidates based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Liu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Van Duinen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Post et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hou et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bächinger et al. 2019</xref>). The cerebellum is particularly interesting, as it has been found to be involved in the continuous monitoring of movement rates, as well as in regulating movement rhythmicity via the brain stem, basal ganglia, and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Scott 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bastian 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Pisotta and Molinari 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Therrien and Bastian 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Concerning premotor-motor interactions, we found a trend-level increase in effective connectivity from SMA to SM1 with motor slowing, and the stepwise linear regression analysis hinted that stronger effective connectivity between SMA and SM1 was associated with more slowing on an individual level. SMA is known for its importance of controlling internally generated movements through projections to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Samuel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Konoike and Nakamura 2020</xref>). In this regard, SMA has not only been linked to the temporal sequencing of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tanji 2001</xref>), but also to rhythm production itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Konoike and Nakamura 2020</xref>). Increased SMA activity has been proposed to not be related to the execution of movement per se, but rather to the elevated difficulty in motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kawashima et al. 1999</xref>). In other fatiguing paradigms, SMA has been linked to effort perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zénon, Sidibé, and Olivier 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sharples et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Emanuel et al. 2021</xref>), with modulation of SMA leading to changes in perceived effort. This suggests that the increased SMA to SM1 connectivity that we found may reflect the increase in perceived effort required to maintain the tapping performance with advancing time. However, this conclusion is highly speculative and must be interpreted with caution since the association between SMA and behaviour has been driven by a small group of participants and we did not measure the perceived effort. Thus, even though interactions between premotor and primary sensorimotor cortex might contribute to motor slowing, it seems likely that more complex neuronal interactions involving a larger network may underlie the observed behavioural outcome.</p><p id="P30">In summary, these results revealed additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that motor slowing is associated with a release of inhibition in SM1. Additionally, the driving input coming from other (motor) areas is essential for explaining the network modulations occurring during motor slowing.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P31">Our DCM analysis indicates that a reduction in self-inhibition of SM1 explains the increase in BOLD activation that occurs during motor slowing, even though it is not directly associated with the behavioural decrease in movement speed. Furthermore, we show that premotor-motor interactions are moderately modulated by motor slowing, but that the driving input to the cortical motor network appears to play an even more important role. These findings emphasize that processes upstream of the premotor-motor areas contribute to the changes occurring in SM1 when fatigability increases during fast finger tapping.</p></sec><sec
