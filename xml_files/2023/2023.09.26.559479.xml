Habitat transitions are thought to be a key driver of prokaryote diversity, but we still know relatively little about how prokaryotes successfully transition and persist across environments, and how this varies between biomes and lineages. Here, we investigate biome transitions and specialisation in natural populations of a focal bacterial phylum, the <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, sampled across a range of replicated soils and freshwater and marine sediments in Cornwall (UK). By targeted deep sequencing of the protein-coding gene <italic>rpoB</italic>, we found &gt;2000 unique <italic>Myxococcota</italic> lineages, with the majority (77%) being biome specialists and &lt;5% able to live across the salt barrier. Discrete character evolution models revealed that biome specialists very rarely transitioned to specialising in another biome. Instead, generalists mediated transitions between biome specialists. Multistate hidden-state speciation and extinction models found variation in speciation rate across the tree, but this variation was independent of biome association and specialisation. Overall, our results help explain how microbes transition between biomes and are consistent with “the jack-of-all-trades” trade-off, where generalists suffer a cost in any individual environment, resulting in rapid evolution of niche specialists.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that structure prokaryote diversity across heterogeneous environments is a central objective in microbial ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The extent to which different taxa are associated with different biomes, the frequency at which taxa transition between these biomes, and how this influences their diversification rate are not yet fully understood. One of the most drastic environmental transitions for both macro- and microorganisms is that between marine and terrestrial (land and freshwater) biomes, the so-called “salt barrier” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Salinity is a major determinant in structuring microbial diversity, with distinct phylogenetic shifts observed over salinity gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Transitions between marine and terrestrial biomes require substantial re-organisation of the proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and gains and losses of a multitude of genes and metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Due to these adaptive challenges, microbe transitions across the salt barrier are thought to be rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Trade-offs between ecological specialisation strategies may explain the scarcity of successful transitions across the marine-terrestrial divide in prokaryotes. Generalist taxa that can live in both terrestrial and marine environments (and easily transition between them) are expected to be at a competitive disadvantage in any individual biome according to the classic “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” trade-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Apart from antagonistic pleiotropy, a generalist strategy could have other fitness costs, such as reduced evolvability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In macro-organisms, evolutionary transitions between generalism and specialism are thought to occur in both directions, but are more commonly directed towards specialism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Recent studies on prokaryotes that classified generalists or specialists based on their distribution across environments also found that evolutionary transitions are directed predominantly towards specialism, but additionally, that generalists possessed higher speciation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. These results highlight the key role generalists may play in colonising novel environments and generating microbial diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P4">However, these studies on prokaryotes did not apply some of the newly developed comparative phylogenetic methods that can better test whether variation in diversification rates is due to the focal trait (e.g. specialist or generalist) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and relied on the 16S rRNA gene marker, which, although representing the ‘gold standard’ in microbial ecology, offers relatively low genetic resolution and occurs in multiple (sometimes different) copies per genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The most commonly used alternative, metagenomic sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], likely misses rare taxa, which can affect the results of diversification analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. An alternative option is to use single-copy protein-coding genes, which are reliable proxies for whole-genome divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and with a high rate of evolution enables differentiation between even closely related taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Moreover, amplicon sequencing targeting a subgroup of bacteria should allow exhaustive sampling and retrieval of taxa that would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p id="P5">Here, we use the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene to amplify Myxobacteria (previously classified as the δ-Proteobacterial Order <italic>Myxococcales</italic> but recently proposed to form the Phylum <italic>Myxococcota</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]), best known for their social development into multicellular fruiting bodies, large genomes, and prolific production of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Myxobacteria have long been known to live across a wide range of terrestrial habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], but in the last two decades, they have also been shown to be ubiquitous components of marine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and freshwater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] sediments. We sequenced the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene in samples collected from different marine and terrestrial environments replicated across Cornwall (U.K.) and, as has been done in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], classified samples not based on a set of abiotic measurements (e.g. pH or salinity), but based on 16S rRNA community composition, reasoning that this reflects both the abiotic environment (i.e. ASVs in a sample share abiotic affinities) and biotic environment (i.e. ASVs co-occur in a sample because they interact with each other). The presence/absence of <italic>Myxococcota</italic> ASVs across biomes was used to classify each as a specialist or generalist, and we used modern comparative methods to investigate their macroevolution. Models of discrete character evolution revealed that generalists form ‘evolutionary bridges’ between biome specialists and act as sources of specialist lineages, with transitions predominantly directed towards specialists. Using the state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) framework, we found that diversification rates across the phylogeny varied, but were not associated with biomes or degree of specialisation. Our results demonstrate how generalists successfully transition between biomes, but then relatively rapidly evolve into specialists, likely due to the “jack-of-all-trades master-of-none” trade-off.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Extensive regional phylogenetic diversity of the phylum Myxococcota structured across three main biomes</title><p id="P6">We used targeted sequencing of a ∼225 base pair (bp) region of the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene to uncover Myxobacterial diversity across the county of Cornwall (U.K.). Fifteen predefined, more or less distinct habitats were sampled across six broad locations with a view to maximising ecological and phylogenetic diversity, including freshwater, estuarine, and marine sediments, and soils associated with different vegetation or land uses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). After prevalence filtering, 2,621 unique <italic>Myxococcota</italic> amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified, compared to a total of only 153 <italic>Myxococcota</italic> ASVs retrieved from 16S sequencing (a 17-fold increase). We also saw increased diversity and relative abundance of <italic>Myxococcota</italic> in individual samples. In the <italic>rpoB</italic> dataset, we identified an average (mean) of 239 ASVs per sample (minimum = 1, maximum = 789) and the relative abundance of <italic>Myxococcota</italic> was 0.14 (minimum = &lt;0.001, maximum = 0.47), compared to an average diversity of 42 (one sample had zero <italic>Myxococcota</italic>) and an average proportion of 0.02 in the 16S data, representing a seven-fold increase in <italic>Myxococcota</italic> sequences. Rarefaction curves demonstrated that diversity was sequenced to sufficient depth across all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), and assigning taxonomy using the lowest common ancestor method (see Methods) resulted in 97% of all ASVs being assigned to at least family level. All seven named families in the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> were retrieved, alongside 16 unidentified families, demonstrating that our primers had phylum-wide coverage.</p><p id="P7">To determine whether predefined habitats indeed differed, we looked for an overall effect of habitat and location on community composition as quantified by 16S rRNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Our predefined habitats explained a significant amount of variation in microbial community composition (PERMANOVA, F<sub>14,53</sub>=13.17, R<sup>2</sup>=0.76, p=0.001), whereas geographical location, as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], did not (PERMANOVA, F<sub>5,53</sub>=1.14, R<sup>2</sup>=0.024, p = 0.278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). To determine which predefined habitats differed significantly in community composition, we ran multiple pairwise permutational ANOVAs (see Methods) and removed three predefined habitats (high supratidal beach sand, thrift rhizosphere, and estuarine sediment (polyhaline/mesohaline)) that were not significantly different from the other predefined habitats. This left us with 12 predefined habitats, each with a significantly different community composition. As having 12 states for our observed trait for comparative analyses is computationally intractable, we used k-medoid clustering to calculate the optimal number of clusters based on the principal coordinate analysis of community composition that corresponded to the three main biomes: freshwater (11 samples), marine (25), and land (27)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To assign biome preference to each <italic>Myxococcota rpoB</italic> ASV, we compared their observed prevalence across all biomes to that expected by chance (accounting for the unequal numbers of samples in each biome). Most ASVs (77%) were associated with only one of the three major biomes and were designated as either freshwater (738), land (704) or marine (568) specialists. Generalism was designated when an ASV was present in multiple biomes at proportions equal to or exceeding those expected by chance and was rarer than specialism (23% of all ASVs). Only six ASVs were designated ‘true’ generalists present in all biomes, five ASVs were classified as land + marine generalists, 112 as freshwater + marine generalists, and 488 ASVs as freshwater + land generalists. Therefore, ignoring the latter generalist category, only 123 ASVs (&lt;5%) occurred in both saline and non-saline environments, which is in line with our expectation that the salinity boundary is challenging to cross [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. This principal finding of biome specialists being most common (and generalists capable of straddling the salt barrier being rare) was consistent across a range of OTU cut-offs (from ASVs to 91% similarity)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We constructed an ultrametric phylogeny of all <italic>Myxococcota</italic> ASVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), constraining the tree structure based on seven named family-level clades identified in a recent multi-gene phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> inset) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Of all ASVs, 73.6% were assigned to these seven families, with the remaining tips being unconstrained. We determined how biome associations were linked to the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> phylogeny in multiple ways. First, clustering of our <italic>Myxococcota rpoB</italic> sequencing based on the weighted Unifrac distance - which considers the phylogenetic proximity of species - demonstrated that freshwater, marine, and land samples had distinct <italic>Myxococcota</italic> composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Second, we found strong phylogenetic signal of biome preference using two different methods: the D-statistic and Pagel’s lambda (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). The D-statistic is based on the sum of sister-clade differences in a given phylogeny, and is equal to one if the observed trait has a random distribution and to zero if the observed trait is as clumped as if it had evolved by Brownian motion, but values can fall outside of this range. In our phylogeny, D-statistic values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] for the binary (yes or no) ability to live in freshwater, marine, or land biomes were 0.31, -0.20, and 0.04 respectively, with all of these being significantly different from a random distribution (p &lt; 0.001) indicating significant phylogenetic clumping. Pagel’s lambda measures phylogenetic dependence of an observed trait, with a value of 1 indicating the trait has evolved by perfect Brownian motion, and lower values indicating that other factors, unrelated to phylogenetic history, have an impact on trait evolution. The estimate of Pagel’s lambda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] for biome preference was 0.86, meaning that a large proportion of the variation in biome preference is explained by the phylogeny. The level of phylogenetic signal did not change systematically across different OTU cut-offs and was unaffected by tree size (after bootstrapping the tree at each OTU cut-off to the same size) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). The clustering results and strong phylogenetic signal indicate biome preference is conserved across the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> phylogeny, meaning that closely related <italic>Myxococcota</italic> are likely to be ecologically similar.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Biome transitions are mediated by generalists</title><p id="P10">We next tested whether differences in transition rates between specialists and generalists drove the uneven distribution of ASVs across biome specialists and generalists. As it is difficult to fit comparative phylogenetic models when distributions across states are extremely uneven and when some states have low numbers, we collapsed the three biome preferences with the smallest numbers of ASVs (marine + land generalist, freshwater + marine generalist, and full generalist) into a single preference of “marine generalist” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). We tested ten Markov models to study discrete character evolution and explore the transitions between biome preferences in the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> through evolutionary time. We fitted four hypothesis-driven models that restricted some transitional pathways: all-rates-different (ARD), symmetric (SYM), equal rates (ER), and stepwise (SW). The ARD model assumes all transitions are possible and all rates can differ. The SYM model assumes all transitions are possible, but rates to and from any pair of biome preferences are equal, and the ER model assumes all transitions are possible but all occur at the same rate. The SW model assumes that an intermediate generalist state is needed to move to a new specialisation (i.e. evolution from marine specialist to land specialist requires a marine + land generalist step first), but all allowed rates can differ. The remaining six models were simplifications of the ARD model where we iteratively set transitions with the lowest rates to zero (see Methods). A custom ARD model of just 11 transitions (of a possible 20) was best supported (AIC weight = 0.39, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), while the estimated transition rates were qualitatively similar among the four best-supported models that cumulatively had an AIC weight of 0.87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The parameter estimates of the transition models revealed several key patterns in the evolution of biome preference in the <italic>Myxococcota</italic>. First, it is very rare for specialists of one biome to shift directly to specialising in another biome. The best-supported model does not support any specialist-to-specialist transitions (out of potentially six transitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), and across the four best-supported models, only the transition from land specialist to freshwater specialist is estimated to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,c</xref>), and at a very low rate. Instead, marine generalists and freshwater + land generalists were the best connected (with seven and six transitions, respectively, compared to a maximum of four for a biome specialist), acting like stepping stones through which biome specialists evolve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, generalists are less stable than specialists, with transition rates away from the more generalist state exceeding those towards these states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). For instance, transition rates away from marine generalists are more than five times higher than all rates towards it combined, and freshwater + land generalists have the second highest ratio of rates directed towards compared to away from. In contrast, all specialist states are stable, with transition rates into freshwater, marine, and land specialists being 79%, 91%, and 37% higher than those away from these states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, when looking at individual pairs of transitions, transition rates away from the more generalist state were always higher than rates towards it. This pattern is consistent across all four best supported models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Third, marine specialists are extremely stable and the most evolutionarily isolated of all biome preferences, with transition rates both towards and away from this state being the lowest compared to all other biome preferences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Fourth, transitions between land specialists and freshwater + land generalists are widespread, indicating that species can easily transition between these biome preferences. We can exclude the possibility that freshwater + land generalists simply represent land specialists transiently present in freshwater sediments due to runoff, as the best supported Markov model indicates that freshwater + land generalists are more connected to other states than to land specialists. Our bootstrapping approaches, where we (a) subsampled 80% of the tree or (b) subsampled the tree to have the same number of tips within each biome preference and then re-fitted the best supported Markov model, gave qualitatively equivalent results (Figures S5 and S6). Specifically, transitions away from biome generalists were higher than transitions away from biome specialists; marine generalists were the least stable and marine specialists were the most stable biome preference.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Heterogeneity in the diversification and speciation of Myxococcota does not vary between biome specialists and generalists</title><p id="P12">We used Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] to detect shifts in diversification rates across our <italic>Myxococcota</italic> phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Speciation rates across the phylogeny generally decreased over time, while extinction rates remained relatively stable, resulting in a net decrease in diversification rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). More important than the average rates across the whole tree, we detected heterogeneity in the diversification rate across the tree, with an average of 12 shifts in the diversification regime (95% credible intervals: 9-18)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Supporting this, a model with 12 rate shifts in the diversification regime had the highest posterior probability (0.19) and was strongly supported over models with fewer or more regime shifts (closest Bayes Factor difference = 34). However, the evidence for any one of the 993 detected shift configurations was very weak, with the highest percent probability for a single shift configuration being only 0.19%. Consequently, we calculated the best overall shift configuration and estimated the diversification rate through time averaged over the whole tree and for subsets of the tree at the nodes where core shifts occurred during this configuration (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Immediately after a core shift in diversification rate, rates spiked before receding back towards the global average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). In summary, we find evidence of heterogeneity in speciation rates across the <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, but it is impossible to ascertain precisely where, how often, and with what magnitude these shifts are occurring in the phylogeny. To test whether heterogeneity in diversification rate was associated with biome preference, we fitted a set of multi-state dependent speciation and extinction models (MuSSE) that allow diversification rates to vary with biome preference while accounting for the transition rates between these states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. A MuSSE model with only state-dependent speciation rates was selected over models with (a) both state-dependent speciation and extinction, (b) state-dependent extinction only, and (c) no state-dependent speciation or extinction (AIC weight = 0.98). This result is consistent with the BAMM analysis that found that heterogeneity in diversification rates was mainly driven by speciation rate. The MuSSE model showed that marine generalists had a significantly higher speciation rate than the other biome preferences. However, SSE analyses must be interpreted with caution as they rest on the assumption that rate heterogeneity is associated with variation in the measured trait state (e.g. biome preference) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p><p id="P13">To address this shortcoming, we fitted several models containing “hidden” (or concealed) traits, so-called Hidden State-dependent Speciation and Extinction Models (HiSSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. To reduce the number of estimable parameters, we fixed the transition rates to those estimated from the best Markov model. Doing so had little impact on the diversification rate estimates (Pearson’s correlation coefficient between speciation rates with- and without fixing some transition rates = 0.99), and the correlation between transition rates estimated from the MuSSE model and the Markov model was strong (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.95). We refitted the MuSSE model with only state-dependent speciation and compared it to several null models. First, concealed-trait-dependent (CTD) models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] with two, three, or four concealed states, in which rates of speciation were allowed to vary across lineages modulated by hidden states but not by biome preference. Second, a MuHiSSE model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] allowing diversification rate variation owing to both hidden variation and biome preference. The CTD4 model (a concealed-trait-dependent model with four hidden states) performed best by far (AIC weight ∼ 1) and had diversification rates broadly in line with the values found in the original MuSSE, with one hidden state having a high speciation rate (15.54, compared to 12.7 for marine generalists), two intermediate rates (2.59 and 5.72, compared to 3.88 for marine specialists), and one low rate (0.57, compared to 1.96 for freshwater specialists). Across different estimated sampled fractions of diversity, the concealed-trait dependent models were favoured over MuSSE or MuHiSSE models, with CTD4 performing best at an assumed sample fraction of 0.75 and CTD3 performing best at a sample fraction of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). In summary, after accounting for hidden states, there is no evidence for differences in diversification rates between biome specialists or generalists. In line with this result, a phylogenetic regression on the tip-specific evolutionary rates estimated from BAMM found no significant difference in diversification rates between biome preferences (all contrasts between biome preferences had p &gt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">In this study, we used an ecologically and geographically explicit, replicated sampling design to explore biome transitions and specialisation in the macroevolutionary history of the <italic>Myxococcota</italic>. Specifically, we used 16S sequencing to cluster predefined habitats into three clusters corresponding to the main freshwater, land, and marine biomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Most <italic>Myxococcota</italic> ASVs were biome specialists, with less than 5% of ASVs able to live across the salt barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). We used models of discrete character evolution to demonstrate how specialisation evolves and biome transitions occur. Generalists mediate transitions between biomes and then rapidly evolve into specialists, which, while not evolutionary dead ends, generally have much lower transition rates away from them than generalists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Finally, we performed analyses investigating variation in diversification rates across the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> and found shifts in diversification rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), but these shifts were not attributable to biome preference or specific <italic>Myxocococcota</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Our results revealed that the much rarer biome generalists mediate transitions between biomes, with transition rates substantially higher away from, rather than into, generalist states, consistent with previous findings based on 16S rRNA data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. There was very little statistical support for transitions between biome specialists, suggesting that biome generalists successfully transition between biomes, after which they rapidly evolve to specialise on one specific biome. Crucially, this result was replicated across all biomes, with rates into freshwater/land/marine specialists always being higher than rates in the opposite direction towards a generalist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). In this way, generalists act like ‘stepping stone’ lineages through which microbes transition between biomes before evolving specialisation, somewhat similar to work that found brackish water biomes act like ‘stepping stone’ environments mediating marine-terrestrial transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Not all biome specialists evolve in the same way, with marine specialists being the most evolutionarily isolated, with transition rates into and away from this biome specialisation the lowest of any state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This might reflect more constrained pathways of adaptation from saline to non-saline environments, but also more constrained dispersal routes: migration into the marine environment might be more frequent than the other way around thereby offering more potential for colonising taxa to adapt to this environment.</p><p id="P15">Our analyses did not uncover differences in diversification rates between generalists and specialists associated with different biomes. Historically, specialisation has been considered an evolutionary dead end, which may result in lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates. Still, recent analyses have demonstrated that diversification rate is often independent of specialisation in macro-organisms. In microbes, studies have shown mixed results, with two studies finding that generalists had (much) higher diversification and speciation rates than specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], while the other demonstrated the opposite pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. However, none of these studies used Hidden State Speciation and Extinction models, which can account for unknown (hidden) traits that may affect diversification rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], meaning there is a high risk of false positives in these analyses. In line with this, our MuSSE analysis found that marine generalists had higher speciation rates than other biome preferences, but after using HiSSE models, the best-supported model was one where the diversification rate was independent of biome preference.</p><p id="P16">Similar to previous work investigating bursts in diversification rate in prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], we found evidence of rate shifts in diversification (speciation) rates across the phylogeny, but it was not possible to assign such bursts to specific taxa, biomes, or generalist/specialist strategies. Bursts in diversification rate are often interpreted as adaptive radiations, which occur when a single ancestral type encounters broad ecological opportunity, enabling diversification into a multitude of specialised types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Although their capacity for dispersal means that adaptive radiations in prokaryotes are unlikely to arise via colonisation events of novel ecosystems, it may be that the uptake of novel traits through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) allows the colonisation of new niche space, which subsequently can be partitioned into different specialists. Going forward, combining targeted amplicon sequencing data with (metagenome-assisted) whole-genome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] is needed to characterise the role of HGT in evolutionary transitions and its mechanistic impact on ecological specialisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P17">In summary, we present the first work - to our knowledge - that looks at the macroevolution of both biome transitions and specialisation in prokaryotes simultaneously and is amongst the first to apply SSE methods to an observed trait (biome preference) with more than two states. In doing so, we demonstrate how generalists allow for successful transitions between biomes, including across the salt barrier, before rapidly giving rise to specialists. The exponential rise in microbial sequencing data will undoubtedly result in comparative phylogenetics being increasingly used to understand prokaryote evolution, but using these methods for this purpose remains challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. First, the lack of a universally accepted (operational) species definition in prokaryotes impedes the estimation of global diversity and inferring phylogenetic species trees. Second, while targeted short amplicon sequencing allows for better sequencing of the microbial diversity in a sample, it can be hard to estimate robust phylogenetic trees, whereas the opposite is true for metagenomic data. These issues can affect the results of diversification rate analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], but as the majority of prokaryotic diversity is currently unculturable, there is no other way to study the macroevolution of bacteria. Our approach here was to cross-validate our analyses as thoroughly as possible, compare the relative fit of multiple models to understand how biome preference evolved, and compare relative differences in parameter estimates rather than concentrating on absolute values. Increased collaboration between comparative phylogeneticists and microbial ecologists is needed to uncover macroevolutionary dynamics in prokaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Environmental sampling</title><p id="P18">We sampled 15 predefined habitats in August 2020 replicated across six drowned river valleys (‘rias’) in Cornwall (United Kingdom): Helford, Fal, Fowey, Looe, Tamar and Camel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Any ASV that was only present in a single biome was designated as a biome specialist. For any ASV present in two or three biomes, we employed a bootstrapping approach to assign biome preference. Specifically, we created a bootstrapped presence dataset for each ASV by sampling their observed presence across samples 100 times with replacement to calculate their proportional presence across biomes. This process was repeated 1000 times for each ASV to create a distribution of observed biome preference proportions. We then compared these observed proportions to those based on the number of samples in each biome (land = 0.44, marine = 0.38, freshwater = 0.18), akin to habitat availability. For every ASV, if 97.5% of the observed use estimates in any given biome were below the expected proportion given its availability, we assumed it did not have an affinity for that biome. Consequently, ASV biome preference consists of all the biomes where the ASV was present at a level at least as high as expected by each biome’s availability. This approach meant that seven different biome preferences were possible (freshwater specialist, marine specialist, land specialist, freshwater + marine generalist, marine + land generalist, freshwater + land generalist and full generalist (i.e. land, freshwater and marine).

We fitted four hypothesis-driven models that restricted some transitional pathways: all-rates-different (ARD), symmetric (SYM), equal rates (ER), and stepwise (SW). As our trait is simply an association, these are not the only biologically plausible models. Consequently, we also performed iterative model simplification on the ARD model to set the lowest transition rate to zero until AIC stopped decreasing. For the first simplified model, we set four transitions that were less than 0.001 to 0 and then set the single smallest transition rate to zero for each subsequent model simplification. We then compared all models using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. For the best-supported model, we calculated a “source-sink ratio” by dividing the sum of the transition rates into a biome preference by the sum of the transition rates away from the same biome preference.

Second, we subsampled each group to have the same number of ASVs (123) and re-fitted the best model.

Priors for BAMM were generated using the R package ‘<italic>BAMMtools</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and the expected number of transitions was set to 500 to aid convergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. We ran four MCMC chains for 30,000,000 generations, allowing chain swaps every 1000 generations and saving output every 20,000 generations. We assessed convergence by calculating the effective sample size (ESS) of the log-likelihood and the number of shifts of the results after a burn-in period of 30% (ESS values &gt;200 are indicative of good convergence). We also checked that the posterior of the number of transitions differed from the prior by using ‘<italic>BAMMtools::plotPrior()</italic>’.</p><p id="P33">The best overall model (number of rate shifts) from our BAMM analysis was chosen by selecting the model with the highest Bayes factor relative to the null model, which has zero rate shifts. We calculated the credible shift set - the ranked set of distinct shift configurations that accounts for 95% of the posterior probability of the data - for our BAMM analysis. This returns the number of core shifts, defined as those that contribute appreciably to our ability to model the data. In contrast, non-core shifts are simply shifts we would expect to sometimes happen under the prior distribution for rate shifts across the tree. In our case, all shift configurations had very low probability (the best having a posterior probability of 0.0019). This is expected in some datasets with large numbers of taxa as there are simply too many parameters in the model to allow a single shift configuration to dominate the credible set. Consequently, we extracted the shift configuration using ‘<italic>maximumShiftCredibility</italic>’ that maximises the marginal probability of rate shifts along individual branches, similar to the maximum clade credibility tree in phylogenetic analysis. We used phylogenetic generalised least squares regression using ‘<italic>nlme::lme()</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] to determine whether tip-specific net diversification rates estimated from BAMM were associated with biome preference. Although disagreements exist about what these estimates represent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], this analysis helped complement the state-dependent diversification analyses. In this model, tip-specific net diversification rate was the response variable, biome preference was the predictor, and the phylogenetic tree was used to create a correlation matrix to control for the effect of phylogeny. Post-hoc comparisons between individual pairs of biome preferences were done to see if any biome preferences had significantly different tip-specific net diversification rates.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>State-dependent diversification analysis and parameterisation</title><p id="P34">We used multi-state-dependent speciation and extinction (MuSSE) models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] to determine whether rate heterogeneity is associated with biome preference. In these models, a lineage’s speciation or extinction rate depends on biome preference, and transitions between biome preferences were limited to those from the best supported transition matrix from the Markov models. We first used ‘<italic>diversitree::fitmk()</italic>’ to compare models where (1) both speciation and extinction were associated with biome preference, (2) only speciation was associated with biome preference, (3) only extinction was associated with biome preference, and (4) neither speciation nor extinction was associated with biome preference (constant-rates model). Models were compared using AIC weights.</p><p id="P35">It is possible that the SSE model could be supported over a constant-rates model just because it allows for variation in speciation (or extinction) rate across the tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Consequently, we fitted models where diversification rates depend on an unknown (hidden or concealed) trait using the R package ‘<italic>secsse</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. For all models, we estimated a single extinction rate and fixed transitions between biome preferences to those estimated from the best Markov model to limit the number of estimable parameters. We fitted four different models: (1) a MuSSE model with no hidden states, (2) a MuHiSSE model that allowed for both state-dependent and hidden state speciation rates, (3) a concealed trait diversification model (CTD) with two hidden states (CTD2) (4) a CTD model with three (CTD3) states, four (CTD4), or five (CTD5) hidden states. For models including hidden states, transitions to and from the same hidden state were allowed to differ (i.e. 1A -&gt; 1B ≄ 1B -&gt; 1A), and dual transitions were disallowed (i.e. could not move hidden and measured traits at once). Models were compared using AIC scores and AIC weights. Statistical support for biome preference affecting diversification rates is found when the AIC score of the model in which speciation (or extinction) differs across biome preferences is higher than that in which rates depend on an unknown (CTD model) and a constant-rate model.</p><p id="P36">We used several different initial parameter sets to circumvent local optima during likelihood optimisation with ‘<italic>secsse</italic>’. The first set of parameters were the estimates of speciation and extinction from a birth-death model fit to the branching times and transition rates from the best-supported Markov model using ‘<italic>DDD::bd_ml()</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. For transitions between hidden states, the initial start value was the mean of the transition rates from the best supported Markov model. We then created a grid of all combinations of starting values for half and double these initial values (27 different combinations) and calculated the log likelihood of the model using these estimates given the data using ‘<italic>secsse::secsse_loglik()</italic>’. We then chose starting parameters with the six highest initial log-likelihood values to fit to the data using ‘<italic>secsse::secsse_ml()</italic>’, choosing the highest likelihood of the six starting points to compare across models. We re-ran the model-fitting process at three different levels of sampling fraction (1, 0.75, and 0.5) to determine how sensitive our conclusions are to the assumption that we have sampled all the <italic>Myxococcota</italic> diversity in the samples. All models were fitted with a log-likelihood penalty of 0.05 to prevent unrealistically high parameter estimates and to aid in model fitting.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Overview of open source software used</title><p id="P37">All R scripts used elements of the suite of packages known as the ‘<italic>tidyverse</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>], all phylogenetic trees were plotted using <italic>‘ggtree’</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], all figures were made using ‘<italic>ggplot2</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>], and all tables were created using ‘<italic>flextable</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>].
