approximately 40% of the patients respond insufficiently to the available synthetic or biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The infiltration of the synovial membrane by lymphocytes and monocytes profoundly alters its homeostatic functions, leading to chronic joint inflammation and bone destruction. A better understanding of how DMARDs impact the complex synovial cell social network in relationship to response/non-response remains an unmet need to design more targeted and active therapeutic strategies. Here, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to comparatively profile more than 115,000 cells in the synovial tissue of healthy, low inflammatory osteoarthritis and matched active early treatment-naïve RA patients at baseline and at 6 months after starting DMARDs treatment. We notably highlighted that tissue resident macrophages (LYVE1<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>) in perivascular synovial niches encompassing specific subsets of vascular cells, fibroblasts and immune cells vanished in active RA but were recovered in response to DMARDs treatment. Combined ligand-receptor analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified that IL10, C-type lectin or TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) receptors were particularly involved in the restoration of these spatial cell interactions in the context of clinical remission. In addition to providing an unprecedented synovial spatial mapping, our work uncovered novel potential cellular and molecular targets for the development of therapies for RA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting 0.3-1% of the general population worldwide and characterized by joint inflammation associated with debilitating bone and cartilage erosions. Despite the availability of a large therapeutic arsenal, including conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; e.g., methotrexate, MTX), biologic (b) DMARDs (e.g., TNF inhibitors) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (e.g., JAK inhibitors), around 40% of patients do not respond adequately to the available treatments, and RA remains a major public health challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). RA is a prototypic synovitis-driven autoimmune disease and the in-depth characterization of the synovial tissue have broadened our understanding of RA pathogenesis and led to the development of targeted therapies. Blood biomarkers of inflammation and autoimmunity e.g. ESR / CRP, Rheumatoid Factor / Anti Citrullinated Protein Antibody (ACPA), and clinical features are the mainstay for the diagnosis of RA. However, there are no biomarkers predictive of treatment-response, consequently treatment allocation is based on “trial and error” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). On the other hand, similarly to other rheumatic conditions such as lupus nephritis, vasculitis and myositis, recent evidence in RA supports the concept of integrating synovial cellular/molecular signatures into clinical algorithms to help predicting response to specific DMARDs and enhance clinical outcome, towards precision medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Also recently, single cell profiling of dissociated tissues using transcriptomic (scRNAseq) and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) approaches, have brought unprecedented insights into synovial cell heterogeneity, including fibroblasts, macrophages, T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Importantly, single cell studies have highlighted the existence of key cellular crosstalk and dysregulated signaling pathways involved in RA pathogenesis. For instance, NOTCH3 signaling appears critical in the differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> perivascular and sublining fibroblasts, and is involved in inflammation and joint damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In addition, several T helper cell subsets are also found expanded in the RA synovium, within so called ectopic tertiary lymphoid structures (ELS), to promote B-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A particular role for tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) expressing <italic>MERTK, CD163, TREM2</italic> and <italic>TIMD4</italic> (and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> in mice) have also been proposed as a protective tight-junction-forming cell layer that secludes the synovium, and avoid the infiltration of inflammatory cells from the joint cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Overall, TRMs represent the majority of lining and sublining synovial macrophages in healthy donors and RA patients in remission, whereas several inflammatory macrophage subsets (IMs), characterized by TLR activation, interferon signature, alarmin production or antigen-presenting cell profile, are enriched in the synovial tissue of patients with active RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Although these findings have been outstandingly informative, tissue dissociation represents a major limitation inherent to single cell profiling approaches, as critical cells might be lost in the elution process and spatial information is also lost. This is important, as spatial function/identity, both for the stromal microenvironment and immune cell infiltration are increasingly recognized as key for pathogenesis and treatment response in rheumatology, as in oncology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). For example, in oncology, in depth spatial molecular imaging revealed that the proximity of cytotoxic T cells to melanoma cells is associated with positive response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and that specific cellular neighborhoods composed of myeloperoxidase-positive macrophages are associated with long-term survival in patients with glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, a precise spatial characterization of individual cells within their synovial niche using highly multiplexed histology has neither yet been performed in RA, in comparison with healthy or disease control synovial tissue.</p><p id="P5">Here, we performed single-cell high dimensional imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to spatially analyze the expression of 33 proteins at subcellular resolution, comparatively in the synovial tissue of healthy individuals, osteoarthritis (OA) patients who lack severe inflammatory responses, and matched samples from active early treatment-naïve RA patients at baseline and at 6 months after starting a DMARD, namely MTX, treatment. For the first time, we provided a comprehensive characterization of synovial cells in the lining, sublining and ELS niches across healthy and disease conditions. We found that LYVE1<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> TRM population was disturbed in the synovium of early treatment-naive patients and significantly reestablished in a distinct cellular neighborhood following MTX treatment. Furthermore, using ligand-receptor analysis strategies of public scRNAseq databases, we highlighted that LYVE1<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> TRM cell interactions specifically observed in responder RA patients may involve several mediators, such as IL10, C-type lectin receptors and TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK). Overall, this study provides insights into the spatial distribution and the pathogenic connections between synovial niches and highlights key pathways relevant for better understanding RA pathogenesis and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Highplexed imaging mass cytometry highlights high heterogeneity of TRMs within the lining and sublining layers of the synovium</title><p id="P6">To comprehensively profile the cellular composition and spatial organization of RA synovium, we took advantage of the various cluster-specific gene markers recently proposed by scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and developed the workflow presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>. Thirty-three antibodies labeled with unique metal isotopes were validated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and used to identify monocytes and macrophages (CD14, CD68, IBA1), discriminating TRMs (CD163, CD206, MERTK, LYVE1, TIM4) and IMs (HLA-DR, S100A12, SPP1, CCR2, IFI6, CLEC10A), lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, for T cells, CD20 for B cells, and CD138 for plasma cells) and stromal cells (aSMA for smooth muscle cells, CD31 for endothelial cells, both CD90 and PDPN for fibroblasts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In addition, this panel also allowed the characterization of specific cell states, such as cell proliferation (KI67) or apoptosis (cleaved-caspase3). All antibodies were validated in healthy and RA synovial tissues on the basis of their expected staining pattern, including their spatial localization in lining and perivascular areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Forty high-dimensional images were analyzed for a total of 26.85mm<sup>2</sup> of synovial tissue from four healthy donors, four patients with OA exhibiting a low inflammatory profile, and four patients with active RA (Disease Activity Score - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) ≥ 3.9) at baseline before the initiation of treatment. For three of the RA patients, we also included post-treatment biopsies at 6 months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Selected RA patients were positive for autoantibodies (Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody, ACPA<sup>+</sup>).</p><p id="P7">All images were then segmented into 115,411 total cells and an unsupervised clustering approach was used to classify synovial TRMs, IMs, lymphoid and stromal cells. Sixteen distinct subsets of cells were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and this classification was validated by comparing the raw images with the segmented/cell-subset-assigned images and confirming a clear overlap between the staining patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). One additional undefined cell cluster was observed and did not present specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Importantly, by calculating the distance between each cell type from the vascular and lining cells, we obtained a comprehensive spatial cell organization allowing for the annotation of lining (L-) and sublining (SL-) cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The different cell subsets determined by IMC were also compared to the cell clusters determined using public scRNAseq datasets covering 23,759 synovial cells dissociated from the synovium of RA patients (n=11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Using a clusterization approach based on the same markers as in previous IMC analysis, we found similar cell clusters in public scRNAseq datasets, including TRMs, IMs, T and B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial and mural cells comprising smooth muscle cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). Therefore, in addition to confirming the presence of synovial single-cell clusters previously highlighted using scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), IMC provides further insights into their spatial organization.</p><p id="P8">Importantly, we distinguished two distinct lining TRM cell subsets based on their differential expression of TIM4 and MERTK. Lining TRM1 cells (L-TRM1) were CD68<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>TIM4<sup>+</sup>MERTK<sup>low</sup>, whereas L-TRM2 cells were CD68<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>TIM4<sup>-</sup> MERTK<sup>high</sup>, and both expressed the apoptosis marker cleaved-caspase3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>), which is presumably linked to their capacity of phagocyting dying cells (efferocytosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Although L-TRM1 were located at the edge of the synovial lining layer, L-TRM2 were located slightly deeper in the tissue in the lining and proximal sublining region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G-I</xref>). In line with previously published evidence, at the transcriptomic level, scRNAseq confirmed that L-TRM1 cells expressed higher levels of <italic>TIM4</italic> and <italic>TREM2</italic> compared to L-TRM2 cells, and both cell subsets expressed <italic>CD163</italic> and low levels of <italic>MERTK</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). SL-TRM3 cells were found positive for CD206 and LYVE1, dispersed throughout the sublining membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-F</xref>), and resembled perivascular TRM recently described in mice and RA individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Three distinct tissue infiltrating CD14<sup>+</sup> IM clusters were defined based on varying expression of the alarmin S100A12 (SL-IM1), CD11c and HLA-DR (IM2, antigen presenting cells) or osteopontin (SPP1, IM3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C-F</xref>). A small proportion of IM3 cells was also positive for KI67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>), suggesting cell proliferation in this cluster usually linked to tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). A fourth IM cluster, characterized by the expression of CCR2, IFI6 and granzyme B (L-IM4) presented an interferon signature. As expected, CD4 (helper T cells) and CD8 (cytotoxic T cells) were mutually exclusive among the CD3-expressing lymphocytes, and CD20 and CD138 respectively defined B and plasma cells. As previously described, L-fibroblasts were defined by the expression of podoplanin (PDPN<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>-</sup>), whereas SL-fibroblasts lacked PDPN expression but exhibited CD90/THY1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). At the transcriptomic level, L-fibroblasts expressed <italic>PDPN, PRG4, VCAM</italic> and <italic>CD55</italic>, whereas SL-fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of <italic>THY1, DKK3</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). Due to the close proximity between those cells, both smooth muscle cells (aSMA<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial cells (CD31<sup>+</sup>) were clustered together and were identified as vascular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). Overall, our results were concordant with the cell diversity described in the literature based on scRNAseq, CyTOF and multiplexed immunofluorescence technical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) but unveiled higher diversity with three TRM cell subsets displaying distinct spatial organization within the lining and sublining layers of the synovium.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reduced density of synovial TRMs correlates with the infiltration of immune cells in active RA synovium</title><p id="P9">Following the identification of synovial cell subsets, we compared the stromal and immune cell density across patients’ groups. A t-SNE visualization of each cell subset in the synovial tissue of healthy, OA and active treatment-naïve RA is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, and a representative image of their spatial localization is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>. Their respective density (cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and frequency (% of the total number of cells) in each patient group is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, respectively. As expected, a significant increase in both the different lymphoid cell subsets (B, plasma, CD4 and/or CD8 T cells) and the L-fibroblast cell density was observed in the synovium of RA patients as compared to healthy donors or OA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Although not statistically significant, we observed a trend toward an increased synovial density of IM1, IM2 and IM3 cells in active RA compared to healthy donors and their overall proportions were higher in active RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Inversely, the density of most TRM, and specifically L-TRM2 cells, was significantly decreased in RA compared to OA synovial tissues. Altogether, using a precise characterization by IMC, we highlighted the reduction of all three synovial TRM cell subsets in active early treatment-naïve RA patients, concomitantly to the infiltration by numerous lymphoid and IM cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Social network analysis highlights a significant disruption of SL-TRM3 cellular interactions in active RA patients</title><p id="P10">Communications between cells in their tissue environment have been shown to dictate synovial tissue homeostasis but also RA pathogenesis through the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation, autoimmunity and tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To further characterize the patterns of communication between individual synovial cells, a permutation test was performed to define significant interactions between cells as compared to an empirical null distribution. Within the 5 nearest cell neighbors (k=5) and a distance threshold of 20μm, we identified interaction and avoidance behaviors between cell cluster pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) and constructed summary graphs where nodes corresponded to cell types and each arrow matched their proximity and probability of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In healthy individuals, the main cellular network mostly involved sublining cells, including SL-TRM3, SL-fibroblasts and vascular cells. In OA patients, a similar synovial social cell network was observed, but the interactions involving SL-TRM3 cells were reduced whereas the interactions involving L-TRM2 and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were enhanced, especially with L-TRM1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Importantly, in the synovial tissue of early, active, and treatment-naïve RA patients, several cell-cell interactions were disrupted compared to healthy tissues, especially the ones involving SL-TRM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Furthermore, in RA, new specific interactions were revealed, especially involving IMs, lymphoid cells and L-fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). These analysis therefore highlighted that the synovial infiltration by numerous inflammatory cells, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes and IMs, at early stages of RA, creates a dense cellular network in which the homeostatic social network involving SL-TRM3 is disrupted.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The definition of spatial multicellular neighborhoods or niches reveals the dynamic and functional synovial interactions of SL-TRM3 cells</title><p id="P11">We next explored whether multicellular structural analysis, rather than pairwise cell-cell interactions, would provide further insights into the organization and dynamic changes of RA synovial tissue. We performed cellular neighborhood analysis on the IMC multiplexed imaging data and clustered the cells based on the identity of their neighbors within a radius of 20μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We identified nine cellular neighborhoods (herein called “niches”), of which three were localized in the lining (L1 to L3) and six in the sublining (SL1 to 4, ELS1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Lining niches were composed of distinct proportions of L-TRM1 cells (high in L1), L-TRM2 cells (high in L2) and L-fibroblasts (high in L3). The four sublining niches (SL1-4 niches) were mostly composed of vascular cells, SL-fibroblasts and SL-TRM3 cells, which was reminiscent of the principal cell network determined in healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Finally, two additional niches also localized in the sublining compartment were composed of lymphoid cells and IMs cells tightly packed together, forming lymphoid aggregates, and therefore called ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). While the ELS1 niche was mostly composed of lymphoid cells, namely B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, the cellular composition of the ELS2 niche included B cells, plasma cells, but also the 3 IMs cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Representative images of the niches localization are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>. Importantly, ELS1, ELS2 and L3 niches were significantly more abundant in active RA samples, compared to healthy donors or OA patients, whereas, in accordance with the disruption of the synovial lining macrophages observed in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), the density and frequency of the L1 niche composed of L-TRM1 and 2 cells were significantly reduced early in the disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Although not statistically significant, we also observed a decreased density and frequency of the SL1 and SL3 niches, which can be partly explained by the reduced density of SL-TRM3 cells in active RA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">While each niche can represent the site of unique and local cellular interactions, distinct niches may also be interacting to support additional biological events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We therefore generated a spatial niche interaction graph for each patient group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>) and provided a comprehensive locoregional niches map based on the strength of the interactions between niches, their density, and their precise tissue location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). A schematic representation of the cellular composition of each niche was also provided to summarize our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). In healthy donors, the main interactions were observed between L1, L2, SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4 niches. Of interest, the cells in these niches (TRMs, fibroblasts and vascular cells) are considered tissue resident or structural cells, thus highlighting the features of a basal structural and homoeostatic interaction map within the synovial tissue. In OA synovium, a similar cartography was observed but a central position of the ELS1 niche, interacting with L2, SL2 and SL4 niches, was underlined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). In active RA patients, the L3, ELS1 and ELS2 synovial niches composed of all infiltrating proinflammatory immune cells and L-fibroblasts, established novel interactions between them and with the homeostatic niches, therefore highlighting profound alterations compared to the basal picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed the loss of L1 and SL3 niches involvement in RA cellular interactive map, as well as the disruption of specific interactions, such as L2 with SL2 or with SL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that the infiltration of numerous immune cells, the formation of perivascular ELS niches, as well as the expansion of fibroblasts in the lining layer, characterizing the RA synovial tissue, have a profound impact on the whole synovial architecture and the underlying cellular communications. Most notably, as observed at the individual cell level, these results confirmed that the perivascular SL3 niche, mainly composed of SL-TRM3 cells, was profoundly altered in early active and treatment-naive RA patients.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SL-TRM3 cells are reestablished following efficient csDMARD treatment</title><p id="P13">To study the impact of csDMARD treatment on the altered synovial cellular network observed in active RA patients, we next performed paired analysis of matched RA patients prior to therapeutic intervention and 6-months following efficient csDMARD treatment with MTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The proportions of SL-TRM3 and vascular cells were significantly enhanced, whereas CD4 T cells and SL-fibroblasts proportions were significantly decreased by MTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Importantly, 6-months following efficient csDMARD treatment, we observed that the cellular interactions involving SL-TRM3 cells were partially reestablished, for example with L-fibroblasts, L-TRM2 and vascular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). In addition, MTX treatment induced novel interactions, such as between SL-TRM3 and plasma cells, whereas preexisting interactions persisted post-treatment, such as with SL-fibroblasts and CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Interestingly, upon MTX treatment and along with an increased proportion of the SL1 and SL3 niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>), SL3 reestablished significant connections with SL1 and SL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B</xref>), as observed in homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Similarly, the interaction between L2 and SL4 niches was recovered in the synovial tissue from responder RA patients, and the strength of several interactions, such as ELS2-L2, L2-L3 or SL4-L3, was downregulated compared to baseline RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). Overall, the response to csDMARD therapy was associated with a partial recovery of the basal homeostatic synovial cartography, sustaining the particular involvement of SL-TRM3 cells. In particular, we highlighted the key role of SL-TRM3 intra- and inter-niche interactions with vascular cells and SL-fibroblasts (SL1, SL3 and SL4 niches), CD4+ T and plasma cells (ELS1 and ELS2 niches), L-fibroblasts and L-TRM2 cells (L2 niches) in treatment response.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Combined spatial synovial mapping and scRNAseq ligand-receptor analysis underline SL-TRM3 cellular pathways linked to csDMARD treatment response</title><p id="P14">To further highlight the pathways that govern cell communications within the synovial niches, we further analyzed the public scRNAseq datasets of synovial cells dissociated from the synovium of patients with active RA (n=8) and in remission (n=3) introduced previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).

We compared, for the first time, healthy tissues with OA and matched active treatment-naïve and csDMARD-treated responder RA synovium and highlighted disease- and treatment-response-specific alterations of the synovial cellular network and their underlying disrupted cellular pathways compared to homeostatic conditions.</p><p id="P17">Using a 33-antibodies panel, we were able to distinguish sixteen distinct immune and stromal cell subsets and to spatially map each of these subsets within the lining and the sublining synovial regions. Overall, we highlighted the presence of seven macrophage subsets, for which the spatial features and expression profile confirmed and expanded the diversity described in the literature using scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). By using a distinct but complementary approach and clustering the cells based on the identity of their neighbors within the synovium, we then identified the presence of nine relevant synovial niches, of which three were localized in the lining (L1 to L3) and six in the sublining (SL1 to 4, ELS1 and 2).</p><p id="P18">We first underlined that two distinct TRM cell subsets can be found in the lining layer, depending on their expression of TIM4 and MERTK. L-TRM1 cells expressed <italic>CD163</italic>, <italic>TIM4, TREM2</italic> and <italic>MERTK</italic>, were located at the edge of the lining layer and were abundant in healthy synovium, in line with their previously described homeostatic, phagocytic and anti-inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). L-TRM2 cells expressed lower level of <italic>TIM4</italic> and <italic>TREM2</italic>, correlated to MERTK<sup>+</sup>TREM2<sup>low</sup> cells described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We show here that they can be found deeper in the proximal sublining layer and were most abundant in OA synovium. Whether L-TRM2 cells represent the pro-inflammatory state of L-TRM1 cells with lost barrier and homeostatic functions or originates from another cell subset now deserves further studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). We also observed that lining fibroblasts expressing PDPN were expanded in RA and mainly localized in the L3 niches, where, as previously described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), they assume a central position by connecting with lining L-TRM1 cells but also with sublining cells and niches. This expansion matched with a significant reduction of the density and frequency of the L1 niche mainly composed of L-TRM1 cells in RA, confirming previous studies that demonstrated a significant disruption of the lining myeloid barrier that physically secludes the joint in homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Within the sublining compartment, notably, different subsets of IMs and lymphoid cells were shown to communicate together and form two distinct ELS niches. Such ELS organization recapitulates the architecture of secondary lymphoid organs, with (i) a distinct T cell rich zone in contact with a B cell rich area; (ii) a network of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and activated resident stromal cells such as fibroblasts; and (iii) the presence of high endothelial venules (HEVs) that participate to T and B cells recruitment and in situ differentiation into plasma cells, that produce somatically mutated disease-specific autoreactive antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Our multiplexed spatial approach supports this view and provides additional insights into ELS organization. The ELS1 niche has a relative enrichment for T cells and few B cells, corresponding with the T cell rich zone, whereas the ELS2 niche has many more B cells and fewer T cells, corresponding with the B cell rich area. Of note, CD11C<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (IM2 cells), resembling FDC, were observed withing the ELS2 niche. In the context of active RA and before any treatment intervention, both ELS niches were also strongly connected with resident sublining fibroblasts (PDPN<sup>-</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>) near vascular vessels belonging to the SL1 and SL4 niches, consistent with the described presence of activated stromal cells and HEVs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Importantly, we also highlighted the presence of different subtypes of IMs cells within the ELS2 niche. Although analyzing the expression of additional markers would be necessary to further characterize ELS cells such as FDC, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, T regulatory (Treg) cells, plasmablasts, activated stromal cells, and endothelial cells, our data clearly indicates that several inflammatory myeloid cells with potent roles on monocyte and fibroblast activation (IM1, S100A12<sup>+</sup>), antigen presentation (IM2, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>), neutrophil activation and matrix remodeling (IM3, SPP1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) were localized in closed proximity to the cells involved in ELS functions and enriched in active RA.</p><p id="P20">As despite the availability of a large variety of conventional, biologic, and synthetic DMARDs approved for the treatment of RA, 40% of patients still do not respond to treatment, understanding molecular signatures underlying the variety of clinical and treatment-response phenotypes remains one of the major areas of research in rheumatology, with the aim of developing personalized therapies for RA patients. Here, we chose to focus our analyses on RA patients who, 6-months following csDMARD treatment, presented a good or moderate treatment response, in order to decipher the complex biological mechanisms driving the resolution of inflammation. We demonstrated that a key cellular social network involved in the homeostasis of healthy synovium comprised SL-TRM3 cells, SL-fibroblasts and vascular cells in SL1 to 4 niches within the sublining membrane, while, in active RA, the loss of SL-TRM3 cells induced profound changes in the SL1 and SL3 organization. Importantly, csDMARD treatment was able to induce a partial recovery of the basal homeostatic synovial cartography i.e. part restoration of SL-TRM3 cells, allowing, for example, the reorganization of lining fibroblasts and TRMs cells similar to the healthy or OA situation. The homeostatic proportion of SL-TRM3 was indeed partly recovered 6-months after MTX treatment, and these cells established strong interactions with IMs, TRMs, lymphoid and stromal cells. Perivascular SL-TRM3 cells are positive for the hyaluronan receptor LYVE1 and the mannose receptor CD206, and are thought to control homeostatic collagen production, prevent leukocyte infiltration and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). They are therefore well adapted to exert beneficial roles in response to treatment.</p><p id="P21">To overcome the technical limitation that currently restricts the maximum number of markers that can be simultaneously analyzed using the IMC approach (33 antibodies in this study), we further dissected the molecular basis of synovial cell communications by combining IMC with public scRNAseq datasets analysis and explored a large number of cell-cell communications based on ligand-receptor interactions. We observed that in the synovial tissue of RA patients in remission, SL-TRM3 cells communicate with IMs and TRMs through <italic>IL10</italic> and complement <italic>C3</italic>, with the presumed scope of limiting inflammation, cytokines production and stimulate the phagocytosis of damaged materials and immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). SL-TRM3 cells also produced more <italic>TWEAK (TNFSF12)</italic> and <italic>IGF1</italic> targeting vascular cells and SL-fibroblasts, supporting the notion that these pathways are linked to remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). In addition, DMARD treatment significantly influenced SL-TRM3 to express more <italic>CLEC2B</italic> and <italic>CD86</italic> to interact with <italic>KLRB1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>CD28</italic><sup>+</sup> T cells, thus also regulating T cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).

TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) receptors have been shown to negatively regulate the inflammatory cascade involved in RA pathophysiology and mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

Further studies should assess whether tissues presenting other histopathological profiles (pauci-immune and diffuse-myeloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) exhibit specific disease- and treatment-response related cellular and molecular pathways. Moreover, although one of the strengths of our study consist in the comparison of the expression of 33 proteins between paired synovial samples of active treatment-naïve and csDMARD-treated responders RA patients, our combined scRNAseq analysis based on public datasets focused on the comparison between active and remission RA patients.

Seurat was used to identify clusters with a resolution setting of 0.6. Macrophages and T cells were sub-clustered with a resolution setting of 0.3. The clusters were manually annotated according to IMC clusters by identifying the differentially expressed genes using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat and focusing on the markers used for IMC. Clusters annotated as “fibro”, “prolif”, “undefined” and “T cells” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> were not considered for further analyses. Scatter plots of the mean expression for each marker and proportion of expressing cells were generated using ggplot2.</p><p id="P39">Ligand-receptor analysis were performed using the CellChat (v1.6.1) R package workflow using default settings, adding the S100As ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) into the CellChatDB interaction file. We compared active RA versus remission RA samples. All outgoing / incoming signaling patterns and differential interactions were first computed. We then focused on all signaling changes of SL-TRM3 cells in active versus remission RA samples. For each analysis, we provided examples of differential ligand-receptor interaction using the netVisual chord diagram and bubble plot functions.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P40">Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v8 statistical software.
