The cell is the basic unit of biological systems, and yet, the study of cell type allometry remains relatively unexplored. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a promising tool for investigating cell type allometry. Planarians, capable of growing and degrowing following allometric scaling rules, serve as an excellent model for such studies. We used scRNA-seq to examine cell type allometry in asexual planarians of different sizes, revealing that they consist of the same basic cell types but in varying proportions. Notably, the gut basal cells are the most responsive to changes in size, suggesting a role in energy storage. We capture the gene regulatory programs of distinct cell types in response to size. This research sheds light on the molecular and cellular aspects of cell type allometry in planarians and underscores the utility of scRNA-seq in such investigations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Allometry studies how body parts, structures, or processes in an organism relate to its overall body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). It is important for understanding ecology, physiology, metabolism, disease, and other aspects of organismal biology. Scaling laws often govern allometry, such as the Kleiber law that relates metabolism to body size using a 3/4 power function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P3">While allometry has been classically studied using whole organism parts, the study of allometry at the cell type level is still vastly unexplored. Cells are the fundamental units of life, serving as building blocks of multicellular organisms. They can be classified in different types, based on their morphology, function, or gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, the exact definition of a cell type is still a topic of debate and controversy among researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Despite the importance of cell types in understanding biological systems, the study of how cell types vary with size (i.e. cell type allometry) is still a largely unexplored field. Advances have been made using morphological cell type classifications and markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) but these are typically limited to one or few cell types. Whether cell types vary with size, and how, is still a question, for most cell types, in most organisms.</p><p id="P4">The study of cell types has been enhanced by single cell methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), particularly single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), which measures the expression of hundreds to thousands of individual transcripts in thousands of cells. Each cell type is characterised by specific expression of effector and regulatory genes, allowing clustering algorithms to reveal the presence of cell populations. However, it is still unclear how these populations correspond to cell types as opposed to other cell states such as stress, differentiation or developmental states. Despite this, scRNA-seq enables quick and simple classification of cells into largely interpretable populations, such as neurons, muscle cells, and epidermal cells.</p><p id="P5">Single cell analysis techniques have potential for studying cell type allometry, but several challenges remain to be addressed. Cell dissociation techniques can cause stress responses and biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), leading to cell death and differential survival. Including different samples can also lead to batch effects. However, fixative cell dissociation approaches like ACME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) can address the first concern, while combinatorial single cell transcriptomic approaches like SPLiT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) allow for sample multiplexing and convenient multi-sample experiments. Combining ACME and SPLiT-seq could therefore enhance the study of cell type allometry.</p><p id="P6">Planarians are an interesting model for studying cell type allometry because apart from growing when fed, they can degrow when starved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This process follows allometric scaling rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). They exhibit a wide range of body sizes, with sexual populations typically being larger than asexual ones. Romero and Baguñà examined cell dissociations from animals of varying sizes to study 13 basic cell types based on their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). They showed that body size increases mostly by increases in cell numbers, with quantitative changes in the proportions of cell types. For example, larger planarians have a decrease in neuron proportion and an increase in fixed parenchymal cells. Thommen and coworkers established that the metabolic rate in planarians also follows the Kleiber law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Interestingly, larger planarians have more cells, but their cellular size scales with mass following a 3/4 power relationship. This indicates that larger planarians have many more cells, but that at least some of these cells are also larger. It remains unknown if this applies to all cell types or if it is largely driven by one or few cell types. Planarians are an excellent model for single cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), but the allometry of their cell types has not been investigated yet with these methods.</p><p id="P7">Here, we aimed to investigate the allometry of cell types in asexual planarians using scRNA-seq across body size categories. To minimise batch effects and enable an integrated analysis, we used SPLiT-seq to multiplex planarians of different sizes in a single experiment. Our findings reveal that asexual planarians of different sizes are made of the same cell types in different proportions. Specifically, smaller planarians exhibit a higher proportion of neurons and fewer parenchymal cells. Unlike previous studies, scRNA-seq has greater resolution on which types of neurons and parenchymal cells vary the most. Notably, further to cell proportions, scRNA-seq allows us to access cell type specific genetic programs. Our data shows that epidermal cells and the recently discovered basal cells are the ones that respond more dynamically to organism size at the transcriptomic level. Overall, our results show that scRNA-seq using ACME and SPLiT-seq is a powerful method to study cell type allometry that can be applied to virtually any organism. Our data reveals the basic principles of cell type scaling at the cellular and molecular level.</p><sec id="S2"><title>A single cell approach for studying cell type allometry</title><p id="P8">We aimed at generating one scRNA-seq experiment to multiplex asexual planarians of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first selected asexual planarians from our cultures and classified them in sizes by visual inspection. To corroborate our inspection, we took low resolution images using a general field camera and measured the area of each individual using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was done to avoid the stress of monitoring the animals under a bright light prior to single cell transcriptomics. We undertook the image capture immediately prior to cell dissociation, to avoid that animals vary in size further after capture and to avoid fission events that would modify the sizes. We used ACME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) to dissociate the different sized animals in 4 independent cell dissociations. We initially aimed at classifying 4 body sizes, but found that the two higher size classes overlapped significantly and decided to consider them as one class. We therefore considered 3 classes of body size, termed Large (L), Medium (M) and Small (S). Measuring the area of the individual animals revealed a good size separation in 3 classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). The mean size of our classes was 8.04, 4.02 and 1.24 mm2 for L, M and S planarians respectively. The larger planarian measured 12.98 mm2 and the smaller measured 0.30mm2, encompassing a ~43-fold difference in area. In the average populations the fold difference between L and S planarians was 6.45. To achieve comparable cell numbers we used 35, 50 and 100 animals of L, M and S sizes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>A cell type atlas of planarian body sizes</title><p id="P9">We then subjected these cell dissociations to scRNA-seq, multiplexing the different classes using RT barcodes in SPLiT-seq’s first combinatorial barcoding round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This step allows demultiplexing the cells coming from each sample in the data analysis steps. After this first round, cells are pooled and every subsequent barcoding, sorting and library preparation step is performed in pools of cells containing all samples, therefore minimising batch effects. Furthermore, SPLiT-seq is very robust against ambient RNA, as the successive pooling and centrifugation steps select the material encapsulated in cells, while the supernatants (with any soluble ambient RNA released from the cell suspension) are eliminated in each round. We implemented FACS sorting after the 3<sup>rd</sup> round of combinatorial barcoding, a step that allows us to sort barcoded whole cells into the lysis buffer, prior to the 4<sup>th</sup> round of barcoding. This step drastically reduces the presence of broken cells and particles of cellular debris in the experiment. We obtained two sub-libraries which were subjected to the 4<sup>th</sup> round of barcoding during library preparation. In these conditions, the cost of a single SPLiT-seq experiment is around ~£750 in enzymes, FACS sorting time and library preparation reagents, making it an affordable scRNA-seq approach. We sequenced the library pool using Illumina NovaSeq technology, to obtain 715 million paired-end reads.</p><p id="P10">We then processed these reads through our SPLiT-seq analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The final dataset contained 28,738 cells, consistent with the ~19Kx2 cells observed in each of the 2 FACS sorted samples. Leiden clustering revealed the presence of ~40-73 cell clusters, depending on clustering resolution. We selected resolution 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which resolved 64 cell populations, largely corresponding to planarian well known cell types. We grouped these cell type identities in broad groups by hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We annotated cell clusters using previous literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Files 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and cross referencing published markers with markers obtained from this experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Files 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>). Our dataset resolves 3 types of differentiated muscle cells, 3 epidermal and gastrodermal differentiation states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), and up to 17 neuronal cell populations. This resolution reveals clusters containing relatively rare cell types such as the glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, 0.19 %), the psd+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, 0.26%), but fails to resolve the photoreceptors which are clustered together with other cholinergic neurons. We annotated cluster 13 as the basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>), which had been clustered together with phagocytes and goblet cells in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Neoblasts were clustered in 3 major clusters, including one cluster that we called “committed neoblasts” as it expressed markers of differentiation to gastrodermal and epidermal types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Finally, a number of small cell types (10 clusters, 315 cells, 1.1 %, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Files 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>) had unspecific markers or no significant markers were interpreted as putative doublets, and were left unannotated in the final dataset. SPLiT-seq resulted in a low UMI and gene per cell content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-D</xref>), but allowed us to distinguish 55 annotated cell clusters. The average mean counts and genes per cluster vary from cluster to cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-D</xref>). To elucidate whether this variation is technical, or reflects biological properties of the cells instead, we studied the relationship between counts and cells at the cell and cluster level. The number of genes detected in each cell largely correlates with the number of counts obtained, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>). However, at the cluster level averages, some clusters deviate from the correlation: secretory cell types have more counts than other cell clusters with similar gene counts, consistent with the idea that they express a few genes at higher levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). The cluster with more gene counts and UMI counts is nanos+ germ cell progenitors, consistent with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These observations indicate that the variations in cluster counts and genes are biological signals. Altogether, these results show that our ACME + SPLiT-seq approach reliably detects dozens of cell clusters.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Asexual planarians of different sizes are made of the same cell types</title><p id="P11">We aimed to determine if all body sizes have the same cell types, building on previous studies that found no evidence of size-dependent cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, the increased resolution of our dataset raised the possibility of identifying more specialised cell types that could be size dependent. For instance, larger organisms may have specialised energy storage types. Furthermore, processes like sexualization are known to lead to the formation of new organs (e.g. gonads and reproductive apparatuses). Therefore, to determine if there are body size specific cell types we assessed if all detected cell populations were present across all body sizes.</p><p id="P12">We first examined qualitatively the distribution of L, M and S cells in the UMAP space. Interpreting UMAPs in such a way is controversial as dimensionality reduction techniques and low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data are known to introduce distortions of the dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). On the other hand, our multiplexed analysis to minimise batch effects allows us to expect a homogeneous distribution of all three samples, except for biological differences. Therefore, we investigated UMAP distribution differences as an exploratory analysis to motivate further inquiry. In our dataset, L, M and S cells were homogeneously distributed throughout the UMAP except in regions corresponding to the basal cells (cluster 13), the epidermis (cluster 19) and secretory 4 (cluster 54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to investigate if these effects are underlied by biological differences or stochastic variation due to dimensionality reduction, we explored the parameter space of our PCA, k-nearest neighbours embedding and UMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This analysis revealed that UMAP differences in basal cells were observable in all analyses with at least 55 Principal Components, and in spite of the k-nearest neighbour parameter. This strongly suggests that the differences in the basal cell cluster are of biological source and motivated further inquiry.</p><p id="P13">We then asked if these differences translated into size category specific cell clusters. To decouple this analysis from the resolution parameter of the cell clustering algorithm, we performed this analysis using 4 different resolutions of the leiden algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). This analysis showed that all 3 size categories have cells from all clusters except for the smallest clusters, i.e. cluster 64 of resolution 3 (11 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and cluster 72 of resolution 4 (8 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This strongly suggests that this is a sampling effect due to the small cell numbers of these clusters. Further to that, cluster 54 of resolution 3 and clusters 43 and 57 of resolution 4 are largely made of L and M cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-G</xref>), with only a few S cells (1 in each case). These clusters correspond to the differences observed before on UMAP space. Cells from cluster 19 of resolution 3, corresponding to the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), are sub-clustered in 2 clusters of resolution 4, clusters 29 and 43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The latter cluster is made majoritarily of cells from the Large sample (125 L, 12 M and 1 S) and expresses markers of both epidermis and late epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 4</xref>). Cluster 13 of resolution 3, containing the basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), remains one cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) at resolution 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we argue that the basal cells are one cell type and the differences observed in UMAP space correspond to differences in the state of basal cells. Overall, this analysis shows that asexual planarians of our 3 size categories are made of the same essential cell clusters but that differences in cell type abundance may exist.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Differences in cell proportions in planarians of different sizes at single cell resolution</title><p id="P14">We then analysed the differences in cell type frequency between L, M and S planarians. In order to visualise these differences in the UMAP space we plotted the percentage ratios of each cell cluster in large vs small planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The values examined correspond to the logarithmic ratio between the percentage of each cluster in L samples vs S samples. In this representation, a log2 ratio of 1 indicates that the cell cluster percentage is double in L than in S samples.</p><p id="P15">We analysed the frequencies using a chi squared test with a Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 7</xref>). To elucidate if our results compare well with those published by microscopical observation, we first analysed the dataset grouped by broad type category. This grouping made our categories largely comparable with those analysed by Baguñà and Romero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Our analysis revealed an increased frequency of neurons in small planarians, and a decrease in large planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with the microscopy findings. On the contrary, we observed significantly increased frequencies in large, and decreased in small, for the neoblasts, parenchymal, epidermal, phagocytes, and goblet/basal cell broad categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The increases in parenchymal, phagocytes and goblet/basal are also consistent with the reported increases of fixed parenchymal cells, gastrodermal and goblet cells in the microscopy data. Our analysis revealed tendencies inconsistent with those reported by Baguña and Romero for the neoblast and epidermis broad groups, which were described to be more frequent in small planarians.</p><p id="P16">Next, we repeated this analysis in our 55 annotated clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This analysis revealed that the clusters neoblasts 2 and committed neoblasts showed opposite trends, with the neoblasts 2 overrepresented in small planarians, and the committed neoblasts underrepresented in small planarians and overrepresented in large planarians instead. This can potentially explain the discrepancy with the microscopy dataset, as this dataset did not include progenitor cells. It is unclear how this study classified cells that have started to differentiate, but likely these cells already displayed differentiation markers and were classified within their differentiated type category. Next, we examined the individual neuron clusters. We found significant overrepresentation in small and underrepresentation in large for the chat+ neurons clusters 1 and 2, the th+ neurons and the pkd-2+ neurons. Most other neuron clusters had similar tendencies but were not significant in this analysis. Among the parenchymal broad group, we found that the pgrn+ clusters 1 and 2 were significantly enriched in large planarians and significantly underrepresented in small and medium planarians. Furthermore, the ldlrr+ cells were also found significantly reduced in small planarians. Interestingly, the aqp+ cells were overrepresented in medium planarians, and was the only cluster with this behaviour. The biology and function of the parenchymal cells is still enigmatic, and the biological significance of this observation is unclear. From the epidermal cells, we found significant enrichment in large planarians for the early epidermal progenitors and the epidermis. We also found a significant enrichment of phagocyte progenitors 1, secretory 4 cells and the basal cells. Altogether, this analysis shows that single cell transcriptomics has higher resolution and is able to detect significant differences at the cell cluster level, beyond the broad type categories.</p><p id="P17">Next, we analysed each of these clusters, but compared to their broad category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This analysis aimed to identify cell types that behave contrary to their broad type. Our results corroborated the contrary tendencies of neoblasts 2 and committed neoblasts. We also observed that trpm-2-2+ neurons were enriched in the neuronal subgroup of large planarians, a trend opposite to that of neurons as a group. Other clusters behaved similarly, but were not significant. Of note, the neuronal progenitors also have a significant enrichment in the neuronal broad group of large planarians. This analysis also revealed a significant enrichment of body wall muscle in small planarians when compared to the muscle broad group. Within the parenchymal broad group, we found highly significant underrepresentation of pgrn+ and ldlrr+ cells in small planarians and underrepresentation of pigment cells in large planarians. Collectively, these results show that studying allometry with single cell transcriptomics has a high resolution and identifies several cell types that behave contrary to their broad type categories.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Head cell types are enriched in small planarians, and intestinal and parenchymal cell types are enriched in large planarians</title><p id="P18">We then tested if the patterns observed could be explained by anatomical features. In order to investigate this we compared the percentage ratios of each cell cluster in large vs small planarians sorted by Broad Type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) to the same values sorted by Body Region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We assigned cell clusters to anatomical features based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 2</xref>). In brief, “body wall” corresponded to body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), protonephridia distal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), and the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). “Intestine” cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) included phagocytes, goblet cells, basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), psd+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and intestinal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). All neuronal types as well as the cell cluster described as glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) were classified as “nervous system”. “Pharynx” contains the pharynx cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and the muscle of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). All other cell clusters were considered part of the “parenchyma”, i.e. the space between the body wall and the intestine. This included parenchymal cells (excluding pigment and glia, located in the body wall and the nervous system), secretory cell types, neoblasts and progenitor clusters. This analysis revealed that body regions largely explain the observed frequencies, with nervous system cell types being broadly enriched in small planarians, and intestinal and parenchymal cell types being broadly enriched in large planarians. In order to gain more insight into this notion we examined the most extreme values of these distributions and seeked to validate these observations by querying previously published in situ hybridisation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Cluster 42 cells were the nervous system cell cluster with the highest L to S ratio, a pattern dissimilar to other neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In fact, cluster 42 cells were not enriched in heads but are distributed throughout the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Cluster 55 secretory cells had the lowest enrichment in L samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, their distribution showed accumulation in head regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), explaining the enrichment in S samples, similar to that of neuron types. In stark contrast, cluster 44 secretory cells had the strongest enrichment in L samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistently, we observed that these cells are broadly distributed throughout the parenchyma, but depleted from the head region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Finally, we examined cluster 24, containing ldlrr+ parenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) as it showed prominent enrichment in L samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The expression pattern revealed that these cells were associated with gut tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Altogether, these analyses show that small planarians have comparatively more head cell types, including nervous and secretory types, and large planarians instead quantitatively contain more parenchymal and intestinal cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Differential gene expression analysis reveals cell type specific size-related gene programs</title><p id="P19">We then aimed at determining if cell types change their gene expression patterns in response to animal size. For this analysis we focused on large and small samples. Taking full advantage of our multiplexed single cell approach, we aggregated cluster information to generate pseudobulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) count tables for each specific cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We used the two libraries of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) as pseudoreplicates. The two libraries come from the same experiment and can only be considered technical replicates of the tagmentation and 4th barcoding step. However, we reasoned that these are indeed made of completely different cells. It has been recently shown that pseudoreplication (i.e. computationally distributing cells in random groups to obtain replicate information) works well for single cell differential gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Arguably, this is because in single cell approaches there is an additional level of biological replication in the single cell barcoding. We analysed the 65 independent cluster-aggregated count tables using DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) to identify genes differentially regulated by size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 8</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To elucidate if there are cell types that respond more dynamically to size differences we examined the relationship between cluster size and the number of differential genes detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) in each cell cluster. The number of differential genes increased with cluster size, since this is correlated with the number of reads that go into the analysis, maximising its power. However, two clusters lie outside of this distribution, with a much higher number of differentially regulated genes: the epidermis (cluster 19) and the basal cells (cluster 13). These are the clusters identified in the UMAP analysis, likely explaining the UMAP differences. These lists overlapped by only 3 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the differences in gene expression of epidermal and basal cells are largely independent and cell type specific. This analysis shows that the epidermis and the basal cells are the planarian cell types that respond more dynamically to animal size at the gene expression level, with largely independent genetic programs.</p><p id="P21">To examine the genes that are differentially regulated in the epidermis and the basal cells we obtained volcano plots and analysed the GO term enrichment of up- and down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6D-E</xref>). Genes differentially expressed in epidermal cells from small animals were enriched in cilium and other related GOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Genes differentially expressed in epidermal cells of large animals were enriched in creatine metabolism and other metabolic processes, suggesting that in large planarians epidermal cells carry out metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Key genes in this enrichment are AGAT enzymes (h1SMcG0009479, h1SMcG0009480, h1SMcG0011148), which have been already described in planarian late epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Genes differentially expressed in small basal cells were enriched in ceramide sphingolipid biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Genes differentially expressed in basal cells of large animals were enriched in lipoprotein particle assembly, retinoid and terpenoid metabolism genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Finally, to elucidate if these genes are exclusively expressed in the epidermis and basal cell clusters or if contrarily they are expressed more generally in other clusters as well, we examined their UMAP feature plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We found that the differentially expressed genes are expressed in other cell types. We then scored the expression of these gene sets to obtain a general view of their grouped expression. This analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes in epidermis and basal cells are enriched in the UMAP areas of differential distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that these genes explain these differences. Altogether, these analyses show that epidermal and basal cells are the cell types that are most responsive to animal size as they exist in two states with their specific gene expression patterns, largely related to their metabolism. On one hand, large planarians have epidermal cells that express late epidermal progenitor genes, suggesting that their differentiation process is longer. On the other hand, basal cells in large planarians express lipid metabolism genes. This is consistent with the accumulation of lipids around the basal area of the gut described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), although the existence of the basal cells was only shown later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Cell type allometry is a key question in developmental biology, but it has remained mysterious in many organisms due to the lack of cell type markers (antibodies, RNA probes). Furthermore, cell quantification with methods of immunohistochemistry and/or <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation is challenging at full body scale. Cell type identification based on microscopic observation presents a subjective component. Finally, these methods can only identify a few cell types and lack resolution.</p><p id="P24">Here we showed that single cell transcriptomics solves these challenges by providing a method to identify and quantify all major cell types in different samples. Beyond that, scRNA-seq allows accessing the gene expression patterns of each cell type. To achieve this level of resolution it is key to use fixation methods such as ACME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and multiplexing approaches such as SPLiT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). These methods will open the door to studying cell type allometry and other cell type quantitative studies in virtually every organism.</p><p id="P25">Planarians are an excellent model to study cell type allometry because of their ability to grow and degrow with food availability. Previous studies have already shown that neurons are enriched in small planarians and that gut and parenchymal cell types are enriched in large planarians. Our study confirmed these trends, but provided higher resolution. For instance, we were able to identify neuron types that are not enriched in small planarians and secretory types enriched in heads. Our results show that the ratios for each cell type are largely explained by their anatomical location, despite their broad cell type identity, with small planarians having an enrichment of head cell types.</p><p id="P26">Baguña and Romero showed that asexual planarians were made of the same basic 13 broad cell types in varying proportions. We confirm these results, but at a higher resolution of ~55 annotated cell clusters. Single cell transcriptomics is changing the way we think about cell types, showing that granularity is key to their definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We were able to show that there are no cell clusters specific to large or small asexual planarians at our current level of resolution. Remarkably, we were able to distinguish up to 17 types of neurons, 7 types of parenchymal cells and 9 types of secretory cells, and found them all represented in all size categories. While further subdivision of these types might lead to the identification of types specific to small or large planarians in the future, the question would then be if these correspond to cell types or if they constitute different cell states of the same specific cell types.</p><p id="P27">Importantly, we identify cell states characteristic of large planarians for the epidermis and the basal cells. We argue that these represent states instead of types because 1) they are just defined by a few quantitative differences in gene expression and 2) they share general markers of their cell type. Increasing the resolution of the Leiden clustering algorithm can cluster these cells out, but at these high resolutions other cell types are divided in clusters that lack meaningful markers and are largely explained by noise. Our results delve further into the definitions of cell type and cell state, and will offer insight to other researchers investigating the nature of cell type identity.</p><p id="P28">Crucially, we are able to access the gene expression patterns of these cell types and states, and identify differentially regulated genes. Further studies will identify more gene expression differences, enabled by deeper resolutions, larger cell numbers and increased number of samples and replicates. This will allow us to study their transcriptional regulation, including the transcription factors that regulate the differences. Combinatorial barcoding scRNA-seq methods such as SPLiT-seq and other single cell analysis methods will be key to decode the cellular and molecular principles of cell type allometry, as well as other developmental paradigms.</p><p id="P29">Our results are largely consistent with those of Baguñà and Romero’s microscopic study, except for 2 key broad groups: the neoblasts, and the epidermis. Key to understanding this discrepancy is the fact that the microscopy study did not identify progenitor cells. We were able to identify 7 progenitor clusters, the majority of which are enriched in large samples. This also applies to the committed neoblast cluster. It is unclear whether Baguñà and Romero classified progenitor cells with neoblasts or with their corresponding cell fate broad group. The overrepresentation of progenitors in large planarians raises interesting hypotheses about the dynamics of cellular differentiation. For instance the differentiated epidermis contains a group of cells that clusters together with the mature epidermis but contains late epidermal progenitor cell markers, and is highly enriched in large planarians. This could indicate a longer time of differentiation for epidermal cells in large planarians. Future research will address the dynamics of cell differentiation in planarians and other organisms using single cell transcriptomics.</p><p id="P30">The most dynamic cell type in planarians of different sizes are the basal cells, as they change both their frequency and their gene expression patterns. This type was only described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) with proposed metabolic functions. In previous single cell transcriptomic dataset, the basal cells are found clustered together with other gut cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), primarily goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), due to their similarity. Likely, the basal cells host the size-dependent lipid accumulations described by Thomenn <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Our data shows that basal cells exist in two states characterised by their gene expression patterns. Basal cells in large animals express lipid particle synthesis and assembly genes.

We proceeded to measure the area of the individual animals to ensure the accuracy of our examination and quantify the size separation range. The images were processed and analysed using ImageJ 1.51d software, treating them as 8-bit pictures, enabling us to measure the animal’s area in pixels.

These steps included read alignment, barcode demultiplexing, and removal of low-quality or duplicate reads. The sequencing was performed with 150 bp length, paired-end reads. However, the reads were provided without any extensive quality verification apart from a basic chastity check. Therefore, we conducted initial quality checks using the FastQC software. To further improve the quality of the data, we utilized the CutAdapt v2.1 tool.

Additionally, each gene in the adata.var was tagged with the previously described gene annotations.</p><p id="P57">We applied additional quality control (QC) measures to the scRNA-seq data in order to eliminate low-quality cells. Specifically, we used the command “sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_counts=100)” to filter out cells with a low number of UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifiers), and “sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=100)” to filter out cells with a low expression of genes. To further assess the quality of the data, QC metrics were calculated using the command “sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, qc_vars=[‘mt’], percent_top=None, log1p=False, inplace=True)”. Cells with a low number of expressed genes are often indicative of poor quality or technical artifacts, and therefore, they were excluded from further analysis. Similarly, cells with a low total UMI count may be associated with low RNA content or technical issues, so they were also excluded to improve the downstream analysis quality. To achieve this, we filtered the matrix in the Anndata object, removing cells where the number of expressed genes was less than 900 using the command “adata = adata[adata.obs.n_genes_by_counts &lt; 900, :]”, and cells where the total molecule count was less than 1200 using the command “adata = adata[adata.obs.total_counts &lt; 1200, :]”. Furthermore, we performed normalization to ensure consistent read counts across cells, which was accomplished using the command “sc.pp.normalize_total(adata)”. Subsequently, the data was log-transformed to stabilize the variances, and variable genes were identified to pinpoint genes that exhibited significant expression variation across cells. For this purpose, the top 24,000 variable genes were selected using the command “sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=24000)”.</p><p id="P58">To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, we used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction). PCA was performed on the first 150 principal components using the command “sc.tl.pca(adata, svd_solver=‘arpack’, n_comps=150)”. An elbow plot was created to assess the amount of variance captured by these components. Based on the PCA results, the neighbourhood relationships between cells were determined using the first 95 principal components with the command “sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=55, n_pcs=95)”. For UMAP visualisation, the calculated neighbours were utilised, and parameters such as minimum distance and spread were specified to control the density and layout of the visualisation. This was accomplished using the command “sc.tl.umap(adata, min_dist=0.75, spread=1.25, alpha=1, gamma=1.0)”. Clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm, and the resolution was set to values 1, 2, 3, and 4 to determine the optimal granularity of the clusters. To evaluate the consistency and robustness of the clustering results, correlation matrices and dendrograms were examined for each clustering resolution. Reliable clustering was indicated by consistent and well-separated clusters in both the correlation matrix and dendrogram. Additionally, known marker genes were referenced to assess whether the clustering algorithm accurately captured the expected biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Finally, to identify marker genes associated with each cluster, gene rankings were generated using both the ‘wilcoxon’ and ‘logreg’ methods. The cluster dendrogram was obtained with the scanpy function “sc.pl.dendrogram”.</p><p id="P59">To gain further insights into the cellular composition and heterogeneity present in the scRNA-seq data, we visualised cluster-specific marker genes using dot plots, heat maps and features plots. These visualisations provided a concise representation of gene expression within each cluster as well as across clusters. By performing these analyses and examining the expression patterns of known marker genes, we were able to identify distinct cell populations and infer their respective cell types. To obtain log2 ratios between cell numbers in large and small planarians we divided the number of cells in each cluster in each size category by the sum of the cells in the category. We then applied logarithms and obtained the ratios by subtracting the log frequency values. These values were plotted on the UMAP using a custom colour scale, since most values are between -1.3 and 1.1 except cluster 54 (secretory 4) which has an outlier value of 4.4.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Pseudo bulk and differential gene expression analysis</title><p id="P60">Using the cell annotation derived from our single cell analysis (i.e. clustering, broad cell types, etc.) as well as cell information such as size of the organism of origin (L,M,S) and cell library, we generated a pseudo bulk matrix by aggregating, for a given gene X, all the counts of gene X from cells coming from the same cluster and library, effectively generating a pseudo bulk matrix with genes in rows and ‘pseudosamples’ (i.e. all combinations of cell type + ‘condition’ i.e. organism size + ‘replicate’ i.e. library) in columns. For a given cell type i, we subsetted this pseudo bulk matrix to keep ‘pseudosamples’ from cell type i as well as genes annotated as “high-confidence” in the gene annotation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), and performed differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) inside a custom wrapper. Briefly, we filtered genes with less than two counts in at least one replicate and performed a negative binomial test from DESeq2 with contrast “L” over “S”. Genes were considered differentially expressed if the p-value of the test was lower than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>In situ hybridization images</title><p id="P61">All in situ hybridization images were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://digiworm.wi.mit.edu/">https://digiworm.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

Each omnibus chi-squared test was followed by a post hoc analysis of the standardised residuals to assess which category combinations were significantly over- or under-represented.
