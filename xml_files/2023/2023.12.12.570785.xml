Mutations in developmental cells can result in the wide dissemination of cells predisposed to disease within mature organs. We characterised the evolutionary history of four synchronous renal tumours from a 14-year-old girl, timing their shared origin to a multipotent embryonic cell committed to the right kidney, around 4 weeks post-conception. Their shared <italic>MTOR</italic> mutation, absent from normal tissues, enhances protein flexibility, which enables a FAT domain hinge to dramatically increase activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Developmental mutations, not usually detected in traditional genetic screening, have vital clinical importance in guiding prognosis, targeted treatment, and family screening decisions for paediatric tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Four renal tumours were identified incidentally in the right kidney of a 14-year-old girl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>); the left kidney was radiologically normal. She underwent a radical nephrectomy and has remained free of disease as of writing. Two of the lesions (A and D) had the typical histological appearances of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (chRCC) and two (C and E) were renal oncocytomas (RO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Both of these tumour types, thought to be derived from collecting duct type A cells, are exceedingly rare in young patients, even with the presence of a predisposing germline mutation in <italic>FLCN</italic> (Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> This is just the eighth case of a child with a RO, one of about twenty reported paediatric chRCC cases, and the first report of a young patient with both lesions occurring in the same kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Standard clinical genetic testing detected no causative germline mutations.</p><p id="P3">We evaluated the phylogenetic relationships of these four renal tumours using whole genome sequencing. The tumours shared 13 single nucleotide variants (SNV), one double nucleotide variant (DNV) and one in-frame 12 base-pair (bp) duplication in <italic>MTOR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Beyond this small number of shared variants, each separate tumour had independently acquired somatic mutations with distinct copy number profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). The 15 shared mutations were clonal in all tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). High-coverage whole genome sequencing (550x) of histologically normal kidney and blood showed that 7 of the 15 shared variants were detectable in both normal kidney and blood, with monotonically decreasing variant allele frequency (VAF). A further 5 variants were detectable in normal kidney but not blood, and 3 variants were not detectable in either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We also analysed bulk and single cell transcriptomes from the four tumours. Strikingly, each tumour had a unique transcriptome resembling a different renal cell type, inferred using deconvolution from a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference dataset from normal kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1b-c</xref>). These cell types were collecting duct type A, distal principal, loop of Henle, and proximal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Using the two RO tumours’ unique patterns of whole chromosome loss, we also identified cells from tumours A and D in the scRNA-seq dataset. These cells’ transcriptomes recapitulated the bulk RNA-seq findings, with tumour A cells again resembling collecting duct type A and tumour D resembling distal principal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Taken together, these data demonstrate that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the four tumours was a multipotent embryonic cell that likely existed during the early development of the right kidney. A burden of 15 mutations would time the MRCA to well before 8 weeks post-conception (when mesodermal cells have an average of 25 mutations each<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>), to around the fourth week of embryogenesis. This is supported by the 7 mutations shared with blood, which splits from kidney when gastrulation establishes intermediate and lateral mesoderm structures in the third week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> As the nephrogenic cords split into left and right pronephros between the third and fourth week of embryogenesis, it is likely that the initially affected cell was already fated to the right kidney, generating an organ-restricted cancer field effect akin to the 1953 theorisation of “synchronous” cancer incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, the fact that each of the four tumours had an expression signature of a different cell type argues that the most recent common ancestor was multipotent, capable of generating several distinct functional zones of the nephron.</p><p id="P6">Of the 15 shared mutations in the most recent common ancestor, the only coding variant was an in-frame duplication of 12bp in <italic>MTOR</italic>. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation via protein mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2). The mTOR pathways are commonly dysregulated in cancer, but activating mutations in <italic>MTOR</italic> are rarely observed outside of renal cell carcinomas. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> This patient’s in-frame duplication of 1455-EWED-1458 is in the helical autoinhibitory FAT domain of mTOR, in close vicinity to a slightly activating single amino acid mutation A1459P seen previously in other RCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> All four tumours express the mutant <italic>MTOR</italic> transcript, and an unbiased gene set enrichment test of the tumour transcriptomes revealed the mTORC1 hallmark signalling pathway to be significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). As this exact mutation had not been previously described, we probed the functional and structural consequences of the protein variant.</p><p id="P7">First, we expressed and purified recombinant mTORC1 with the cancer-associated 1455-EWED-1458 duplication, referred to from here on as mTORC1_EWED<sub>dup</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The thermal unfolding profile for this mutant is similar to wild type (WT), suggesting no major global destabilising events from the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Kinetic analysis showed the variant is hyperactive with a catalytic turnover (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of ∼18 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is a great increase relative to the mTORC1_WT (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ∼0.02 s<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The activity of mTORC1_EWED<sub>dup</sub> is similar to mTORC1_WT when activated by the physiological activator, RHEB (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ∼6 s<sup>-1</sup>), and the activity of the variant was not further increased by the addition of RHEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Though the role of mTORC2 in tumorigenesis is less understood, we also analysed effects of the mTOR_EWED<sub>dup</sub> variant on mTORC2 activity, revealing that the variant caused significant hyperactivation of this complex as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The cryoEM structure of the mTORC1_EWED<sub>dup</sub> variant revealed a disordering of the FAT domain between residues 1442-1512, implying greater flexibility around the duplication site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Despite its hyperactivity, the mutant’s global structure resembled the apo-conformation of mTORC1_WT (apo meaning not bound to activated RHEB). This flexibility suggests that the mutant can more readily adopt a transient activated conformation, even though the equilibrium conformation resembles apo-mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast to the characteristic 30° rotation around a hinge at residue 1443 as seen in the RHEB-activated mTORC1_WT complex, the duplication variant does not elicit such a hinge motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Prior analysis by Xu and colleagues suggested that most <italic>MTOR</italic> mutations associated with renal tumours occurred in three clusters of the FAT domain (F1, F2 and F3) and in three clusters in the kinase domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> These point mutations each increased the activity of mTORC1. Furthermore, combining two mutations, one in the FAT domain and one in the kinase domain, synergized to hyperactivate mTORC1, even in the absence of RHEB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Notably, this patient’s <italic>MTOR</italic>_EWED<sub>dup</sub> variant, present in the F1 FAT domain cluster, also hyperactivated mTORC1 to achieve a RHEB-like maximum rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), without requiring mutation in a second cluster. As this F1 cluster lies near a previously described hinge for RHEB-activated mTORC1, it is plausible that the significant disorder induced by the duplication event directly relieves auto-inhibition exerted by the FAT domain on the kinase in the basal state. The hyperactivity of the variant within mTORC2 is also consistent with the mTORC2-activating effect reported for a nearby point mutation at 1483.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P10">Together, these genomic, biochemical, and structural analyses affirm that this <italic>MTOR</italic> mutation, acquired early in development, is the initial tumorigenic driver. <italic>MTOR</italic> mutations are relatively uncommon in kidney cancer, with an incidence of 3% in chRCC and no previously reported incidence in RO tumours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> However, the mTORC pathway has been implicated in both tumour types. Germline loss-of-function mutations in mTOR pathway gene <italic>FLCN</italic> in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome predispose not only to chRCC and RO, but also to more aggressive clear cell and papillary RCCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Further, recent changes to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines have defined a class of hybrid RO-chRCC tumours defined as “other oncocytic/chromophobe RCC” for which <italic>MTOR</italic> or <italic>TSC1/2</italic> mutations are frequently the primary driver, with suggestion that rapalogs may be an effective targeted treatment as in adult RCC patients with advanced disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> It is notable that the WHO guidelines highlight how <italic>MTOR</italic> and mTOR pathway mutations can generate a wide variety of histologically diverse tumours as we have observed in this one individual.</p><p id="P11">The standard categorisation of tumours considers germline and sporadic aetiologies as two entirely separate, opposing entities. With advances in understanding the developmental genome and with the accessibility of whole genome sequencing, there is a growing appreciation for a subset of tumours generated from some point between. As such, it may be helpful to consider tumour aetiology as a continuum from early germline to late sporadic tumours, with particular vulnerabilities through development. A number of cases of both blood cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and kidney cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> have been described in which the first driver mutation was acquired <italic>in utero</italic>. What makes our case so interesting is that the distinct expression profiles across the tumours, the small number of shared mutations and the restriction to a single kidney enables us to pinpoint the most recent common ancestor to a very specific stage of development, likely a multipotent kidney progenitor cell at about 4 weeks post-conception. The timing and tolerability of a developmental driver will determine the extent of the resultant cancer field effect and the type of cancers that would eventually emerge. Because these aspects can inform prognosis and treatment, it is vital that mosaic aetiologies are further characterised along the spectrum from germline to sporadic tumours.</p><sec sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Samples and sequencing</title><p id="P12">Human material was obtained from patients enrolled in an UK NHS REC approved study (reference 16/EE/0394).
