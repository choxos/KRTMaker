Given the critical role of the liver in glucose and lipid metabolism, understanding the molecular mechanisms in hepatic insulin resistance is essential for early preventive treatments. To elucidate changes in insulin signal transduction associated with hepatocellular resistance, we employed a multi-layered mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach focusing on insulin receptor (IR) signaling at the interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome levels.in a long-term hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cell line with a knockout of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R KO). Analysis of the dynamic insulin-induced IR interactome revealed recruitment of the PI3K complex in both insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells. From the phosphoproteomics dataset, a change in insulin-stimulated signaling responses in insulin resistance was observed and showed attenuated signaling via the metabolic PI3K-AKT pathway but sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. At the proteome level, the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) showed an insulin-induced increase in expression. This receptor belongs to the Eph receptor family and participates in various cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and tissue development. The protein abundance regulation of EphA2 occurred through the ERK signaling pathway and was concordantly independent of insulin resistance. Induction of EphA2 by insulin was confirmed in other cell lines and observed uniquely in cells with high levels of IR compared to IGF1R. The multi-layered proteomics dataset provided insights into insulin signaling in general and in the context of insulin resistance, and it can going forward serve as a resource to generate and test hypotheses, leading to an improved understanding of insulin resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is characterized by impaired cellular responses to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It affects nearly 40% of young American adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and is influenced by various factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, chronic inflammation, prolonged exposure to elevated levels of nutrients, and pathophysiological insulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The cellular response and mechanisms of insulin resistance vary by tissue, with fat, muscle, and liver being the primary insulin-responsive tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P3">The liver plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and overall metabolism, and insulin signaling in hepatocytes primarily coordinates glucose uptake, storage, and production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a plasma membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), leading to its autophosphorylation. Insulin signaling branches into two major pathways - a metabolic pathway via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling axis, which plays the primary role in hepatic insulin response, and a mitogenic pathway controlling cell growth, proliferation, and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The growth factor capabilities of insulin depend on signaling activation via the canonical extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These central signaling pathways have several shared and diverging points of regulation by various kinases and phosphatases, leading to complex interplay and cross-talk in downstream activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Hepatic insulin resistance primarily impairs PI3K-AKT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The relationship between IR levels and insulin resistance is unclear, with some studies reporting reduced IR levels in insulin-resistant states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and others observing no significant differences between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Studies have shown that changes in subcellular localization of IR may play a role in hepatic insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a powerful technology for global analysis of cell signaling networks, and it is widely used to characterize signaling pathways from activated RTKs in different cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. MS-based interactome studies have used receptor overexpressing cell models to study the proximal signaling of the IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. While occasionally applied in phosphoproteomics, overexpression can lead to aberrations in interactions, downstream signaling, and general cellular processes. Additionally, induction of insulin resistance in such manipulated cell line models is often more complicated or unattainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance, we performed a multi-layered MS-based proteomics investigation in a HepG2 IGF1R KO cell line model with endogenous IR expression. The study focused on analyzing the insulin-dependent IR interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome to uncover molecular changes driving insulin resistance in the model. The global phosphoproteome analysis affirmed that the insulin-resistant condition pathway specifically reduced PI3K-AKT response but not the ERK pathway. The proteome analysis revealed upregulated protein levels of the RTK, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2), in insulin-resistant compared to -sensitive cells. EphA2 belongs to the Eph receptor family and is involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tissue development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Moreover, the receptor displays upregulation in certain types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This study showed that the activation of the ERK pathway by insulin was responsible for upregulating EphA2 levels, and this mechanism was independent of insulin resistance. The ERK pathway dependency was shown by MEK inhibition and the lack of induction with the AKT-biased partial IR agonist, S597 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Screening of different cell lines suggested that the ability of insulin to induce EphA2 protein levels required a high IR/IGF1R ratio. Exploring this previously unreported regulation of EphA2 by insulin and its correlation with the relatively higher IR/IGF1R ratio has the potential to provide insights into the intricate insulin signaling in diverse cellular and tissue contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title><p id="P5">To investigate molecular changes associated with insulin resistance, we utilized an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor knock-out (IGF1R KO) HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. This cell model offers an advantage over the commonly used wild-type (WT) HepG2 cell line, which expresses IGF1R at comparable levels to IR, not typically observed in healthy hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Employing the IGF1R KO cell line allowed a focused characterization of the IR-mediated insulin response, disregarding the influence of insulin signaling through IR-IGF1R hybrids. An insulin-resistant state was induced by hyperinsulinemia based on a protocol established by Dall’Agnese <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], in which the cells were stimulated with 0.1 nM (considered physiological) or 3 nM (considered pathological) insulin for 48 hours. To ensure comprehensive coverage of differential insulin signaling pathways, the proteome, phosphoproteome, and IR interactome of insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells were sampled unstimulated or after 5-minute insulin stimulation with 0.1, 3, and 100 nM insulin. Five biological replicates were collected for each experimental condition. The same co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) buffer-extracted lysates were used to generate all three types of datasets. Also, a single-shot proteome dataset was acquired using cells lysed in SDS lysis buffer. Validation of the insulin-resistant phenotype involved the application of several orthogonal methods. This comprehensive experimental design and analysis strategy enabled a thorough exploration of insulin signaling dynamics in an insulin-sensitive and -resistant state. Data from a stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiment in the rat hepatoma cell line, H4IIE, was included, analyzing proteome changes after 24- and 48-hour treatment with insulin or the IR agonist S597 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], using three biological replicates. Additionally, a SILAC H4IIE phosphoproteome dataset after stimulation with insulin or S597 for 5, 15, and 30 minutes was acquired, including two biological replicates.

These cells were lysed with a milder detergent-containing lysis buffer to preserve endogenous protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Additionally, to improve proteome coverage, a second analysis applied a harsher lysis buffer containing SDS (referred to as “SDS-proteome”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. The reference proteome and SDS-proteome resulted in the identification and quantification of 4,867 and 6,378 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5.A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.G</xref>, and Table S3). The reference proteome displayed good correlation (Pearson correlations between 0.81-0.97) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5.B</xref>) with high similarity between the insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells. The differential expression analysis compared the proteomes from insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells with the assumption of a minimal effect of the 5-minute insulin stimulation on proteome abundance changes. This analysis identified 117 proteins significantly regulated (p&lt;0.05, ≥1.25-fold; downregulation in insulin resistance, 64; upregulation in insulin resistance, 53). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5.C</xref>). The SDS-proteome dataset showed good correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients averaging 0.97) validating the data quality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5.D</xref>). In the differential analysis, 131 proteins were identified with significant abundance changes (FDR&lt;0.05, s0=0.1; downregulation in insulin resistance, 58; upregulation in insulin resistance, 73) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.G</xref> and Table S3). The study identified proteins differentially regulated between insulin-sensitive and - resistant cells in at least two of three layers of proteomics datasets (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.H</xref>). The limited number of proteins identified as regulated in the proteome, while concurrently exhibiting regulation in the interactome (one in insulin-resistant) or phosphoproteome (6 in insulin-sensitive and 4 in resistant), indicated a low proteome bias in the interactome and phosphoproteome data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.H</xref>). Noteworthy, proteins regulated in multiple datasets hold importance because they can influence different aspects of cellular signaling, revealing complex layers of cellular regulation. For example, two kinases, EphA2 and serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF), were upregulated in two proteomics layers following the hyperinsulinemia treatment used to induce insulin resistance. Similar observations were made for the proteins: biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 1 subunit 3 (BLOC1S3) and Rab11 family-interacting protein 1 (Rab11FIP1), both involved in cellular vesicle trafficking, in insulin-sensitive cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.H</xref>). In summary, the study applied MS technology to create three IR-centric datasets, encompassing IR interactors, phosphorylation sites, and protein levels. These datasets form the foundation for a thorough investigation of dose-response insulin signaling in insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Interactome analysis reveals distinct IR networks in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells</title><p id="P51">Considering the significance of protein-protein interactions in modulating cellular signaling, the aim was to gain an understanding of the IR interactome in induced insulin-resistant HepG2 IGF1R KO cells. The approach involved two strategies: first, examining the strongest IR adaptor candidates with &gt;5 annotated peptide precursors and ≥10-fold enrichment compared to the reference proteome (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.C</xref> and Table S1). Second, exploring the dynamic interactome through differentially regulated IR interactors between unstimulated and insulin-stimulated conditions at all three doses for insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6.A-B</xref>). To uncover important signaling components in the IR pathway, the top 207 IR interactors were analyzed. These included 25 kinases, 3 SH2 domain proteins, 6 SH3 domain proteins, 11 PH domain proteins, and 3 Cbl-PTB domain proteins (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.A</xref> and Table S1). Enrichment analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-terms confirmed the dominance of the insulin signaling pathway, supported by the identification of key interactors such as PIK3R1, AKT, GAB1, and IRS1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.A-B</xref>). Combined, these findings validated the IR co-IP data from the endogenous IR-expressing cell model. To identify notable differences in the basal IR interactome between insulin-resistant and -sensitive cells, the interactor peptide precursor ratios were compared for the two cell states. We identified previously unreported IR interactors and observed variations in the interactor ratios between insulin-sensitive and -resistant interactome for several proteins (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.A</xref>). Further experimental validation of these is needed.</p><p id="P52">The regulation of dynamic IR interactors was characterized by significant fold-change differences between the 5-minute insulin stimulation and the unstimulated control, as indicated by the respective volcano plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6.A-B</xref> and Table S1). A separate analysis of the dynamic interactome in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells was conducted to avoid the potential bias introduced by the decreased IR protein levels in the insulin-resistant state. This approach was taken due to the variability in IR protein levels between the two cell types. The analysis revealed that the PI3K complex, comprising catalytic subunits A and B and a regulatory subunit, showed dynamic recruitment in both insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells with 3 and 100 nM insulin stimulation, but not with 0.1 nM insulin stimulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6.C</xref>). This aligns with the undetected IR and AKT phosphorylation at this insulin concentration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1.A</xref>), indicating minimal activation and signal transduction.</p><p id="P53">The hierarchical clustering analysis of the significant IR interactors divided the data into six clusters, each displaying distinct behavior in dynamic IR interactors between insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells. Cluster 1 revealed a consistently high level of IR-recruited PI3K complex after 5 minutes of stimulation with 3 and 100 nM insulin in the insulin-sensitive cells, while -resistant cells required 100 nM insulin levels for similar recruitment levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.D</xref>). The reduced PI3K recruitment confirmed diminished insulin responsiveness in insulin-resistant cells. Clusters 2-6 showed varying dynamic recruitment of IR interactors in insulin-sensitive and resistant cells based on 5 minutes of 3 or 100 nM insulin stimulation. Cluster 2 contained 13 interactors with a tendency for stronger insulin-induced recruitment in insulin-sensitive compared to resistant cells. The insulin-sensitive state interactors included the two kinases: acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase (PRKAA2) and diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKE) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.D</xref>). Also, Rab11FIP1, known for its involvement in receptor tyrosine kinase recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], was detected among these potentially stronger insulin-sensitive interactors, (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.D</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation levels of Rab11FIP1 were found to be downregulated in insulin-resistant cells compared to insulin-sensitive cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1.H</xref> and Table S2). In cluster 4, 10 proteins showed a tendency to be more strongly recruited to the IR upon 5 minutes of 3 and 100 nM insulin stimulation in insulin-resistant compared to sensitive cells. This cluster contained the phosphatase polyphosphoinositide phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">FIG4</xref>) and, interestingly, the kinase BRAF, which is usually linked with the MAPK signaling pathway. Additionally, BRAF demonstrated higher phosphorylation levels in insulin-resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. While BRAF has not previously been linked to insulin resistance, its kinase activity is regulated by metformin treatment, a first-line therapy to enhance insulin sensitivity, making it an interesting target for further studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Cluster 5 contained 6 potential interactors showing increased recruitment for 100 nM insulin stimulation in insulin-sensitive and resistant cells, compared to their respective 3 nM stimulation and included the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14). The hierarchical clustering analysis showed differences in the recruitment of dynamic IR interactors between insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells. The study found that some dynamic IR interactors had differentially regulated phosphorylation levels, which could be potential targets for further investigation into altered insulin resistance-associated signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Phosphoproteome analysis uncovers sustained ERK signaling and impaired insulin-stimulated AKT signaling response in insulin-resistant cells</title><p id="P54">The insulin-resistant phenotype is known to display a reduced activation of the metabolic insulin-induced cellular response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], which we initially confirmed by showing decreased phosphorylation levels of IR and phosphorylation of AKT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1.A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.B</xref>). To further characterize the phosphoproteome, the level of regulation of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells was compared. Based on significance testing across all conditions, 1,337 phosphorylation sites showed significantly regulated levels and based on the hierarchical clustering analysis, 10 clusters were defined, resulting in the formation of the large cluster A (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.A</xref>). However, this cluster contained visible sub-clusters that were diverging in their phosphorylation pattern. Cluster A.1 showed decreased phosphorylation levels in unstimulated insulin-sensitive, but not in insulin-resistant cells, compared to their respective insulin-stimulated conditions. The maximum phosphorylation site abundance was reached with the low dose of insulin (0.1 nM) stimulation in insulin-sensitive cells and across all conditions in insulin-resistant cells. In contrast, cluster A.2 displayed an insulin dose-response upregulation in phosphorylation levels for insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells, with a faster increase and higher maximum intensity observed in insulin-sensitive cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.A</xref>). A kinase motif enrichment analysis of the amino acid sequence preferences adjacent to phosphorylation sites in cluster A.1 showed an overrepresentation of proline (P) at the +1 position, which is the consensus motif for proline-directed kinases like ERK1/2 kinase substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. The prolonged activation of ERK/MAPK, resulting from the elevated insulin concentration in the insulin-resistance-inducing protocol, persisted in the control condition without being attenuated, causing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinase substrates in the insulin-resistant cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.B</xref>). From a similar analysis of cluster A.2, peptides with arginine (R) at position -3 relative to the phosphorylated site, which is the consensus motif for AKT kinase substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], were enriched. Additionally, the recognition sequence for basophilic protein kinases like AKT, p70, S6 kinase, and RSK includes R residues at both positions -3 and -5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], partially evident in the cluster motif (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.B</xref>). This observation confirmed the reduced AKT response in insulin-resistant cells, and it was intriguing that the analysis showed differential AKT and ERK substrate motif phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells, in combination, defining the insulin-resistant state. In addition to the cluster analysis, the regulated phosphorylation sites in insulin sensitivity and resistance were globally compared, focusing on high-concentration stimulations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.C</xref>). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis further supported the upregulation of terms associated with endocytosis and MAPK pathway signaling in the insulin-resistant state (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.D</xref>). These findings are intriguing, given the observed differences in IR levels and ERK1/2 kinase substrate phosphorylation in insulin-sensitive and - resistant cells.</p><p id="P55">Given the non-attenuated ERK1/2 kinase substrate phosphorylation in insulin resistance, in unstimulated conditions, the differential regulation of phosphorylation sites was examined at the basal level in the two conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.E</xref>). The level of regulation between unstimulated insulin-sensitive versus -resistant cells was evaluated by differential phosphorylation site analysis. From the resulting volcano plot, reduced phosphorylation levels at two sites in dual-specificity protein phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) (Ser368 and Thr384) were identified in insulin-resistant cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.E</xref>). Noteworthy, only insulin-resistant cells showed upregulated phosphorylation levels of DUSP9 Ser368 and Thr384 upon insulin stimulation (&gt;1.5-fold at 3 nM and &gt;2-fold at 100 nM, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.C</xref>). DUSP9 dephosphorylates MAPKs, including ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], and several studies have shown its involvement in insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. Thus, it was speculated whether the lowered phosphorylation levels of DUSP9 at Ser368 and Thr384 under unstimulated insulin-resistant conditions, potentially impact the activity or stability of the protein, leading to sustained ERK phosphorylation and signaling. Additionally, considering the differential ERK and AKT signaling responses observed in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells, the signaling response was analyzed by inhibiting these two pathways. HepG2 IGF1R KO cells were treated with 3 nM insulin alone or after pre-treatment with either cobimetinib (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular kinase (MEK)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] or MK-2206 (an AKT inhibitor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the ability of cobimetinib and MK-2206 to reduce the activation of ERK and AKT, respectively. Intriguingly, inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway led to a ≥5-fold increase in AKT phosphorylation, strongly suggesting potential cross-talk between AKT and ERK in insulin signaling.

An enrichment analysis of KEGG-terms was performed to characterize the proteins with abundance changes. The analysis showed that proteins involved in MAPK signaling and axon guidance pathways were upregulated, while proteins related to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glucose, and amino acid metabolic pathways were downregulated in insulin resistance (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.B</xref>).</p><p id="P57">In the SDS-proteome, five protein kinases were identified among 6,378 proteins with upregulated protein levels in insulin-resistant compared to -sensitive cells.

Of these kinases, the reference-proteome only confirmed EphA2 to be upregulated in insulin-resistant cells, and thus, a shared significant finding in the two proteome analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5.C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">E</xref>). The RTK EphA2 belongs to the Eph receptor family and is known to play a role in mediating cell-cell communication and regulating various cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, to our knowledge no information exists on its role in insulin resistance or gene expression regulation by insulin. By immunoblotting, the ∼1.5-fold increase in EphA2 abundance at the protein level in insulin-resistant compared to insulin-sensitive cells was confirmed (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.C</xref>). Importantly, EphA2 levels were increased upon insulin stimulation at protein and mRNA levels independently of the insulin resistance, and this underscored the role of insulin signaling-dependency of these changes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.D-E</xref>). Moreover, increased phosphorylation levels were identified of EphA2 Tyr594 in the 3 nM insulin-stimulated insulin-resistant cells compared to the - sensitive in the phosphoproteome (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7.A</xref>). The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation was investigated in insulin-sensitive and -resistant cells, separately. The level of an EphA2 doubly phosphorylated peptide covering the autophosphorylation sites Tyr588 and Tyr594 was downregulated in response to 0.1 nM insulin stimulation in insulin-sensitive, and for all three insulin concentrations in the -resistant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4.C</xref> and Table S2).</p><p id="P58">Based on these results, showing differential levels of EphA2 in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant cells, it was speculated that increased EphA2 levels could be causally involved in the insulin-resistant phenotype by suppressing the ability of activated IR to phosphorylate AKT. Therefore, to elucidate its potential role in insulin resistance, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown (KD) experiment was performed targeting EphA2 in both cell states. The immunoblot showed effective KD of EphA2 in the HepG2 IGF1R KO cell model, however, it did not restore insulin-stimulated phosphorylation levels of IR and AKT in the insulin-resistant cell model (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.F-G</xref>). These results confirmed a strong influence of insulin stimulation on increased EphA2 levels, and aligned well with insulin resistance, as an outcome of prolonged cell culturing with high insulin concentration according to the resistance-inducing protocol. However, the regulation of EphA2 was independent of insulin resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first reporting of EphA2 as an insulin-inducible gene.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Expression level of IGF1R correlates with regulation of EphA2 by insulin stimulation in different cell lines</title><p id="P59">Since EphA2 KD could not restore AKT signaling in insulin-resistant cells to the level in - sensitive cells, we assumed that the upregulation of EphA2 did not play a major causal role in resistance. However, we speculated whether the insulin-dependency of EphA2 expression was a general finding across other cell types or specific to hepatocyte-like cells. Therefore, HepG2 WT cells were treated with 3 and 100 nM insulin for 24 hours (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.A-B</xref>). Interestingly, unlike in HepG2 IGF1R KO cells, insulin stimulation did not induce expression of EphA2 in HepG2 WT cells, indicating an inhibitory or rewiring role of IGF1R in this response. Therefore, a total of 11 insulin-responsive cell lines were screened: 4 hepatoma (HepG2 WT, HepG2 IGF1R KO, Hep3B, and H4IIE), 3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (MOLM-13, THP1, and EOL-1), and 4 breast cancer (BT549, BT474, HCC38, and HCC197) cell lines for insulin-induced EphA2 regulation. The cells were chosen based on their differential IR-to-IGF1R expression levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.D</xref>). The IR-to-IGF1R ratio is generally higher in hepatic and AML cells, while breast cancer cells show varying but lower ratios given higher IGF1R expression levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.C-D</xref>). For the hepatoma cell lines, insulin stimulation induced EphA2 expression in HepG2 IGF1R KO and the rat hepatoma H4IIE cells known to lack IGFIR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. H4IIE cells showed dose-response induction, but not in HepG2 WT and Hep3B cell lines. Among the AML cell lines, ∼5-fold increase of EphA2 protein level with 3 nM insulin stimulation was observed for MOLM-13, whereas THP1 or EOL-1 cells showed no EphA2 induction. None of the screened breast cancer cell lines showed EphA2 protein regulation after insulin stimulation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.A-B</xref>). Taken together, HepG2 IGF1R KO, H4IIE, and MOLM-13 cells exhibited the lowest IGF1R protein levels, supporting the hypothesis of a low IGF1R expression requirement for insulin-induced EphA2 upregulation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.C-D</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that high insulin concentrations can activate IGF1R, initiating proliferative signaling activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. Additionally, heterodimers between IR and IGF1R can form, and these hybrid receptors bind insulin with reduced affinity compared to IR and have been linked to diabetic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. This underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between insulin signaling via these two homologous growth factor receptors, IGF1R and IR, in both metabolic and growth-related contexts.</p><p id="P60">Based on the phosphoproteome data showing a sustained level of ERK signaling in the insulin-resistant cells, this led to the question of whether the balance between PI3K-AKT and MAPK downstream signaling impacted the regulation of EphA2.

Intriguingly, stimulation with S597 did not result in upregulated EphA2 expression at the protein level, compared to stimulation with insulin. This supported the dependency of induced ERK signaling, in the insulin-induced upregulation of EphA2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.E</xref>). To confirm the observed regulation of EphA2 protein levels by insulin but not S597 in another hepatic cell model, the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE was used. This cell line lacks endogenous IGF1R expression, hence without manipulation mimicking physiological healthy hepatocytes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.C-D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In addition to validating the observations in another cell system, the broader changes in protein abundance following stimulation with insulin and S597 were explored. Therefore, a SILAC experiment in H4IIE cells was performed and cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin or S597 for 24 and 48 hours followed by an MS-based proteome analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8.A-B</xref>). A total of 7,508 proteins were confidently identified and EphA2 protein levels were upregulated after 24 and 48 hours of insulin stimulation, ranking EphA2 as the fourth most induced protein. In contrast, S597-stimulation did not lead to detectable upregulation of EphA2 protein levels, which was verified by immunoblotting (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6.F-G</xref>).

Despite the prevalent use of IR overexpression models in most previous studies, our study showed substantial receptor enrichment and successfully identified established and potential previously unknown IR interactors. These findings underscore the sensitivity of the applied workflow enabling studies in a cellular context with endogenous IR expression that more closely resemble physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P65">Another difference between the HepG2 cells with and without IGF1R KO was the reduced ERK activation in the WT model after 5-minute insulin stimulation in insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The IGF1R KO cells showed sustained ERK activation, hindering further activation upon 5-minute insulin stimulation. The observation that insulin resistance did not reduce the ERK response is a common phenomenon in insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. Based on the diverging observations in the HepG2 WT and IGF1R KO cells, it could be interesting to investigate whether the proliferative insulin response depends on a high IR/IGF1R ratio. Since inhibition of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway in standard cultured HepG2 IGF1R KO cells resulted in an increased PI3K-AKT activation by insulin, this suggests a cross-talk mechanism between ERK and AKT pathway activation following insulin stimulation. Previous studies have addressed cross-talk between the AKT and ERK signaling pathways, both in general and in the context of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. A previous study used modeling to predict that activated ERK can inhibit the insulin-stimulated association between IRS1 and PI3K, thus reducing AKT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. This observation aligns with our findings. Based on our results, it can be speculated that suppressing the insulin-stimulated ERK response in insulin resistance, might help restore the activation of the metabolic AKT insulin signaling pathway. Interestingly, a study showed restored insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in a diabetic mouse model upon treatment with a MEK inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. This supports the relevance of further exploration of IR agonists, like S597, which has been shown to exhibit biased AKT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], within the field of insulin resistance research. Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms behind sustained MAPK signaling in insulin resistance is important and adds relevance to our observation of the down-regulated phosphorylation levels of the ERK phosphatase, DUSP9. Increased levels of this phosphatase have been shown to protect against insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>]. The potential regulatory role of the significantly regulated C-terminal phosphorylation sites of DUSP9 identified in this study is unknown. However, previous research has shown that the C-terminal phosphorylation of the related DUSP2, containing a homologous phosphatase domain to that of DUSP9, has a protein-stabilizing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. Further research is needed to elucidate the significance of DUSP9 phosphorylation and its connection to ERK signaling in our model.</p><p id="P66">A key finding in our study was the upregulation of EphA2 protein levels by insulin through the ERK signaling pathway. This aligns with the findings of Macrae <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>], who demonstrated that EphA2 gene expression is induced via RAF pathway activation in fibroblast and human breast epithelial cells upon hormone activation and that EphA2 protein levels are inhibited with MAPK pathway inhibition in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. Generally, elevated levels of EphA2 are associated with various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, we showed that insulin-stimulated EphA2 induction was specific to cells with a high IR-to-IGF1R ratio. EphA2 is involved in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and tissue development. However, the implications of increased EphA2 levels in the HepG2 IGF1R KO cell model with induced insulin resistance remain unknown. Interestingly, another receptor from the Eph receptor family, ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4), has been shown to interact with, and drive IR degradation after insulin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Based on our co-IP analysis, an interaction between IR and EpHA2 was not observed, and a similar role to that observed for EphB4 thus cannot be confirmed. However, further experiments are needed to confirm this.</p><p id="P67">The role of high IR-to-IGFR ratio in the insulin-induction of EphA2 is evidence of the apparent role of IGF1R levels concerning insulin signaling. The ability of IR to form hybrid receptors with IGF1R in cells co-expressing the two receptors adds an intriguing dimension to the already complex interplay of the two receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. Studies have shown that hybrid receptors have reduced insulin affinity compared to the IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. While their function remains uncertain, increased levels of hybrid receptors have been associated with metabolic and mitogenic dysregulated diseases, such as insulin resistance and certain types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. The differences observed in the HepG2 IGF1R KO cell line compared to the HepG2 WT highlight the relevance of this study when investigating insulin resistance in a liver-specific context. However, our model is still a cell line, and therefore, applying the insulin resistance-inducing protocol to more physiologically mimicking cell models, such as liver organoids, would be an evident next step to gain further understanding of insulin resistance.</p><p id="P68">In conclusion, this multi-layered proteomics study serves as a comprehensive resource, covering the IR signaling dynamics and global proteome changes in an insulin-sensitive and - resistant hepatocellular cell line model with endogenous IR levels and a KO of IGF1R. Using this integrative proteomics approach, we highlighted the role of ERK signaling on the proteome landscape and found that insulin, independently of insulin resistance, induces ERK-dependent EphA2 expression exclusively in cells with a high IR-to-IGF1R ratio.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS192800-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d205aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>S.H.J would like to express gratitude to the technicians M.
