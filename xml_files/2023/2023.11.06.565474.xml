The most common form of CTCL, mycosis fungoides (MF), can be difficult to diagnose resulting in treatment delay. The pathogenesis of CTCL is not fully understood due to limited data from patient studies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics profiling of skin from patients with MF-type CTCL, and an integrated comparative analysis with human skin cell atlas datasets from healthy skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We reveal the co-optation of Th2-immune gene programmes by malignant CTCL cells and modelling of the tumour microenvironment to support their survival. We identify MHC-II<sup>+</sup> fibroblast subsets reminiscent of lymph node T-zone reticular cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells that can maintain Th2-like tumour cells. CTCL Th2-like tumour cells are spatially associated with B cells, forming aggregates reminiscent of tertiary lymphoid structures which are more prominent with progressive disease. Finally, we validated the enrichment of B cells in CTCL skin infiltrates and its association with disease progression across three independent patient cohorts. Our findings provide diagnostic aids, potential biomarkers for disease staging and therapeutic strategies for CTCL.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and a subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with mycosis fungoides (MF) being the most common type with an incidence of 5.42 per million in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Early-stage MF (stages I-IIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>) typically presents in the skin with patches and plaques, which can be mistaken for benign inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, posing a challenge for clinical and histological diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although indolent in the majority, one third of patients with MF can progress to advanced-stage disease (≥ IIB) with low overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Malignant T cells in advanced-stage MF are typically central memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> clones characterised by high inter-donor variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and high tumour mutational burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, but very little is known about their molecular characteristics or metabolic activity.</p><p id="P4">Identification of reliable diagnostic hallmarks for CTCL across patients has been limited by its non-specific histopathological features, as well as the heterogeneity and proposed plasticity of malignant T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Current diagnosis is mainly based on correlation of clinical and non-specific histopathological features, including T cell epidermotropism, band-like dermal infiltrate and fibrosis of the papillary dermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, all of which can also be observed in benign inflammatory skin conditions. As such, early CTCL has been termed ‘the great imitator’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Research into CTCL has traditionally focused on tumour cells in peripheral blood from patients with advanced disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. More recent studies on skin lesions from CTCL patients have largely been on small patient numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and primarily focused on tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Molecular characterisation of malignant T cells has led to non-curative treatment options for advanced CTCL, including a monoclonal antibody directed against CCR4 (mogamulizumab)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and a CD30 antibody-drug conjugate (brentuximab vedotin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A subset of patients has also shown to respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we aimed to achieve a holistic understanding of tumour cells and their microenvironment in lesional skin from CTCL patients and integrate with data from previous studies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on skin biopsies from early and advanced stage MF-type CTCL patients, and performed a comparative analysis with single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets of CTCL, healthy skin, AD and psoriasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Our study identified a predominance of Th2-like malignant T cells in CTCL tumours which were likely supported by MHC-II<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and dendritic cells within the TME. In addition, we demonstrate an association of malignant Th2-like cells with B cell aggregations and with progressive disease. Finally, we demonstrate the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures in CTCL lesional skin. Our findings provide diagnostic aids, potential biomarkers for disease staging and therapeutic strategies for CTCL.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cellular and molecular composition of CTCL and the tumour microenvironment</title><p id="P6">We sampled epidermal and dermal lesional skin biopsies from eight (early and advanced-stage) CTCL patients with MF (Supplementary Table 1) and performed droplet-based 5’ scRNA-seq with TCR enrichment (10x Chromium platform) of all live cells from the CD45<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD45<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> and CD45<sup>-</sup> fractions following FACS isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), as well as spatial transcriptomics analysis of tissue sections (10x Visium). Following quality control and doublet removal (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), we captured ~280,000 single cells which could be broadly categorised into 11 cell types based on the expression of canonical marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b,c</xref>).

We observed an expected enrichment of T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) but also enrichment of B cells and mast cells in CTCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The enrichment of B cells is surprising as they are not usually present in the skin, whether in healthy, AD and psoriasis contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

Further sub-clustering of benign T cells, ILCs and NK cells identified 12 cell subsets in CTCL, healthy skin, AD and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b,c</xref>), showing different expression features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Differential abundance testing revealed enrichment of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with a cytotoxic profile (CD8_cytox) in CTCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2e-g</xref>). Overall, benign lymphocytes in CTCL resemble T cells of the TME in other cutaneous squamous and melanocytic cancer types, including melanoma, with high abundance of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, potentially pro-tumourigenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells and Tregs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Cross-tumour comparisons revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between malignant T cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2h,i</xref>). For example, malignant T cells from patient 4 were highly cytotoxic-like with high expression of genes such as <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>GZMB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>). Further projection of dominant TCR clonotypes onto the UMAP revealed that malignant T cells from each patient almost exclusively harboured a single clonally expanded TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), in keeping with published reports on CTCL tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

In total, we identified 767 upregulated and 592 downregulated DEGs in malignant T cells, including previously reported features such as <italic>TOX</italic> upregulation and <italic>CD7</italic> downregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). 24 genes provided good discriminatory power to distinguish malignant from benign T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). For instance, <italic>CD9</italic>, which encodes a cell surface glycoprotein, was upregulated in seven out of eight tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, we observed high expression of <italic>CXCL13</italic> in malignant T cells from three tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggestive of a B cell homing and recruitment role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We corroborated the upregulated DEGs observed in multiple tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) in two published CTCL scRNA-seq datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).

Gene expression outputs from CellRanger were read in using the read_10x_mtx function in Scanpy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> (version 1.8.1). Data objects from different 10x lanes were then concatenated using the concatenate function in anndata (version 0.7.6). To detect and remove doublets, we applied Scrublet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> (version 0.2.3) to the data from each 10x lane to obtain per-cell scrublet scores and used a doublet exclusion threshold of median plus four median absolute deviations of the doublet score, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Cells with greater than 20% mitochondrial gene expression or expression of fewer than 200 detected genes were excluded from downstream analysis.

Normalised data were then transformed using the log1p function in Scanpy to alleviate skewness of data and mean-variance relationship. Expression values of each gene were then scaled and centred using the scale function in scanpy. Highly variable genes (HVGs) were detected using the highly_variable_genes function in scanpy with minimum cut-off values 0.0125 and 0.5 for expression and dispersion. We then regressed out percentages of mitochondrial gene expression using the regress_out function and further calculated principal components (PCs) using the pca function in scanpy. For batch correction, we used the harmonypy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/slowkow/harmonypy">https://github.com/slowkow/harmonypy</ext-link>) to correct donor-to-donor variation with the theta value being set to 3. The neighbours function was used to calculate the neighbourhood graph. UMAP embedding was calculated using the umap function in scanpy. The neighbourhood graph was then clustered using the leiden function in scanpy. Broad cell types were annotated based on expression of canonical marker genes. We integrated our CTCL dataset with the skin cell atlas dataset and two published CTCL datasets. First, datasets were concatenated using the concatenate function in anndata. The downstream data normalization process was the same as mentioned above. We ran harmonypy for batch correction using donor as the batch key and setting theta value to 3.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Differential abundance analysis using Milo</title><p id="P42">To reveal potential differences in cellular abundance in CTCL, we performed differential abundance analysis comparing CTCL to healthy skin, AD and psoriasis using Milo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. For the overall integrated object and different major cell compartments, we first performed a random subsampling using the subsample function in Scanpy, which subsampled the overall object to 0.1, stromal population to 0.3, APC population to 0.5, and benign T-cell population to 0.3 of the total numbers of cells. Then the standard Milo pipeline was run for each data object with the proportion of graph vertices to randomly sample (prop in the makeNhoods function) being set to 0.05, k being set to 20, and d being set to 30. Beeswarm plots were made to show the log-transformed fold changes in abundance of cells in CTCL versus those in healthy skin, AD and psoriasis for each data object.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Inferring copy number variations based on scRNA-seq data</title><p id="P43">To effectively distinguish malignant T cells and non-malignant cells, we inferred large-scale chromosomal copy number variations of single cells based on scRNA-seq data using the tool InferCNV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV">https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV</ext-link>) with default parameters. Briefly, InferCNV first orders genes according to their genomic positions (first from chromosome 1 to X and then by gene start position) and then uses a previously described sliding-average strategy to normalise gene expression levels in genomic windows with a fixed length. Multiple putative non-malignant cells are chosen as the reference to further denoise the CNV result.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Analysing intra-tumour expression programmes and meta-programmes</title><p id="P44">In order to explore intra-tumour expression programmes, we applied non-negative factorization (implemented in the R NMF package) to the tumour cells from the eight CTCL patients. Briefly, for each tumour, we first normalised the expression counts using the NormalizeData function in Seurat with default parameter settings. Highly variable genes (HVGs) were then selected using the FindVariableFeatures function in Seurat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Next, we performed centre-scale for HVSs and regressed out the percentage of mitochondria genes using the ScaleData function. For NMF analysis, all negative values in the expression matrix were replaced by zero. The top 10 ranked NMF gene modules in each tumour sample were extracted using the nmf function in the NMF package. For each gene module, we extracted the top 30 genes with the highest weight which were used to define a specific intra-tumour expression programme. Finally, we only included intra-tumour expression programmes that had standard deviations larger than 0.1 among tumours cells. To investigate if some intra-tumour expression programmes were actually shared by multiple tumours, we applied a clustering analysis to all programmes based on the pair-wised Jaccard index calculated as follows, where A and B represent two intra-tumour programmes.</p><disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Jaccard</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>index</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>=A</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mtext>B/A</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><p id="P45">We defined those intra-tumour programmes shared by multiple tumours as meta-programmes (MPs).

To facilitate the annotation, we first trained a logistic regression (LR) model using the skin cell atlas data as training data and predicted identities of cells in our CTCL dataset. Cells were then subset into stromal, APC, and benign T/NK/ILC population based on the expression of cell lineage markers and clustering results. We then performed data normalisation, embedding, visualisation and clustering on each cell population. For each cell population, we regressed out mitochondrial gene percentage using the regress_out function in Scanpy. For the APC population, we additionally regressed out ribosomal gene percentage. Donor-to-donor variation was corrected using the harmonypy package with the theta value being set to 3. For each cell population, we performed clustering using the leiden function in Scanpy and manually annotated clusters based on LR predicted cell identities and differentially expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Visium data processing and spatial mapping of cell types with cell2location</title><p id="P47">Sequencing reads from 10x Genomics Visium FFPE libraries were aligned to the human transcriptome reference GRCh38-2020-A using 10x Genomics SpaceRanger (v.2.1.0) and exonic reads were used to produce mRNA count matrices for each sample. 10x Genomics SpaceRanger was also used to align paired histology images with mRNA capture spot positions in the Visium slide. To spatially map the cell types annotated in scRNA-seq data to their spatial locations in tissues, we applied cell2location to integrating scRNA-seq data of CTCL with Visium FFPE mRNA count matrices as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, the cell2location model estimates the abundance of each cell type in each location by decomposing mRNA counts in Visium FFPE data using the transcriptional signatures of reference cell types. Two major steps were in analysis using cell2location: (1) We applied a negative binomial regression model implemented in cell2location and estimated the reference signature of fine-grained annotated cell types in scRNA-seq data. In this step, we used an unnormalized mRNA count matrix as input and filtered it to 13,581 genes and 279,561 cells. Donor IDs were regarded as the batch category and the following parameters were used to train the model: ‘max_epochs’ = 500, ‘batch_size’ = 2500, ‘train_ size’ = 1 and ‘Ir’ = 0.002. (2) The reference signature model was further used by cell2location to estimate spatial abundance of cell types. We kept genes that were shared with scRNA-seq and estimated the abundance of cell types in the eight Visium FFPE samples. In this step, cell2location was used with the following parameter settings: training iterations: 20,000, number of cells per location N = 7, ‘detection_alpha’ = 20. We further performed NMF of the cell type abundance estimates from cell2location to identify the spatial co-occurrence of cell types with ‘n_fact’ being set to 5 to 30. For downstream analysis, considering that our Visium samples consist of a single piece of tissue, we removed all spots that correspond to tissue debris (that are all spot groups except the largest one). We considered outermost epidermis spots as skin surface and used them to calculate Euclidean from each spot to the closest surface spot and expressed this distance in interspot distances (100μm). In order to estimate cell type abundance in dependence on distance to surface, we first normalised cell type abundance by dividing it by per-spot totals. Then we grouped spots by rounded distance to surface and calculated mean and standard deviation of mean for each cell type and each distance.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Differentially expressed gene analysis using a pseudo-bulk strategy</title><p id="P48">We applied a pseudo-bulk strategy to the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between (1) malignant and benign T cells, (2) malignant T cells from epidermis and dermis, (3) malignant T cells from early stage and advanced stage samples, and (4) microenvironmental cells from CTCL and other three conditions. Briefly, we aggregated raw counts of each gene by donor and used donors rather than cells as biological replicates. DEG analyses were carried out using R package edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. For the analysis of (1), we excluded non-lesion cells from AD and psoriasis and regarded healthy skin, AD and psoriasis as one comparator (other). We filtered genes by expression levels using the filterByExpr function in edgeR with ‘min.count’ and ‘min.total.count’ being set to 50 and 100 respectively. We designed the model matrix using the model.matrix function and only included one variable, namely groups (malignant T cell and benign T cell). For the analysis of (2), we first divided malignant T cells from each patient into those from epidermis and dermis, and conducted pseudobulk on tissue plus patient (i.e., CTCL1_dermis and CTCL1_epidermis were aggregated separately). In model matrix design, we fit the model on paired samples considering both tissue (dermis and epidermis) and patient (CTCL1 to CTCL8). For the analysis of (3), we included both studies (PKU, Vienna and Ncl_Sanger) and groups (malignant T cell and benign T cell) as variables to consider variation across studies. For the analysis of (4), we excluded non-lesion cells from AD and psoriasis and regarded healthy skin, AD and psoriasis as one comparator (other). We filtered genes by expression levels using the filterByExpr function in edgeR with ‘min.count’ and ‘min.total.count’ being set to 50 and 100 respectively. We designed the model matrix using the model.matrix function and only included one variable, namely groups CTCL and other (healthy skin, AD and Psoriasis). For all the analysis, we fit genewise negative binomial generalised linear Models with quasi-likelihood tests using the glmQLFit and glmQLFTest functions in edgeR.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Bulk deconvolution of cell types in healthy skin, AD, psoriasis and CTCL</title><p id="P49">For bulk deconvolution analysis, we first downloaded published bulk RNA-seq datasets of healthy skin, AD, psoriasis, and CTCL from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession codes GSE121212 and GSE168508. A single-cell reference for deconvolution analysis was then prepared by randomly downsampling the integrated object (healthy skin, AD psoriasis, and CTCL) to 8% of total cells. BayesPrism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> was used for deconvolution analysis with raw counts for both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data as inputs. Both the ‘cell type labels’ and the ‘cell state labels’ were set to fine-grained annotations. Ribosomal protein genes and mitochondrial genes were removed from single-cell data as they are not informative in distinguishing cell types and can be a source of large spurious variance. We also excluded genes from sex chromosomes and lowly transcribed as recommended by the BayesPrism tutorial. For further analysis, we applied a pairwise t-test to select differentially expressed genes with the ‘pval.max’ being set to 0.01 and ‘lfc.min’ to 0.1. Finally, a prism object containing all data required for running BayesPrism was created using the new.prism() function, and the deconvolution was performed using the run.prism() function.
