The candidate microRNA and target genes were validated in 85 human liver samples, and subsequently mechanistically characterized in hepatic cells as well as by dietary interventions and hepatic overexpression in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">Here we present the human hepatic microRNA transcriptome of type 2 diabetes in liver biopsies and use a novel seed prediction tool to robustly identify microRNA target genes, which were then validated in a unique cohort of 85 human livers. Subsequent mouse studies identified a distinct signature of T2D-associated miRNAs, partly conserved in both species. Of those, human-murine miR-182-5p was the most associated to whole-body glucose homeostasis and hepatic lipid metabolism. Its target gene <italic>LRP6</italic> was consistently lower expressed in livers of obese T2D humans and mice as well as under conditions of miR-182-5p overexpression. Weight loss in obese mice decreased hepatic miR-182-5p and restored <italic>Lrp6</italic> expression and other miR-182-5p target genes. Hepatic overexpression of miR-182-5p in mice rapidly decreased LRP6 protein levels and increased liver triglycerides and fasting insulin under obesogenic conditions after only seven days.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P4">By mapping the hepatic miRNA-transcriptome of type 2 diabetic obese subjects, validating conserved miRNAs in diet-induced mice, and establishing a novel miRNA prediction tool, we provide a robust and unique resource that will pave the way for future studies in the field. As proof of concept, we revealed that the repression of <italic>LRP6</italic> by miR-182-5p, which promotes lipogenesis and impairs glucose homeostasis, provides a novel mechanistic link between T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and demonstrate in vivo that miR-182-5p can serve as a future drug target for the treatment of obesity-driven hepatic steatosis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P5"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS189146-f006"/></fig>

Accordingly, obesity is the leading risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Yet, while almost 90% of individuals with T2D are overweight or obese, not all obese individuals develop T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Multiple factors play a role in the development of T2D, including genetics, lifestyle, and the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Non-genetic risk factors such as epigenetic changes induced by aging, weight gain, and intrauterine programming were shown to contribute to the increasing prevalence of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. microRNAs (miRNAs), as one epigenetic mechanism, have the potential to simultaneously regulate the expression of multiple genes and entire pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Additionally, miRNAs can mediate organ cross talk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], and the dysregulation of a few miRNAs can have deleterious effects on a systemic level (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]). Aberrant expression of miRNAs in T2-diabetic subjects was already shown in human adipose tissue, pancreatic beta cells, skeletal muscle and blood (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]). However, although the liver is the central organ to maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] little is known about alterations of hepatic miRNA expression in T2-diabetic subjects.</p><p id="P7">miR-103 and miR-107 directly regulate insulin sensitivity in liver and adipose tissue of obese mice by repressing caveolin-1 and insulin receptor signal transduction [10]. Likewise, miR-802 impairs hepatic insulin sensitivity [11] and the highly expressed miRNAs miR-34a [12] and miR-122 [13] perturb hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Nevertheless, most studies on hepatic miRNAs in T2D pathogenesis were performed in laboratory rodents [10,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">16</xref>] or liver cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">17</xref>], human data is largely elusive. We have shown that miR-let-7e is increased in livers of T2-diabetic subjects and associated with down-regulation of the insulin receptor substrate 2 gene (<italic>IRS2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">18</xref>]. A comprehensive evaluation of all hepatic miRNAs transcribed and dysregulated in T2-diabetic subjects is nonetheless missing. Importantly, miRNAs are already used as drug-targets for cancer treatments and provide an excellent basis to develop novel therapies for metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">19</xref>]. Accordingly, here we aimed to conduct a thorough profiling of hepatic miRNA signatures that associate with T2D in obese human subjects with or without type 2 diabetes, to identify miRNAs that control key genes involved in metabolic pathways as well as NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance etiology.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="P8">A detailed description of all methods can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental material</xref>.</p><sec id="S7"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design human cohort</title><p id="P9">All participants of the human cohort signed informed consent.

The full cohort included the original 40 discovery individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Confirming our microarray results, the expression of miR-182-5p was 2.3-fold upregulated in the diabetic livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In this full cohort hepatic miR-182-5p expression was significantly correlated with age after adjustment for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, blue box), therefore we adjusted all consecutive regression analysis for age.

We identified a distinct signature of 28 hepatic miRNAs that were associated with T2D of which 19 miRNAs were associated with further metabolic traits. Of those, the human/murine conserved miRNA miR-182-5p showed the strongest upregulation in T2D subjects and moreover correlated to multiple metabolic traits and pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism including fasting glucose, HbA1c and liver fat content.

Only five miRNAs that were dysregulated in livers of obese T2D humans were conserved in obese insulin-resistant mice. Of note, the discrepancy between the here identified miRNAs and known miRNAs regulating glucose metabolism in murine studies [10,11,13,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">27</xref>] may be based on the design of our human study. Both groups of our human study cohort were severely obese, and our analysis did not compare the obese miRNA transcriptome to a lean control group. Consequently, obesity-induced miRNAs likely escaped our analysis.

Lastly, our results highlight the risk to miss important disease mechanisms when solely focusing on blood-based epigenetic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">41</xref>] and the urgent need for tissue-specific resource databases as presented in this study.</p><p id="P44">According to the miRNA-gene interaction database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], the lipogenic target genes of miR-182-5p <italic>SCD</italic> and <italic>FASN</italic> should be downregulated upon miR-182-5p induction. However, we hypothesize that the increased expression of key genes of cellular <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis is rather an effect of the miR-182-5p mediated repression of <italic>LRP6</italic> than a direct miRNA-mRNA interaction<italic>. LRP6</italic> is a Wnt co-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">43</xref>] and is linked to metabolic diseases in humans since several loss-of-function mutations within <italic>LRP6</italic> were shown to cause hypertriglyceridemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">45</xref>], hypercholesterinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">47</xref>], NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">48</xref>] and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">49</xref>]. Loss of <italic>LRP6</italic> mediated activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) enhances hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">46</xref>] which is in line with the observed increased expression of <italic>SCD</italic> in T2D obese humans and <italic>SCD</italic> and <italic>FASN</italic> in HepG2 cells after miR-182-5p mimic transfection. Additionally, mice carrying the loss-of-function mutation LRP6 p.R611C develop fatty liver disease including insulin resistance, liver inflammation and steatosis due to increased hepatic <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Besides its crucial role as regulator of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis <italic>LRP6</italic> regulates glucose metabolism by promoting TCF7L2-dependent insulin receptor expression in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">51</xref>] and by regulating <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">52</xref>]. Our findings of reduced <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in diabetic obese humans and reduced <italic>INSR</italic> and <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in DIO mice as well as downregulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling in miR-182-5p overexpressing cells are consistent with this glucoregulatory role of <italic>LRP6</italic>, acting under tight control by miR-182-5p. Our acute hepatic miR-182-5p overexpression study in mice strongly corroborates this miR-182-5p-Lrp6 link, and warrants additional, long-term studies on whole body glucose tolerance and hepatic metabolism in miR-182-5p overexpressing mice.</p><p id="P45">In naïve mice, hepatic miR-182-5p expression was only upregulated after 20 weeks of HFD feeding, i.e. long after the mice develop obesity compared to standard diet fed mice. Accordingly, obesity <italic>per se</italic> does not seem to be the sole driver of hepatic miR-182-5p. This is consistent with the human situation, were only diabetic obese but not “healthy” obese humans show the increase of hepatic miR-182-5p expression. Whether miR-182-5p dictates if an obese individual becomes type 2 diabetic or remains glucose tolerant, and whether miR-182-5p mechanistically drives hepatic dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, are thus intriguing questions for future studies. Such follow-up studies should be conducted in humans, given that mice are rarely developing diabetic pathologies surpassing glucose intolerance, and should compare lean with overweight or obese non-diabetic and T2D subjects to specifically address whether exacerbated hepatic insulin resistance and lipid deposition affect miR-182-5p expression levels. In our cohort, T2D subjects received anti-diabetic treatment, which is a limitation of our study. HbA1c levels in the T2-diabetic subjects were nonetheless still significantly higher compared to the ND obese individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To ultimately dissect if hepatic miR-182-5p upregulation is causally involved in the development of insulin resistance or if it is a marker of manifested T2D would mandate longitudinal studies. First mechanistic evidence is revealed by our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, which show that miR-182-5p overexpression acutely decreases glucose uptake and insulin signal transduction in hepatic cells and increases fasting insulin levels and hepatic fat content in mice. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms inducing miR-182-5p expression in the liver of T2-diabetic subjects, and whether miR-182-5p antagonism can rescue the metabolic phenotype in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P46">We provide a network of novel microRNAs that are dysregulated in livers of T2-diabetic subjects and identify miR-182-5p and its target genes as potential drivers of dysregulated glucose tolerance and fatty acid metabolism in obese T2-diabetics. Mechanistic studies with miRNA mimics in cells and mice revealed that hepatic miR-182 expression elicits repressive effects on its target gene <italic>LRP6</italic> and subsequently on glucose and lipid metabolism. The discoveries that miR-182-5p is associated to T2D and NAFLD via <italic>LRP6</italic> downregulation in liver of obese subjects and the reversibility by weight loss in DIO mice offer unique mechanistic insight into diabetes pathology and point towards promising future anti-diabetic strategies, built either on antagonizing miR-182-5p activity or reducing hepatic miR-182-5p expression by pharmacological or dietary means.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplemental_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Tables 1-9</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplemental_Tables_1_9.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Figure 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d17aAdFiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplemental Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS189146-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAdFjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M.

LRP6 (highlighted) is the main target gene and consistently altered in humans, cell culture and mouse. miR-182-5p is induced by long-term feeding of high-fat diet in mice and reversed by weight loss. Identified target genes are consequently altered inversely to miRNA-182-5p expression. To prove direct effects, liver-specific upregulation of miR-182-5p in metabolically challenged mice caused a significant reduction of LRP6 which is accompanied by increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased fasting insulin levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189146-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
