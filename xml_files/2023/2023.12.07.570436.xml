Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, such as <italic>nanos, vasa</italic> and <italic>piwi</italic>. Interestingly, in animals, which are capable of whole-body regeneration, such as poriferans, hydrozoans and planarians, these genes are also expressed in somatic multi- and pluripotent stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. While multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have been identified in hydrozoans, they have not unambiguously been demonstrated in other cnidarian classes. Therefore, it is currently unclear if these stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin or have been adapted individually in different lineages as homoplasy. We therefore aimed to characterize stem cells expressing conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, to gain insight of shared traits governing the regulation of this enigmatic cell type. Through single cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline associated markers <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> in the soma and germline. Transgenic reporter genes reveal a lineage giving rise to somatic cells, consistent with a role as a multipotent stem cell population. Cell proliferation studies show that a fraction of <italic>nanos2+</italic> reporter cells are cycling and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout show that <italic>nanos2+</italic> progenitor cells are indispensable for male and female germline maintenance in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. This suggests <italic>nanos</italic> and <italic>piwi</italic> genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cnidarians are well known for their high regenerative potential, sexual as well as asexual reproduction and the potential for extreme longevity with some species being even considered immortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Other metazoans, which share these features, facilitate them through multi- or pluripotent stem cell populations like the archaeocytes of sponges or the neoblasts of planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, it is currently unclear if the diverse stem cell systems observed in the animal kingdom are homologous. The comparison of stem cells in bilaterians with those of basally branching animals, such as cnidarians, may shed light into their potential common ancestry. The freshwater polyp <italic>Hydra</italic> possesses four independent stem cell populations, the ectodermal and endodermal epithelial stem cells, as well as two sub-populations of interstitial or i-cells, one that gives rise to gametes, and one that gives rise to gland, mucous, nematocytes and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Yet, i-cells have so far only been observed in hydrozoans, where they can be easily identified morphologically and by a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. For the rest of the cnidarian phylum, the source of new cells (i.e., their stem cells) for any tissue is unknown. While in several non-hydrozoans, “amoebocytes” have been described, their differentiation status and relationship to interstitial cells is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The lack of clear evidence of i-cells outside of hydrozoans suggests that this cell type may be an innovation of this lineage rather than a synapomorphy of the Cnidaria as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This would be somewhat surprising given that most non-hydrozoan cnidarians have similar growth and regeneration capacities as hydrozoans. Hence, if there are no i-cells outside of hydrozoans, the question is, which cells can fulfill their function. Alternatively, they might have been simply overlooked by the so far classic histological methods used to address this question. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the characteristics of the ancestral state for application to evolutionary questions and deduce common principles of cnidarian stem cells, by utilizing the anthozoan <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> as a model system. Since in <italic>Nematostella</italic> no cell population similar to the hydrozoan i-cells has been described, we performed a molecular characterization of potential stem cells through the expression of stemness-associated marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). As an alternative way to the identification of stem cells by morphological features, we reasoned that conserved molecular markers of stem cells might point us to cell populations with stem cell properties. Indeed, <italic>piwi, vasa</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic> were found to be expressed in multipotent and pluripotent stem cells of various metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). As members of the so-called germline multipotency program (GMP), these genes are often expressed in, or even restricted to the germline of ecdysozoan and vertebrate animals, although they can also be expressed in multipotent stem- and progenitor cells in echinoderms, lophotrochozoans, cnidarians and poriferans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). <italic>Piwi</italic> genes interact with piRNAs, which guide them to repress transposons, and protect the genome from damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The <italic>nanos</italic> gene family codes for zinc-finger containing RNA-binding proteins, with apoptosis and differentiation promoting mRNA targets, thereby inhibiting those processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The activity of both gene families is especially conserved in the germline of vertebrates and insects, where they ensure genomic integrity and keep gametes in a stem cell-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we found three piwi genes (one of which appears to be a pseudogene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and two <italic>nanos</italic> paralogs, <italic>nanos1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic>. While <italic>nanos1</italic> marks the neuronoal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), <italic>nanos2</italic> expression studies implied a role in germline formation, similar to that of <italic>vasa1</italic>, <italic>vasa2</italic> and <italic>PL10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Further, <italic>nanos</italic> gene expression can be detected in the interstitial stem cells of <italic>Hydractinia</italic> and <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Together, these expression studies of <italic>nanos</italic> suggested a role in germline, multipotent stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we used single cell transcriptome data to identify a population of <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> positive cells. We generated transgenic reporter lines using <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> promoters and showed that both cell populations give rise to somatic cell types of the neuroglandular lineages. A <italic>nanos2</italic> knockout mutant reveals a conserved crucial role for <italic>nanos</italic> in the formation of the germline.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Piwi1</italic> and <italic>Nanos2</italic> are expressed in a broad range of somatic cell types and gametes</title><p id="P4"><italic>Piwi1</italic> has been previously shown to be expressed broadly during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), however, expression at later stages has not yet been well described and the fate of the <italic>Piwi1</italic> expressing cells is still unclear. To visualize <italic>Piwi1</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a transgenic reporter line expressing mOrange2 (mOr) under the control of the <italic>Piwi1</italic> promoter. The fluorescent reporter recapitulates the mRNA expression observed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (18; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>) shifting from a ubiquitous expression in the gastrula stage to mainly being restricted to endomesodermal tissues during polyp metamorphosis. A low level of reporter expression in ectodermal body wall and tentacle epithelia is, however, retained from the polyp stage onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B,F</xref>). In the adult animal, the endodermal tissue surrounding the pharynx and the gonadal region of the mesentery and ciliated tract are also mOrange positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In juvenile animals, reporter expression is more restricted to few cells residing between the distal tip of the retractor muscle and the ciliated tract, the region where the gonad will form during sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, arrowheads). In the adult mesenteries the endomesodermal expression extends to all epithelia surrounding the gonads and the reticulate tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Notably, large numbers of small single cells displaying mOrange reporter expression are found all along the mesenteries, but especially concentrated around the parietal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To identify cell types expressing <italic>Piwi1</italic>::mOr, we dissociated adult animals and surveyed single cells. In these cell spreads, we find few <italic>Piwi1</italic>::mOrange+ cells in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>) as well as all descendants of the neuroglandular lineage: neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), gland cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and cnidocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K-M</xref>). In summary, <italic>piwi1::</italic>mOrange is expressed in oocytes, spermatogonia, putative germline stem cells, cells of the neuroglandular lineage and at low levels in the ectodermal body wall epithelia as well as the endomesodermal epithelia surrounding the gonad region and the pharynx. This situation is similar to hydrozoan cnidarians, where <italic>piwi</italic> expression has been detected in somatic as well as germline cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next wished to study the lineage derivatives of <italic>nanos</italic> expressing cells. A phylogenetic analysis shows that the <italic>nanos</italic> gene has duplicated in the common ancestor of all cnidarians and most cnidarians have retained both paralogs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Fig</xref>). <italic>Nanos1</italic> has recently been found to mark the neural precursor cells in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). To monitor the expression and fate of <italic>nanos2</italic>-expressing cells in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we generated a transgenic reporter line using the upstream and downstream cis-regulatory elements expressing mOrange. The fluorophore expression during developmental stages recapitulates the pattern retrieved from in situ hybridisation (ISH), changing from an ubiquitous expression in the gastrula and planula stage to being mostly restricted to the primary mesenteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). In juvenile transgenic animals, <italic>nanos2</italic> is expressed around the mouth, similar to hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) in the first forming ciliated tracts of the primary mesenteries, as well as in single cells distributed throughout the whole animal in both germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The ectodermal layer displays a dense net of neurons, expressing the mOr fluorophore at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), whereas in the endomesodermal layer sensory neurons, gland cells and undifferentiated cells are concentrated along the parietal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Interestingly, the pharynx shows patchy expression in the ectodermal tissue (which, according to recent profiling has an endodermal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>)) with parts of the innermost folds being transgenic as well as the outward folds bordering the inner layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Similar to the <italic>piwi1</italic> transgenic line, <italic>nanos2::</italic>mOrange is expressed in the epithelia surrounding the gonad, however <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange additionally marks the side of the ciliated tract bordering the gonadal regions, corresponding to the reticulate tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). In the single cell spreads we can again detect <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange expression in all neuroglandular cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-M</xref>). However, in both <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange and <italic>Piwi1</italic>::mOrange transgenic animals, only a small fraction of neuroglandular cell types show low levels of residual fluorophore, and most are not expressing mOrange. Therefore, we conclude that both genes are most likely expressed in the precursor population, from which the neuroglandular cell types differentiate and carry on residual mOrange reporter protein.</p><p id="P7">Taken together, both <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> reporter lines show a very similar expression pattern in terms of cell types. The <italic>nanos2</italic> promoter drives fluorophore expression in all descendants of the neuroglandular lineage and the gonad epithelia. However, in contrast to <italic>Piwi1</italic>::mOrange, <italic>nanos2::</italic>mOrange is not expressed in oocytes, but marks the epithelia around the mouth, in the pharynx and the putative gametogenic region of the reticulate tract in the septal filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In contrast to most bilaterian animals, gametes in cnidarians are presumably not formed by a set-aside cell population, but rather constantly produced by somatic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This suggests the presence of a population of gametogenic stem cells. As both <italic>nanos</italic> and <italic>piwi</italic> genes are conserved germline factors, we studied their expression in detail in the gonadal region. Both genes show the same expression pattern in males where they are expressed in the outer perimeter of the spermaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C,E</xref>). In females, however, <italic>nanos2</italic> marks the trophocytes (accessory cells), which are situated close to the germinal vesicle of each oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,F</xref>). These cells form the trophonemata, a cnidarian specific ring-shaped structure consisting of multiple trophocytes, which are in close contact with the surface of the oocyte and thought to provide nutrients to the growing egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, Arrowhead; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>)). Interestingly, a plug of ciliated cells, which express both <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>piwi1</italic> is apparent at each sperm cyst. This structure has been described previously, and has been speculated to be homologous to the trophonemata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H,I</xref>, arrowheads; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>)).</p><p id="P9"><italic>Piwi1</italic> is expressed in the oocytes itself, where the reporter concentration is highest in smaller oocytes and fading in larger ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). However, <italic>piwi1</italic> expression is lacking from the trophonemata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>) but can also be detected in the ciliated plugs of the spermaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3L, M</xref>, arrowheads). To our knowledge, this plug has not been functionally described in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and we can only speculate about its function. It is apparent that the size of the nuclei in the sperm cysts decreases from the outer margins towards the inside, suggesting that sperm differentiation proceeds from the perimeter inwards. These small nuclei, however, seem to flow towards the ciliated plugs, which indicates that this might be the place where sperm is released into the body column during spawning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, L, M</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Through the expression patterns obtained by ISH and the reporter gene expression in transgenic animals, we conclude that both <italic>Piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> are expressed in somatic cell types of the neuroglandular lineage and the germline. The mOr reporter of both genes is detected only in a few cells of each of the somatic cell types. This suggests that the fluorophore in these fully differentiated cells was carried over from a common NPC. However, <italic>piwi1</italic> is expressed much stronger in the germline, whereas <italic>nanos2</italic>-positive cells are much more frequent in the descendants of somatic lineages. Also, both markers are expressed in epithelial cell populations, where <italic>piwi1</italic> is very broadly expressed in the body wall ectoderm at a low level, while <italic>nanos2</italic> is restricted to regions of the pharynx and ciliated tract, with a higher expression level overall. For evaluation of functional studies affecting the expressing cell populations, we therefore focused on surveying the <italic>nanos2</italic> expressing population.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Nanos2+</italic> cells are a cycling population</title><p id="P11">To assess if the <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange expressing cells comprise an actively cycling population, we labeled transgenic animals for 24 hours with EdU. After this period, a fraction of the mOrange+ cells in each body region and tissue were marked by EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Since the transgenic line retains mOrange reporter expression in derivatives of <italic>nanos2</italic> expressing cells, we suspect, that the EdU-negative <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange+ cells is comprised of terminally differentiated cell types such as neurons and gland cells as well as possibly slow cycling quiescent stem cells, whereas the fast cycling cells may be immediate precursor populations of the neuroglandular or germline cells.</p><p id="P12">To determine this fraction of actively cycling <italic>nanos2</italic> expressing cells, we wished to carry out a double staining of <italic>nanos2</italic> mRNA and EdU pulse labeling. However, the cellular resolution of the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>nanos2</italic> in adults is very limited, also because the density of small <italic>nanos2</italic> expressing cells is so high in many regions of the body. Therefore, we subjected the transgenic animals to a EdU pulse of 5 hours, dissociated them afterwards, and counted the numbers of EdU positive and negative cells as well as <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange positive and negative cells (Supporting Information, Table 1). We found that <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange cells comprise a significant fraction of all cells (23%), of which 11.8% were EdU+ under these conditions. This shows that at least a subpopulation of <italic>nanos2</italic> positive cells are proliferative. Together with our finding that the mOrange reporter protein is expressed in somatic lineages this is consistent with the possibility that <italic>nanos2</italic>-expressing cells have properties of multipotent stem cells or progenitors. However, we also note that among the <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange negative cells, a similar fraction (13,3%) is also labeled by EdU. The nuclei of these <italic>nanos2</italic>-negative/EdU+ cells are relatively large and round, raising the possibility that these might be epithelial cells. While the nature of these cycling cells remains elusive, this shows that <italic>nanos2</italic>-expressing cells are not the only cycling cells in an adult polyp.</p><p id="P13">Some adult stem cells are mitotically quiescent for long times and rarely divide. These can only be detected by a label retention assay, where an EdU pulse is followed by long periods of no label. Under such conditions, rapidly cycling progenitors would rapidly dilute out the incorporated EdU label to the progeny cells, while quiescent or rarely dividing stem cells would retain the label even after an extended time. To test whether <italic>Nematostella</italic> might have slowly or quiescent stem cells, we incubated the <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and <italic>Piwi1</italic>::mOrange transgenic polyps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 Fig</xref>) for 1 week in EdU, followed by extensive chase with <italic>Nematostella</italic> medium and fixed the animals after several time points up to 3 months after the labeling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows that in cryosections of the polyps we found indeed several EdU<sup>+</sup>/<italic>nanos2</italic>:mOrange<sup>+</sup> cells 1-3 months after the pulse, demonstrating the existence of quiescent or rarely dividing stem cells. Since the label could be also retained by differentiated, long-lived cells, e.g. neurons, it is important to note that the morphology of these cells were small round cells, intercalated between the epithelial cells throughout the animal, but often in the vicinity of the mesentery base, suggesting that these are non-differentiated cells, similar to interstitial cells in hydrozoans. Thus, the detection of rarely dividing <italic>nanos2</italic>+ cells explains at least in part the relatively low fraction of pulse-labeled cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>Nanos2</italic> mutants fail to form primordial germ cells and gametes</title><p id="P14">To test the function of <italic>nanos2</italic> in cellular differentiation, we generated a KO mutant using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), introducing a 1bp insertion at the 5´;end of the predicted Nanos specific zinc finger sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4 Fig</xref>). This results in an early stop codon, which renders the protein unable to form a ternary complex with binding partners such as Pumilio or bind to mRNAs on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). After crossing the heterozygous mutant F1 parent generation, we observed no increased mortality or developmental defects in the offspring, and homozygous mutant animals were only identifiable through sequencing of the <italic>nanos2</italic> locus. We raised the homozygous mutant polyps to adulthood and tried to spawn them. Yet, while wildtype polyps start to spawn after about 4-5 months postfertilization, even after 1 year none of the mutants spawned any gametes, neither oocytes nor sperm, suggesting that the <italic>nanos2</italic> mutants are sterile.</p><p id="P15">To further validate this, we carried out a staining for Vasa2 protein.

Of note, these genes show a partial overlap with the early regulators of the neuroglandular lineages <italic>nanos1, soxC, soxB2a</italic> (also known as <italic>soxB(2)</italic>). To investigate the distribution of the mutant-derived cells within this population, we re-analyzed this cluster separately. Primordial germ cells first originate at the boundary of the ectodermal and mesodermal cell layer in the pharynx of primary and juvenile polyps, from where they migrate into the gonad primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Within this subset of the single cell data of the wildtype polyp we can clearly identify the maturing spermatozoa, primary germ cells, and a cluster of primary oocytes in addition to the putative stem cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Importantly, we find no <italic>nanos2</italic>-/- mutant cells contributing to the primordial germ cells, although this sample does contribute to the putative stem cell precursor population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Neither male nor female gametes could be detected in <italic>nanos2</italic>-/- mutants. This suggests that <italic>nanos2</italic> is required for the formation of the PGCs in both sexes and subsequent differentiation of gametes at an early stage of development. Together with the morphological observations described above, we conclude that <italic>nanos2</italic> is required for germline formation and gamete differentiation in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p id="P18">We note that in the single cell transcriptomes of the <italic>nanos2-/-</italic> mutants, the derivatives of the neuroglandular lineages are still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-C</xref>), although neuroglandular derivatives are found in the <italic>nanos2</italic> transgenic line, suggesting a lineage relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We previously described <italic>nanos1</italic> marking the neuronal progenitor population, overlapping with <italic>soxC</italic>, which acts as the most upstream determinant of several somatic lineages, such as cnidocytes, neurons, and gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This is in line with the observation that the mutants are phenotypically normal, can feed and move as wildtype animals. Long-term observations of our animals did not indicate defects in the homeostatic renewal of neuroglandular cell types or a negative impact on the survivability of <italic>nanos2</italic>-/- mutants. Therefore, while <italic>nanos2</italic> is expressed in NPCs, it is unlikely that <italic>nanos2</italic> is essential for the differentiation of the neuroglandular lineages into terminal cell types. However, we cannot rule out that the lack of a phenotype in the neuroglandular lineages in the <italic>nanos2-/-</italic> mutant might be due to genetic compensation, for instance by <italic>nanos1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In line with this, <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>nanos1</italic> also show a partially overlapping expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Co-expression of <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> in the neural progenitor population and multiple derivatives, together with expression patterns of the fluorophore detected in our transgenic lines, indicate a role of <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> beyond the specification of primordial germ cells. However, slight differences in gene function might be inferred by the single cell expression data. <italic>Nanos2</italic> appears to feature a much broader expression profile than <italic>Piwi1</italic> and is particularly upregulated in the pSC population of both wild type and mutant.

Taken together, our data suggests that <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> function at the top of the differentiation cascade of most cell types, with the possible exception of epithelial cells, and therefore we consider <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> positive cells as a population of putative stem cells that give rise to both primordial germ cells and neural progenitor cells, reminiscent of the hydrozoan i-cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Cnidarians have a remarkable tissue plasticity and regenerative capacity. They can grow and shrink repeatedly yet maintain a homeostatic ratio of all cell types at all times. However, many cell types, such as neurons, cnidocytes, and gland cells are terminally differentiated. Importantly, gametes can also be considered a differentiated cell type. Therefore, they must be replenished from a pluripotent or multipotent stem cell pool. In <italic>Hydra</italic>, interstitial stem cells have been shown to act as multipotent stem cells for all cells except epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In the marine hydrozoan <italic>Hydractinia</italic>, interstitial cells have been shown to also give rise to epithelial cells, thus, they are considered as pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), similar to neoblasts in planarians. Yet, interstitial stem cells have so far only been identified in hydrozoans, and not in any of the other cnidarian classes, despite the fact that they have very similar properties. Therefore, we used conserved molecular stem cell marker genes to molecularly identify putative stem cells in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic>. This includes the <italic>piwi</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic> gene families, which have been implicated in the germline of many bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Piwi binds to piRNAs, which are silencing transposons and hence is thought to contribute to the genome integrity of the germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, an involvement in somatic cells has also been demonstrated. For instance, in planarians <italic>piwi</italic> was shown to be essential for the pluripotent stem cells, the neoblasts, which give rise to all other cell types and hence are crucial for maintenance of the whole body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Additionally, the <italic>piwi1</italic>::mOr transgenic line displays low level expression in the ectoderm and gastrodermis. We could also detect mRNA transcripts of <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> in cells of these epithelia in scRNAseq, while we were unable to detect them by ISH. The low-level expression of these genes might hint towards the existence of epithelial cells as separate stem cell lineages which replenishes the epithelia of the polyp, similar to those of <italic>Hydra</italic>. This would be in line with the existence of a cycling cell population, which is negative for <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange and <italic>piwi1</italic>::mOrange.</p><p id="P21">Nanos, an RNA-binding zinc finger protein implicated in translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), has also been implicated in the germline of many bilaterians, but also in somatic stem cells of some highly regenerative animals, e.g. in neoblasts in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>), archeocytes in sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>) and interstitial stem cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In <italic>Hydra</italic>, a transgenic reporter line under control of the <italic>nanos1</italic> promoter showed that <italic>nanos1</italic> positive stem cells give rise to cnidocytes and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). However, while the function of <italic>piwi</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic> has been shown in planarians, in <italic>Hydra</italic> there are only expression studies available. Moreover, interstitial stem cells have only been demonstrated in hydrozoans, not in other cnidarians. Thus, the nature of possible multipotent stem cells remains enigmatic at this point. The expression of two <italic>nanos</italic> paralogs, <italic>nanos1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> (common to all cnidarians) and two <italic>piwi</italic> genes, <italic>Piwi1</italic> and <italic>piwi2</italic>, have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, the cellular resolution of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization did not permit visualization of individual cells in the adult. Moreover, neither their lineage relationship with other cell types nor their function is known. In the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, single cell RNAseq and transgenic lines showed that <italic>nanos1</italic> is expressed in neuronal precursor cells and gives rise to neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). By contrast, single cell RNAseq suggested that <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> are expressed in a broad spectrum of undifferentiated and differentiating cell types. In this study, we have generated transgenic lines of the <italic>Piwi1</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic> genes in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis.</italic> Both reporter lines mimic the mRNA expression and show similar, but not identical patterns: <italic>Piwi1</italic> is expressed broadly at a low level in the ectodermal layer but is strongly upregulated in many small round cells in the inner (endomesodermal) cell layer as well as in the early stages of germ cells (oogonia and spermatogonia). <italic>Nanos2</italic> and <italic>Piwi1</italic> transgene expression is found in numerous very small cells located between epithelial cells of both layers, spread all over the whole body. Since the fluorophore also transmits into somatic cell types, like neurons and gland cells, we assume that the <italic>nanos2</italic>+ cells give rise to differentiated cells of the neuroglandular lineage. In addition, at least a fraction of the <italic>nanos2</italic>+ cells are proliferating and the label-retention assay over three months demonstrates that some are very rarely dividing cells. Similarly, the <italic>Piwi1</italic> transgenic line also harbors slow cycling label retention cells. These features are essential criteria for a multipotent stem cell population similar to the interstitial stem cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Interestingly, a transgenic <italic>vasa2</italic> line also showed somatic cell type derivatives such as neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Co-staining of the <italic>nanos2</italic>::mOrange line with Vasa2 antibodies showed partial overlap between Vasa2 positive cells (presumably primordial germ cells) and <italic>nanos2</italic>+ cells. These data strongly suggest a role of <italic>piwi1</italic>, <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>vasa2</italic> in a population of multipotent stem cells.</p><p id="P22">However, our <italic>nanos2-/-</italic> mutant did not show any detectable effect on the neuroglandular lineage, suggesting that <italic>nanos2</italic> is not essential for this somatic lineage.

Future work will have to address this possibility. As no functional data are available for <italic>piwi1</italic> and <italic>vasa2</italic>, we don’t know whether these genes are essential for neuroglandular lineages and whether the identified single cells are truly somatic stem cells.</p><p id="P23">Regardless of the role of <italic>nanos2</italic> in the somatic cell lineages, our <italic>nanos2</italic> knockout mutant clearly shows that it is indispensable for the generation of primordial germ cells and hence for the formation of male and female gametes. As a result, <italic>nanos2</italic> mutants are sterile. A sterility phenotype has been also observed for <italic>nanos</italic> knockouts in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila, C. elegans</italic> and mouse, <italic>nanos</italic> is necessary for germ stem cell self-renewal and it prevents precocious differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Since we cannot detect primordial germ cells in the <italic>nanos2</italic> mutant in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we assume that this function is conserved between bilaterians and cnidarians and dates back at least to the common ancestor about 600 million years ago. While this study could not confirm the presence of a pluripotent stem cell population, it has recently been proposed that the <italic>piwi1</italic>+ and Vasa2+ cell population is the source of gametes as well as SoxB(2)+ neurons based on lineage analyses of transgenic lines, similar to our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>).
