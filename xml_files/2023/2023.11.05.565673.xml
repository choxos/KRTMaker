Their functional assessment is fundamental for defining any implication in human diseases and may also uncover genes that are essential for human organ development. Here, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on human iPSCs to study a heterozygous missense variant in <italic>GLI2</italic> identified in a paediatric hyperglycaemic patient and family members. GLI2 is a primary mediator of the Hedgehog pathway, which regulates pancreatic β-cell development in mice. However, neither mutations in <italic>GLI2</italic> nor Hedgehog dysregulation have been reported as cause or predisposition to diabetes. A set of isogenic iPSC lines harbouring the missense variant were studied for their ability to differentiate into pancreatic β-like cells. Interestingly, iPSCs carrying the missense variant showed altered GLI2 transcriptional activity and impaired endocrine differentiation. Collectively, our findings underscore an essential role for GLI2 in human endocrine development and identify a novel variant that predisposes to diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GLI2</kwd><kwd>beta cells</kwd><kwd>endocrine cells</kwd><kwd>monogenic diabetes</kwd><kwd>pancreatic differentiation</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diabetes is a worldwide health problem caused by the loss or dysfunction of the insulin-secreting β-cells in the pancreas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Unelucidated forms of monogenic diabetes, arising from rare mutations in one single gene, represent invaluable models for identifying new targets of β-cell development and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Notably, monogenic diabetes predominantly results from mutations in transcription factors, which are involved in pancreas development and may also cause type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> To date, over 30 genes have been linked to monogenic diabetes, yet many patients are misdiagnosed.

However, after gut tube stage, the number of GLI2<sup>+/+</sup> cell clusters gradually decreased and differentiation arrested at endocrine progenitor stage, failing to reach β-like cell stage. Differences between GLI2<sup>CTRL</sup> and GLI2<sup>+/+</sup> became evident at pancreatic progenitor stage and exacerbated at endocrine progenitor stage, with only approximately 10% of GLI2<sup>+/+</sup>-derived clusters being positive for both PDX1 and NKX6.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>).

At early stages (iPSC and gut tube stage), the transcriptome of GLI2<sup>CTRL</sup> and GLI2<sup>+/-</sup>-derived cells was highly comparable, with only 48 genes significantly dysregulated at gut tube stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). By contrast, differences at the transcriptome level became evident at endocrine progenitor stage [928 genes upregulated and 1070 downregulated in mutant <italic>versus</italic> control cells] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that gene sets significantly downregulated in mutant GLI2<sup>+/-</sup> endocrine progenitor cells belong to the ‘Pancreas development’ gene ontology (GO) term, including <italic>PDX1, NKX6</italic>.<italic>1, NGN3</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).

Isogenic iPSC lines with either a heterozygous or homozygous p.P1554L mutation in the <italic>GLI2</italic> gene showed impaired endocrine progenitor development in a dose-dependent manner. The iPSC models have allowed us to move beyond the discovery of the mutant variant to an understanding of the causative variant and the molecular mechanisms of the disease.</p><p id="P16">Indeed, the diminished expression of <italic>NGN3</italic> observed in patient-like iPSCs leads to endocrine progenitor pool depletion, which might ultimately result in reduced β-cell mass at birth and explain the onset of the diabetes in young age. Hence, these results support the likely pathogenicity of the p.P1554L variant, possibly through impaired GLI2 transcriptional activity.</p><p id="P17">Precise spatiotemporal HH regulation is crucial for pancreas development and β-cell function in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Here, we uncovered a role for <italic>GLI2</italic> in human β-cell development, expanding our current knowledge of human pancreatic development. We found that <italic>GLI2</italic> is expressed in a sub-set of pancreatic progenitors, before endocrine specification, and its expression persists at later stages in human islet cells. Early <italic>GLI2</italic> transcriptional activity regulates a set of genes, including NGN3, which are essential for the activation of the endocrine program. RNASeq and network analyses also revealed a crosstalk between HH/GLI2 and WNT pathways in human pancreatic progenitors, which results into dysregulation of non-canonical WNT signaling in GLI2<sup>+/-</sup> mutant cells. Notably, rescue experiments (by blocking WNT5A) as well as mimicking experiments (by adding WNT5A) showed that GLI2 functions in endocrine progenitors through mechanisms that regulate Wnt signaling. A crosstalk between HH/GLI and WNT pathways has been reported in other contexts, such as cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> However, the precise mechanisms that regulate HH and WNT activity seem to be highly context-specific and the events by which changes in HH/GLI2 signaling in pancreatic cells determines WNT regulation remain to be fully elucidated. Stage-specific WNT signaling regulates multiple aspects of pancreas development in different species, including patterning, specification, and differentiation of pancreatic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> Recent studies reported a non-cell autonomous WNT5A-mediated role for β-cell differentiation from endocrine progenitors in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and human stem cell models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> By contrast, WNT5A/PCP role in beta-cell maturation is still not fully understood and might be different between mouse and human.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Moreover, <italic>WNT5a</italic> is expressed in the pancreatic epithelial component, beside the mesenchyme, and it is unclear how the expression of this ligand is coordinated in the epithelial/mesenchyme compartment to regulate endocrine cell formation. Here, we identified an additional stage-specific response to cell autonomous WNT that corresponds to the time when human pancreatic progenitors acquire endocrine identity. At this specific stage, it is likely that the crosstalk between the two pathways confers temporal control to WNT, wherein GLI2 activation might sustain canonical WNT and prevent aberrant non-canonical WNT signaling during the acquisition of human endocrine progenitor fate. The diverse roles and mechanisms regulating HH and WNT crosstalk during pancreatic lineage differentiation remain to be fully elucidated. Also, while we have presented evidence for HH regulation of non-canonical WNT, the mechanism by which GLI2 affects WNT responsiveness is not known in pancreatic progenitors and is a subject for future research. Overall, such knowledge could be harnessed to improve current targeted differentiation protocols for optimizing β-cell differentiation from human PSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Human material and patient variant discovery</title><p id="P18">The index child was part of a cohort of 94 individuals recruited from Charité Medical School and international diabetes centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> All individuals with hyperglycemia tested negative for β-cell autoantibodies and developed diabetes before the age of 18 years.
