Although various molecular tools exist to visualize binary protein interactions in live cells, the visualization of multiprotein complexes remains a challenge. Here, we report the engineering of a complementation-based approach allowing one to visualize the interaction of three proteins through effective proximity-induced complementation of three fragments of pFAST, a chemogenetic fluorescent reporter that binds and stabilizes the fluorescent state of fluorogenic chromophores (so-called fluorogens). This tripartite-split-pFAST allowed the observation of dynamic ternary protein complexes in the cytosol, at the plasma membrane, in the nucleus and at the junction of multiple organelles, opening great prospects to study the role and function of multiprotein complexes in live cells and in various biologically relevant contexts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Physical closeness plays essential roles in biology. Interactions between proteins regulate nearly every major process in cells, from signal transduction to gene regulation, protein transport or metabolism. Close proximity between organelles allows communication through membrane contacts and plays important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Various methods have been developed to visualize interactions or proximity in live cells by fluorescence microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Most of them rely either on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) or bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). FRET is a physical effect between two fluorophores in close proximity. As the efficiency of the energy transfer is sensitive to the distance between the two fluorophores, FRET can be used to visualize the proximity of two entities coupled to the appropriate fluorophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. BiFC, on the other hand, is based on the fusion of two non-fluorescent fragments from a split fluorescent protein to two interaction partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Close proximity brings the two non-fluorescent fragments together, allowing the reconstitution of a functional fluorescent protein. BiFC is often preferred as it allows the direct visualization of interactions or proximity with high contrast and its implementation is technically simpler. However, the slow and irreversible complementation of the split fluorescent proteins prevents their general use for the study of dynamic interactions. Split fluorescent reporters with rapid and reversible complementation have been recently developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, relying on Fluorescence-Activating and absorption-Shifting Tags (FASTs), small proteins able to bind and stabilize the fluorescent state of synthetic fluorogenic chromophores (so-called fluorogens) that are otherwise dark when free in solution or cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Two non-fluorescent fragments of FASTs are fused to two interaction partners. When in close proximity, a functional split-FAST is reconstituted, enabling fluorogen binding and the formation of a fluorescent assembly. As the binding of the fluorogen is rapid, non-covalent and dynamic, the complementation of split-FASTs is rapid and reversible, allowing the visualization of dynamic protein-protein interactions in real-time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Split-FAST has been recently used for developing fluorescent probes enabling to characterize the dynamics of organelle-organelle contact sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and lipid dropletorganelle interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Although FRET and BiFC have been widely used to study binary protein interactions, the visualization of multiple protein complexes in living cells remains a challenge. Because most cellular processes are carried out by assemblies of more than two proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, the detection of ternary or even higher order interactions is essential to study and understand the processes that govern cells. Existing tools to analyze three-partner interactions are limited to three-chromophore FRET (3-FRET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which uses three mutually dependent energy transfer processes between cyan, yellow and red fluorescent proteins, and BiFC-based FRET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which relies on FRET between a cyan fluorescent protein and a split yellow fluorescent protein.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present the development of a tripartite-split-FAST able to complement when three proteins are proximal or interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While various bipartite split reporters exist, the design of tripartite split systems capable of reconstituting when three entities are in close proximity is more challenging, because of the inherent difficulty of reassembling a functional system from three complementary split fragments. Up to now, only the superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and Nanoluciferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> have been split into three fragments. These tripartite systems have been however only used to detect binary interactions with minimal self-assembly background. To develop a tripartite-split-FAST allowing the visualization of ternary interactions in living cells, we first identified a second split site able to generate alternative functional bipartite-split-FAST variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The combination of the two functional split sites allowed us to generate three complementary fragments that only assemble when in proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Here, we report that this tripartite system enabled one to visualize the formation of ternary protein complexes in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>New functional site for bisection of FAST</title><p id="P5">Bipartite-split-FAST was originally created through bisection of FAST between residues 114 and 115<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, a split site originally used for the design of functional circular permutations of FAST variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In order to identify alternative split sites, we screened for alternative circular permutations of FAST. As the systematic and comprehensive study of all possible circular permutations of a protein, albeit feasible, can be tedious and time-consuming, we used Circular Permutation site predictor (CPred), a computational tool for predicting viable circular permutations in proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In absence of crystal structure for FAST and its variants, we used the crystal structure of <italic>Halorhodospira halophila</italic> Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP), the parental protein from which prototypical FAST was evolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We assumed that, because of the high sequence homology between PYP and FAST and their common structural features, the results from PYP analysis could be directly transposed to FAST. CPred provided a probability score for each position, allowing to identify several potential viable cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). After rational evaluation of the suggested regions, we retained six potential split sites with high probability scores: 24-25, 35-36, 59-60, 72-73, 89-90, 98-99 and 102-103, and generated the corresponding circular permutations by insertion of a ENLYFQGGSGG linker between FAST native termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This linker constituted a relatively long and flexible linker, enabling to evaluate the viability of the circular permutation. The DNA sequences encoding the seven circular permutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the sequence encoding a FAST tandem connected with a ENLYFQGGSGG linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The circular permutations cpFAST(35-36) and cpFAST(102-103) could not be expressed and purified in <italic>E. coli</italic> in preliminary tests, and were thus not further studied. Among the five remaining cpFAST variants, only cpFAST(24-25) and cpFAST(98-99) were able to bind the fluorogenic chromophore 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzylidene rhodanine (HMBR) and activate its fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2 &amp; 4</xref>), however with lower fluorogen binding affinity than prototypical FAST.</p><p id="P6">As the length of the linker connecting the native termini can play a role in the folding and activity, we next replaced the ENLYFQGGSGG linker by flexible GGS linkers of varying size from 11 to 3 residues. A version with no linker between the native termini was also tested for both circular permutations. All new variants were able to form a fluorescent assembly with HMBR and give good fluorescence quantum yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3 &amp; 4</xref>), however the effect of the linker length on the fluorogen binding affinity was notably different between the two circular permutations. In the case of cpFAST(98-99), increasing the linker length from 0 to 11 amino acids increased the fluorogen binding affinity, as shown by the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> varying from 4.0 ± 0.2 to 0.6 ± 0.1 μM, reaching binding affinity close to that of FAST. These results suggested that the use of an 11 amino acid linker allows cpFAST(98-99) to adopt a conformation close to FAST, as previously observed for cpFAST(114-115)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in the case of cpFAST(24-25), no change of affinity was observed when varying the linker length: <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> remained around 10 μM no matter the linker used. This binding affinity was close to that observed for nanoFAST (a.k.a. FAST<sub>27-125</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), a version of FAST in which the first 26 residues are truncated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This suggested that only the domain FAST<sub>25-125</sub> was properly folded and functional within the different cpFAST(24-25) or that the two domains FAST<sub>25-125</sub> and FAST<sub>1-24</sub> were folding independently without interacting together. In both cases, these results precluded to use the split site 24-25 for the generation of a functional split version. We thus focused our study only on the bisection of FAST at position 98-99.</p><p id="P7">To evaluate whether the two fragments FAST<sub>1-98</sub> and FAST<sub>99-125</sub> could complement and form a functional system when in close proximity, the two fragments were fused respectively to the N-terminus of the FRB (FKBP-rapamycin binding) domain of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), and to the C-terminus of FKBP (FK506-binding protein)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). As FRB and FKBP can interact together in presence of rapamycin, this pair of proteins enables to evaluate both interaction-dependent complementation in the presence of rapamycin and self-complementation in its absence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The interaction-induced pre-organization of the two FAST’s fragments can increase the efficiency of their complementation with the fluorogen by reducing this three-body system to a ‘virtual’ two-body system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In order to evaluate the complementation efficiency in the two scenarios, FAST<sub>1-98</sub>–FRB and FKBP–FAST<sub>99-125</sub> were co-expressed in HEK293T cells using two bicistronic plasmids vectors that allowed also the expression of mTurquoise2 and iRFP670, respectively, used here as transfection reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). As the complementation efficiency of split-FAST(98-99) depends on the fluorogen concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, we quantified it by flow cytometry in the presence or the absence of rapamycin at various concentrations of the fluorogen HMBR. This experiment enabled us to determine the effective concentration of fluorogen for half-maximum complementation in the absence (EC<sub>50,−interaction</sub>) or the presence (EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub>) of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). These values can thus be used to evaluate the efficacy of the self-complementation and of the interaction-dependent complementation: the higher the EC<sub>50,−interaction</sub>, the lower the self-complementation, and the lower the EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub>, the higher the interaction-dependent complementation efficacy. Note that the obtained complementation curves enable also to identify the optimal fluorogen concentration to maximize the interaction-induced complementation while minimizing self-complementation. We found an EC<sub>50,−interaction</sub> = 31 ± 4 μM and an EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub> = 7.5 ± 0.7 μM, demonstrating that the complementation of split-FAST(98-99) is favored when FRB and FKBP interact together, even though the value of EC<sub>50,−interaction</sub> revealed that the two fragments could complement to a certain extent in the absence of interaction at high concentration of fluorogen. Globally, the behavior of split-FAST(98-99) was very similar to the one observed for regular split-FAST(114-115) (made of FAST<sub>1-114</sub> and FAST<sub>115-125</sub>) fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, suggesting that splitting FAST at position 98-99 led to a functional split system.</p><p id="P8">We recently generated split-FAST2, a version of split-FAST(114-115) with reduced self-complementation and improved interaction-dependent complementation. This improved system was generated by splitting <sup>RspA</sup>FAST, a FAST variant generated from a PYP ortholog of <italic>Rheinheimera sp</italic>. A13L (RspA), displaying the same length as FAST and 78% sequence identity (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> for the sequence of FAST and RspA-FAST, and a summary of the properties of their full-length and split versions). split-FAST2 was obtained by splitting <sup>RspA</sup>FAST between the positions 114 and 115, used to generate split-FAST, giving two fragments <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-114</sub> and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>115-125</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We applied this orthology-based engineering strategy to split-FAST(98-99). We split <sup>RspA</sup>FAST at position 98-99 to generate two fragments, <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub> and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-125</sub>, and characterized their complementation fusing them to FRB and FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of the complementation of <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub>–FRB and FKBP–<sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-125</sub> at various HMBR concentrations, and in the absence or the presence of rapamycin showed that the use of <sup>RspA</sup>FAST fragments enabled to increase the efficacy of interaction-dependent complementation by 2.5-fold (EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub> = 3.0 ± 0.3 μM), and dramatically reduced self-complementation (EC<sub>50,–interaction</sub> = 270 ± 30 μM), leading to a significant increase of dynamic range (100-fold). Monitoring the rapamycin-induced complementation of <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub>–FRB and FKBP– <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-125</sub> in HEK293T cells treated with 10 μM HMBR by confocal microscopy confirmed that <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub> and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-125</sub> show minimal self-complementation in the presence of HMBR and efficiently complement in a proximity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f-h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). Overall, this set of experiments showed that the site 98-99 could be a functional bisection site for the generation of a bipartite-split-FAST.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Trisection of FAST variants</title><p id="P9">With the final goal of generating a tripartite-split-FAST able to report on the proximity of three proteins, we combined the sites 98-99 and 114-115 to split <sup>RspA</sup>FAST into three fragments: <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub>, <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-114</sub> and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>115-125</sub>. To evaluate the potential of these three fragments to complement into a functional reporter capable of binding fluorogens when in close proximity, we first fused two of the three fragments to the N- and C-termini of FRB and the third fragment to FKBP. We took advantage of the structure of the FRB-rapamycin-FKBP complex to identify the right topology to use. After predicting tridimensional structures with Alphafold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), we decided to fuse <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>99-114</sub> and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>1-98</sub> to the N- and C-termini of FRB, respectively, and <sup>RspA</sup>FAST<sub>115-125</sub> to the C-terminus of FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We evaluated their complementation in HEK293T cells by flow cytometry in the absence or presence of rapamycin at various concentrations of HMBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In the absence of rapamycin, no complementation was observed, no matter the concentration of HMBR used. In the presence of rapamycin, complementation could be observed at high HMBR concentrations, but with relatively modest efficiency compared to the bipartite versions. The modest complementation efficiency could result from an improper reassembly or imperfect folding of the three fragments resulting in a loss of fluorogen binding ability/affinity, limiting thus the formation of the quaternary fluorescent assembly. When using 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylbenzylidene rhodanine (HBR-2,5DM), a fluorogen that binds FAST tighter than HMBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we observed a significant improvement of the interaction-dependent complementation efficacy, reaching an EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub> = 8.1 ± 0.2 μM, while keeping minimal self-complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This result supported the idea that the use of highly affine fluorogens favors the formation of the quaternary fluorescent assembly by compensating the loss of entropy resulting from the trisection. We hypothesized that efficient complementation required additional binding energy to counteract the unfavorable entropy change associated with assembling together the three fragments and the fluorogen into a quaternary fluorescent assembly. If so, additional binding energy could favor the interactions of the three fragments or the fluorogen binding or both.</p><p id="P10">We recently described a bipartite split system with high self-complementation, i.e. capable of complementation in the presence of fluorogen even in the absence of interaction. This system allowed us to develop a fluorogenic chemically induced dimerization tool to induce and visualize the proximity of two proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. This CATCHFIRE (Chemically Assisted Tethering of CHimera by Fluorogenic Induced Recognition) approach was made through bisection of pFAST at position 114-115, generating two fragments pFAST<sub>1-114</sub> (a.k.a. <sup>FIRE</sup>mate) and pFAST<sub>115-125</sub> (a.k.a. <sup>FIRE</sup>tag) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> for the sequence of pFAST and a summary of the properties of its full-length and split versions). pFAST is a FAST variant able to bind fluorogenic chromophores with spectral properties covering the entire visible spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. pFAST was shown to display higher conformational rigidity, resulting overall in higher fluorogen binding affinity. We assume that higher folding and binding energy provides the driving force for the self-complementation of the fluorescent ternary assembly in the case of CATCHFIRE. We thus hypothesized that trisection of pFAST could result in a tripartite system with higher complementation efficiency. To test this idea, we fused pFAST<sub>99-114</sub> and pFAST<sub>1-98</sub> to the N- and C-termini of FRB, respectively, and pFAST<sub>115-125</sub> to the C-terminus of FKBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), and evaluated their complementation in HEK293T cells by flow cytometry as previously done for the tripartite-split-<sup>RspA</sup>FAST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-f</xref>). The analysis was done in the absence or the presence of rapamycin at various concentrations of HMBR or HBR-2,5DM. With HMBR, almost no self-complementation could be detected in the absence of rapamycin, however we observed an efficient complementation when inducing the FRB-FKBP interaction by addition of rapamycin, reaching an EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub> = 12 ± 1 μM. With HBR-2,5DM, the efficacy of interaction-dependent complementation was 10-fold higher (EC<sub>50,+interaction</sub> = 1.2 ± 0.1 μM), supporting the idea that the use of fluorogens with high binding affinity favors the formation of the quaternary fluorescent assembly. Although the system could partially self-complement at high HBR-2,5DM concentrations, self-complementation remains very low at low concentrations, allowing to detect the rapamycin-induced interaction of FRB and FKBP with high dynamic range. For instance, at [HBR-2,5DM] = 5 μM, complementation reaches 81% with rapamycin and less than 6.5% without, resulting in a 12-fold fluorescence increase upon formation of the interaction. Monitoring the rapamycin-induced complementation of pFAST<sub>99-114</sub>–FRB–pFAST<sub>1-98</sub> and FKBP–pFAST<sub>114-125</sub> in HEK293T cells treated with 5 μM HBR-2,5DM by confocal microscopy confirmed that the tripartite-split-pFAST showed minimal self-complementation in presence of HBR-2,5DM and could efficiently complement in a proximity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g-i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). Kinetic analysis showed that the rapamycin-induced formation of the quaternary green fluorescent assembly was rapid and occurred with half-time &lt; 2 min. This timescale was comparable to that observed with bipartite-split-FASTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The experiments described above allowed us to demonstrate that the three fragments resulting from the splitting of pFAST at positions 98-99 and 114-115 were able to efficiently complement with HMBR or HBR-2,5DM when brought into close proximity. However, we used a model system in which the fragments pFAST<sub>1-98</sub> and pFAST<sub>99-114</sub> were fused to the same protein, which already preorganized them to interact. To demonstrate that the tripartite split system could selectively complement when the three fragments are fused to three different proteins that interact together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), we used the chemically inducible heterotrimerization (CIT) system recently developed from the FKBP-FRB-rapamycin system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In this CIT system, trimerization of a bipartite-split-FRB with full-length FKBP can be induced by addition of rapamycin.

Bisection at position 114-115 generated two fragments that could efficiently complement into a functional reporter when in close proximity.

In the current study, we further showed that the cleavage of FAST or its variant <sup>RspA</sup>FAST in between residues 98 and 99 generated two complementary fragments able to reassemble into functional reporters when in close proximity. Combination of the two split sites allowed us to generate a tripartite split system composed of three complementary fragments. We showed that efficient complementation requires the three fragments to be in close proximity to counteract the unfavorable entropy change associated to complementation, allowing thus the detection of ternary protein interactions. Optimal tripartite split system was obtained using pFAST, a FAST variant with higher conformational rigidity and higher fluorogen binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We assume that the complementation of the three fragments is favored by a higher folding energy, and by the extra binding energy provided by fluorogen binding. We show that the complementation is rapid, allowing to monitor the formation of the ternary protein assembly within few minutes.</p><p id="P23">To our knowledge, only sfGFP and Nanoluciferase have been previously successfully split into three fragments capable of reassembling into a functional reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Each system is composed of a large fragment, and two short fragments corresponding to consecutive beta strands, as in tripartite-split-pFAST. Complementation of tripartite-split-sfGFP can occur as soon as the two short fragments are in close proximity. This property was used to detect binary protein interactions with minimal fluorescence background. To do so, the two proteins are fused to the two short fragments. Upon formation of the binary protein complex, the large fragment spontaneously assembles with the two short fragments, leading to the reconstitution of a functional fluorescent protein within few hours (due to the slow maturation of the chromophore). Tripartite-split-Nanoluciferase displays similar behavior: reconstitution of functional Nanoluciferase can occur as soon as the two short fragments are in close proximity.

Fluorescence quantum yield measurements were determined as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> using FAST:HMBR as a reference. Reciprocal dilution with protein solution was used so as to keep the protein concentration constant at 40 μM while diluting the fluorogen solution. Thermodynamic dissociation constants were determined by titration experiments in which we measured the fluorescence of the fluorescent assembly at various fluorogen concentrations using a Spark 10 M plate reader (Tecan) and fitting data to a one-site specific binding model.

Cells were transiently transfected using Genejuice (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s protocols for 24 h prior to imaging. Cells were washed with DPBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline), and treated with DMEM media (without serum and phenol red) supplemented with the fluorogen at the indicated concentration few minutes prior to imaging. To follow the kinetics of rapamycin-induced complementation, rapamycin was added at t = 0 min.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Flow cytometry analysis</title><p id="P32">Flow cytometry in HEK293T cells was performed on a MACSQuant® analyzer equipped with 405 nm, 488 nm and 635 nm lasers and seven channels. To prepare samples, cells were first grown in cell culture flasks, then transiently co-transfected 24 hours after seeding using Genejuice (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 24 hours. After 24 hours, cells were centrifuged in PBS with BSA (1 mg/ml) and resuspend in PBS-BSA supplemented with the appropriate amounts of compounds. For each experiment, 20,000 cells positively expressing mTurquoise2 (Ex 434 / Em 450 ± 25) and iRFP670 (Ex 638 nm / Em 660 ± 10 nm) were analyzed with the following parameters: Ex 488nm, Em 525 ± 20 nm.

A figure presenting the gating strategy is presented in supporting information on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>. The analysis of the complementation was performed as follows: the evolution of the mean cell fluorescence in the function of the concentration of fluorogen in the presence and in the absence of rapamycin was fitted with a one-site binding model equation with GraphPad Prism v9.3.0, sharing the maximal value for the experiments in the presence and in the absence of rapamycin. This allows us to determine the effective concentration of fluorogen for half-maximal complementation (EC<sub>50</sub>) as well as the theoretical maximum fluorescence value. This latter value is then used to compute the percentage of complementation for each concentration of fluorogen.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy</title><p id="P33">Confocal micrographs were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 980 Laser Scanning Microscope equipped with a plan apochromat 63× /1.4 NA oil immersion objective.
