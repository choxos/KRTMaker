To address this, we assessed the effect of the mGluR2/3 agonist, eglumetad, on spatial memory consolidation in both mice and rats. Using the novel place preference paradigm, we found that post-sample injections of eglumetad impaired subsequent spatial discrimination when tested 6 hours later. Using the immediate early gene c-<italic>fos</italic> as a marker of neural activity, we showed that eglumetad injections reduced activity in a network of limbic brain regions including the hippocampus and mammillary bodies. To determine whether the systemic effects could be replicated with more targeted manipulations, we performed post-sample infusions of the mGluR2/3 agonist 2<italic>R</italic>,4<italic>R</italic>-APDC into the mammillary bodies. This impaired novelty discrimination on a place preference task and an object-in-place task, again highlighting the role of mGluR2/3 transmission in memory consolidation and demonstrating the crucial involvement of the mammillary bodies in post-encoding processing of spatial information.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Memory formation is a complex process, involving encoding, consolidation, and recall. These processes depend on a network of brain regions whose relative contribution varies according to memory stage as well as its content. The medial diencephalon, including the mammillary bodies, has long been implicated in memory processing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]</sup>, especially in relation to encoding<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup>. By contrast, less is known about its possible contributions to consolidation, which has been more closely aligned with the medial temporal lobe and cortical regions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup>, which are sites directly involved in memory storage. However, increasing evidence suggests an active role for subcortical regions in orchestrating systems-wide memory consolidation, via neuromodulatory inputs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]</sup> and generation of oscillatory activity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]</sup>. This role may be extended to the mammillary bodies given their importance for arousal and coordinating hippocampal-network activity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P3">The mammillary bodies form part of an extended memory system (or the circuit of Papez), receiving their major glutamatergic input from the subiculum via the postcommissural fornix and projecting to the anterior thalamic nuclei, which in turn reciprocally connect with the hippocampal formation and cortical regions involved in mnemonic processing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup>. Mammillary body activity is modulated via their reciprocal connections with Gudden’s tegmental nuclei, and inputs from the septum and supramammillary nuclei<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</sup>. This enables the mammillary bodies to modulate and amplify relevant signals for subsequent processing in downstream regions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup>, in addition, their role in the propagation of sharp-wave ripple-related activity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]</sup> provides a further mechanism via which the mammillary bodies may contribute to consolidatory processes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P4">The mammillary bodies show evidence of highly specialized glutamatergic transmission: they express vesicular glutamate transporters as well as ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]</sup>. Indeed, the medial mammillary nucleus has some of the highest metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) expression levels, along with other regions in the Papez circuit including the hippocampus, and retrosplenial cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>. The distribution of mGluR2 in the brain might suggest that modulating mGluR2 activity would impact memory processes. However, the effects of mGluR2/3 agonists on spatial working memory tasks appear mixed<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup>, with some studies finding impairments<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]</sup> while others showing improvements<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup> and others showing no effect on cognition<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>. However, metabotropic glutamate receptors in general have also been implicated in memory consolidation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup>, due to their role in slower, longer-lasting modulatory effects<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]</sup>, including long-term depression<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup>, and mGluR2 could therefore be mediating consolidatory processes within the Papez circuit<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P5">To assess the effects of mGlu2 receptor manipulation on early consolidation processes, rats and mice were systemically injected with an mGluR2/3 agonist, eglumetad (LY354740), immediately after the sample phase of a novel place preference task and a discrimination test was carried out after a 6-hour delay. A motility test was used to determine whether the injections had any overall effects on activity. To identify which brain regions were affected by systemic eglumetad injections, we quantified the expression of the immediate early gene c-<italic>fos</italic> across the Papez circuit of mice that had explored a novel environment after receiving either an injection of eglumetad or saline.</p><p id="P6">The next step was to determine whether the systemic effects of mGluR2/3 agonists could be replicated with more targeted administration and for this we looked at the effects of mGlu2 receptor agonism in the mammillary bodies. The mammillary bodies were selected as they have particularly high levels of mGlu2 receptor expression<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup> and slice studies have shown the mGluR2/3 agonist, APDC, to inhibit mammillary body activity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup>. Animals were tested on two spatial discrimination tasks that assess incidental learning and rely on an animal’s innate preference for novelty<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]</sup>. By looking at spatial discrimination behavior with a 6-hour delay, and administering the drug post-sample, it was possible to study the impact of an mGluR agonist on early consolidation while leaving the animals unaffected by any acute effects of the drug during both encoding and recall periods.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="P7">We first tested the impact of eglumetad injections in rats on open field exploration and found no effect on total distance travelled or mean distance from the center of the arena at 30 min post-injection (total distance travelled: t = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.090, d = 0.37; mean distance from center: t = -0.98, <italic>p</italic> = 0.84, d = -0.26; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a-c</xref>) or at 6 h post-injection (total distance travelled: t = -0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.63, d = -0.09; mean distance from center: t = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46, d = 0.09, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 a-c</xref>; one-sided within-subject permutation tests).</p><p id="P8">Next, we investigated the effect of the drug on memory consolidation using the novel place preference (NPP) task with a 6 h delay between sample and test. Post-sample injections of eglumetad impaired novel spatial discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d</xref>), as demonstrated by a significant reduction in cumulative discrimination scores when compared with saline injections (t = 1.79, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047, d = 0.55; one-sided within-subject permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 e&amp;f</xref>). Furthermore, rats displayed clear novel place preference with above-chance cumulative discrimination scores following saline injections (t = 3.59, <italic>p</italic> = 1.62×10<sup>-3</sup>; one-sided within-subject permutation test) whereas they performed at chance following eglumetad injections (t = 1.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16). The differences in discrimination were not driven by changes in general activity as there was no effect of drug on total number of arm entries or mean duration of time spent in the arms either at sample or test phases of the task (number of entries at sample: t = -0.97, <italic>p</italic> = 0.38, d = -0.21; mean arm visit time at sample: t = 0.63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.54, d = -0.14; number of entries at test: t = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 1, d = 0.012; mean arm visit time at sample: t = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.51, d = -0.15; two-sided within-subject permutation tests). However, we found that total active exploration at sample was negatively correlated with subsequent discrimination scores at test following saline injections (r = -0.56, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024) but not following eglumetad injections (r = -0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.88). We therefore tested if inclusion of sample total exploration data improved the estimation of discrimination scores at test and found that it marginally did (λ = 3.88, <italic>p</italic> = 0.049, compared to a model lacking sample data), while still returning the main effect of drug (F<sub>1,29</sub> = 5.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and a trend for sample total exploration on D2 scores at test (F<sub>1,29</sub> = 4.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.051).</p><p id="P9">We also measured the concentration of the drug in rat brains at increasing intervals between 10 and 360 min from injection, confirming its presence immediately after injection and a near full wash-out by 6 h (5.5-fold decrease, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Experiment 2</title><p id="P10">As with rats (<bold>Experiment 1</bold>), eglumetad injections had no effect on the total distance travelled in the open field in mice (t = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> = 0.33, d = 0.44; one-sided between-subject permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a&amp;b</xref>). However, unlike the effect on rats, the injections in mice resulted in greater exploration in the center of the arena, revealing an anxiolytic effect of the drug (t = 2.59, <italic>p</italic> = 9.93×10<sup>-3</sup>, d = 1.03, one-sided between-subject permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a&amp;c</xref>), likely driven by the higher dose used in mice than rats (10mg/kg vs 6mg/kg, respectively).</p><p id="P11">Eglumetad affected performance on the NPP task in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 d</xref>) in the same way as in rats, with saline-injected mice displaying above-chance discrimination (t = 4.6, <italic>p</italic> = 9.77×10<sup>-4</sup>) and eglumetad-injected mice showing no preference (t = 1.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.090; one-sided between-subject permutation tests, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 e-f</xref>). This was reflected in significant drug-related differences in discrimination scores (t = 1.85, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037, d = 0.69, one-sided between-subject permutation test). The impaired discrimination following eglumetad injections did not reflect changes in overall activity as there was no effect of drug on the number of arm entries and the mean duration of time spent in the arms at either sample or test phases of the task (number of entries at sample: t = -1.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23, d = -0.44; mean arm visit time at sample: t = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.050, d = -0.77; number of entries at test: t = 0.016, <italic>p</italic> = 0.98, d = 0.006, mean arm visit time at test: t = -0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.69, d = 0.17, two-sided permutation tests). As with rats, we found total sample exploration time to negatively correlate with subsequent discrimination at test, this time both for saline (r = -0.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0490) and eglumetad (r = -0.56, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0495). Inclusion of sample exploration data significantly improved the mixed effects model (λ = 7.91, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0049), still returning a main effect of drug (F<sub>1,22</sub> = 9.33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0058) and a main effect of total exploration (F<sub>1,22</sub> = 9.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0059).

Among these, the mammillary bodies show high levels of circumscribed mGluR2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 e</xref>) and they have also been shown to directly respond to group II metabotropic agonism<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup>. As such, we hypothesized that local infusion of mGluR2/3 agonists into the mammillary bodies would be sufficient to impair spatial memory consolidation.</p><p id="P14">To test this, we cannulated 45 rats to locally infuse the mGluR2/3 agonist, <italic>2R</italic>, <italic>4R</italic>-APDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Postmortem validation, including cresyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d</xref>) and DAB staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 b</xref> for individual subjects), and in some cases, infusions of a fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 f</xref>), confirmed correct cannula placement, with limited tissue damage, in 26 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b-c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 a</xref>). To ensure local infusions of APDC had no effect on motility, the rats were tested on open field exploration following saline and APDC infusions. There was no effect of drug on total distance travelled (t = -1.01, <italic>p</italic> = 0.83, d = -0.26) or mean distance from the center of the arena (t = 1.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.090, d = 0.39, one-sided within-subject permutation tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">For the NPP task, we found a similar pattern to that of the systemic injection experiments, with APDC infusions leading to reduced discrimination (t = 3.06, <italic>p</italic> = 5.08×10<sup>-3</sup>, d = 0.54, one-sided within-subject permutation test). However, unlike the systemic injections, rats’ performance was above chance following both saline (t = 6.38, <italic>p</italic> = 6.1×10<sup>-5</sup>) and APDC infusions (t = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03; one-sided within-subject permutation tests), showing rats could discriminate the novel arm under both drug conditions. The main effect of drug was not driven by differences in overall activity levels at either sample or test (number of entries at sample: t = -0.32, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81, d = -0.074; mean arm visit time at sample: t = 1.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.30, d = -0.24; number of entries at test: t = -0.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89, d = -0.05, mean arm visit time at test: t = -0.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.91, d = 0.028; two-sided within-subject permutation tests).

We found that rats were able to discriminate the displaced objects at test following saline infusions (t = 3.27, <italic>p</italic> = 2.22×10<sup>-3</sup>, one-sided within-subject permutation test), whereas rats performed at chance following APDC infusions (t = -0.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.57, one-sided within-subject permutation test). These drug-related differences were reflected in a significant difference in discrimination scores (t = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024, d = 0.46, one-sided within-subject permutation test). As in the NPP task, this difference was not due to changes in general exploratory behaviors at sample or at test (sample: t = 0.79, <italic>p</italic> = 0.44, d = 0.17; test: t = 1.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21, d = 0.28; two-sided within-subject permutation tests).

Post-sample administration of mGlu2 receptor agonists either injected systemically or infused into the mammillary bodies impaired performance on a novel place preference task. The systemic effects were found to be highly reliable as the same pattern was observed across both mice and rats; in mice the effects were observed in both males and females. mGlu2 receptors are strongly expressed in the Papez circuit in the rodent brain<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>, a brain network important for memory<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</sup>. Consistent with this, we found that systemic injections of eglumetad in mice markedly reduced novelty-induced c-<italic>fos</italic> expression across the Papez circuit, including the mammillary bodies, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex and ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, indicating an inhibitory effect across this memory network. This pattern of reduced activity replicated findings from a previous glucose imaging experiment<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup>, establishing the impact of mGluR2/3 agonists on limbic memory networks. To determine whether local inhibition of the mammillary bodies could produce a similar behavioral effect to a systemic mGluR2/3 agonist, or whether network-wide changes were necessary, we selectively targeted the mammillary bodies using the mGluR2/3 agonist, 2<italic>R</italic>, 4<italic>R</italic>-APDC. A remarkably consistent pattern of findings was observed with the local manipulation as with the systemic injections, suggesting the systemic effect of mGluR2/3 agonism was in part driven by its effect on the mammillary bodies. Furthermore, we extended our findings by showing impaired consolidation of a separate behavioral task, the object-in-place task, which is known to be sensitive to lesions of mammillary body pathways<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P19">Neither systemic administration of an mGluR2/3 agonist, nor selective infusion into the mammillary bodies, affected the overall activity of rats or mice, as measured by open field exploration. Mice did, however, explore the center of the arena more following eglumetad injections, consistent with the anxiolytic effect of mGluR2/3 agonists<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]</sup>. Mammillary body lesions have also been found to reduce anxiety on the open field task <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]</sup>, although we did not find increased center occupancy in locally infused rats, or in systemically injected rats, which may reflect the amount of drug administered. There was also no difference in animals’ overall activity in the test phase of the discrimination tasks, despite impaired performance. This would suggest that the discrimination effects are driven by memory impairments resulting from impoverished consolidation, rather than non-specific changes to activity during the test stage. Consistent with this, the brain occupancy data showed that following systemic administration, eglumetad had mostly cleared from the brain after the first hour. As such, the post-sample drug manipulations can be considered in terms of their impact on early consolidation rather than directly affecting the recall stage.</p><p id="P20">We observed no mean differences in sample activity, as would be expected given the manipulations were carried out after the sample phase. However, we did find relationships between sample activity and test scores at an individual animal level across most of the behavioral tasks, likely driven by animals’ biases towards certain objects or maze arms. By including these sample exploration data in the analyses, we were able to reduce some of the variance and better isolate the effect of experimental treatment, making the data more robust and highlighting the potential benefit of using sample data in these types of experiments. The current study employed a two-phase design with a 6-hour consolidation window, which capitalized on rats’ and mice’s natural ultradian activity patterns. It is unclear whether manipulating the length of the sample-test delay would have produced an equivalent deficit, however, lesions of the mammillary bodies or their principal efferent pathway have been shown to impair performance on the OIP task at shorter delays <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</sup>. Considering the systems-wide impact of eglumetad injections on <italic>c-fos</italic> expression, it might be predicted that that memory storage over longer delays, requiring greater cortical engagement, would also be vulnerable to mGluR2/3 agonist effects.</p><p id="P21">Almost all previous behavioral studies assessing the role of the mammillary bodies have involved permanent lesions, making it difficult to draw conclusions about their contributions to specific stages of memory processing. One of the few inactivation studies found that manipulation of the mammillary bodies in rabbits immediately after trace conditioning impaired reflex learning. By contrast, there was no effect if inactivation occurred 3 hours after training, suggesting a role for the mammillary bodies during the early consolidation period<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup>. Glucose imaging and cytochrome oxidase imaging studies have also shown increased mammillary body activity during the first few hours following task learning<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup>, consistent with a role for the mammillary bodies in this early post-encoding period.</p><p id="P22">Temporary inactivation of both dorsal subiculum<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]</sup> and the anterior thalamic nuclei<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</sup>, regions that send inputs to, and receive outputs from the mammillary bodies, respectively, have both been shown to affect memory consolidation, suggesting that they, along with the mammillary bodies, form part of an extended consolidation network. Indeed, the mammillary bodies’ role in mediating sharp-wave ripple-related activity between the dorsal subiculum and anterior thalamic nuclei might be key to this role in consolidation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]</sup>. However, there are also high expression levels of mGluR2 in the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden and, in agreement with this, we found reduced c-<italic>fos</italic> expression in this region following eglumetad injections. Therefore, the reciprocal mammillary body-tegmental nuclei pathway could also be contributing to consolidatory mechanisms, and the behavioral impairments observed.</p><p id="P23">mGluR2/3 agonists have been identified as a potential treatment for schizophrenia<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]</sup>. The present results are difficult to interpret in terms of therapeutics since we investigated only the acute effects of drug administration. Chronic administration may produce different results on memory consolidation, with the agonist present at multiple stages of the task. Furthermore, downregulation of receptors and compensatory responses following chronic administration could also produce different effects. Nevertheless, future work into mGluR2-targeting agents as a treatment should consider the possible impact on longer-term memory processes.</p><p id="P24">Improving the therapeutic potential of mGluRs requires mechanistic understanding of their roles across multiple brain systems. Our results demonstrate their relevance to long-term memory via interactions within the limbic system and highlight the specific role of the mammillary bodies in early memory consolidation. The effect of systemic eglumetad delivery on <italic>c-fos</italic> expression suggests that the effects on consolidation may be driven by overall depression of neuronal activity. In support of this, group II mGluRs act as glutamate autoreceptors whose activation results in reduced presynaptic glutamate release, as seen in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, sensory cortices and others<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]</sup>. In the case of the mammillary bodies, mGluR2 is, however, likely to directly exert its function by reducing neuronal excitability postsynaptically<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup> (although the contribution of presynaptic and astrocytic mGluR2 cannot be ruled out). As such, impaired early consolidation following local drug infusion may simply reflect diminished mammillary body activity levels, thus reducing transmission of theta activity and bursting activity, particularly as mGluR2/3 agonists have been shown to preferentially affect spike frequency <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P25">Together, the present results demonstrate that modulating neural activity in the Papez circuit, via mGluR2 agonism, impacts early memory consolidation. Furthermore, mammillary body inhibition is sufficient to produce similar effects to those seen following systemic injections, highlighting the mammillary bodies as a vital node for consolidation. Given the mammillary bodies are affected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]</sup>, this gives a greater understanding of some of the mechanisms via which disruption to the mammillary bodies can impact cognitive processing.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><sec id="S10"><title>Rats</title><p id="P26">A total of 73 male Lister Hooded rats (Envigo, UK) were used in the study: <bold>Experiment 1</bold> involved 28 animals (~320-360g at the time of injections); <bold>Rat Experiment 3</bold> combined 45 rats from across three separate cohorts.

Additional salient visual cues, such as geometric shapes and high contrast stimuli, were attached to the walls of the testing room (280 × 295 × 260 cm high). Behavior was recorded using an overhead-mounted action camera (GoPro Silver 7, GoPro Inc, USA). The test objects were complex 3-dimensional shapes constructed from Duplo (Lego, Denmark) that varied in color and size (16 × 16 × 14 cm high - 15 × 16 × 19 cm high) and were too heavy to displace (each set comprised a red, a green, a blue and a yellow object). There were duplicates of each set of objects such that each test session used a different object set and within a session and duplicates were used for test and sample. Prior to testing, rats received five habituation sessions over 3 days. On the first day, rats were placed into the arena in home cage pairs for 10 mins in the morning and 10 mins in the afternoon. The following day, rats received two 5 min sessions individually. On the last day, individual rats received a single 5 min session. No objects were present in the arena during habituation. On test days, the task involved a sample and a test phase, separated by a 6 h delay. One object was placed in each corner of the arena, positioned 10 cm from the wall. An individual rat was transported to the room in a metal carrying box with a lid to prevent them from seeing outside the box. In the sample phase, the animal was placed in the center of the arena and allowed to explore the objects for 5 min.

The primary outcome measure that confirmed sufficient sample sizes were tests of above-chance discrimination following vehicle administration.</p><p id="P54">For the open field task, the trajectories of the animals were computed in DeepLabCut<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]</sup> using custom models trained in-house (for each individual experiment). The coordinates were loaded into Matlab and total distance travelled and mean distance from the center of the maze were calculated.For the NPP task, recordings of the behavioral data were manually scored without knowledge of animal assignment, to provide entry and exit times for each arm visit. Entry to an arm was defined as the full head of the animal crossing the arm threshold, followed by its entire body, while an exit was scored when the full head of the animal crossed the threshold in the opposite direction. Periods of grooming as well as excessive biting or licking of maze walls were annotated and later excluded from analysis (animals did not differ in grooming/biting behavior according to drug). The manual scores were loaded into Matlab. Using custom scripts, the number of arm entries, mean arm visit time, cumulative active exploration (sum of total arm visit times) and a cumulative discrimination index (D2) were computed. The D2 score was calculated as the difference in cumulative time spent visiting the novel arm and the mean cumulative time spent visiting familiar arms over the sum of the cumulative novel arm visit time and the mean cumulative familiar arm visit time. The index therefore ranged from -1 (exclusive preference for familiar arms), through 0 (no preference for novel or familiar arms or chance level performance) to 1 (exclusive preference for the novel arm). Positive scores signified novel place preference. D2 values were plotted as function of exploration time (1-10 min) at 1 s resolution and compared between conditions at 10 min exploration time. Both test and sample phases were analyzed, the former to ensure there were no mean group differences in animal activity levels by chance.</p><p id="P55">For the OIP task, video recordings were loaded into Matlab. The position of the animal’s center of gravity was extracted and assigned to the object it was closest to. The object positions and identities were extracted based on color thresholding. Cropped video frames displaying the animal in proximity to one of the four objects were assembled into a tiff file for manual scoring in FIJI. A custom start-up macro in FIJI was written to enable button-controlled user scoring of the videos in a frame-by-frame manner. This method improves the reliability of data as the experimenter is unaware of object placement in the arena at the time of testing, as well as the experimental status of the animal, thus removing potential bias. A frame was assigned an exploration status if the nose of the animal pointed toward the object and was within 1 cm from the object’s border. Instances of biting and licking were not considered object exploration. FIJI-outputted csv files were loaded into Matlab for analysis. Total object exploration and a cumulative discrimination score (D2) were computed. The D2 score was calculated as the difference in exploration times between the displaced and non-displaced objects over the sum of total object exploration time.</p><p id="P56">For the NPP task, animals were removed from analyses if they spent less than 2 min exploring arms at either sample or test and if they idled in a single arm for longer than 1.5 min as well as in cases where running errors occurred (incorrect arms open, etc.). In total, 6 rats were excluded based on inadequate exploration levels (<bold>Experiment 1:</bold> two rats were excluded due to poor sample exploration and two for poor test exploration, one following eglumetad infusion and one following saline infusion; <bold>Experiment 4</bold>: two rats were excluded due to poor sample exploration). One saline-injected mouse was excluded from <bold>Experiment 2</bold> due to inadequate exploration levels at test.</p><p id="P57">For the OIP tasks, animals were removed from analyses if they failed to explore any of the objects at sample or if they spent less than 30 s exploring the objects at either sample or test and (no animals were rejected based on these criteria).</p><p id="P58">For open field /cross-maze, animals were removed from analyses if they failed to move (i.e., remained in the corner of the arena or refused to enter arms). One eglumetad-injected mouse from <bold>Experiment 3</bold> was removed from analyses on this basis.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P59">To test for the effect of drugs on behavioral performance, we utilised permutation tests appropriate to the experimental design (between-subject design: <italic>permutationTest</italic> <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]</sup> or within-subject design: mult_comp_perm_t1<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]</sup>). We used this approach as permutation testing is nonparametric and calculates exact, rather than estimated, <italic>p</italic>-values. Where assumptions for the equivalent parametric test are met, permutation and parametric hypothesis test probabilities are typically near identical. For experiments testing drug effects on memory, it was hypothesized eglumetad/<italic>2R,4R</italic>-APDC would lead to poorer performance, therefore one-sided (single-tail) tests were employed. Similarly, in open field experiments, it was hypothesized the drugs would lead to reduced motility and lower anxiety, and one-sided tests were used. Tests investigating whether animals performed above chance levels were also one-tailed since below chance performance is statistically implausible<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]</sup>. For any other tests (e.g., total number of arm visits on novel place preference task), we did not hypothesize a specific direction for the effect of the drug, and two-sided tests were used. To estimate the magnitude of the effects, we calculated the effect sizes in the form of Cohen’s d<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]</sup>, using <italic>computeCohen_d</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]</sup>, adjusted to reflect the small (&lt;50) sample sizes used in the reported experiments.</p><p id="P60">For memory consolidation tasks, we also tested whether activity at sample explained the variance in discrimination scores observed at test. Informed by the presence of correlations between some sample metrics and discrimination at test, we built a series of linear mixed effect models (<italic>fitlme</italic>) incorporating total active exploration at sample (both NPP and OIP) or object discrimination (OIP only) as confounding factors. If the addition of sample data significantly improved the model (<italic>compare</italic> function), we also tested for a significant improvement with an interaction term (drug by confound). The most parsimonious model with the best fit was chosen in each case.</p><p id="P61">For <bold>Experiment 3</bold>, <italic>c-fos</italic> staining density was transformed to represent fold change from baseline (mean home-cage control regional density values). The following linear mixed effect model (<italic>fitlme</italic>) was built to test for the effect of drug injections on <italic>c-fos</italic> induction levels: ‘Density ~ Drug × Region + (1|Animal)’. Simple effects were investigated in an analogous manner, for each individual ROI (‘Density ~ Drug + (1|Animal)’) and the computed regional <italic>p-</italic>values were corrected for with the Benjamini-Hochberg method <italic>fdr_bh</italic> add-on<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P62">Manual scoring of behavioral data was performed by several experienced researchers who were unaware of the animals’ experimental status at the time of scoring.
