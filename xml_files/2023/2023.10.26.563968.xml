Arguably, the most important amongst these are lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and its precursor, lipomannan (LM), which are both trafficked out of the bacterium to the host via unknown mechanisms. An important class of exported LM/LAM is the capsular derivative of these molecules which is devoid of its lipid anchor. Here, we describe the identification of a glycoside hydrolase family 76 enzyme that we term LamH which specifically cleaves α-1,6-mannoside linkages within LM and LAM, driving its export to the capsule releasing its phosphatidyl-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol mannoside lipid anchor. Unexpectedly, we found that the catalytic acitvity of this enzyme is important for efficient exit from stationary phase cultures where arabinomannan acts as a signal for growth phase transition. Finally, we demonstrate that LamH is important for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> survival in macrophages. These data provide a new framework for understanding the biological role of LAM in mycobacteria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The bacterial cell envelope includes a diverse array of molecules that in addition to contributing to basic biology, act as messengers that help shape or report on their environmental niche. In the context of host-pathogen interactions, these molecules are typically chemically distinct, marking the bacteria as different from their host. For mycobacterial pathogens, their unusual cell envelope includes a wide range of such structures that act in concert to manipulate the host immune response. The core elements of this are the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, and lipoglycans such as lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">LAM and LM are important to the pathogenesis of mycobacteria and form the basis of many diagnostic platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. They are required to control acidification of the phagosome and are a ligand for the C-type lectins Dectin-2 and DC-Sign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Through decades of careful analysis, the structure of LM and LAM has been revealed to include three structural domains. The first is a phosphatidyl-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol anchor, believed to be biosynthetically derived from phosphatidyl-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol mannosides (PIMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Attached to this is a large mannan moiety, with an α-1,6 mannose backbone of approximately 13 residues branched with α-1,2 mannose decorations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. A large, branched D-arabinofuranose domain is connected to this mannan backbone, which is far more complex and includes multiple non-stoichiometric acyl modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Much of the immunogenicity of LAM has been associated with the final, capping structures on the molecule, most notably in the form of α-1,2-linked mannose caps and an unusual methylthioxylose residue in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. While broadly similar across species, the precise structure of LM and LAM associated with the cytoplasmic membrane can vary between species and strains with substantial impacts on the host response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, while the chemical analysis of LAM derived from bacteria has proved incredibly useful, the structures of the macromolecules that are ultimately secreted and perceived by the host are not well defined. LM and LAM have also been proposed to play important roles in the basic biology of the bacteria, contributing to proper septal formation in a manner analogous to lipoteichoic acids in some Gram-positive bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, much of the biology of LM and LAM remains to be uncovered.</p><p id="P4">Amongst the pathways that require further study is the modification and release of LM and LAM. Release of these molecules may happen passively, as is the case during cell wall degradation because of division and wall remodelling, or actively as the bacteria secrete effectors into the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In the context of mycobacteria, we recently described the identification of a new family of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) responsible for the release of D-arabinan fragments into the surrounding environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The fate of these fragments is largely unknown, however at least some of these molecules end up in the mycobacterial capsule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The composition of this capsule varies substantially amongst mycobacterial species, but in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> the carbohydrate component has been reported to be comprised of 80% α-glucan and approximately 20% arabinomannan (AM) and mannan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The latter two of these are believed to be derived from LM and LAM, however no mechanism for this has been established.</p><p id="P5">To address this gap in our understanding, we have identified LamH (Rv0365c) as the enzyme responsible for release of the carbohydrate domain of LM and LAM to the capsule of mycobacteria. We show that the enzyme is highly specific for the attachment point between the lipid anchor and the carbohydrate domain of LM and LAM and plays an important role in the biology of the bacilli. Loss of LamH results in a prolonged lag-phase, which is coupled with an accumulation of LM and LAM and a down-regulation in the production of each of these molecules. Our data also shows that during the lag phase, AM can act as a signalling molecule, whose accumulation helps the bacteria trigger transition to exponential growth. Finally, we show that this protein enables the correct processing and display of capsular AM and mannan, and that knock-down of this protein in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> results in a decrease in pathogenesis. Altogether our data provide a new perspective on LM and LAM and their release into the extracellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mycobacteria encode a single predicted family GH76 enzyme</title><p id="P6">Prior work has identified the GH76 family as a large group of enzymes that can either degrade, or in a subset of these enzymes, generate through transglycosylation, α-1,6 mannoside linkages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. For example, we have previously shown that GH76 enzymes from the Bacteroidota are essential for the cleavage of α-1,6 mannoside linkages in fungal mannan in the human gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We used the experimental structure of Aman6 (PDB:5AGD), a known GH76 family member, as a search model in Foldseek and limited the taxon to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This search yielded a single high confidence result, supporting identification Rv0365c as the sole predicted family GH76 enzyme encoded within the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome. While broadly similar (LSQKab calculated R.M.S.D. = 3.49A), the mycobacterial enzyme is predicted to possess an additional β-hairpin cap covering the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We then sought to determine if homologs of Rv0365c are conserved amongst mycobacteria. We identified Rv0365c homologs using a custom BLAST database comprised of representative genomes for members of the Mycobacteriales and used NGPhylogeny.fr to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Rv0365c homologs were conserved in all representative species, suggesting they participate in an evolutionarily conserved process.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rv0365c specifically cleaves α-1,6 mannoside linkages</title><p id="P7">We next wanted to determine if Rv0365c possessed GH76-like catalytic activity. LM and LAM are complex substrates, making them unsuited to determining the precise linkage specificity of the enzyme. To circumvent this, we purified mannan from three <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains lacking glycosyltransferases that produce three distinct mannans of decreasing complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Each of these have a backbone of α-1,6 linked mannose, while Mnn5 and Mnn1 have additional α-1,2-linked mannose decorations and extensions respectively. Our initial assays with purified Rv0365c on these substrates yielded no observable reaction products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Many endo-acting GHs have been shown to preferentially cleave shorter substrates, and so we pre-digested the yeast mannans with BT3792 which produces shorter oligosaccharides. Incubation of pre-processed mannans with Rv0365c revealed an endo-like reaction profile exclusively from the material derived from the strain Mnn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These data demonstrate α-1,6 mannanase activity for Rv0365c and indicate that the enzyme is unable to cleave substrates with α-1,2-linked mannose decorations. To further confirm this finding, we isolated an a-1,6-mannotetraose oligosaccharide from this mixture, and digested it with Rv0365c, supporting its designation as an endo-α-1,6-mannanase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Taken together we conclude that Rv0365c is a member of the GH76 family and is specific for undecorated α-1,6 mannan.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Rv0365c cleaves the lipid anchor from LM and LAM</title><p id="P8">In mycobacteria, α-1,6-linked mannan has only been described in regions of LM, LAM, and their presumed capsular derivatives. We therefore hypothesised that Rv0365c would specifically degrade LM and LAM. To test this, we purified these lipoglycans from <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG Danish and incubated them with the enzyme. The reaction products were analysed by TLC, using a solvent system that would retain the carbohydrate domain at the origin, and separate any released glycolipids. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, Rv0365c released a low molecular weight product from LM and LAM, which stained positive for both carbohydrates and lipid. We also separated the LM/LAM reaction products by SDS-PAGE followed by ProQ-Emerald staining, demonstrating activity on both LM and LAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Incubation of the enzyme with isolated PIMs showed no detectable product formation, suggesting the enzyme cannot process PIM<sub>5</sub> or PIM<sub>6</sub> substrates, which is consistent with its inability to degrade α-1,2-linked mannose decorated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Supported by comparison to Aman6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) we predicted that D96 and D97 (numbering relative to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv genomic annotation) are the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile residues in this enzyme. We therefore generated the D96A mutant, which was catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We next sought to determine if the enzyme preferentially degraded LM or LAM. We quantified the degradation of both species over time by incubating the enzyme with LM/LAM and then analysing a time-course of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). This revealed that LM and LAM bands decrease at the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and that the enzyme exhibits no preference for either substrate. Prior work indicates that there are on average between 2 (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) and 7 (<italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>) α-1,6-linked mannose residues immediately attached to the <italic>myo</italic>-inositol anchor which lack α-1,2 decorations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Given the many possible cleavage sites available for Rv0365c, we next sought to identify the limit glycolipid product formed by exhaustive Rv0365c digestion of LAM. The sole glycolipid product was analysed by MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), revealing the product to be AcPIM<sub>2</sub>. The site of cleavage on LAM is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, using the most recent structural proposal of LAM from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as a template<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. From these data we conclude that Rv0365c degrades LM and LAM, releasing the carbohydrate domain from the AcPIM<sub>2</sub> lipid anchor and have renamed the protein LamH (<underline>L</underline>ipo<underline>a</underline>rabino<underline>m</underline>annan <underline>H</underline>ydrolase).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LamH drives production of capsular (arabino)mannan</title><p id="P10">Our biochemical data support the hypothesis that LamH is responsible for generating the capsular products of LM and LAM. To test this, we utilised a transposon mutant within <italic>lamH</italic> (BCGDAN_0378) in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Danish, hereafter referred to as Δ<italic>lamH</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This species is 99% genetically identical to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, having lost elements predominantly related to pathogenesis and is generally an excellent model system for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> envelope biogenesis and turnover. We first sought to determine if the loss of <italic>lamH</italic> had any impact on the levels of LM and LAM in the mutant. We observed accumulation of approximately 30% more LM/LAM in the Δ<italic>lamH</italic> strain compared to the wild-type strain at mid-exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Consistent with the biochemical data showing no preference for cleavage of LM and LAM by LamH, the change was approximately equal in magnitude for both LM and LAM. We generated a complementation plasmid in the pMV306 plasmid including the <italic>lamH</italic> open reading frame and 300 upstream bases, to include the likely promoter elements. Introduction of this <italic>lamH</italic> locus at the L5 site fully complemented the over-production of LM/LAM in the complemented mutant, but a catalytic null variant of this construct phenocopied the Δ<italic>lamH</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also deleted <italic>lamH</italic> (MSMEG_0740) in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 and analysed the LM/LAM composition in this strain, which gave results consistent with that of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Danish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3 a,b</xref>). Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that LamH is responsible for maintaining LM/LAM levels within the cell.</p><p id="P11">To investigate if LamH is responsible for the production of capsular (arabino)mannan, we examined levels of AM in the capsule of wild-type and mutant strains. Capsular polysaccharides from these strains were isolated and labelled with 2-aminobenzamide, then separated by size-exclusion chromatography, which allows the separation of α-glucan (∼100 kDa) from AM (∼14 kDa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, while AM was detected in wildtype, no AM was detected in the capsule of the Δ<italic>lamH</italic> strain, and capsular AM production was rescued in the complemented strain. The production of capsular AM required the enzyme be catalytically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). As 2-AB labelling instals a single label at each reducing end of the glycans, this allows calculation of the ratio of reducing ends of α-glucan to AM which can be used as a proxy for capsular composition. This analysis indicated that the complemented mutant produced significantly less AM than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), showing that complementation is imperfect, and suggesting that expression of the <italic>lamH</italic> gene is altered when located distally. We also analysed the PIM composition of the wild-type and mutant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). These data indicate that in response to <italic>lamH</italic> deletion, the bacteria produce less AcPIM<sub>2</sub> but significantly more Ac<sub>2</sub>PIM<sub>2</sub>. It was recently demonstrated that acylation of PIMs can occur as a response to membrane stress, which suggests that increased abundance of LM/LAM triggers a membrane stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Taken together these data are consistent with the hypothesis that LamH drives production of capsular AM by cleaving LAM.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mycobacteria respond to the lack of LamH activity by down-regulating LAM biogenesis</title><p id="P12">Given that Δ<italic>lamH</italic> bacteria were unable to degrade existing LM/LAM, we were surprised that they did not accumulate even more of these materials. To better understand why this might be the case we conducted whole-cell proteomics of mid-exponential bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The Δ<italic>lamH</italic> strain showed a pronounced reduction in abundance of several enzymes in the LM/LAM biogenesis pathway, suggesting that the bacteria respond to the accumulation of LM/LAM by reducing synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). While not all biosynthetic enzymes were observed, even within wild type, levels of arabinosyltransferases associated with LAM biogenesis (AftB, AftC, AftD) were observed to be significantly reduced or undetectable within Δ<italic>lamH</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Similarly, the levels of EmbC and MptA, which are arabinosyl- and mannosyl-transferases associated with LAM biogenesis were both reduced, however not significantly so<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, the expression of PimA and PatA, which are involved in both PIM and LM/LAM biogenesis are unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Taken together, this provides evidence that the levels of LM/LAM are tightly regulated by the bacteria and that LamH is involved in maintaining LM/LAM homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>LamH is required for efficient transition from lag-phase growth</title><p id="P13">Given that LAM was recently reported to be involved in septation, we next asked whether loss of LAM turnover would impact growth kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, loss of <italic>lamH</italic> dramatically extended lag-phase growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Under the conditions tested, wild-type bacteria have a lag phase of approximately 5 days. In contrast, the Δ<italic>lamH</italic> mutant extends lag to approximately 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This phenotype could be partially complemented with <italic>lamH</italic> but was not complemented by production of the catalytic null variant of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To understand if <italic>lamH</italic> was involved in both exit from lag-phase and exponential growth, we performed a linear regression on the linear portion of the growth curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This analysis revealed that exponential growth rate of the mutant was reduced, by approximately 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast to the lag defect and the capsular AM production, this aspect is fully complemented. This suggests that the time point between lag and exponential growth phases is more susceptible to LAM turnover deficit. We interpret these data to suggest that AM acts in part as a molecular cue for division in these bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>LamH-derived arabinomannan triggers exit from lag-phase</title><p id="P14">If capsular AM is a molecular signature for exit from lag phase or growth rate, we would expect that its location in the capsule means that spent media from wild-type bacteria may include sufficient material to alter the growth defects of the Δ<italic>lamH</italic> mutant. We therefore cultivated the mutant in spent media from a mid-exponential wild-type culture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, this spent media partially rescued the lag-phase and exponential growth rate defects.</p><p id="P15">Reasoning that the dose of AM may not be sufficient in spent media, we degraded LAM <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant LamH, and added it to fresh media at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.

Upon addition of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) to the resulting strain Rv0365::pLJR965, the expression of <italic>lamH</italic> was reduced by approximately 80% relative to the same strain grown in the absence of ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>).

According to the CAZy database, only 11 GH76 enzymes have been characterised to date, none of which are from pathogenic bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Our biochemical data identify LamH as an LM/LAM hydrolase that is specific for the first α-1,6 linked mannose attached to the AcPIM<sub>2</sub> anchor of LM/LAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). We explored this specificity using structurally homogenous yeast mannan from mutant strains. Our data demonstrate the enzyme will not digest mannan with α-1,2 backbone decorations, which are present on much of the mannan backbone of LAM distal from the AcPIM<sub>2</sub> anchor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This specificity is possibly driven by the predicted β-hairpin capping the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Alignment with the Aman6 structure suggests that binding of α-1,6 mannotetraose should be accommodated within the LamH active site, however the capping β-hairpin and active site would clash with substituents on mannose residues in the -1 and -2 positions. Future work will be required to determine the precise substrate recognition mechanism of LamH.</p><p id="P19">Our biochemical data indicate that AcPIM<sub>2</sub> is the dominant, if not sole, anchor of LM and LAM in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. This is consistent with prior studies, although we observe no detectable variation in the acylation status of these molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Production of AcPIM<sub>2</sub> upon digestion with LamH suggests a possible pathway for recycling of this lipid anchor into new rounds of LM/LAM and AM biogenesis. This is reminiscent of how mycobacteria have been shown to recycle components of peptidoglycan and trehalose mycolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Given its high specificity, it is likely that LamH will be a useful tool for probing the structure of the PIM anchor of LM/LAMs isolated from other mycobacterial species and critically, clinical isolates. The Jackson laboratory recently reported the identification of an Aman6 isozyme from <italic>Bacillus circulans</italic> for a similar purpose, which demonstrated activity against LAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. However, this enzyme appeared to hydrolyse LM/LAM at more positions than LamH, complicating the analysis of the reaction products.</p><p id="P20">Three main hypotheses have been put forward to explain how LM, LAM or their by-products are released to the host. First, LM/LAM may be extracted from the cytoplasmic membrane and trafficked to the outside of the cell through an active secretion system. The lipoprotein LprG has been implicated as a potential LM/LAM carrier protein, and loss of <italic>lprG</italic> leads to reduced surface exposure of LM/LAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. However, another report suggests that the physiological role of this protein is to transport triacylglycerols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Alternative mechanisms for active LM/LAM secretion have yet to be discovered. The second mechanism is through the production of vesicles by the bacteria, which are reported to contain LM/LAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Finally, the production of capsular AM has long been known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Indeed, capsular AM has been shown to drive the production of protective antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, this work provides the first mechanistic basis for the generation of capsular AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Our data also provide evidence that generation of this material is important for pathogenesis. While we were unable to make a complete deletion of <italic>lamH</italic> in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv, CRISPRi-mediated silencing reduced its expression by approximately 80%. Despite incomplete knock-down, this strain had an approximately 10-fold reduction of growth in macrophages. This echoes a prior report where expression of <italic>lamH</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 provided a growth-advantage in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that LamH-driven AM production is an anti-virulence target.</p><p id="P21">LM and LAM have important roles during pathogenesis. Yet, all mycobacteria generate LM and LAM, most species of mycobacteria are considered non-pathogenic. Recent work from the Morita identified to a role for LAM in septation, like that observed for lipoteichoic acids in other bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Our analysis of Δ<italic>lamH</italic> mutants in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> demonstrate that this enzyme is critical to maintaining LM/LAM homeostasis in the bacteria and that it drives expression of capsular AM. This suggests that the bacteria actively monitor the amount of LAM or AM in the cell and adjust biosynthesis by regulating the levels of synthetic enzymes through some as-of-yet unknown signalling pathway. This hypothesis is supported by the surprising result that loss of <italic>lamH</italic> leads to a profound lag-phase defect in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. Repair of this defect requires the catalytic activity of LamH or the addition of AM to the culture media suggesting that the AM is a signalling molecule. We can rule out the use of AM as a carbon nutrient given that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv has previously been shown not to be able to utilise D-arabinose or D-mannose as carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. While our data supports a role for AM in a signalling process, it is possible that the signal is not intact AM but is derived from further processing. For example, this could be driven by the action of recently discovered the endo-D-arabinanases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In this context, the abundance of AM or degraded fragments thereof could directly report on cell growth and division, and therefore report on the metabolic state of the bacteria. Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that AM can act like a quorum-sensing molecule in mycobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p id="P22">Unless stated otherwise all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Each biological replicate was analysed using four different FAIMS compensation voltages (CVs, -25, -35, -45 and -65) in a data-dependent manner switching between the acquisition of a single Orbitrap MS scan (450-2000 m/z, maximal injection time of 50 ms, an AGC set to a maximum of 1*10<sup>6</sup> ions and a resolution of 60k) every 3 seconds followed by Orbitrap MS/MS HCD scans (using the “Auto” mass range setting, a NCE of 25;32;40%, maximal injection time of 120 ms, an AGC set to a maximum of 500% and a resolution of 30k) as well as a Orbitrap EThcD scan (NCE 25%, maximal injecition time of 120 ms with an AGC of 500% and a resolution of 30,000) undertaken on each precursor.</p><p id="P41">FragPipe version 19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> was used to process the resulting proteome dataset with proteins identified by searching against the <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Danish 1331 proteome (NCBI accession: CP039850.1) allowing carbamidomethyl (57.0214Da) of cystines as a fixed modification as well as oxidation of methionine (15.9949Da), N-terminal acetylation (42.0106Da) in addition to hexose (162.0528Da) and 2*Hexose (324.1056Da) on serine and threonine residues as variable modifications. The resulting datasets were filtered using the default FragPipe parameters of 1% peptide/protein level false discovery rates. IonQuant was utilised for quantitative proteome comparisons with matching between runs enabled across biological replicates using the default parameters. The resulting combined MSfragger protein level output was process using Perseus (version 1.6.0.7) with missing values imputed based on the total observed protein intensities with a range of 0.3 σ and a downshift of 1.8 σ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>.
