We obtained whole genome sequences for 54 individuals from both wild and captive populations. We identified two genetic lineages at least 3 million years divergent, revealing cryptic diversity within the species complex. Our study indicates that the most common populations used for commercial and academic applications are primarily derived from just one of these divergent lineages, originating from a wild North American progenitor. Despite insect farming practices only reaching mass production scale over the past two decades, we find that captive populations show strong genome-wide signatures of domestication. Selective sweeps are found in multiple independently domesticated populations but are not seen in wild populations and suggest five major domestication loci located on chromosomes two, four and five. These regions contain development, behaviour, reproduction, metabolism and immunity genes. Populations experiencing independent domestication events, in the early stages of domestication, also show evidence of convergent genome evolution with repeated signatures of domestication in these same regions. Some limited evidence of gene flow between divergent lineages was observed, as well as evidence of hybridisation from domesticated populations into the wild. Our study reveals the genetic basis of ongoing domestication and provides a genomic platform for breeding and genetic surveillance in this novel agricultural species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>domestication</kwd><kwd>hybridisation</kwd><kwd>cryptic species</kwd><kwd>selective sweeps</kwd><kwd>introgression</kwd><kwd>artificial selection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Domestication of plants and animals has enabled successful human population growth and globalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kareiva et al. 2007</xref>). Domestication is a coevolutionary process that emerges from a specialised mutualism where a species fitness is managed through manipulation of the environment, food-source, behaviour, and mate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Zeder 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Purugganan 2022</xref>). Evolutionary changes in physiological, morphological, and behavioural traits over time have ultimately led to specialised varieties of crops and breeds of animal resulting in a host of phenotypic diversity, exemplified by <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> cultivars and dog breeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Ostrander et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mabry et al. 2021</xref>). This process of domestication provides insights into evolution on short time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Darwin 1868</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Larson et al. 2014</xref>). Whilst domestication has been extensively studied in plants, mammals, birds and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Ostrander et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Wang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mabry et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kwon et al. 2022</xref>), the silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori,</italic> is currently the only undisputed domesticated insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lecocq, 2018</xref>). Most livestock exclusively occur as domesticated populations where wild counterparts have become extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Sun et al. 2012</xref>). Here we focus on the black soldier fly, <italic>Hermetia illucens,</italic> a unique case which persists both in captivity and the wild.</p><p id="P3">The black soldier fly, <italic>H. illucens</italic> (L., 1758; Diptera: Stratiomyidae), has only become an important and globally mass farmed species within the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Sheppard et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Van Huis 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Tomberlin and van Huis 2020</xref>). In response to rising food demands driven by an ever-increasing human population, novel and more sustainable agricultural practices are being developed, such as the insect livestock industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Van Huis et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Van Huis 2013</xref>). The black soldier fly can convert a diverse range of organic wastes into protein and fat rich biomass making it a key species in the insect-based food and feed industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Gold et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Surendra et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Tomberlin and van Huis 2020</xref>). The black soldier fly has a cosmopolitan distribution with an origin in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Marshall et al. 2015</xref>), most likely South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>). Global distribution of <italic>H. illucens</italic> outside of the Americas is predicted to be anthropogenically mediated and by 1960 the species had established most of the present-day distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Marshall et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, over 60 years of local adaption to diverse environmental niches has likely occurred. Genomic resources have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Zhan et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Generalovic et al. 2021</xref>) and the species harbours high levels of genetic diversity (Ståhls et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Guilliet et al. 2022</xref>). The large amount of standing genetic diversity suggests considerable potential for artificial selection to develop improved strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Facchini et al. 2022</xref>). However, commercial activity is currently dominated by few closely related breeds all derived from one strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>). This population was founded in Georgia, USA in the 1990’s by Craig Sheppard with an approximate effective population size of 20,000 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Sheppard et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>) and has since been shared across the globe. Captive populations such as these have likely undergone or are currently experiencing a multitude of domestication bottlenecks and genetic adaptions associated with artificial insect farming conditions.</p><p id="P4">Here we explore <italic>H. illucens</italic> diversity on a whole-genome scale. Using the first genome-wide dataset of <italic>H. illucens</italic> sequenced to high coverage, we explore the genomic landscape of captive and wild populations, from locations across the globe. Using this dataset, we address the following questions: (1) What are the phylogenetic relationships among <italic>Hermetia illucens</italic> lineages? (2) When comparing genomes of captive populations to wild relatives can we reveal common signatures associated with domestication? (3) What is the extent and genetic consequences of introgression in the wild and within insect mass-rearing commercial facilities?</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genome sequencing and variant calling</title><p id="P5">We sequenced 54 <italic>H. illucens</italic> genomes to an average 22x sequencing coverage alongside an additional outgroup species, <italic>Ptecticus aurifer</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 1</xref>). In order to capture the extent of global genetic variation within the species we sampled <italic>H. illucens</italic> individuals from genetically distinct (captive and wild) populations, previously identified from microsatellite data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>). The remaining dataset consisted of several representative samples of active industrial and academic captive lines. In addition, we sampled wild sourced populations as part of a taxonomic voucher set. We hereafter term long-established academic/industry-derived samples as ‘captive’ whereas samples directly sampled from in the field were termed ‘wild’. After variant calling and stringent quality filtering, we identified 33,940,069 bi-allelic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Divergent lineages and cryptic species complex</title><p id="P6">A Maximum-Likelihood (ML) phylogeny of <italic>H. illucens</italic> was reconstructed using <italic>Ptecticus aurifer</italic> as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis on the genome-wide SNP data showed two major genetic lineages, the first containing wild sampled individuals from North America and many captives belonging to a single yet diverse sister clade, hereafter named lineage-<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The captive populations found in lineage-<italic>a</italic> are made polyphyletic by the North American wild population. European and North American captive populations form sister clades, or ‘breeds’, in line with a documented split from an original founding population, named hereafter as the ‘Sheppard’ strain. The ‘EVE’ genome reference line also appears to be a derivative of the Sheppard strain and thus forms a third breed. The second lineage, lineage-<italic>b,</italic> is formed from a diverse range of wild and captive populations. In lineage-<italic>b</italic>, wild and captive clades broadly cluster according to geographic location, indicating these captive populations are commonly established from locally occurring populations and may form new strains. Individuals from Asia (wild) and Australia (captive) also form an ‘Australasian’ clade. Phylogenetic methods using coalescence-based methods (ASTRAL) with both Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and ML algorithms also support a split between major lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1A &amp; 1B</xref>). However, NJ methods suggest this split is less pronounced with wild western European populations appearing as the most recent common ancestor to the previously identified lineage-<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Evidence for the divergence between the two distinct nuclear lineages was also supported by ADMIXTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Optimal clustering in ADMIXTURE analysis was identified at <italic>k</italic> = 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 2</xref>), and this was consistent when subsampling an equal number of individuals per population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). At higher <italic>k</italic>-values, <italic>k</italic> = 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), wild European populations show distinct clusters indicating a diverse within continent population structure consistent with independent colonisation events and likely subsequent patterns of isolation-by-distance. A similar pattern is observed across a larger geographic range in Asian and Australian samples in agreement with the successive colonisation of Australasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Guilliet et al. 2022</xref>). PCA analysis showed that captive <italic>H. illucens</italic> cluster with wild North American samples whilst the remaining wild and captive samples found globally form a second major cluster explained by 22% of the genetic variance along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Several individuals belonging to various industry populations (Ind-A, -B &amp; -C) are found in the PCA as intermediates between lineages, suggesting admixed origins for these populations. Measures of genetic differentiation (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>) and absolute sequence (<italic>d<sub>XY</sub></italic>) divergence were calculated to understand the scale of within and between lineage divergence of <italic>H. illucens.</italic> When grouped by discrete populations identified in clustering analysis we found high genome-wide levels of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> (0.178) and <italic>d<sub>XY</sub></italic> (0.081) between nuclear lineages.

The <italic>de novo H. illucens</italic> and <italic>P. aurifer</italic> assemblies are comparable to published reference mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Qi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Zhan et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Guilliet et al. 2022</xref>). Pronounced nuclear lineages (<italic>a</italic> &amp; <italic>b</italic>) were not recovered in the mtDNA tree where three major lineages (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B1</italic> &amp; <italic>B2</italic>) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>). Nuclear lineage-<italic>a</italic> samples were found falling into mitochondria clades <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B1</italic>, which diverged an estimated 6.8 million years ago (my; 95% CI: 4.1 - 9.7 my). Lineage-<italic>B1</italic> of the mtDNA tree contains nuclear lineage-<italic>a</italic> wild North American and captive European-Sheppard populations belonging to nuclear lineage-<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which diverged from mtDNA lineage-<italic>B2</italic> approximately 3.8 my ago (95% CI: 2.4 - 5.3 my). Mitochondrial clade <italic>B2</italic> shows a maximum internal divergence of 1.2 my isolating a captive representative of the</p><p id="P9">Australasian clade and wild southern Europe from the remaining populations. We also generated Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees of Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) markers, such that additional previously published samples could be incorporated, including some from wild Central American populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 6</xref>). This confirms the observation of divergence between two lineages and further supports that Sheppard-derived breeds of lineage-<italic>a</italic> are most closely related to wild samples from North America.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Genetic signals of domestication</title><p id="P10">Genomic signals of domestication are typically characterised by genome-wide reductions in genetic diversity and elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD) associated with a domestication bottleneck and small effective population sizes (<italic>Ne</italic>). On average, genome-wide heterozygosity of captive Sheppard (0.031) strains shows a 39% reduction compared to wild populations (0.051), supporting the domestication hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 7</xref>). Additional captive populations from South America exhibit the highest levels of diversity (0.087) as expected if this represents the ancestral range of the species, followed by African populations. In general, extensively reared captive populations showed lower diversity, with the exception of the European breed of the Sheppard strain which showed levels of diversity similar to that of wild populations. Within-population estimates of LD revealed elevated levels in captive populations consistent with a genetic bottleneck during domestication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 8</xref>). This analysis highlighted genome-wide patterns of domestication in captive populations. Next, we investigated which genomic regions showed evidence for adaptation by scanning populations for selective sweeps.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Genetic basis of domestication</title><p id="P11">Due to strong selection pressures during domestication, mutations carrying a fitness benefit rise in frequency causing linked alleles, by genetic hitchhiking, to sweep with the beneficial allele. Using sweepfinder2 to scan for these signatures of selection we reveal many putative sweeps (n=51) with outlier windows found throughout the genomes of domesticated populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Selective sweeps were identified firstly at a relaxed threshold when found exceeding the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile. Numerous sweeps were identified within captive breeds from North America (n=7), Europe (n=40), and the UK, EVE (n=4) belonging to the Sheppard strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 5</xref>). Of these potential domestication sweeps three European sweeps overlapped in genomic position with two large North American sweeps, whilst another three overlapped with a single large sweep in the EVE (UK) breed. One sweep was found overlapping across all three Sheppard breeds on chromosome five. A single representative individual from three industry strains (A, B &amp; C), sourced from Asia and maintained in the UK, were pooled and screened for signatures of selective sweeps to confirm common signatures of selection under artificial captive conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 5</xref>). Several sweeps were identified (n=18) and overlapped with previous candidate domestication loci on chromosome two, four and five (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 9</xref>). We further explored primary sweeps using a conservative threshold (1%) revealing sweep hotspots on chromosomes two, four and five (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 5</xref>). North American and European Sheppard breeds harboured one and three primary sweeps respectively, whilst EVE contained a single large potential domestication locus manifesting 36.8% (43 Mbp) of chromosome five. Captive industry strains contained two of these primary sweeps, one overlapped with the North American sweep on chromosome two and the second over chromosome five of the EVE strain.</p><p id="P12">We also explored populations recorded as recently established from local wild sources (South America, Africa and Australia) to evaluate whether independent domestication events involve evidence for parallelism over previously identified conservative sweeps. We found evidence for a second independent domestication event which showed convergence in all recent captive populations identifying overlaps with Sheppard strain sweeps at three major loci at the conservative (1%) threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 10</xref>). At the conservative and relaxed thresholds both South American and African captive populations overlapped with selective sweeps on chromosomes two and four, consistent with sweeps identified in the Sheppard populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 10</xref>). Sweeps within the captive African population also overlapped with the large domestication loci on chromosome five at the relaxed threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 10</xref>). Australian sweeps overlapping with the North America and European Sheppard breeds were absent but showed multiple overlaps within the large sweep region identified in the EVE breed (S5: 73574597-116544363) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In order to confirm that these loci are primarily associated with domestication, we also examined wild populations to test whether the five primary domestication loci showed evidence of natural selection in the wild. We found no evidence for selection at candidate domestication loci in the wild on chromosomes two and five, however, the wild North American population harboured a single overlap with the identified domestication loci on chromosome “S4: 59774502–68235020” at the relaxed (5%) threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 11</xref>). Whereas this analysis supports several of the identified sweeps as potential domestication loci, exclusively occurring in association with domestication of <italic>H. illucens,</italic> sweep “S4: 59774502–68235020” is likely a product of natural selection that provides mutual fitness benefits in an artificial environment or remains an independent signal of domestication due to the large overlapping region identified.</p><p id="P14">We next used genome-wide scans of genetic differentiation (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>) and cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (xpEHH) to further scan the genomes for differences between wild and captive Sheppard breeds. Sheppard strains were compared to the closest sampled wild relative, North America, for cross population analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 6</xref>). Peaks of high <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> and xpEHH occurred over previously identified domestication loci on chromosomes two, four and five in all Sheppard breeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 12 &amp; 13</xref>). However, only <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> peaks overlapped with the sweep on chromosome four in the captive North America and European breeds populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 12</xref>). The sweep over chromosome two (S2: 67366769-86308840 bp) harboured elevated <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> of 0.503 (global <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.122) and xpEHH -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) of 4.471 (global -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 0.43) values within the North American breeds. The sweep on chromosome two (S2: 24862123-29762659 bp) in the captive European breed also showed high <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> of 0.631 (global <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.1) and xpEHH -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 3.266 (global -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 0.428) values. Population specific loci here likely represent different selection pressures in these environments despite a shared history. Both previously identified domestication loci on chromosome five also contained extremely high levels of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> and xpEHH, particularly over the “S5: 40467072-56630746” region in the North American (max <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.889; max -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 3.963), European (max <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.892; max -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 5.369) and EVE (max <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.822; global <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.133; max -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 3.823; global -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) = 0.441) captive breeds. Measures of global <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3</xref>. This suggests a common domestication associated mode of genome evolution. Overall, although these signatures are not entirely independent of one another, (non-)overlapping <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> and xpEHH values within selective sweeps further support signatures of domestication selection in these regions.</p><p id="P15">Hotspots of selection were seen on chromosomes two, four, and five in captive populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We aimed to identify potential causative candidate genes associated with potential domestication sweeps using the top outlier (1%) regions of each domestication locus as outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary table 7</xref>. In addition, genes within 20 kb of the top <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> and xpEHH hits within sweeps were identified as candidates. A single 18.94 Mbp domestication peak within the North American captive breed on chromosome S2 (67,366,769-86,308,840 bp) contained 178 genes. Candidates within the outlier region of the sweep had annotated functions involved in egg development (<italic>Myb</italic>) and the innate immune responses (<italic>HMCT</italic>). Supporting hits (xpEHH) identified draper (<italic>drpr</italic>), also activated as part of the immune response, outside of the sweep’s outlier region.

In addition, two cuticle protein genes and a ciliary regulator ((<italic>PhLP</italic>), important for sperm function, were identified within the sweep outside of the outlier region. Two characterised genes were identified within chromosome S4 (59,774,502-68,235,020 bp), including a regulator of (night-time) sleep and brain glycogen metabolism (<italic>Lztr1</italic> or <italic>nowl</italic>), which has been shown to contribute to genetic susceptibility to obesity in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Maurer et al. 2020</xref>). Two additional genes involved in mushroom body development and photoreceptor differentiation (<italic>mbt</italic>), and axonogensis (<italic>SrpRA</italic>) were identified. The outlier region of the 6.2 Mbp sweep on chromosome S5 (50,409,332-56,630,746 bp) in the European Sheppard breed contained a single gene, neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (<italic>Ncam</italic>), also involved in brain development and sensory perception of smell. The Sheppard genome reference EVE breed showed the strongest selective sweep signal on chromosome S5 (73,274,529-116,544,363 bp), consisting of 662 genes, including ones associated with development, behaviour, and stimuli response. Genes found as top outliers within this sweep included tailless (<italic>tll</italic>), involved in early eye development and male-male aggression as adults. This <italic>tll</italic>-like gene was found clustered with three additional <italic>tll</italic>-like genes.

Outside the outlier region we continue to identify genes associated with behaviour (<italic>y</italic>) and eye development (<italic>sev</italic>).

Combined with a lack of evidence for extensive admixture, our data would suggest that <italic>H. illucens</italic> lineages may perhaps be considered as distinct taxa within a cryptic species complex. However, in the absence of further refined and complete global sampling of underrepresented regions presented in this study this remains speculative. Although previous work, including this study, indicate limited but feasible hybridisation suggesting a general lack of complete reproductive incompatibilities (Ståhls et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>), there is some previous evidence of barriers to random gene flow in <italic>H. illucens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hoffmann et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>).

Overall, it remains unclear the extent to which commercially motivated worldwide exchange will contribute to the breakdown of these divergent lineages. However, deciphering the evolutionary history of <italic>H. illucens</italic> appears key and timely in order to appropriately discriminate global genetic diversity, as well as improve breeding and targeted genomic selection.</p><p id="P23">Deciphering the evolutionary history of <italic>H. illucens</italic> provides insights into its biogeographic history. The deep divergences observed (&gt;3 mya) predate recent anthropogenic expansion, suggesting that this must represent divergence originating in the original native range in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Marshall et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kaya et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Guilliet et al. 2022</xref>). This could be a result of isolation-by-distance (IBD) across a broad range across South and North America. Alternatively, deep divergence in the mtDNA and whole genome trees might reflect biogeographic events within the Americas. For example, divergence in mtDNA that occurred during the late Miocene period (~6 mya) coincides with extreme uplift of the Andean Plateau, potentially driving reproductive barriers between South American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Garzione et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ghosh et al. 2006</xref>; Ståhls et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Pazmiño et al. 2023</xref>).

Ancient hybridisation has been shown to facilitate adaptive ecological radiation and speciation which may have played a role in the diversification of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Meier et al. 2017</xref>). Likewise, hybridisation may have played an important role in shaping the genetic basis for domestication and consequently, an entire industry largely building on lineage-<italic>a</italic> descendants. These inferences corroborate the presence of cryptic diversity within <italic>H. illucens</italic> and poses major implications on harnessing its breeding potential in an agricultural context. <italic>Hermetia</italic> are distributed throughout the globe, yet ~65% of species are found in the Neotropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fachin and Hauser 2022</xref>).

Some caution should be applied here when interpreting signals stretching over extreme distances of up to &gt;40 Mb, as inbreeding can also lead to runs of homozygosity and signatures similar to selective sweeps. Nonetheless, evidence for shared signatures between descendants of the original and independently domesticated populations lends credence to the hypothesis that these are genuine signatures of selection. The strongest genetic evidence of selection in domesticated populations repeatedly identifies regions containing genes affecting traits commonly associated with domestication such as development, growth and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Darwin 1868</xref>).

Several genes involved in cuticle protein production were under selection across several life stages potentially indicating factors such as unnatural rearing densities in domesticated conditions may impact commercially relevant traits including body size.

We used a composite likelihood approach to detect beneficial mutations that have rapidly increased in frequency causing a selective sweep using SweepFinder2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Degiorgio et al. 2016</xref>). A genome wide empirical frequency spectrum was generated for each tested population and sweep detection was performed using sites spaced 20 kb apart (-lg 20000). All selective sweep tests were set an arbitrary relaxed outlier threshold of 5% to identify sweeps associated with selection followed by a 1% threshold to conservatively identify primary sweeps associated with selection. Sweep co-ordinates were quantified by CLR values exceeding the genome-wide average for each respective population or if the flanking region of sweeps occurred within 50 kb of another sweep, in which case they were treated as a single sweep. These key sweeps were compared to populations in ongoing domestication and the wild to confirm association with domestication.
