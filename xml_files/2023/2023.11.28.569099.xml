Furthermore, populations adapted to distinct environments differ in their sensitivity to combined thermal and nutritional stress. However, most studies have tested these effects using constant temperatures, even though animals in the wild experience daily and seasonal thermal fluctuations. Here, we used two locally-adapted populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from the east coast of Australia (a tropical and a temperate population) to ask whether temperature fluctuations interact with nutrition in the same manner as constant temperature conditions to shape life history traits, and how this differs across populations. We found that fluctuating temperatures exacerbate the negative effects of a poor diet when compared to constant temperatures. Moreover, the negative effects of nutritional stress were significantly greater in the tropical population. In contrast, we found that the temperate population was able to utilize nutrition in unique ways to maintain optimal viability under warmer temperatures. Our findings reveal the ways in which temperature and nutrition interact to impact key life history traits in geographically distinct populations, while also highlighting the importance of using temperature assays representative of natural diel cycles when examining insect responses to climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Temperature</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Local Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Diel Cycles</kwd><kwd>Climate Change</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics are being impacted by climate change in unprecedented ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Dawson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Foden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels have not only led to an increase in mean temperatures, but accentuated variation in seasonal temperatures and precipitation. This is becoming an increasingly important source of chronic stress for animals, both directly and through complex interactions with other environmental stressors, such as the nutritional composition and availability of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chevin, Lande and Mace, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Foden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Long <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rosenblatt and Schmitz, 2016</xref>).

For example, studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> show that warmer temperature fluctuations reduce traits associated with fitness and cooler temperature fluctuations improve traits associated with fitness, when compared with constant temperatures of the same mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ketola, Kellermann, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Czarnoleski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Colinet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Javal, Renault and Colinet, 2016</xref>).

Thus, whether it is possible to make accurate assessments of climate vulnerability based on studies using constant thermal treatments has been questioned by many (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Sgro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Fischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Estay, Lima and Bozinovic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ketola and Saarinen, 2015</xref>). Importantly, such assessments also ignore the fact that climate change will expose organisms to combinations of stressors.</p><p id="P6">In particular, increasing CO2 levels and changes in temperature and water availability under climate change are expected to alter the macronutrient content of plants and fruits in complex ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Dietterich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rosenblatt and Schmitz, 2016</xref>). In addition, the maturation process of fruits, from ripening to rotting, is temperature sensitive and can lead to changes in the density and diversity of yeast species upon which insects like <italic>Drosophila</italic> feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Morais <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), resulting in additional changes in the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (P:C) in and around rotting fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Tournas and Katsoudas, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P7">How ectotherms respond to climate change will depend on their response to combinations of stressors simultaneously (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaunisto, Ferguson and Sinclair, 2016</xref>), which may or may not reflect how they respond to single stressors in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Sisodia and Singh, 2010</xref>). Temperature and nutrition are strongly linked by an organism’s metabolism and energy requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rho and Lee, 2017</xref>). For instance, the capacity of ectotherms to absorb macronutrients from food sources can be highly dependent on temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Clissold, Coggan and Simpson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Clissold and Simpson, 2015</xref>). Thus, even when an insect feeds on a plant with the same nutritional composition, the effects of that plant on insect fitness will differ with thermal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Stamp and Yang, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Clissold and Simpson, 2015</xref>). As a result, changes in the nutritional and thermal environment can be expected to have unexpected impacts on key fitness-related traits in ectotherms. Recent work examining the interactive effects of temperature and nutrition have shown that temperature modulates the effects of nutrition on life history traits in often unpredictable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kutz, Sgrò and Mirth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty, Sgrò and Mirth, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Further, populations sampled from along environmental (latitudinal) gradients often vary in their responses to thermal stress due to local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Angilletta Jr., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Liefting, Hoffmann and Ellers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lasne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Because such populations are also exposed to different nutritional environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pärtel, Laanisto and Zobel, 2007</xref>), they might also be expected to differ in their sensitivity to nutritional stress. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty et al. (2020)</xref> found that locally-adapted populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> collected along the Australian east coast vary in their response to combined thermal and nutritional stress, but not in a way that was explained by their latitude of origin. This result might be explained by the studies’ use of constant temperature regimes.</p><p id="P9">Populations living at opposing ends of a latitudinal cline are subject to contrasting daily mean temperatures, but perhaps more importantly, different amplitudes of temperature fluctuations over time. As a result, temperate populations might be better adapted to thermal fluctuations than their tropical counterparts, as they experience more variable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buckling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Hoffmann and Ma, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shah, Funk and Ghalambor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Given that insect responses to constant versus fluctuating thermal conditions can vary for a range of life history traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brakefield and Mazzotta, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brakefield and Kesbeke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Colinet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Fischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), the interactive effects of fluctuating thermal conditions and nutritional stress on geographically-distinct populations might be expected to produce unique phenotypes. Because temperate populations are adapted to more variable environments, we might predict that they will be better able to buffer the response of life history traits against combinations of stressors when temperatures fluctuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bradshaw, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">De Jong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sørensen, Kristensen and Overgaard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shah, Funk and Ghalambor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Here, we first test whether locally-adapted populations differ in the response of their key life history traits to either fluctuating or constant temperature treatments in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.

We found that egg-to-adult viability was significantly reduced in flies reared under fluctuating temperatures when compared to a constant temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, there was no significant effect of fluctuating temperatures on body size within individual populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), however, when reared under fluctuating temperatures the Melbourne population was significantly larger than the Townsville population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). These findings indicate that fluctuating temperature treatments impact fitness-related traits both in a different manner to constant temperatures and in a population dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Egg-adult viability at fluctuating temperatures</title><p id="P25">Next, we aimed to uncover how temperature treatments that fluctuated around different means mediate egg-to-adult viability and body size responses to nutrition across two locally adapted populations. Egg-to-adult viability was measured across 25 experimental diets (varying in their protein: carbohydrate concentration and caloric content), three temperature treatments (18, 25 and 28 ± 5°C), and two populations (temperate (Melbourne) and tropical (Townsville)). The Melbourne population, which is adapted to more extreme thermal fluctuations, showed higher egg-to-adult viability across all three temperature treatments when compared to the Townsville population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Importantly, there was a four-way interaction between carbohydrate, protein, population, and temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). As a result, we used the newly developed ‘Nutrigonometry’ model to test for complex nutritional trade-offs in both populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Morimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The dietary conditions that generated the highest viability shifted substantially towards lower protein: carbohydrate ratios (i.e., more carbohydrate) as mean temperatures increased in the Melbourne population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a – c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). For instance, the peak region for viability shifted from an intermediate protein: carbohydrate ratio and high nutrient concentration at 18°C± 5°C and 25°C± 5°C to relatively lower protein: carbohydrate ratio and lower nutrient concentration at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This allowed the Melbourne population to maintain relatively high viability despite thermally stressful conditions. For the Townsville population, the dietary conditions which generated the highest egg-to-adult viability remained at an intermediate-high protein: carbohydrate ratio and high nutrient concentration across thermal regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These findings suggest that locally-adapted populations might be expected to utilise nutrients in different ways under thermal stress. This is curious, given a previous study using constant temperature treatments did not observe this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty, Sgrò and Mirth, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Body size at fluctuating temperatures</title><p id="P27">To determine the combined effects of nutrition and fluctuating temperature on final body size among two locally-adapted populations, we measured female wing size as a proxy for body size, using viable adults from the experiment described above. Overall, body size decreased with increasing rearing temperatures in both populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), while the Melbourne population remained consistently larger than the Townsville population for each temperature regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). As was the case with viability, we found a four-way interaction between carbohydrate, protein, population, and temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), so we again applied the ‘Nutrigonometry’ model to test for complex nutritional trade-offs in both populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Morimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P28">There was a shift of the peak region for size as temperature increased, going from regions of high protein: carbohydrate ratios and intermediate nutrient concentration to regions of lower protein: carbohydrate ratios and low nutrient concentration in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Specifically, we know that both temperature and the nutritional composition and abundance of primary producers are expected to change significantly as climate change worsens. These two stressors have also been shown to interact in complex ways, with nutrition mediating the effects of temperature on key life history traits in small ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Clissold and Simpson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kutz, Sgrò and Mirth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty, Sgrò and Mirth, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kim, Jang and Lee, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P30">While previous studies provide insights into how temperature changes responses to diet, they have used constant temperature assays, which may over or underestimate the impacts of increasing temperatures on animal fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ketola <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Czarnoleski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Colinet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Javal, Renault and Colinet, 2016</xref>). Constant temperature regimes also fail to consider how local adaptation to thermal variability in nature may impact the ability of populations to tolerate the increasing temperatures (and increases in thermal fluctuations) expected under climate change. To these ends, the first aim of this study was to understand how key life history traits (viability and final body size) respond to the effects of fluctuating versus constant temperatures during development among two locally-adapted populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> collected from along a latitudinal cline in eastern Australia. The second aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of fluctuating temperatures and nutrition on the same two traits.</p><sec id="S18"><title>Populations vary in their response to constant versus fluctuating temperature</title><p id="P31">Our findings for viability are generally in line with previous investigations which show that key life history traits are negatively impacted by fluctuating warm versus constant warm temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ketola, Kristensen, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Colinet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Javal, Renault and Colinet, 2016</xref>). We found that in both populations, viability was significantly reduced under fluctuating temperature treatments, when compared with constant temperature treatments. Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in egg-to-adult viability differs in response to fluctuating versus constant temperature regimes. This may be because thermal oscillations more closely mimic developmental conditions in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Les, Paitz and Bowden, 2009</xref>). It is also possible that constant temperatures have different effects on an animal’s ability to regulate their metabolism than fluctuating temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lamb, 1961</xref>). In the wild, animals will typically decrease their metabolic rate in response to thermal stress – this is done by reducing their activity and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barnes and Laurie-Ahlberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Klepsatel et al. , 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Vianna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). This process may be disrupted under constant temperature conditions. These findings highlight the need for fluctuating temperature treatments to be increasingly included in studies of population responses to environmental change.</p><p id="P32">Interestingly, we found that final body size was not significantly reduced when flies were developed at fluctuating temperatures versus constant temperatures. This is interesting in light of findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Czarnoleski <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, who reported a reduction in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing size when exposed to fluctuating temperatures during development. Similar to our study, flies were reared at two mean temperatures (18 and 25°C), either constant or ±4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Czarnoleski <italic>et al.</italic>,2013</xref>). However, it is important to note that the population used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Czarnoleski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref> was collected from a site in the USA, thus, it is possible that these contrasting findings represent variability in phenotypic responses among different populations.</p><p id="P33">Indeed, we found a significant difference among populations for body size, but only when flies were reared under fluctuating temperatures. In this instance, the temperate population was significantly larger than the tropical population at fluctuating compared to constant temperatures. We know that populations sampled from latitudinal gradients adapt to their local climatic conditions and that the temperate Melbourne population is subject to more severe and more frequent thermal shifts (Hoffmann et al. 2001, 2002, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lasne et al. 2018</xref>; Sgrò et al. 2010). They are also likely to be adapted to a more variable nutritional environment, given these shifts in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bradshaw, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">De Jong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sørensen, Kristensen and Overgaard, 2016</xref>). This leads us to believe that populations adapted to greater variation in thermal maxima and minima, and to greater nutritional variability can maintain larger body sizes under more stressful (in this case fluctuating) thermal conditions. This supports the environmental variability hypothesis which predicts that populations which are adapted to less variable environments (tropical populations) should display reduced plasticity when compared with populations subjected to more variable environmental conditions (temperate populations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bradshaw, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Stearns and Kawecki, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">De Jong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wagner, Booth and Bagheri-Chaichian, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Local adaptation changes population responses to combined thermal and nutritional stress</title><p id="P34">As a result of local adaptation, stress traits associated with starvation resistance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> often vary across latitudinal clines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Sisodia and Singh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lasne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Thus, population differences in trait values found along latitudinal gradients might be driven by the combined effects of changing nutritional and thermal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Robinson and Partridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kolss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Flatt, 2016</xref>). Indeed, we found that nutrition mediates the effects of fluctuating temperatures on both egg-to-adult viability and body size, and that these responses are population specific.</p><p id="P35">As discussed previously, egg-to-adult viability is often considered a canalized trait in ectotherms, and this trait has previously been found not to vary significantly among populations, steadily declining as temperatures increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Conover and Schultz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wagner, Booth and Bagheri-Chaichian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kutz, Sgrò and Mirth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty, Sgrò and Mirth, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the temperate population was able to maintain on average higher egg-to-adult viability than the tropical population and that under warmer temperatures this effect was mediated by the nutritional environment. Specifically, the temperate population appeared to dramatically shift its nutritional optimum from an intermediate P:C diet towards a low protein, high carbohydrate diet, whereas in the tropical population the same diet produced maximum viability across all thermal conditions. We know that different traits have different macronutrient requirements for maximal performance, and that this can vary in different thermal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Boggs, 2009</xref>). However, our findings suggest that larvae from our temperate population can utilise their nutritional environment in unique ways to maintain optimal viability under a range of thermal conditions.</p><p id="P36">Interestingly, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chakraborty, Sgrò and Mirth (2020)</xref> found no interactive effect of temperature and nutrition on egg-to-adult viability among different locally adapted populations – however, they used constant 18 and 25°C temperature assays. Similarly, the caterpillar <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> (Hübner) had the highest viability at intermediate P:C ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lee and Roh, 2010</xref>), regardless of whether they were reared at 18, 26, or 34 °C. These findings suggest that under constant temperatures the interactive effects of temperature and nutrition are dampened when compared to the effects under fluctuating thermal conditions.</p><p id="P37">Previous work has shown that a protein rich diet maximises body size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kristensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Rodrigues <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Poças, Crosbie and Mirth, 2020</xref>). Our results at 18 ± 5°C align with this existing knowledge. Interestingly however, at 28 ± 5°C both populations had larger wings when reared on low protein, low carbohydrate concentration diets. This suggests that wing size does not increase with high protein at warmer temperatures, as it does at lower temperature. Furthermore, given these results, we hypothesise that viability/body size trade-offs, whereby the nutritional optima for each trait diverges, may become more extreme under warmer conditions, particularly for the tropical population, where high protein diets maximised viability but reduced body size at 28±5°C.</p><p id="P38">Under warmer mean temperatures, metabolic stress has been shown to increase in ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rho and Lee, 2017</xref>) and is modulated by developmental nutrition. For example, when reared at warmer temperatures (28 °C), animals on low-protein diets showed the highest metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). As a result, it is unsurprising that we observed narrower viability and body size peaks at 28 ± 5°C compared to 18 and 25± 5°C, in both populations. This means that the number of diets which generate the optimal phenotype are reduced under increasing thermal conditions. Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kutz et al. (2019)</xref> using constant temperature treatments. This suggests that this reduction in nutritional optima is not specific to fluctuating temperature regimes but observed under higher temperatures in general. This has significant implications for ectotherm persistence under climate change, as it would be expected to significantly reduce the ecological niche of different populations.</p><p id="P39">Our findings indicate that it might not be possible to determine a universal predictive model or explanation for nutrient by temperature interactions in ectotherms. We know that nutrition and temperature are linked via an organism’s metabolism and energy requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Cross <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Clissold and Simpson, 2015</xref>). Thus, given that plant species distribution and abundance is influenced by climate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rosenblatt and Schmitz, 2016</xref>), it may be that locally-adapted populations have evolved different means of moderating thermal stress via diet, based on the resources available to them. This hints at the possibility that the populations examined in this study may have different physiological means of utilising macronutrients, particularly under warmer conditions. For instance, they might vary in how they process food through digestion, absorb nutrients, or store excess energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Volkoff and Rønnestad, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Responses to environmental change are complex – broader implications, limitations, and future directions</title><p id="P40">In this study, we established that egg-adult viability and wing size differ in their responses to constant versus fluctuating temperatures in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Then, using Nutritional Geometry, we found that the response of these traits to the combined effects of nutrition and temperature was population specific. Even within a single population, trait responses to nutrition differed with temperature treatments, producing unexpected results under warmer conditions. This suggests that the ways in which locally-adapted populations respond to multiple simultaneous drivers of global change are likely to differ significantly.</p><p id="P41">Nevertheless, it must be noted that there were several limitations to our study. First, the way protein increase was achieved in the yeast-dextrose-potato media was to increase the yeast component. However, yeast also contains other essential macro and micronutrients, and these micronutrients might interact with protein and carbohydrates to dictate life-history outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Rodrigues <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Zanco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Piper <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Therefore, the life-history traits examined in this study may not only be responding to carbohydrate and protein content, but also to complex interactions between these other nutritional elements. Nevertheless, we know that the range of P:C ratios used in the current study do reflect those which are observed in rotting fruits in the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Matavelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Silva-Soares <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). This indicates that laboratory-based experiments such as ours still play an important role in understanding the responses of ectotherms to multiple simultaneous drivers of global change.</p><p id="P42">Another limitation of our study was the fact that temperature fluctuations typically experienced at lower latitudes are less severe than those experienced in more temperate environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Cunningham and Read, 2003</xref>). Thus, the reduced viability of the tropical population across all treatments could be attributed to the fact that the extremity of fluctuations used in the current study were more pronounced than the temperature fluctuations tropical populations would experience in nature. Exploring how traits respond to differing amplitudes of thermal fluctuations would be an interesting avenue of future research. Adding to this, it would also be beneficial for future research to determine which fruits our study populations feed on in the wild and investigate how different thermal conditions influence macronutrient ratios during the decomposition processes. This would provide invaluable insights into what might be driving variation in trait responses to nutrition under different thermal conditions observed in this study.</p><p id="P43">Finally, given our results suggest that different populations may have different physiological mechanisms of dealing with thermal stress via nutrition, it would be useful to establish what molecular pathways may be mediating these differences. This would allow us to better understand the mechanisms that underpin differences among locally-adapted populations, and further our understanding of the ways in which different populations might evolve in response to ongoing environmental change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P44">Environmental change is not one-dimensional, instead it is the result of multiple interacting factors, varying over space and time. Despite this, most studies aimed at better understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change focus on static temperatures and single stressors within single populations. Our study shows that locally-adapted populations respond to the combined effects of nutrition and fluctuating thermal regimes in trait and population-specific ways. Even within single populations, we found that trait responses to nutrition varied across temperature treatments.</p><p id="P45">In conclusion, our study suggests that the effects of fluctuating temperature are mediated by diet and that these two environmental factors interact to shape fitness outcomes, making it difficult to predict the way traits will respond with increasing temperatures. Furthermore, the effects of these two stressors on larval traits are population specific. Therefore, creating predictive models about the effects of climate change on organisms may only be possible at more local scales, and with nutrition and temperature considered as interacting factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS191883-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d208aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS191883-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d208aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS191883-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d208aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS191883-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d208aAdFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS191883-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d208aAdFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Funding and Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by funds from the Australian Research Council, DP180103725 to CMS and FT170100259 to CKM, and the School of Biological Sciences, Monash University.

different ways in populations of flies from Melbourne or Townsville. The direction of this variation differs between traits, with flies reared under fluctuating temperatures being significantly less viable when compared with those reared under constant temperatures (a). Alternatively, there was no significant effect of fluctuating temperature on body size within populations (b), however, under fluctuating temperature, body size was significantly reduced in the Townsville population when compared with the Melbourne population (b). Pairwise comparisons are shown above (black asterisks denote level of significance).
