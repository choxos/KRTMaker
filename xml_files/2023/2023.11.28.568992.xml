A framework of nuclear division and morphological changes is known from light microscopy, yet this has limited resolution and the intrinsic organisation of organelles within the cell body and their manner of duplication and inheritance is unknown. Using volume electron microscopy approaches, we have produced three-dimensional reconstructions of different promastigote cell cycle stages to give a spatial and quantitative overview of organelle positioning, division and inheritance. The first morphological indications seen in our dataset that a new cell cycle had begun were the assembly of a new flagellum, the duplication of the contractile vacuole and the increase in volume of the nucleus and kinetoplast. We showed that the progression of the cytokinesis furrow created a specific pattern of membrane indentations and sub-pellicular microtubule organisation indicates that is likely a preferred site of new microtubule insertion. The daughter cells retained these indentations in their cell body for a period post-abscission. By comparing cultured and sand fly derived promastigotes, we found an increase in the number and overall volume of lipid droplets in the promastigotes from the sand fly, reflecting a change in their metabolism to ensure transmissibility to the mammalian host. Our insights into the cell cycle mechanics of <italic>Leishmania</italic> will be invaluable for future molecular cell biology analyses of these important parasites.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Leishmania</kwd><kwd>SBF-SEM</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. are flagellated unicellular parasites that cause the neglected tropical disease, leishmaniasis. <italic>Leishmania</italic> are transmitted between mammalian hosts by its sand fly vector and during its life cycle the parasite has two developmental stages each principally defined by the shape and form of the cell and flagellum length, with limited molecular makers to differentiate the promastigote forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gossage, Rogers, and Bates 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burza, Croft, and Boelaert 2018</xref>). In the sand fly midgut, <italic>Leishmania</italic> has a promastigote morphology with an elongated cell body and a single flagellum extending from the anterior end of the cell body. Promastigote cells have a highly polarised layout with single-copy organelles occupying defined positions within the cell. The nucleus is positioned centrally within the cell body, with the concatenated mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast) found towards the anterior end of the cell. The kinetoplast is physically connected to the basal body from which the flagellum extends. The base of the flagellum is within a membrane invagination called the flagellar pocket, which is the sole site of endo/exocytosis. In the mammalian host, <italic>Leishmania</italic> resides within the parasitophorous vacuole of a macrophage as an amastigote. This form is characterised by having a smaller and more spherical cell body, with a flagellum that just extends beyond the exit of the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambit et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sunter and Gull 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sunter et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>Leishmania</italic> are members of the trypanosomatid parasites that includes the other human pathogens <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. Life cycle stages of these parasites have highly defined morphologies, with two major morphological supergroups – liberform and juxtaform. <italic>Leishmania</italic> belong to the liberform group, with <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in the juxtaform group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2013</xref>). The defining feature of these different morphological groupings is the length of the portion of the flagellum that is laterally attached to the cell body. In liberform <italic>Leishmania</italic>, there is a minimal lateral attachment of the flagellum to the cell body within the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wheeler, Sunter, and Gull 2016</xref>), whereas in juxtaforms such as <italic>T. brucei</italic> there is an extended region of flagellum attachment along the majority of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sunter and Gull 2016</xref>). This lateral attachment in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> is mediated by a complex cytoskeletal structure called the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ). In <italic>T. brucei</italic> the FAZ is important for regulating cell division through defining the start point of cytokinesis furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Robinson et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sunter and Gull 2016</xref>) whilst in Leishmania, the FAZ is important for defining flagellar pocket shape and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sunter et al. 2019</xref>). The distinctive cell morphology of a <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigote is retained in each subsequent cell generation, requiring cell division to occur reproducibly with high-fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>; 2013). Despite the liberform likely being the ancestral morphology of the trypanosomatid parasites, cell division has been more extensively studied in the juxtaform <italic>T. brucei and T. cruzi</italic> (Sherwin and Gull 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abeywickrema et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Campbell and de Graffenried 2023</xref>). However, the timings of and the morphological changes during the <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigote cell cycle have been examined at the light microscopy level, using a combination of markers for cellular structures (nucleus, kinetoplast, spindle, flagellar pocket), DNA replication, and overall cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Rudzinska, D’alesandro, and Trager 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aleman 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambit et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Minocha et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). For the vast majority of the cell cycle the parasite has one kinetoplast, one nucleus and one flagellum protruding from the flagellar pocket. During the promastigote cell cycle, the <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell body undergoes dramatic changes in its length, having doubled in length during G1 then plateauing in S phase before rapidly becoming shorter and wider as the cell divides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambit et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). Nuclear and kinetoplast S phase are near synchronous and around the end of S phase a new flagellum becomes visible protruding from the flagellar pocket alongside the old flagellum. Though given the ∼2 µm depth of the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wheeler, Sunter, and Gull 2016</xref>), the exact point in the cell cycle at which new flagellum growth starts is unknown. The kinetoplast and nucleus divide at similar times as the cell body shortens, with the flagellar pocket segregating around this point, before the formation of a cytokinesis furrow with cytokinesis proceeding along the long axis of the cell body from the anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambit et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P4">These light microscopy studies provided an overall temporal and morphological framework for the <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell cycle. This is, however, limited in detail to large organelles - although there are isolated exceptions using specific molecular markers, such as used to analyse the cell cycle related dynamics of the multivesicular tubule lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wang, Wheeler, and Sunter 2019</xref>). Our understanding of the timing and manner of cell morphogenesis and organelle inheritance in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is limited. In a previous study, our group used a volume electron microscopy (vEM) approach called serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) - which is based on automated and sequential sectioning and imaging by SEM - to produce a three-dimensional spatiotemporal map of cell division in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, with ultrastructural detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hughes et al. 2017</xref>). This work demonstrated the power of complementary microscopy methods to understand the mechanisms that control trypanosome and by extension juxtaform cell morphogenesis.</p><p id="P5">Here, we used the vEM methodologies of SBF-SEM and serial electron tomography to examine <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> promastigotes at many stages of the cell cycle in unprecedented detail. This provides a comprehensive spatial overview of the changes that occur in organelle shape, number, size, and position through the cell cycle, along with changes in the organisation of the sub-pellicular microtubule cortex, which defines cell shape, and differences between axenically cultured and sand fly inhabiting promastigotes. In doing so, we have provided important insights into the cell cycle mechanics of these parasites and the liberform morphological supergroup.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SBF-SEM allows classification of axenic promastigotes into seven characteristic cell cycle stages</title><p id="P6">Promastigote form <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> cells from an asynchronous exponential phase <italic>in vitro</italic> culture were imaged by SBF-SEM, generating a dataset containing 750 individual slices (Z-slice = 100 nm) (Movie 1). We analysed a total of 40 promastigote cells whose cell body and flagella lay within the imaged dataset, representing seven different stages of the cell cycle (see below). The cell body membrane, flagellum, nucleus, mitochondrion with kinetoplast, Golgi Body, contractile vacuole, paraflagellar rod, lipid bodies, acidocalcisomes and glycosomes were segmented for each individual whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, Movie 2, Supple.

Organelles were identified as per previous descriptions in transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chang 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Rudzinska, D’alesandro, and Trager 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Pan and Pan 1986</xref>). The volume and surface area was calculated from the segmentation of each cellular structure and organelle and counts were made of multi-copy organelles, shown below and in Supple. Table 1. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was segmented in each slice of the dataset to illustrate positioning within each cell, but due to its undulating nature these fragments are not connected across sections to produce a 3D model due to the limitations of Z-resolution. The sub-pellicular microtubules were also not modelled as they are separated by only 20 nm thus were only visible when orientated parallel to the Z axis.</p><p id="P7">Using the asynchronous exponential phase culture means the cells are randomly sampled from all stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Sherwin and Gull 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wheeler 2015</xref>). We defined seven distinct cell cycle stages by identifying the number of kinetoplasts and nuclei and the length of the new flagellum, which will enable us to examine changes in both cell and organelle morphogenesis through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Stage 1-3 have a single kinetoplast and nucleus and are distinguished by the flagella: Stage 1) Single flagellum (Movie 1); Stage 2) Two flagella, with the new flagellum (NF) restricted to the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; arrow - NF); Stage 3) New flagellum that has emerged from the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; arrow - NF); Stage 4-7 are distinguished by kinetoplast, nucleus and cell body division stage: Stage 4) Single elongated (dividng) kinetoplast and a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; arrow – kinetoplast); Stage 5) Two kinetoplasts and a dividing nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; arrow – nucleus); Stage 6) Two kinetoplasts and two nuclei, with a cell body division fold (Movie 2); Stage 7) Cell body cytokinesis furrow from the anterior end of the cell towards the posterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; arrow - furrow).</p><p id="P8">For a population in exponential growth it is possible to calculate time spent in each cell cycle stage, assuming that all cells are undergoing the same replicative cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wheeler 2015</xref>). Here, we represent timings as proportion of time (in units, u) through the ∼8h cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). The new flagellum begins to grow within the flagellar pocket in Stage 2 at 0.3 u and emerges from the flagellar pocket in Stage 3 at 0.53 u. The kinetoplast shows a more elongated form, indicative of the earliest stages of reorganisation for division (Stage 4), at 0.76 u followed by a late mitotic nucleus (Stage 5) characterised by two distinct nuclear lobes linked by a cytoplasmic mitotic nuclear bridge at 0.8 u with segregation of the kinetoplast and nucleus (Stage 6) occurring at 0.81 u.</p><p id="P9">One of the most notable morphological features of <italic>Leishmania</italic> is the change in cell body length during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The overall change in cell length agrees with our previous light microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). Despite a reduction in cell body length, the cell volume increased from Stages 1-5 and then remained relatively constant through Stages 6-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), whilst the cell surface area increased steadily across the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). This shows that the cell volume and surface area increases whilst the cell body length decreases as the cell undergoes large cellular rearrangements in preparation for cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>New flagellum does not rotate around the old flagellum</title><p id="P10">In <italic>L. mexicana</italic> promastigotes the single flagellum remains assembled throughout the cell cycle with the new flagellum growing alongside, as is typical of trypanosomatid parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>; 2013). Consistent with previous light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>), the old flagellum length was variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). By the end of the cell cycle, the new flagellum length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>) did not reach that of the old, with flagellum growth therefore continuing after cytokinesis.</p><p id="P11">In <italic>T. brucei</italic> trypomastigotes the new flagellum extends into the existing flagellar pocket on the anterior side of the existing flagellum. The basal body and new flagellum then rotate around the old flagellum to position the new flagellum towards the posterior of the cell. This rotation occurs prior to the new flagellum extending out of the flagellar pocket and flagellar pocket duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lacomble et al. 2010</xref>). Here, we investigated if this rotation occurs during new flagellum growth in <italic>L. mexicana.</italic> The axoneme, paraflagellar rod and flagellar pocket were segmented in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The paraflagellar rod is always positioned alongside microtubule doublets 4-7 of the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vickerman 1962</xref>) and the paraflagellar rod is present on axonemes within the flagellar pocket neck of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sunter et al. 2019</xref>). Therefore, we used this feature as a positional marker. The new flagellum was always positioned next to the side of the old flagellum with the PFR (Stage 2 - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; Stage 3 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) indicating that new flagellum rotation does not occur in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and suggests that this phenomenon is restricted to parasites with a trypomastigote morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lacomble et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2013</xref>). This raised a further question regarding the timing of flagellar pocket duplication relative to the elongation of the new flagellum. The new flagellum extended into the existing flagellar pocket bulbous domain in Stage 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In Stage 3, the new flagellum exited the existing flagellar pocket, but flagellar pocket duplication had not occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The first morphological indicator of flagellar pocket duplication was seen in Stage 4 cells, with a ridge of cytoplasm invading the bulbous domain of the existing flagellar pocket between the old and new flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; arrow). This cytoplasmic ridge has previously been observed in <italic>T. brucei</italic> flagellar pocket duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lacomble et al. 2010</xref>). Prior to the ridge forming, the old and the new flagellum share the same flagellar pocket exit point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; Stage 2-3). Whilst the ridge is forming from the base of the flagellar pocket, the exit point of the flagellar pocket was still shared by the two flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; Stage 4). Two separate exit points for each flagellum were first observed in Stage 5 cells, indicating completion of flagellar pocket duplication by this cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; Stage 5). This sharing and separation between the new and old flagellum exit points can also be seen by whole mount negative staining of the cytoskeleton of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). This shows that flagellar pocket duplication occurs in two stages with the division of the bulbous domain by the cytoplasmic ridge followed by the division of the flagellar pocket neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Halliday et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P12">At the distal tip of the flagellum, we observed an elaborate cap structure that has previously been identified in other trypanosomatid parasites including <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Woolley, Gadelha, and Gull 2006</xref>). The cap structure consisted of two annuli, one associated with the central pair that sits inside the outer doublets that are capped by a second annuli. The annulus associated with the central pair is readily observable in whole mount cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). This elaborate cap structure is only present on the old flagellum and is therefore added post-assembly, with a potential role in beat regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Woolley, Gadelha, and Gull 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Contractile vacuole and Golgi Body re-position during the cell cycle</title><p id="P13">Our data confirmed there was a single contractile vacuole and Golgi Body located close to the flagellar pocket in Stage 1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), supporting our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wheeler et al. 2016</xref>). During the cell cycle, one additional contractile vacuole and Golgi Body were observed. A second contractile vacuole was first visible in Stage 2 and a second Golgi Body in Stage 3. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The appearance of the second contractile vacuole along with the new flagellum are therefore the earliest ultrastructural changes we identified. The second contractile vacuole and Golgi Body initially appeared alongside the existing organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, during Stage 4, a single contractile vacuole and Golgi Body were located next to each separate flagellar pocket bulbous domain, such that there was a pairing of contractile vacuole and Golgi Body to be inherited by each daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We were unable to identify which contractile vacuole/Golgi Body pair re-positioned with the new flagellum in Stages 2-4 because flagella pocket division had not yet occurred. However, there was a clear difference in volume between the old and new flagellum-associated contractile vacuole in Stage 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, this shows that as the cytoplasmic ridge ingresses to segregate the flagellar pocket bulbous domains, each bulbous domain acquires a dedicated contractile vacuole/Golgi Body pair, indicating that each bulbous domain has the potential to be endo/exocytically active at this point.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Multi-copy organelles increase in number and overall volume during the cell cycle</title><p id="P14">Multi-copy organelles such as lipid bodies, glycosomes and acidocalcisomes also need to duplicate through the cell cycle.

Nuclear volume and surface area increased up to Stage 5, after which the two nuclei were the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>).

Given the surface area of this bridge region was 1.8 ± 2 μm<sup>2</sup> (n=6 Stage 5 cells) and the average number of nuclear pores per membrane surface area was ∼2±0.62 per μm<sup>2</sup> at Stage 5, we would expect to see ∼4 pores within the bridge and in the 6 bridges examined we only saw 3 nuclear pores in total (<italic>p</italic>=0.01046, Mann-Whitney U test). This suggests there is a potential exclusion mechanism to ensure the nuclear bridge is devoid of nuclear pores or that nuclear pores are quickly disassembled at the centre of the dividing nucleus, just before this region narrows down and becomes a noticeably ‘bridge-like’.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mitochondrion retains a complex structure throughout the cell cycle</title><p id="P18">The ER and mitochondrion are large networks that must grow and segregate during the cell cycle. The ER network was more concentrated along the periphery of the cell body and extended along its length, with clear reticulated regions connecting to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J-L</xref>). This correlates with the location of the sub-pellicular microtubules. Indeed, this was observed with serial section tomography showing ER intercalating between the sub-pellicular microtubules (n=7 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M, N</xref>). This tight associated of the ER and the sub-pellicular microtubules may play a role in ensuring ER inheritance during cell division.</p><p id="P19">The single mitochondrion forms a network of interconnected loops and branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4O</xref>), with the volume and surface area of the mitochondrion increasing from Stage 1 to 5, peaking at Stage 5 after replication and segregation of the kDNA was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4P, Q</xref>). Mitochondrial segregation was accompanied by a reorganisation of the network in Stage 5 cells. An enlarged region of the mitochondrion was positioned along the anterior-posterior division fold, with projections of the mitochondrial network extending into the two regions of the cell body that will form the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4R</xref>). In our dataset, the mitochondrion was the last organelle to divide with only 50% (n=6 cells) of Stage 6 cells containing two independent mitochondria.

The first step cytokinesis is the in-folding of the cell membrane to form a division fold, as previously seen in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler et al. 2013</xref>). This was seen in Stage 4 and later cells with the in-folding of the cell surface occurring centrally along the anterior to posterior axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Fold formation occurred symmetrically via an in-folding from both sides of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>; arrows). Furrow formation is first visible in Stage 6, and is more pronounced in Stage 7 cells, progressing unidirectionally from between the two flagellar pockets at the anterior end of the cell towards the posterior. Furrow progression is accompanied by the twisting of the two daughter cells away from each other, generating the characteristic posterior cell tip to tip of late cytokinetic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We noted that Stage 1 cells also appeared to contain a fold, which we speculated might be from a previous cytokinesis event. Stage 1 cells do not have a circular cross section and instead have a characteristic set of indentations with a central ridge along one side of the cell body that is generated by the resolution of the cytokinesis fold and furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, E</xref>; arrow). This fold was not present in Stage 2 cells, suggesting that as the cell body elongates microtubule rearrangement occurs to generate a cell with a circular cross-section and resolve the cytokinesis fold. As SBF-SEM does not have the sufficient resolution to visualise and reliably track sub-pellicular microtubules, we reconstructed the sub-pellicular cortex of whole cells by serial section electron tomography to reconstruct whole cells at ∼2 nm resolution. Reconstructed whole cells required a large number of sequential dual-axis tomograms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supple. Figure 2</xref>). Thus, we focused on examining the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2, to investigate the microtubule rearrangements that lead to ridge disappearance. We reconstructed two Stage 1 cells that did not contain a new flagellum and one Stage 2 cell where there was a short new flagellum within the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supple. Figure 2</xref>). Tracing of the microtubules from the serial section tomograms revealed a parallel array of evenly spaced microtubules, with no discontinuities such as microtubule crossovers or double layers of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). The microtubules lay in a weakly right-handed helical configuration, with a pitch of ∼20 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with our data and others, the cell body length increased from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Intriguingly microtubule number decreased as the cell elongated, but the overall length of the microtubules increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G, H</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The whole cell microtubule models clearly showed the characteristic ridge and double indentation matching that formed by resolution of the division fold and furrow seen by SBF-SEM, indicating that the underlying microtubules were part of its formation. Within the ridge portion of the double indentation, we identified a line of microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). To better visualise the microtubule organisation, we ‘unwrapped’ the microtubules around the midline of the cell along its long axis, producing quantitative schematics of where microtubules start and end within the reconstructed cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). A cluster of anomalously short microtubules starting near the cell anterior but not reaching far to the cell posterior was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>; seam). This was visible as a converging line of microtubule ends in the 3D microtubule organisation of the Stage 1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). As the only discontinuity in an overall otherwise homogenous array we referred to this as a ‘seam’ in Stage 1 cells, which was resolved by Stage 2. Importantly this seam is at the correct position to represent a ‘scar’ of the line of furrow ingression from the previous cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Cell body volume occupied by lipid bodies was 6-fold higher in sand fly derived promastigotes</title><p id="P23">We wanted to extend our analysis to <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes in the sand fly, as they experience the natural environment with different energetic and metabolic pressures to those in culture, which could be reflected in their 3D cellular organisation. We chose to examine parasites from a late stage infection at the stomodeal valve, as this gives a good number of parasites which are likely furthest removed from <italic>in vitro</italic> log phase promastigotes, giving the most extreme of comparisons. We analysed a 10-day post infection <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infected sand fly midgut SBF-SEM dataset containing 218 slices, which covered part of the stomodeal valve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yanase et al. 2023</xref>, EMPIAR-11463) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In total, 10 random cells whose whole cell body and flagellum were laying within the dataset and their flagellum not attached to the stomodeal valve, were segmented and the volume and number of organelles - the flagellum, flagellar pocket, mitochondrion, acidocalcisomes and lipid bodies – were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Glycosomes, contractile vacuole, Golgi Body and ER were partially reconstructed in some cells but were not included in this analysis because of low contrast staining leading to lower resolution of the SBF-SEM dataset captured from a sand fly infection, compared with the <italic>in vitro</italic> promastigote dataset.</p><p id="P24">Previous studies have defined different promastigote stages in sand fly infections using morphological criteria including cell body and flagellum length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bates 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Rogers, Chance, and Bates 2002</xref>). Using these criteria, we identified ten leptomonad promastigotes in our dataset ranging from 5.6 - 13.3 µm in cell body length, with flagella ranging from 5 - 21 µm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, D</xref>).

Overall, the promastigotes found in the stomodeal valve of the sand fly were significantly smaller in cell body volume, surface area and nucleus volume, while cell body surface to volume ratio was significantly higher, in comparison to Stage 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-H</xref>). Acidocalcisomes and lipid bodies were also distributed throughout the cell body in the leptomonad promastigotes, similar to the culture promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>, 3D-F). When we examined the numbers and volumes of acidocalcisomes and lipid bodies we also saw differences between the leptomonad and <italic>in vitro</italic> promastigotes.

We showed that initiation of assembly of the new flagellum is one of the first events in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell cycle, while at the end of the cell cycle the resolution of the sub-pellicular microtubules leaves a characteristic seam defined by the ends of shorter microtubules.</p><p id="P26">In the cell cycle, the first ultrastructural change we identified was the assembly of the new flagellum within the flagellar pocket and the appearance of a second contractile vacuole, which also coincided with an increase in nuclear and kinetoplast volume, indicating that S phase had likely begun.

From this and being aware of the limitations of previous experimental approaches used, it is likely that S phase, new flagellum assembly, new microtubule quartet and contractile vacuole duplication are initiated at a similar time in the cell cycle. This is consistent with our previous tomographic analysis of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> flagellum attachment zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wheeler, Sunter, and Gull 2016</xref>). The maturation of the basal body early in the cell cycle of both <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> suggests that cell cycle initiation in these organisms is similar and potentially reliant on common regulatory molecules such as the mitotic arrest deficient 2 protein (MAD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Akiyoshi 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Previous analyses of the cell cycle of different <italic>Leishmania</italic> species by light microscopy have shown variation in whether kinetoplast division precedes nucleus division or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Simpson and Kretzer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambit et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Minocha et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). In this study, we observed the kinetoplast starting to divide before the nucleus as we classed late mitotic cells as having one nucleus as they were still connected via the mitotic bridge membrane. This bridge is not easily visible via light microscopy methods, so there is the potential for such a cell to appear to have two separate nuclei when imaged using DNA stains and light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2011</xref>). Yet, both these approaches are based purely on morphology and the regulators and the timing of their appearance remain unknown in <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p><p id="P28">In organisms including <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which divide their nucleus via closed mitosis, the nuclear envelope needs to be resolved and segregated between two independent nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bianchi et al. 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Triemer, Fritz, and Herman 1986</xref>). We found that, in the narrow bridge formed between the mitotic nuclei there was a reduction in the number of nuclear pores. This aligns with recent work in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that showed the composition of the nuclear pore complex changed during nuclear envelope resolution; nuclear pore exclusion in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is therefore likely important for the resolution of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Varberg et al. 2022</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>T. brucei</italic> the protein Closed Mitosis Protein 1 was shown to be important for nuclear envelope resolution and localised to mitotic nuclear bridge on the nuclear envelope and this may be related to the nuclear pore exclusion phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Billington et al. 2023</xref>).

Little is known about how the sub-pellicular microtubule array undergoes re-modelling to accommodate these cell body changes. However, the preference for long, near whole cell length, microtubules in Stage 2 cells indicates that cell shortening for cytokinesis and differentiation to amastigotes must involve microtubule depolymerisation. Perhaps the shorter amastigote cell body is generated by division. Unlike for <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we do not have whole cell 3D mapping of all sub-pellicular microtubules for any other trypanosomatid. However, light microscopy evidence suggests that, during cell division, <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> add new microtubules to the existing subpellicular array rather than depolymerisation of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sherwin and Gull 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Sheriff, Lim, and He 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sinclair and de Graffenried 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We discovered that pre-abscission cells (Stage 7) have a double indentation and ridge of the cell membrane, which is present in daughter cells after the cytokinesis furrow has processed along the anterior to posterior axis. This double membrane indentation and ridge is also present in Stage 1 cells but was resolved by Stage 2. In Stage 1 cells, we observed by electron tomography a seam along which short microtubule ends meet and this discontinuity in the otherwise uniform sub-pellicular microtubule array is likely to be partially responsible for the ridge and double membrane indentation of the cell membrane we observed in Stage 1 cells. Consistent with this seam contributing to the double membrane indentation these short microtubules were resolved by Stage 2, when the ridge and indentations also disappear. Overall, this points to the preferred growth of microtubules in the cleavage furrow from anterior to posterior as the cytokinesis furrow is formed. The retention of these indentations in the cell body post cytokinesis and the microtubule seam is analogous to what has been described in budding yeast where the mother retains a bud scar and the daughter cell a birth scar post cytokinesis, though it has yet to be determined in <italic>Leishmania</italic> whether a permanent molecular remnant is associated with this seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Powell, Quain, and Smart 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Our data showed that the first step in flagellar pocket division was the invasion of the cytoplasmic ridge between the old and new flagella and this ridge was also observed in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, suggesting its formation is likely important for the flagellar pocket division in many kinetoplastid parasites. In <italic>T. brucei</italic> the new flagellum rotates around the old flagellum, bending the flagellar pocket membrane around the microtubule quartet, which contributes to flagellar pocket division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lacomble et al. 2010</xref>). Yet, we showed that this rotation does not occur in <italic>Leishmania</italic>; therefore, the invasion of the cytoplasmic ridge is likely the dominant mechanism for the division of the flagellar pocket bulbous domain. This difference in flagellar pocket division between <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> reflects their liberform and juxtaform morphologies and the requirement of <italic>T. brucei</italic> to position its new flagellum to the posterior of the old one, with the rotation a juxtaform adaptation not found in the ancestral form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wheeler, Gluenz, and Gull 2013</xref>). At the point the cytoplasmic ridge was observed in the flagellar pocket (Stage 4), the new flagellum had already extended beyond the cell body. This means the new flagellum shares the flagellar pocket neck region and exit point with the old flagellum. The duplication of the flagellar pocket and neck structures must therefore occur through a semi-conservative mechanism, with new molecular components integrated into an existing structure. Moreover, this suggests that flagellar pocket segregation likely occurs through a two-step process, with the bulbous domain dividing first through the continual invasion of the cytoplasmic ridge, followed the division of the neck region.</p><p id="P32"><italic>Leishmania</italic> undergo a series of morphologically and functionally distinct developmental stages in the sand fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dostálová and Volf 2012</xref>).

Figure 2).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Electron tomography data capture</title><p id="P40">Transmission electron micrographs of tilt series for tomographic reconstruction were captured on a Tecnai TF-30 at 300 kV electron acceleration voltage using a 2048×2048 Gatan CCD, at a magnification of 23.2 Å/px. Images were captured at 1° steps from −65° to +65° using Serial EM, recording the location of each field of view using the navigator (coordinate recording) function and location map images. Where necessary, up to three overlapping fields of view were captured per section to cover the entire cell. The sample was then removed, the grid rotated 90° in the sample holder, the navigator coordinates remapped to account for sample rotation, the same fields of view identified assisted by the navigator function, then precise field locations identified by registration of a test image to 90° rotated copy of the map images. A second tilt series was then captured, with the tilt axis perpendicular to the first – with the exception of a few sections where electron beam-induced damage led to loss of that grid region prior to capture of the second axis.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Electron tomography reconstruction</title><p id="P41">Tomographic reconstruction of individual tilt series were made using the “Build Tomogram” project function of eTomo, part of IMOD. Fiducialless reconstructions were made of each tilt axis, before aligning the tomogram from the second tilt axis to the first, and averaging into a dual axis tomogram. The second axis typically showed an electron beam-induced sample shrinkage of ∼10%. For sections captured with multiple overlapping tomographic volumes, these were subsequently montaged using the “Blend Montages” project function of eTomo, using the field of view captured first as the reference volume for alignment. Finally, the sample sections within the tomographic volumes were flattened using the “Flatten Volume” tool of eTomo.</p><p id="P42">For alignment of serial tomograms, extremely precise local alignment was necessary to track sub-pellicular microtubules separated by only ∼20 nm. The “Join Serial Tomograms” project function of eTomo was found to be inadequate: Subtle section warping, likely from a combination of variation in electron beam induced sample shrinkage and local mechanical deformation from ultramicrotomy depending on local sample properties, necessitated custom alignment. Matched reference points at the top and bottom of sequential tomographic volumes, typically microtubules in flagella, sub-pellicular microtubules in neighbouring cells and mitochondrial cristae, were marked across the tomogram. Delaunay triangulation was used to split the image into triangular regions, and the position of the bounding reference points of each triangular region in the two tomograms were used to calculate the necessary affine transformation to warp that region of one tomogram to align with the other. This warping was applied to each triangle in the plane parallel to the section at all depths (i.e. in x, y, without affecting z), using custom ImageJ macros.</p><p id="P43">To align all sections, a central reference tomographic volume was selected. In the tomograms above and below that section, reference points were identified, triangulated and the neighbouring tomogram warped to align it to the reference section. Working up and down, reference points to the next section were identified, triangulated and the neighbouring tomogram warped, etc. For each warping step, reference points from structures in neighbouring cells were strongly prioritised over structures in the cell of interest, to avoid biasing subsequent joining of traced sub-pellicular microtubules between sections. Finally, the tomographic volumes from sequential sections were stacked into a single volume for the whole cell, with an estimated 10 to 20 nm depth lost between sections from the action of the diamond knife.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Sub-pellicular microtubule modelling from tomographic volumes</title><p id="P44">Microtubules in the sub-pellicular array were traced and a 3D model generated using 3Dmod, part of IMOD. First, sub-pellicular microtubules were traced as open contours in the tomographic volumes from each serial section separately. Comprehensive identification of microtubules was confirmed by the expected regular ∼20 nm spacing across the cell. Microtubule tracing was possible in all regions except a small volume of the anterior of cell 1, where a region of the sub-pellicular array lay perpendicular to the tilt axis and perpendicular to the imaging plane of the camera leading to insufficient z resolution to identify individual microtubules.</p><p id="P45">Traced microtubules were joined across serial sections based on both proximity, i.e. the microtubule is in the same place in the two sections, and trajectory, i.e. making that join does not introduce a sharp kink or bend in the microtubule. A consistent approach was used to avoid bias. First, the traces of microtubules which could be unambiguously identified in both sections were joined. In order of preference: 1) based on distinctive nearby non-sub-pellicular microtubule features, like nearby ER or mitochondrial structures. 2) based on distinctive folds or curves in the sub-pellicular array, particularly where there is a sharp bend with two or three protruding microtubules. 3) based on variation in microtubule spacing, where a distinctive narrow or wide spacing can be seen in both sections. Having made joins between sections at these unambiguous sites, this provides ‘landmark’ joins at many positions around cell perimeter. The intervening microtubules can then be joined. On the basis that microtubule starts and ends were rare within the tomographic volumes, joins were made which minimised the number of necessary microtubule starts and ends falling in the lost volume between sections.</p><p id="P46">To map microtubule lengths cell-wide, microtubules in each serial section tomogram needed to be correctly joined across the 7 to 11 300 nm serial sections, between which a small depth (∼10-20 nm) is lost, ∼5% of the cell volume. We therefore carefully considered our strategy for microtubule joining. Based on the cell circumference and even ∼20 nm microtubule spacing, we expected ∼100 to 150 microtubules around the widest point of each cell. As ∼5% of the cell volume is lost between sections, microtubule starts and ends lost in this lost volume should be 20× rarer than starts and ends visible within sections, yet in-section starts and ends were rare. Therefore, microtubule starts and ends lost between sections must be extremely rare, implying the subpellicular microtubules must be long and the correct between-section joins should introduce a minimum number of microtubule starts and ends. Following this strategy, and using advanced section-section alignment, we build high confidence model of all microtubules in the three cells.</p><p id="P47">Therefore, where the same number of microtubules lay between these landmarks in both sections, this implies no microtubule starts/ends in the between section space and therefore join the traces of these microtubules, while monitoring for anomalously large disjoints. Where the number of microtubules between two landmarks differed between two sections, then a best effort from proximity and trajectory was made to identify which microtubule(s) started/ended within the section. Only very close to the cell anterior or posterior were cases identified where multiple nearby microtubules seemed to start/end within the between section space – these were more likely to be erroneously joined, however any error here does not affect the major conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Negative staining protocol</title><p id="P48">For preparation of whole-mount promastigote cytoskeleton samples, 8 ml of log phase promastigotes (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation (800g for 10 min) and resuspended in 500 µl of M199. 8 µl of cell resuspension was added to a glow-discharged formvar and carbon-coated 200 mesh nickel grid and left for 2 min.

The unique seams in the two Stage 1 cells are visible as neighbouring microtubules with ends far from the cell posterior.

(A) Organelles are modelled using the following colours: cell body (grey), old flagellum (black), new flagellum (orange), nucleus (blue), kinetoplast (blue) mitochondrion (yellow), acidocalcisomes (dark purple), lipid bodies (red), glycosomes (pale green), contractile vacuole (dark blue), Golgi Body (purple), ER (pink), cytoplasmic spur in the flagellar pocket (red). Black dashed line represents the division fold and furrow forming along the anterior-posterior axis of the cell body. Blue dashed lines on the nuclear envelope represent nuclear pores. Stage 1 represents a G1 cell. The cell enters S-phase in Stage 2 and a new flagellum is assembled within the flagellar pocket and the contractile vacuole duplicates. The new flagellum grows in length and extends out of the flagellar pocket in Stage 3. The Golgi Body duplicates and the nucleus enters mitosis. In Stage 4 the kinetoplast begins to undergo division. During Stage 5, the kinetoplast has divided and the nucleus is in the process of nuclear division. A cytoplasmic spur forms within the existing flagellar pocket to divide the flagellar pocket between the old and new flagellum. One contractile vacuole and Golgi Body appears either side of the dividing flagellar pocket. A division fold forms along the anterior-posteriors axis, pinching the cell body into two nascent daughter cell morphologies. In Stage 6, two separate nuclei and kinetoplast are present and the flagellar pocket has divided. Lipid bodies, acidocalcisomes, glycosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum segregate between the two nascent daughter cells. The mitochondrion is the last organelle is segregate. During Stage 7, the cell body undergoes cytokinesis which gives rise to one daughter cell which inherits the old flagellum and one daughter cell inheriting the new flagellum.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191814-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
