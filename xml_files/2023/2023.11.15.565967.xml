Here we describe “TDP-REG”, a precision medicine approach primarily for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which exploits the cryptic splicing events that occur in cells with TDP-43 loss-of-function (TDP-LOF) in order to drive expression specifically in diseased cells. In addition to modifying existing cryptic exons for this purpose, we develop a deep-learning-powered algorithm for generating customisable cryptic splicing events, which can be embedded within virtually any coding sequence. By placing part of a coding sequence within a novel cryptic exon, we tightly couple protein expression to TDP-LOF. Protein expression is activated by TDP-LOF <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, including TDP-LOF induced by cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation. In addition to generating a variety of fluorescent and luminescent reporters, we use this system to perform TDP-LOF-dependent genomic prime editing to ablate the <italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic donor splice site. Furthermore, we design a panel of tightly gated, autoregulating vectors encoding a TDP-43/Raver1 fusion protein, which rescue key pathological cryptic splicing events. In summary, we combine deep-learning and rational design to create sophisticated splicing sensors, resulting in a platform that provides far safer therapeutics for neurodegeneration, potentially even enabling preemptive treatment of at-risk individuals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease. In 97% of cases, there is pronounced formation of neuronal cytoplasmic aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Further, such pathology is found in ~45% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, and is also observed in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting TDP-43 mediated RNA dysregulation is a critical element in many neurodegenerative diseases and therefore a promising clinical target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">TDP-43 plays a crucial role in the regulation of splicing, protecting the transcriptome from the inclusion of toxic “cryptic exons” (CEs), which are rarely detected in healthy cells, but become prominently expressed upon TDP-LOF; CEs typically introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) into transcripts, preventing the expression of crucial proteins including STMN2 and UNC13A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We and others previously showed that genetic modulation of even a single specific cryptic exon can influence disease progression, meaning the stage in which cryptic exons are expressed is within the therapeutic window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Numerous preclinical studies aim to reduce TDP-43-associated toxicity, for example via blocking cryptic exon inclusion using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or transgenes, or by targeting the aggregation process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">A major barrier to bringing gene therapy approaches to the clinic is the lack of methods to tightly regulate transgene expression. Only a small fraction of motor neurons, let alone all neurons, display clear pathology at any given time in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Therefore, a conventional targeting approach (for example, combining an AAV serotype with CNS-tropism with a neuronal promoter) would result in expression of the therapeutic transgene in a vast number of non-degenerating cells. Such expression is not merely unnecessary, but could actually worsen prognosis by interfering with the homeostasis of otherwise healthy cells, especially given the permanent nature of these approaches. Such concerns recently led to the development of therapeutics with activity-dependent transcriptional promoters for epilepsy; however, it is unclear how a similar promoter-based approach could be applied to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we leverage our understanding of TDP-43’s regulation of splicing together with deep-learning-based splicing prediction tools to generate gene therapy vectors featuring novel cryptic splice sites. Crucially, whereas pathological cryptic splicing blocks protein expression, our vectors explicitly require the use of the cryptic splice site(s) to express the encoded transgene. This approach limits expression of transgenes to cells with TDP-LOF, which co-occurs with TDP-43 aggregation in patients, thus greatly reducing the risk of off-target side-effects. In addition to demonstrating highly effective TDP-LOF-dependent expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we apply this approach to two candidate ALS/FTD gene therapies, paving the way towards safer and more efficacious treatments for these devastating diseases.</p><sec id="S1"><title>TDP-REGv1: Modification of ALS/FTD cryptic exons for TDP-43-regulated expression vectors</title><p id="P6">Numerous TDP-43-regulated CEs have been reproducibly detected in cellular and animal models, showing high specificity for TDP-LOF; furthermore, a number of these, including CEs in <italic>STMN2, UNC13A, HDGFL2</italic> and <italic>AARS1</italic>, have been found specifically within neurons with TDP-43 pathology in post-mortem ALS and FTD samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). We reasoned that if configured in a suitable manner, a cryptic exon with these features could be used to regulate expression of a therapeutic or reporter transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We identified the cryptic exon in the <italic>AARS1</italic> gene (hg38: chr16:70272796-70272882) as the most suitable candidate owing to its reproducible detection, its lack of stop codons in at least one frame, and its short, defined TDP-43 binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). To make it suitable for use within a frame-shifting “minigene”, we added an extra residue to the cryptic exon to cause frame-shifting, and removed sections of the flanking introns that were likely unnecessary for regulation by TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then placed this sequence between an upstream start codon and downstream transgene such that only when the cryptic exon was included would the start codon be in-frame with the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We included a P2A “self-cleavage” site so that the upstream peptide encoded by the CE is released separately from the main protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we added a constitutively-spliced intron derived from <italic>RPS24</italic> to promote nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in the event that a PTC is encountered.</p><p id="P7">To test if this system restricted expression to cells with TDP-LOF, we used mCherry as the transgene. This reporter construct, along with a positive control in which the cryptic exon sequence is constitutively expressed, was transfected into SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line) with doxycycline-inducible TDP-43 knockdown. A &gt;16-fold increase in mCherry expression was detected in cells with TDP-43 knockdown when using the cryptic construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). In agreement with this, Nanopore sequencing revealed a &gt;43-fold increase in cryptic exon inclusion upon TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). We noted that in cells with normal TDP-43 levels, mild leaky expression of mCherry protein was detectable, even though cryptic exon inclusion was less than 0.5%, suggesting a mechanism of protein translation that circumvents the presence of the upstream frameshift. Using western blotting, we observed low-level leaky expression even in a vector in which the cryptic exon is deleted, potentially due to use of alternative transcriptional start sites or leaky ribosomal scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>TDP-REGv2: Creation of de novo cryptic splicing sequences</title><p id="P8">We reasoned that if new CEs could be created within the transgene-encoding region of the vector, this would remove any risk of leaky expression when the CE is spliced out because the full, uninterrupted transgene coding sequence would not be present in the mature mRNA. Further, this approach would avoid expression of unwanted upstream peptides and reduce the vector size. In pilot tests, we found that the <italic>AARS1-</italic>derived cryptic exon could be replaced with other sequences, and that the cryptic exon strength of these sequences correlated with SpliceAI splicing predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Encouraged by this, we built a deep-learning-driven <italic>in silico</italic> directed evolution algorithm, <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>, to design <italic>de novo</italic> TDP-43-regulated cryptic cassette exons or single cryptic splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). TDP-43 preferentially binds to stretches of UG-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We therefore programmed <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> to incorporate different types of UG-rich regions into our designs, including upstream UG-repeats (as in <italic>AARS1</italic>), downstream UG-repeats (as in <italic>Sars</italic>), upstream and downstream repeats (as in <italic>Smg5</italic>) or UG-rich regions without extended UG-repeats (as in <italic>UNC13A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To create single-intron vectors, which can be smaller than those based on CEs flanked by two introns, we modified our algorithm to design candidate alternative 5’ or alternative 3’ splice sites, which compete with the designed cryptic splice site to aid TDP-43-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In each case, the single intron was heavily enriched for TDP-43 binding sites; for alternative 3’ splice sites, the algorithm optimised part of the coding sequence to produce a polypyrimidine rich region. Using <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>, we also attempted to design variants exhibiting TDP-43-regulated intron retention (IR) by specifying lower SpliceAI scores (i.e. weaker splice sites) combined with a single UG-rich intron.</p><p id="P10">Of the 27 designs that were tested in HEK293 cells (immortalised human embryonic kidney cells) which explored the full range of possible design parameters, 13 gave a significant increase in expression upon TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-H</xref>). Many constructs achieved greater dynamic range than our initial <italic>AARS1</italic>-based design, with two constructs achieving &gt;100-fold increase in expression upon TDP-43 knockdown. The maximal expression level varied greatly across constructs, from &gt;100-fold less to greater than the positive control, thus demonstrating that expression can be fine-tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Seven of the successful designs were further tested in an SH-SY5Y cell line (human neuroblastoma cell line) with inducible TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), which yielded very similar results, demonstrating that the splicing regulation of these vectors is robust across cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3B-C</xref>). In order to demonstrate that the splicing regulation was due specifically to TDP-43 depletion, we co-transfected a selection of the above constructs into SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) cells with TDP-43 knockdown, together with either functional TDP-43/Raver1 fusion protein, which has been shown to rescue TDP-LOF, or an inactive TDP-43/Raver1 fusion protein that lacks ability to bind RNA (“2FL”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Cells co-transfected with the 2FL mutant exhibited greatly increased fluorescence compared to cells co-transfected with functional TDP-43/Raver1, confirming the key role of TDP-43 in regulating the splicing of our TDP-REG constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Multiple cryptic exons further increase specificity</title><p id="P12">Several TDP-REGv2 constructs showed remarkable specificity, but there could be therapeutic approaches, e.g. involving genome editing, where leaky expression is extremely undesirable. We therefore examined whether multiple cryptic exons could be included within the same construct, further reducing the risk of leaky expression. We used <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> to design a construct encoding Cre recombinase enzyme split across seven exons, three of which were cryptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Nanopore sequencing revealed that in untreated cells, a small proportion of transcripts featured one or two cryptic exons, but &lt;0.05% of transcripts featured all three cryptic exons, whereas shTDP cells expressed all three cryptic exons &gt;10% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>); using multiple cryptic exons thus further decreased the risk of leaky expression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TDP-REG is activated by TDP-LOF <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P13">Having demonstrated our constructs are functional in multiple cell lines, we examined whether they are also functional <italic>in vivo</italic> in mammalian spinal cord, the main target of ALS therapeutic approaches. We injected AAVs (PHP.eB serotype with hSynapsin promoter) containing TDP-REGv1 mCherry or TDP-REGv2 mScarlet (construct #7) into TDP-43 conditional knockout (cKO) mice (TDP-43<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>;Chat-Cre<sup>+/wt</sup>), where TDP-43 loss was driven by a ChAT Cre driver line and therefore directed, within the spinal cord, to motor neurons and other spinal cholinergic cells.</p><p id="P14">We observed striking expression of mCherry or mScarlet in the motor neurons of these mice, with at least 50% of identified motor neurons having clear expression in all but one case for each construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, 3C, 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4A</xref>). By contrast, control mice (TDP-43<sup>Fl/wt</sup>;Chat-Cre<sup>+/wt</sup>) displayed very little expression of mCherry, with between 0% and 2% of identified motor neurons having detectable mCherry or mScarlet expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, 3D, 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4A</xref>). A positive control mScarlet AAV (i.e. without TDP-REG) showed no such specificity when injected into control mice, instead strongly expressing mScarlet in the majority of TDP-43-positive motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TDP-43 aggregation activates TDP-REG expression</title><p id="P15">In the above experiments, TDP-43 pathology was simulated by silencing TDP-43 expression. Next, we tested whether our vectors could be activated by TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation, which would more accurately simulate the disease process. We co-transfected our reporters (and an mGreenLantern transfection control) into HEK293T cells with an aggregation-prone version of TDP-43 in which the Q/N-rich domain is repeated twelve times (SNAP-TDP-43-12QN), or with a vector expressing Halo-tag as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We observed strong expression of mScarlet induced by SNAP-TDP-43-12QN but not by Halo-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that, in a subset of cells, SNAP-TDP-43-12QN was highly expressed and heavily enriched in the cytoplasm, activating TDP-REG mScarlet (construct #7) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G-H</xref>). TDP-REG is functional <italic>in vivo</italic> and is activated by TDP-43 aggregation, strongly suggesting this approach will function within ALS/FTD patients.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Application of TDP-REG to biomarker expression</title><p id="P16">Next, we sought to apply TDP-REG to translationally-relevant systems. Although TDP-LOF is an established key feature of ALS progression, there is a lack of tools to detect it in cell and animal models of disease, thus limiting preclinical studies. Our fluorescent reporters described above offer a solution to detect TDP-LOF in cell studies though live imaging or FACS. We also decided to generate a sensitive luminescent biomarker that could potentially be adapted to monitor TDP-LOF in organoid and animal models. We fused the Gaussia Princeps luciferase (Gluc) sequence downstream of the <italic>AARS1-</italic>based minigene described above (TDP-REGv1), and in parallel also used <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> to create five vectors encoding Gluc with an internal, synthetic cryptic exon (TDP-REGv2). Nanopore sequencing revealed that all of these vectors featured increased CE PSI (percentage spliced in) upon TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5A</xref>). Both the TDP-REGv1 vector and the best TDP-REGv2 vectors featured high CE inclusion upon TDP-43 knockdown with minimal leakiness, but the best-performing TDP-REGv2 vector had better dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>): it led to &gt;200-fold increase in Gluc expression upon TDP-43 knockdown in SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) cells, and had negligible expression in cells without TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>TDP-REG tightly regulates genome editing</title><p id="P17">We explored the possibility of minimising the toxicity associated with TDP-LOF by performing genome editing to remove cryptic splice sites. The Prime Editing (PE) approach, which avoids the need for highly mutagenic double-stranded breaks, can be adapted for high-efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> editing of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, even PE can lead to unwanted editing events that could potentially be toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Using <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>, we therefore designed a TDP-REGv2 vector encoding an optimised PE construct (“PE-Max”) where part of the Cas9 sequence was encoded by a novel CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Via RT-PCR and western blotting, we confirmed that the CE had near-undetectable leaky expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then designed a pegRNA to edit the donor splice site of the <italic>UNC13A</italic> cryptic exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), combined with a nicking sgRNA to improve editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We tested editing efficiency with or without TDP-43 knockdown in SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) cells. The constitutive PE-Max vector led to editing regardless of TDP-43 knockdown, whereas the CE-containing vector tightly restricted editing to cells with TDP-43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Thus, TDP-REG can ensure that genome editing occurs only in cells where it is beneficial, minimising the potential for off-target effects when delivered to all cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>TDP-REG can enable autoregulated splicing rescue</title><p id="P19">Finally, we used our system to directly rescue TDP-LOF. Fusions of TDP-43 to a less aggregation-prone splicing repressor domain (e.g. from <italic>RAVER1</italic>) can partially rescue TDP-43 splicing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, even small imbalances in TDP-43 expression can cause significant toxicity, and therefore in spite of its lesser aggregation, generalised expression of TDP-43/Raver1 fusions is undesirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We therefore used <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> to design TDP-REGv2 constructs encoding TDP-43 fused to the <italic>Raver1</italic> splicing repressor domain (TDP-REGv2:Raver1) featuring an internal CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). To ensure that expression of the synthetic CE occurred upon even a mild decrease in TDP-43 function, thus enabling rescue at the first signs of TDP-43 pathology, we specified high SpliceAI scores (60-100%) for the CE splice sites and used short UG-repeats to limit the binding affinity of the introns to TDP-43.</p><p id="P20">Using RT-PCR, we analysed the splicing of our constructs, with or without endogenous TDP-43 knockdown. TDP-43/Raver1 fusion protein mimics TDP-43’s splicing repressor function and would therefore be expected to autoregulate by inhibiting expression of the synthetic CEs in these constructs. Whilst this is a great advantage therapeutically, as it would prevent overexpression of TDP-43/Raver1, it could also mask the responsiveness of our synthetic CEs to TDP-LOF during these initial tests. We therefore used a 2FL mutant during these initial screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). All but one construct displayed detectable CE expression upon TDP-43 knockdown, with six showing high expression; presumably due to the use of high SpliceAI scores and relatively short UG-rich regions, some vectors had detectable leaky CE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Using the piggyBac system, we generated polyclonal SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) lines expressing TDP-43/Raver1 fusion in triplicate, either as a constitutive version or with an internal CE from constructs #6 or #9, or mScarlet. In this case, the wild-type TDP-43 sequence was used to enable both repression of cryptic splicing and autoregulation. Whereas the constitutive vector expressed TDP-43/Raver1 regardless of endogenous TDP-43 levels, vectors featuring an internal CE only expressed detectable TDP-43/Raver1 upon knockdown of endogenous TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Indeed, expression of TDP-43/Raver1 constructs, either constitutively spliced or with an internal CE, reduced <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>AARS1</italic> CEs by over 85%, and the <italic>STMN2</italic> CE by approximately 40%.</p><p id="P23">Interestingly, higher levels of TDP-43/Raver1 expression, and more efficient repression of endogenous CEs, were observed upon TDP-43 knockdown for cryptic vectors (especially #9) than for the constitutive vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K-M</xref>). We propose this is due to toxicity of TDP-43/Raver1 when expressed in cells with functional endogenous TDP-43, leading to a selection pressure against cells constitutively expressing high levels of TDP-43/Raver1. Indeed, a strong growth advantage was observed for cells expressing TDP-43/Raver1 regulated by TDP-REG compared with those expressing constitutive TDP-43/Raver1, which severely impacted growth in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

However, there are major hurdles that must be overcome to translate these to the clinic. Gene therapy is typically based on a single delivery approach, which results in permanent expression throughout the patient’s lifetime, thus avoiding the need for repeated invasive delivery. However, such long-term, widespread expression can lead to significant toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To mitigate this, in neurodegenerative diseases, one would ideally only express gene therapies in cells showing signs of disease, such as TDP-LOF in ALS/FTD. Crucially, this occurs only in a small proportion of cells: specific brain regions are affected in ALS and FTD, and even within the strongly affected areas, &lt;10% of neurons show signs of TDP-43 pathology, even at the end stage of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Although one can employ AAV capsids that show preference for specific tissues, and promoters can be used to limit expression to specific cell types, additional systems are needed to target expression to the small proportion of cells affected by disease pathogenesis.</p><p id="P25">Here, we describe TDP-REG, which enables disease-specific spatial and temporal regulation of gene therapy expression by exploiting the predictable splicing changes induced by TDP-LOF. Given that TDP-LOF is a hallmark of ALS, FTD, and other common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and LATE, TDP-REG could have broad utility in the treatment of these disorders. In at-risk individuals carrying causal genetic variants of ALS, the spatial and temporal specificity of TDP-REG could allow the therapeutics to be delivered at the pre-symptomatic stage, lying dormant until the very first stages of TDP-43 pathology are detected. Furthermore, TDP-REG can be used during the preclinical phase of drug development as a real-time readout for TDP-43 pathology in cells or even live animals.</p><p id="P26">We designed two “flavours” of TDP-REG. TDP-REGv1 involves the fusion of a transgene to an upstream regulatory module, featuring a modified CE sequence derived from an existing human gene. This approach has several benefits: as a modular design, different transgenes can be controlled by the same upstream regulatory module. Furthermore, TDP-REGv1 is based on a well-validated endogenous CE which is detected in patients in a disease-specific manner.</p><p id="P27">In contrast, TDP-REGv2 uses synthetic splicing sensors that are embedded within the transgene sequence itself. This addresses several limitations with TDP-REGv1 and previous approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>): it removes the need for a lengthy upstream regulatory region, thus aiding packaging of large transgenes into AAV vectors; it prevents an upstream, unwanted peptide being expressed and released into the cell; and it is highly tunable, meaning that splicing characteristics can be optimised for the specific transgene being delivered. For example, with a gene editing enzyme one may opt for extremely tight gating to prevent the risk of DNA damage in non-target cells, whereas for a chaperone one may prefer less tight gating if it enables higher maximal expression. Strikingly, we found that our most potent vectors had higher maximal expression levels than matched positive control vectors. This may be due to splicing promoting higher expression levels by avoiding silencing from the recently-described HUSH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Splicing regulation is highly complex and difficult to predict with conventional algorithms. During the development of TDP-REGv2, we created an algorithm, <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>, which leverages the power of deep-learning splicing prediction to optimise vectors, ensuring they are spliced in the desired manner. Compared to using high-throughput screens to find sequences with desired splicing characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), use of <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> means only a handful need to be tested. The benefits of the <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic> approach are also apparent from the first iteration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, which demonstrates that naive procedural generation produces sequences that are not predicted to be spliced in the desired manner. Using <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>, we successfully generated cryptic cassette exons, and also cryptic alternative splice sites, by computationally designing competitor alternative splice sites that are used preferentially when TDP-43 is present. The flexibility and high success-rate of <italic>SpliceNouveau</italic>-designed vectors therefore represents a major step forward in splicing-regulated vector technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Overall, this study demonstrates how cryptic splicing, ostensibly a driver of ALS and FTD progression, can be reverse-engineered and exploited to enable exceptionally targeted therapeutic protein expression. This approach, which is compatible with conventional AAVs that have previously been approved for gene therapy, can readily be adapted for different transgenes, including tuning of their maximal expression levels and sensitivities to TDP-43 depletion. This will minimise the risk of toxic side-effects and thus improve the chance of obtaining measurable improvements during clinical trials, reducing danger for patients, and increasing incentives for drug developers.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P30">SK-N-BE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
