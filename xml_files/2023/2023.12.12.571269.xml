The production of cardiomyocytes from hPSCs typically requires expanding large numbers of hPSCs and maintaining them in culture for extended periods of time. This in turn predisposes hPSCs to the acquisition of non-random genetic changes, including recurrent gains of chromosome 1q. Here, we show that gain of chromosome 1q in hPSCs affects both the efficiency of differentiation to cardiomyocytes and phenotype of the differentiated cells. Mechanistically, we show that aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway underpins the skewed differentiation of variant 1q hPSCs. Collectively, our data demonstrates that the presence of genetically variant cells in cultures is a significant concern for production of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for research or clinical applications. Further, our results suggest new approaches for removing genetically variant cells for future clinical applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which include both embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and induced pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, represent a promising source of <italic>in vitro</italic> derived cardiomyocytes for disease modelling and regenerative medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Successful implementation of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in research and clinical practice, requires that the production of cardiomyocytes from hPSCs is reproducible and efficacious and, for cellular therapies, the resulting cells must be safe to use in humans. Concerningly, these requirements could be severely compromised by the occurrence of genetic changes in hPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, culture-acquired genetic changes are known to arise in hPSCs during expansion and prolonged maintenance of hPSCs <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Genetic changes in hPSCs appear to be non-random with the most common changes including gains of chromosomes 1, 12, 17, 20 and X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The non-random nature of these abnormalities is thought to result from the selective advantage they confer onto the cells under particular culture regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, variant cells with recurrent genetic changes were previously shown to outcompete wild-type cells in culture and gain dominance through enhanced survival, decreased propensity for apoptosis, reduced cell cycle time and/or exhibiting cell competition behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Such features of variant hPSCs are reminiscent of cancer cells, raising concerns that the presence of recurrent genetic changes in hPSCs may render them unsafe to use for production of differentiated cells destined for clinical use. Another documented feature of genetically variant cells is altered differentiation propensity, which can in turn impact the efficiency and the number of produced cell types required for basic research and disease modelling. For example, previous work has shown that the amplification of chromosome 17q in hPSCs leads to altered neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, while we recently demonstrated that the presence of isochromosome 20q impairs spontaneous differentiation of hPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Although the recurrent nature of genetic aberrations in hPSCs is well established, our recent large-scale analysis of karyotyping datasets from over 23,000 hPSC cultures demonstrated that trends of karyotypic abnormalities are culture condition-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, we noted an increase in prevalence of chromosome 1q gains in recent years, associated with increased use of feeder-free cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Our work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and that of others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, showed that <italic>MDM4</italic> is a likely driver gene for the selective advantage of variant 1q cells, allowing variants to rapidly take over cultures through faster proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Given the prevalence of chromosome 1q variants in hPSC culture in recent years, a question arises whether the gains of chromosome 1q affect downstream application of hPSCs, such as their use for generating differentiated cells?</p><p id="P5">Here, we utilised a panel of paired lines with or without a gain of chromosome 1q to ascertain their ability to differentiate to cardiomyocytes. We show that, in comparison to wild-type cells, genetic variants with a gain of chromosome 1q exhibit impaired cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency and altered phenotype of differentiated cells relative to WT cells. We further show that the altered differentiation of variants is mediated by aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway, providing an insight into the mechanisms that are perturbed by this culture-acquired genetic aberration.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Variants with a gain of chromosome 1q exhibit impaired differentiation to cardiomyocytes</title><p id="P6">We first set out to assess the ability of variant hPSCs with a recurrent genetic change, a gain of chromosome 1q, to differentiate into cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we utilised three wild-type (WT) hPSC lines (H7 [WA07]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, H9 [WA09]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and MIFF3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>) paired with their isogenic sublines harbouring a gain of chromosome 1q (from herein termed H7 <italic>v1q</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, H9 <italic>v1q</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and MIFF3 <italic>v1q</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). For differentiation to cardiomyocytes, we used two different protocols: a commercial STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Ventricular Differentiation kit (STEMCELL Technologies) and a microcarrier differentiation protocol adapted from previously published studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The commercial kit entailed differentiating cells in a monolayer by treating them with differentiation media until day 8, when the beating cell phenotype is expected to appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, following previously published microcarrier differentiation protocols, we expanded hPSCs on microcarriers for 5-7 days, prior to treating them with a Wnt pathway agonist CHIR99021 (days 0-1 of the differentiation protocol) and followed by treatment of cells with a Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (days 3-5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As expected, at day 8 of differentiation, both protocols yielded beating cells in WT H7, H9 and MIFF3 cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). The proportion of cells positive for a cardiac marker, cardiac troponin (cTNT), was consistently above 70% for WT lines tested in each of the protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This was in contrast to <italic>v1q</italic> cells, where the differentiation efficiency was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-E</xref>). Neither the commercial nor the microcarrier differentiation protocol generated beating cells in variant H7<italic>v1q</italic> and MIFF-3<italic>v1q</italic> cultures at day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video S3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). In the H9 pair, the commercial kit generated some beating cells, but to a much lower extent than the WT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video S4</xref>). We observed cell death was an overt feature in <italic>v1q</italic> cultures in both differentiation protocols, with levels of cell death being particularly prominent in the microcarrier differentiation protocol, as less extensive <italic>v1q</italic> cell networks remaining attached to the microcarrier surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). The excessive cell death of variants was surprising given the previously reported apoptotic resistance of recurrent variants under the self-renewing hPSC conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Together, the differences of isogenic WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells undergoing the same differentiation protocol indicated significant alterations in cell fate decisions between WT and variant hPSCs, with obvious adverse consequences for reproducibility and robustness of cardiomyocyte protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Variant 1q hPSCs are hyperresponsive to Wnt activation</title><p id="P8">To investigate the mechanisms underpinning the failure of variant cells to efficiently differentiate to cardiomyocytes, we decided to focus on utilising the microcarrier differentiation protocol as a platform for probing signalling pathways implicated in altered fate decisions in variant cells. To exclude the possibility that the increased cell death of <italic>v1q</italic> was due to growing the cells in a different environment (i.e. on microcarriers, rather than in conventional 2D cultures), we performed growth curve experiments of WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells grown on microcarriers. We found that, much like in 2D cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, variant cells displayed enhanced population growth compared to WT cells during initial expansion on microcarriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). This suggested that the high level of variant cell death in the differentiation protocol was not due to growing the cells on microcarriers but was instead likely caused by the differentiation cues present in the medium.</p><p id="P9">The first step in our protocol for cardiomyocyte differentiation entailed activating the Wnt signalling pathway with CHIR99201. Therefore, we reasoned that the Wnt activation may be causing death and failure of variant hPSCs to differentiate. To test this hypothesis, we first treated H7 WT and <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs for 18 hours in the presence or absence of 11µM CHIR99021 – the concentration for which we had already established a high differentiation efficiency in WT control lines, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. As a control, we also assessed the level of apoptosis of WT and <italic>v1q</italic> lines grown in the E8 medium that supports the maintenance of undifferentiated hPSCs and in the RPMI medium that we used as a basal medium to induce hPSC differentiation with CHIR99021. Strikingly, while variant cells exhibited significantly lower levels of apoptosis compared to WT cells when grown in E8 or RPMI medium, they showed significantly higher levels of apoptosis upon treatment with CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We noted a similar trend in H9 cells, with <italic>v1q</italic> sublines undergoing higher levels of apoptosis when treated with CHIR99021 compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Although CHIR99021 is commonly used as a Wnt agonist, this compound has multiple off-target effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, to confirm that the effects observed upon the addition of CHIR99021 were specific to the stimulation of the Wnt pathway we next utilised the direct agonist of Wnt, the Wnt3a ligand, which binds to frizzled transmembrane receptors to activate downstream signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We treated H7 WT and variant H7<italic>v1q</italic> cells with 200ng/ml Wnt3a ligand for the same 18 hours window and then assessed the proportion of cells expressing the cleaved caspase-3 marker of apoptosis. In a similar manner to CHIR99021 treatment, the treatment with Wnt3a caused a sharp increase in the percentage of cleaved caspase-3 positive apoptotic cells in 1q variant hPSCs compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We confirmed that this result was reproducible in an additional hPSC line, H9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Overall, this data is consistent with the notion that Wnt activation in <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs triggers predominantly apoptosis rather than differentiation of variant cells.</p><p id="P11">We next reasoned that two alternate possibilities could explain our results. One explanation is that Wnt signalling is unperturbed in variant cells, but the same level of activation leads to a different cell fate. Alternatively, the Wnt signalling may be aberrantly activated in variants, thus causing differences in cell fate between WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells. To test these possibilities, we directly measured Wnt activity in WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells in undifferentiated state and at different time points post-CHIR99201 treatment using the TOP-Flash Wnt reporter assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We noted no significant differences in basal Wnt signalling in WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells (H7 pair) grown under conditions that support undifferentiated stem cell phenotype (0hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, an 8-hour treatment with 11µM CHIR99201 resulted in a significantly higher Wnt activation in the <italic>v1q</italic> subline compared to WT cells, which remained significantly elevated at the 18h timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also noted a similar trend of Wnt activation upon CHIR99201 treatment in H9 WT and <italic>v1q</italic> pair lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Based on these experiments, we concluded that WT and <italic>v1q</italic> cells display significant differences in their capacity for Wnt activation, with variants responding more rapidly and achieving a higher level of Wnt activation compared to WT hPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Impaired differentiation of <italic>v1q</italic> cells is caused by hyperactivation of Wnt</title><p id="P12">While the microcarrier differentiation protocol yielded no apparently beating cardiomyocytes from <italic>v1q</italic> cells in any of the three lines tested, the fact that we saw some cTNT-positive cells when using the STEMCELL kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), as well as some beating cells in H9 <italic>v1q</italic> cultures suggested to us that <italic>v1q</italic> cells are not inherently refractory to differentiation. Based on our results that <italic>v1q</italic> cells are hyperresponsive to Wnt activation, we postulated that overactivation of Wnt is preventing <italic>v1q</italic> cells from differentiating. Hence, we hypothesized that reducing the levels of Wnt agonism in <italic>v1q</italic> cells would reduce the amount of cell death and permit differentiation to cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="P13">In line with our hypothesis, treatment of variant cells with lower doses of CHIR99201 (4µM) for 18h induced similar level of apoptosis in <italic>v1q</italic> cultures compared with their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Notably, lowering the concentration of CHIR99201 was also effective in overcoming the differentiation block in <italic>v1q</italic> sublines, as all the <italic>v1q</italic> sublines produced beating cardiomyocytes after 8 days of the differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video S5</xref>). Based on the proportion of cTNT positive cells, the efficiency of differentiation of variant cells treated with lower concentrations of CHIR99201 was more similar to those of WT cells in the original protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To test our assumption that differentiation in <italic>v1q</italic> lines upon treatment with lower doses of CHIR99021 was due to achieving just right levels of Wnt activation, we employed the TOP-Flash Wnt reporter assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> on variants treated with optimised levels of CHIR99021 (4µM). This analysis confirmed that the levels of Wnt activation with lower doses of 4µM CHIR99021 in <italic>v1q</italic> sublines were equivalent to the Wnt activation in WT cells with 11µM CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Together, our data shows that the excessive cell death of variant cells is caused by hyperactivation of Wnt and reveals that the levels of Wnt must be tightly regulated to achieve efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis of cardiomyocytes derived from WT and <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs</title><p id="P15">We next asked whether the cardiomyocytes derived from <italic>v1q</italic> cells are phenotypically equivalent to those produced from WT cells. To address this, we first performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq in WT and <italic>v1q</italic> H7 cells at the undifferentiated (d0) and cardiomyocyte-differentiated state (d8). To achieve efficient differentiation, here we used differentiation protocols specifically optimised for each of these sublines, i.e. using 11µM CHIR99021 for WT and 1µM for <italic>v1q</italic> H7 cells. Principal component analysis showed that while <italic>v1q</italic> and WT cells are transcriptionally relatively similar to each other at d0, they diverge significantly at the cardiomyocyte state (d8). Specifically, <italic>v1q</italic> cells are deficient in genes associated with normal cardiomyocyte differentiation and remain clustered with hPSC-state (d0) based on PC1 component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To better understand the transcriptional changes, we computed differentially expressed genes at each stage of differentiation and detected n=591 and n=8,876 high confidence differentially expressed genes between <italic>v1q</italic> and WT cells at d0 and d8, respectively (log2FC &gt; 1.5, and FDR &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The majority of differentially expressed genes at d0 were upregulated in <italic>v1q</italic> cells (n=495) whereas a more comparable number of up- (n=3,352) and down-regulated (n=5,524) genes were detected in <italic>v1q</italic> cells at d8 of differentiation. Furthermore, the number of differentially expressed genes were distributed across multiple chromosomes at d8 of differentiation ruling out a major bias in transcriptional profiles towards chr1 loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). GO-term enrichment analysis revealed that genes downregulated in <italic>v1q</italic> cells at cardiomyocyte stage (d8) are mainly associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation including genes involved in extracellular matrix interaction, collagen and fibre formation, and muscle contraction. In contrast, genes up-regulated in <italic>v1q</italic> cells at d8 were predominantly involved in cell cycle pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Wnt signalling was also one of the pathways identified as altered in <italic>v1q</italic> cells at d8 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Altogether, these data indicated that multiple genes are dysregulated in variant hPSCs in undifferentiated state but the transcriptomes of WT and <italic>v1q</italic> lines become profoundly different upon differentiation.</p><p id="P17">In line with marked transcriptional changes, the phenotypic assessment of α-actinin-stained cells after eight days of differentiation also showed overt differences between WT- and <italic>v1q</italic>-derived differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Notably, some of the differences, such as the cell size, appeared cell line-specific, with MIFF3 <italic>v1q</italic> α-actinin positive cells appearing significantly smaller and H9 <italic>v1q</italic> cells significantly larger than WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, a common feature across cardiomyocytes derived from all three <italic>v1q</italic> lines was a significantly shortened average branch length of α-actinin positive fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The total length of α-actinin fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the number of cardiac fibre junctions per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>) were overall similar between WT- and <italic>v1q</italic>-derived cardiomyocytes. Collectively, this data revealed that although variant cells are capable of differentiation when Wnt activation is finely tuned, the resulting cardiomyocytes deviate significantly from their wild-type counterparts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">The inefficiency of hPSC differentiation and/or altered functional characteristics of differentiated cells due to the presence of genetic changes in the starting hPSC population stand to seriously jeopardise the use of hPSC-derived cells in research or therapy. In this study, by using three independent pairs of WT and variant lines with a gain of chromosome 1q in two different differentiation protocols, we established that the presence of the chromosome 1q gain affects the differentiation of hPSC to cardiomyocytes. We further demonstrated that this defect is due to an altered sensitivity of variant cells to Wnt activation. First, we showed that the same dose of CHIR99021 that triggers differentiation in WT cells causes apoptosis in <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs. We confirmed that this effect was due to Wnt activation as we could phenocopy it by using the natural Wnt ligand, Wnt3a. Second, we demonstrated that this differential response to Wnt agonists is likely because variants are hyperresponsive to Wnt activation, as the same dose of CHIR99021 caused a much quicker and greater upregulation of Wnt signalling, as measured by TOPFlash assay. Finally, by decreasing the levels of CHIR99021, we were able to overcome the apparent block in differentiation and achieve cardiomyocyte differentiation of <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs. This latter result demonstrated that <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs are not inherently recalcitrant to differentiation but rather, genetic changes that variant hPSCs harbour affect their response to differentiation cues.</p><p id="P19">While we were able to alleviate differences in the propensity for differentiation of variant cells by fine-tuning their signalling environment, the resulting differentiated cells significantly differed from their WT counterparts. For example, apart from an increase in the expression of genes harboured within the amplified chromosomal region, transcriptome analysis highlighted global transcriptional changes. Many pathways were significantly dysregulated as a result, including the Wnt pathway, although we do not yet know the precise mechanism by which the gain of chromosome 1q influences the capacity of Wnt activation. Further phenotypic differences were evident from the immunocytochemistry analysis of alpha actinin-positive cardiac fibre length and connectivity, which represent a hallmark of cardiomyocyte maturity and functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Although we noted some variability in the cardiomyocyte phenotype of WT lines, <italic>v1q</italic> cells consistently differed from their paired WT counterparts. All <italic>v1q</italic> lines examined displayed shorter fibre lengths, suggesting a more immature phenotype. Future work should address the extent of functional consequences of recurrent chromosome 1q gain on hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Of note, a parallel study by Brandao et al. (2023) showed enhanced contractility of a <italic>v1q</italic> line in a 3D cardiac model, thus demonstrating that recurrent genetic changes in hPSC can have profound consequences for functional behaviour of their differentiated derivatives.</p><p id="P20">There are at least a couple of ways in which <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs can undermine the effectiveness of differentiation protocols for research or cell therapy. First, some of the variants investigated in our study, such as MIFF3 <italic>v1q</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, had a relatively small amplification of chromosome 1q, which appeared below the resolution of G-banding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but nonetheless affected the differentiation efficiency of hPSCs. The relatively small size of this CNV limits the detection of variant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, making them more likely to go unnoticed in cultures. Second, even if harbouring larger karyotypic abnormalities, variant cells may be present at a low proportion of cells in culture. Low level of mosaicism also presents detection challenges of variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. As a corollary, the contamination of cultures with variant cells may impact the differentiation efficiency of protocols used. Indeed, given the striking effects of variants on the differentiation efficiency of hPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, it seems plausible that at least some of the widely reported batch-to-batch variations in differentiation performance could be due to the presence of culture-acquired genetic changes arising in hPSCs and consequently taking over the cultures. On the other hand, our observation that <italic>v1q</italic> hPSCs are more prone to apoptosis upon Wnt activation may offer a practical solution for the elimination of variant cells during expansion. Specifically, titrating the levels of Wnt may allow concomitant differentiation of WT cells and elimination of <italic>v1q</italic> from mosaic cultures.</p><p id="P21">In summary, our work demonstrates that recurrently gained genetic variants in hPSCs alter the differentiation capacity of hPSCs to cardiomyocytes. We identified enhanced susceptibility to Wnt activation as the key reason for this difference. Given the commonality of recurrent genetic changes in hPSC cultures, the presence of variants may be the prime reason for issues with reproducibility and robustness of the hPSC differentiation protocols. Our data suggests that copy number changes affecting the Wnt pathway activation may be implicated in aberrations associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation during development. Finally, our study demonstrates a paradigm approach for investigating the impact of genetic variants on hPSC differentiation and behaviour of other specialized cell types, relevant for disease modelling and cell therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S9"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S10"><title>Corresponding authors</title><p id="P22">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the corresponding author, Ivana Barbaric (<email>i.barbaric@sheffield.ac.uk</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P23">This study did not generate new unique reagents.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines</title><p id="P24">Wild-type hPSCs used in this study were H7 (WA07)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, H9 (WA09)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and MIFF-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.
