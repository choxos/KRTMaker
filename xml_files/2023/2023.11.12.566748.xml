Genomic analysis can provide insights into the evolutionary history of the species, and the key selective pressures shaping populations, including assessment of population level differentiation, population fragmentation, and population genetic structure. In this study we generated the highest quality <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly (2.65 Gb, scaffold N50 69.17 Mb) of African buffalo to date, and sequenced a further 195 genomes from across the species distribution. Principal component and admixture analyses provided surprisingly little support for the currently described four subspecies, but indicated three main lineages, in Western/Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, respectively. Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces analysis suggested that geographical barriers have played a significant role in shaping gene flow and the population structure. Estimated effective population sizes indicated a substantial drop occurring in all populations 5-10,000 years ago, coinciding with the increase in human populations. Finally, signatures of selection were enriched for key genes associated with the immune response, suggesting infectious disease exert a substantial selective pressure upon the African buffalo. These findings have important implications for understanding bovid evolution, buffalo conservation and population management.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The African buffalo, <italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>, is a key member of the charismatic African megafauna, and was historically distributed across sub-Saharan Africa, inhabiting a diverse range of habitats from dry savannah to montane rainforest. Over the past century the population density and distribution has been much reduced. The population range has also become increasingly fragmented due to man-made pressures, resulting in approximately 70% of the global population being restricted to protected areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The species has been historically divided into varying numbers of subspecies based upon distribution, habitat and morphology, the most recent update of the IUCN Red List recognising <italic>S. caffer caffer</italic> (Eastern and Southern African savannah), <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic> (Western African savannah), <italic>S. c. aequinoctialis</italic> (Central African savannah), and <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> (Western and Central African forest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The genetic understanding of population diversity and structure across the species range mostly derives from the application of low resolution tools, such as mitochondrial D-loop sequences, microsatellites and mitogenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], with a more recent study using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The two studies to analyse diversity at the genome level, focused on South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> animals (n=40) in protected areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> populations (n=59) from East and Southern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. These studies have collectively highlighted that the current subspecies classification may not be supported by genetic data, and that there is striking population substructuring within and between the putative subspecies. They have also indicated concerns with respect to low effective population sizes in increasingly isolated populations in some African regions. Improved genetic tools can potentially contribute to conservation management strategies, both in terms of restoring connectivity between relevant populations in order to improve or restore genetic diversity, and avoiding loss of genetic integrity (i.e. maintenance of genetic diversity relevant to local environmental adaptation) through uninformed population mixing (e.g. translocations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P6">As well as being an iconic species of African wildlife, the African buffalo is the closest bovid relative of domesticated cattle (<italic>Bos taurus taurus &amp; Bos taurus indicus</italic>) in Africa. The African buffalo has co-evolved in Africa with pathogens responsible for important and impactful diseases of cattle such as animal African trypanosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and foot and mouth disease virus (FMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. For trypanosomiasis, in contrast to the often devastating impact that infection has on cattle, African buffalo are largely tolerant, displaying much less severe clinical signs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]). Additionally, African buffalo are the primary host for the tick-borne protozoan <italic>Theileria parva</italic>, the causative agent of East Coast fever, an often deadly disease in cattle that is asymptomatic in buffalo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. These diseases have impeded productivity and the expansion of African pastoralists and their cattle for centuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. During the colonial era, European cattle also brought with them diseases then exotic to Africa, such as rinderpest, brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], to which African buffalo are susceptible. African buffalo and cattle co-exist today across many wildlife/livestock interfaces that enhance mutual pathogen transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and this can result in imposition of strict veterinary controls at these interfaces that often impact local livelihoods and conservation efforts (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]). This makes the buffalo particularly interesting in terms of host-pathogen coevolution and potentially providing a route to identifying host genes and pathways relevant to controlling these diseases in livestock.</p><p id="P7">This study aimed to develop a reference genome for the African buffalo, as a foundation to analyse the population genomic structure across the current distribution of the species in sub-Saharan Africa. Two reference genomes have previously been published, but were generated via short read sequencing, resulting in relatively fragmented final genome assemblies (scaffold N50s of 2.40 Mb and 2.32 Mb, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Using a combination of long read (PacBio) and Hi-C sequencing, we generated and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled a substantially higher quality and more contiguous reference genome of 2.65 Gb, with a scaffold N50 of 69.17 Mb. We then sequenced the genomes of 196 African buffalo samples from across the current species distribution, which enabled the analysis of genetic substructure, admixture between populations, and effective population sizes. We also assessed <italic>S. caffer</italic> genomes for signatures of selection, highlighting genes that may be responsible for environmental adaptation, in particular against diseases important for both buffalo and cattle.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Assembly statistics</title><p id="P8">We first generated a <italic>de novo S. c. caffer</italic> reference genome from a male buffalo (OPB4) sampled in Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya, providing the foundation to enable the characterisation of the genetic diversity of African buffalo populations both in terms of their geographic regions and habitats and their current subspecies classification. We applied a deep sequencing strategy, based on a combination of 60x long read (PacBio) and 75x short read (Illumina) reads, to generate a <italic>de novo</italic> reference genome ensuring high per base sequence quality and consensus to achieve good genome contiguity, with an N50 of 69.16Mb. The long reads were assembled using FALCON (Dovetail Genomics) and polished using Arrow. Contigs were then scaffolded using ~393 million 2x150bp Illumina reads of HiC data, using the HiRise software. Gaps in the draft genome were addressed using PBJelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Finally, Pilon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] was used for sequential rounds of polishing, each of which was assessed for its resulting assembly quality over previous rounds. The genome following four rounds of polishing displayed the highest assembly statistics, with a total of 3,351 scaffolds, a total length of 2.65 Gb (comparable to 2.72 Gb for the <italic>Bos taurus</italic> genome), a scaffold N50 of 69.16 Mb and a quality value (QV) of 35.9, indicating ~1 error every 5,000 bp. The assembly statistics are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>.</p><p id="P9">Previous African buffalo reference genomes, generated by Glanzmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], were based solely on Illumina short read sequencing, which led to highly fragmented assemblies of 442,401 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 2.40 Mb, and 150,000 scaffolds with an N50 of 2.30 Mb, respectively. These very fragmented assemblies provided limited scope for downstream analysis of variants and their predicted effects on functional regions, i.e. annotated genes and regulatory regions (a comparison of the three genome assemblies is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptome analyses and genome annotation</title><p id="P10">To enable in depth characterisation of the African buffalo transcriptome and to facilitate the annotation of gene isoforms, we performed full length isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) across samples from six different tissues (prescapular lymph node, testis, liver, kidney, lung and spleen) collected from the same animal for which the genome was assembled (OPB4). In total 51,521 distinct, high quality isoforms (defined as being supported by at least two full length reads and with &gt;99% base composition accuracy) were detected across these samples (median of 11,520 per tissue, maximum of 27,271 in the testis). Complementing these data, we also generated Illumina RNA-seq data, from the same animal, from eight tissues (heart, prescapular and inguinal lymph nodes, testis, liver, kidney, lung and spleen). All transcriptomic data were deposited to ENA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_902825105.1">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_902825105.1</ext-link>) with accession numbers PRJEB36587 and PRJEB36588 for RNA-seq and Iso-Seq, respectively. Together these data have been used to provide a high quality annotation of the buffalo assembly which can be accessed through the Ensembl Rapid Release genome browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rapid.ensembl.org/Syncerus_caffer_GCA_902825105.1">https://rapid.ensembl.org/Syncerus_caffer_GCA_902825105.1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>African buffalo-specific sequence</title><p id="P11">After aligning the African buffalo genome to eight high quality assemblies of four different Bovidae species (cattle, water buffalo, yak and goat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]), portions of the <italic>S. caffer</italic> genome that did not match any regions in the other assemblies were ascertained. This process identified a total of 24,336,918 intervals, for a total of 145,050,830 bp of sequence not identified in the other eight assemblies. This includes both small variations (e.g. SNPs, small indels), unplaced contigs without alignments to any other genome, and large portions of the genome lacking any alignment.</p><p id="P12">We then refined the region selection by filtering out shorter intervals (&lt;60 bp) and regions defined as too close to a telomere (&lt;10 Kb) or to a gap (&lt;1 Kb), leaving a total of 113,654,400 bp in 81,357 fragments longer than 60 bp, which were neither telomeric nor neighbouring an assembly gap. These regions have an average length of 1,397bp (3772.4 bp SD) and a median size of 286bp (min. 61bp, max 308,890bp). The majority of the regions (74,659 fragments accounting for 112,762,919 bp) represent sequence not found in any of the other species genomes considered in the study, whereas the remaining are classified as divergent haplotypes. Of the 113Mb, a total of 64.9Mb (57.1%) are putatively identified as repeats using RED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. To rule out the possibility of these novel regions being due to contamination, we confirmed the coverage of these regions was consistent with the rest of the genome, using short-read whole genome sequencing data from 46 samples from the population analysis (see section below; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">HOMER analysis considered 4,286/7,096 sequences with less than 60% of masked nucleotides. These sequences presented 38 motif types enriched (P-value &lt;1e-5), such as the FOSL2/MA0478.1/Jaspar (0.661) motif, a negative regulatory sequence in the differentiation-sensitive adipocyte gene (aP2), a motif identified as a transcriptional enhancer for the Gibbon ape leukaemia virus, and which is also in a region of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. We performed the feature analysis on the annotation generated by Ensembl from the Iso-Seq sequencing data previously described. We identified 7,096 annotated genes and 131 pseudogenes overlapping the novel regions, of which 583 genes, 194 ncRNA genes and 71 pseudogenes were entirely included in the identified regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A total of 317 of 583 genes had at least one biological term annotated. GO terms definitions were fetched using the goatools python package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Out of 4,088 terms in the background dataset, 17 (15 GO terms and 2 KEGG pathways) were found significantly enriched. Among the significant terms was the defence response GO term (GO:0006952, FDR-corrected P-value: 0.0189, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), described as the response triggered by the presence of a foreign body.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Population genetics</title><p id="P14">To better understand African buffalo genetic diversity, we generated short read sequencing data for a further 195 animals deriving from across the continental range of the species (at a coverage of 15x for 146 samples, and 30x for 50 samples; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; for full sample list and metadata see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

Together, these samples derived from 21 sites/localities or protected areas across 12 different countries. We performed phylogenetic and population analyses including only samples with a high call rate (&gt;85%), and analysing only the biallelic polymorphic SNPs (minor allele frequency &gt;5%), as well as only considering unrelated individuals (samples fourth degree or greater).</p><p id="P15">As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> the genetic relationships between the samples largely mirrors their geographic origin, with the first principal component (PC1) reflecting differentiation between samples from Eastern/Southern and Western Africa, which corresponds to a split between the Western/Central African subspecies (<italic>S. c. aequinoctialis, S. c. brachyceros</italic> and <italic>S. c. nanus</italic>) and Eastern/Southern African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic>. The second component (PC2) correlates with differentiation between <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> samples from the Northern part of the subspecies’ range (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) compared to <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> samples from Southern Africa. Notably, there was a clear signature of geography within the <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> data, with each geographic sub-population forming a distinct cluster in the PCA and a cline observed from Uganda to Kenya and Tanzania in the North, through Mozambique to samples from Botswana and Zimbabwe, and finally South Africa in the South. In Western/Central Africa, <italic>S. c. aequinoctialis, S. c. brachyceros</italic> and <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> sub-populations also formed separate clusters, although the <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> and <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic> populations clustered closely together. Samples were initially grouped by sub-species and country of sampling. However, based on PCA results, the Tanzania and Kenya, and Botswana and Zimbabwe samples were grouped together, reflecting their geographic proximity. This resulted in nine subgroups for downstream analyses; referred to hereafter as <italic>S. c brachyceros, S. c. nanus, S. c. aequinoctialis</italic>, intermediate (putative hybrids between <italic>S. c. nanus, S. c. aequinoctialis</italic>), <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Uganda, <italic>S. c. caffe</italic>r Kenya/Tanzania, <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Mozambique, <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Zimbabwe/Botswana and <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> South Africa.

Since the <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic> population had a total of 16 samples, we did not perform any reduction on this population. This resulted in a subset of 95 individuals to be considered for the population genetic analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for samples included in these analyses).

At K=9 the clusters recapitulate the nine sub-groupings described above (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> for admixture results at multiple K).

However, sub-structure in this isolation-by-distance analysis is observed. After excluding the <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> populations, the relationship is even stronger, and variation in the F<sub>ST</sub> values between the remaining groups can potentially largely all be explained by the distances between them (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, Mantel test r: 0.96, p=0.0013). This is consistent with the idea that these African buffalo have historically formed large continuous groups of populations with differentiation between populations simply reflecting the reduced mating probability with increasing distance. <italic>S. c. nanus</italic>, the forest buffalo, shows an unusually steep increase in differentiation relative to other populations (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This could be for a variety of reasons, including geographical barriers reducing the gene flow between this group and the others analysed. Animals found at the same location should exhibit little differentiation, and consistent with this, the intercept of the slopes is not significantly different from 0 in these comparisons (both linear regression intercept P&gt;0.4), i.e. when comparing <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> to other populations or the non- <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> and non-<italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Hluhluwe-Umfolozi populations to each other. However, this is not the case for comparisons involving the South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Hluhluwe-Umfolozi population. Under the assumption of a simple linear relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distance, the predicted level of diversity at a distance of 0 km is significantly higher than 0 (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, linear regression intercept P=2.7x10<sup>-4</sup>). This suggests, that unlike in the other population comparisons, there is elevated differentiation between this population and others, above and beyond that expected from their geographic distance apart.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> there has been a sharp reduction in the estimated effective population sizes across these groups in the last approximately 10,000 years, broadly mirroring the expansion of human effective population sizes over a similar time-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). There were not sufficient numbers in all individual populations for robust N<sub>e</sub> analyses, but for the populations that did have sufficient numbers, contemporary N<sub>e</sub> estimates were ~1,300, 2,000 and 3,000 for Uganda, Tanzania/Kenya and Zimbabwe/Botswana, respectively.

To investigate selective sweeps between and within the nine population groupings we calculated the XP-EHH and P<sub>R</sub> Relate Selection Test statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Due to being more susceptible to artefactual results deriving from smaller sample sizes than the XP-EHH statistic, the calculation of the P<sub>R</sub> statistic was restricted to just the populations with more than 20 samples after filtering for relatedness (i.e. the Uganda, Zimbabwe/Botswana and Tanzanian/Kenyan populations). These two tests are complementary in that whereas the XP-EHH statistic tests for differences in haplotype homozygosity between populations, P<sub>R</sub> characterises the speed of spread of particular genomic lineages within a population, relative to others. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref> summarises the results of these two tests. In total, 73 loci of elevated XP-EHH levels overlapping a gene were identified in at least one population comparison, and 34 P<sub>R</sub> significant loci were detected in one of the three studied populations. Of the XP-EHH loci, 9 also overlapped a significant P<sub>R</sub> peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These 9 loci spanned 11 genes, with several having strong links to immune response, including putative killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor like protein KIR3DP1 (LOC102402296), T cell receptor beta variable 5-1-like (LOC112577699), the major histocompatibility complex gene TRIM26 and N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphatase (NANP). The latter is involved in sialic acid synthesis which in turn is linked to immune response modulation, and NANP has also been observed to be under recent positive selection in both humans and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Two further of these nine genes linked to both XP-EHH and P<sub>R</sub> peaks in African buffalo were also previously linked to recent positive selection in water buffalo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], namely myeloid-associated differentiation marker-like (LOC102403696) and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1-like (SIRPA-like) gene (LOC102396916). LOC102396916 was associated with significant P<sub>R</sub> peaks in both the Uganda and Tanzania/Kenyan populations and also elevated XP-EHH scores in the South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> vs intermediate and <italic>S. c aequinoctialis</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). SIRPA is an immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor for CD47 (a cell surface protein that is involved in the promotion/regulation of cellular proliferation) and has been associated with a range of infectious diseases, including <italic>Theileria annulata</italic> infection in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] (<italic>T. annulata</italic> being the causative agent of tropical theileriosis across North Africa and Asia, and is closely related to <italic>Theileria parva</italic> found in Eastern Africa). This gene has previously been identified to be associated with selective sweeps between water buffalo breeds (elevated XP-CLR statistics between Mediterranean and Jaffrabadi, and Pandharpuri and Banni water buffalo breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]). Characterisation of this gene’s expression profile in the water buffalo expression atlas highlighted that it falls within a macrophage-specific cluster of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Together these results therefore point towards this gene being a potentially important target of selection across bovids due to its role in immune response.Consequently, five of these nine genes under putative selection in African buffalo show strong links to immune response, with two of the remaining genes being uncharacterised and their function being unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S9"><title>African buffalo genome</title><p id="P23">The genome generated in this study represents a substantial improvement on current genomic resources available for <italic>S. caffer</italic>, with greater contiguity and much improved assembly and annotation – this, and the allied gene expression datasets, will hopefully serve as useful resources for the bovid and African buffalo research communities. The genome assembly is currently at the scaffold rather than chromosomal level, and so karyotype and features such as centromeres remain undefined, and the genome also contains Y chromosome and mitochondrial sequences that have not been completely resolved. There is therefore clearly scope for further improvement of the reference genome. An interesting finding was the African buffalo-specific sequence, which was identified after aligning the African buffalo genome to eight existing high quality bovid genome assemblies (cattle, water buffalo, yak and goat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]). <italic>S. caffer</italic> sequences that that did not match any regions in the other assemblies were defined as African buffalo-specific sequence. These sequences were validated by assessing coverage of these African buffalo-specific sequences in randomly selected short read data from the population data, based on the expectation that if these were genuine African buffalo-specific sequence there would be coverage detected in multiple samples, and this was indeed the case. While 57.1% of these African buffalo-specific sequences are repeats, there are 583 genes, 71 pseudogenes, and 194 ncRNAs that are entirely within the identified regions. These were enriched for genes associated with the host defence, and the genes within these regions would clearly be of interest in further studies to identify traits that may be relevant to these African buffalo-specific sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Population genomic structure: taxonomic insights</title><p id="P24">The admixture analysis suggests that the <italic>S. caffer</italic> population splits into three high-level lineages, with a further nine subgroupings apparent that correlate with geographical location. There is little support in our data for the current classification of the four IUCN recognised subspecies; <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> (Eastern and Southern African savannah), <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic> (Western African savannah), <italic>S. c. aequinoctialis</italic> (Central African savannah) and <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> (Western and Central African forest), with <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic> and <italic>S. c. aequinoctialis</italic> sometimes being lumped and treated as a single subspecies, viz. <italic>S. c. brachyceros</italic>. Historically these classifications have been based on a combination of geographical distribution, habitat preferences and morphological features. <italic>Syncerus c. nanus</italic>, the forest buffalo, is the most divergent morphologically, being on average much smaller, predominantly rufous in colour as opposed to black, and with a different horn shape. From this perspective it is perhaps surprising that we could not detect substantial genetic divergence from the Western/Central African savannah buffalo. However, this finding agrees with previous genetic analyses using mitochondrial D-loop sequence markers, which similarly indicated a lack of support for differentiation between Western/Central African ‘subspecies’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, the limited number of samples assigned to <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> did not enable balanced analyses, with in general a smaller number of populations sampled for the Western and Central African regions compared to Eastern and Southern Africa. This may have resulted in some bias in our population analyses. However, we did attempt to mitigate this bias to some extent by reducing populations to 10 samples per population where relevant and possible. Notwithstanding this fact, the present database provides genome-level and -wide resolution on variation (based upon 23,454,419 identified variants relative to the assembled reference genome); a much more robust basis for identifying genetic differentiation than previous methods used to identify genetic substructuring in this species. These insights have parallels with previous genome/multilocus genetic data studies on African ungulates with similar pan-Sub-Saharan distribution, the giraffe (<italic>Giraffa camelopardis</italic>) and zebra (<italic>Equus quagga</italic>), which indicated a lack of correlation of genetic data with morphology-based speciation, in those cases resulting in the identification of cryptic speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>].</p><p id="P25">Admixture and EEMS analyses indicate that the population genomic structure is shaped by geographical barriers, which limit where migration and therefore where lineage and population mixing can happen. This is evidenced by Ugandan buffalo demonstrating ancestry from both Eastern and Western African populations, and there being some signal of East African ancestry in Central African buffalo (<italic>S. c. aequinoctialis, S. c. nanus</italic> and intermediate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Both admixture and EEMS data indicate that Uganda is likely to act as an interface zone between these lineages, although further sampling in relevant populations (for example, known buffalo populations in Eastern CAR and DRC, South Sudan and Western Ethiopia) would help resolve the extent of genetic flow. EEMS analyses suggests that the divergence between the East and West lineages was most likely driven by geography, with the Congo Basin and River effectively creating a barrier to North-South gene flow in the West of the continent, and Uganda being the pinch point at which Central African savannah and forest populations can intersect with Eastern African savannah buffalo.</p><p id="P26">The driving forces shaping the differentiation between Northern and Southern populations of <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> (i.e. between the Kenyan, Ugandan and Tanzanian cluster and the Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa cluster) is less clear from our analyses. A potential role of the Great Rift Valley acting as historical barrier to gene flow has been suggested within other large savannah mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. However, all Tanzanian samples included in the present study originated from the North of the country (the closest population in the Southern cluster being Niassa Special Reserve in Mozambique –approximately 1,000 km from the Northern Tanzanian parks); additional samples from Central and Southern Tanzania where substantial buffalo populations exist (e.g. in Ruaha and Nyerere NPs) could potentially identify animals that are genetically intermediate between the ‘Northern’ and ‘Southern’ clusters, and reveal that there is a steady cline of differentiation within <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> from North to South, as supported by the isolation-by-distance analysis. The data are consistent with the findings of a previous genomic study of <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> across its range, which also concluded that there was a primary split between northern and southern <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> populations approximately 50,000 years ago, followed by gene flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Effective population sizes</title><p id="P27">Although effective population size estimates are difficult to estimate accurately and can be confounded by population structure, the effective population size data interestingly suggests a coincident drop in N<sub>e</sub> with the rise in human N<sub>e</sub> (obtained through the 1,000 Genomes data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]). This is observed in similar analyses applied to both other individual African ungulates (giraffe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] and collated global ruminant data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In the case of African buffalo, previous studies based on both microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data have suggested an expansion approximately 80,000 years ago coincident with the spread of grassland habitat, which was followed by a significant decline ~3-7,000 years ago, probably resulting from an overall increase in arid areas across Africa that are inhospitable to African buffalo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] – our findings are also consistent with these conclusions. For the African buffalo, it was anticipated that the greater resolution provided by genomic data may detect a drop in N<sub>e</sub> observed as a result of the rinderpest virus epidemic of the 1890s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], which anecdotally caused very high mortality of the buffalo populations through Eastern and Southern Africa in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. However, given the relatively recent timing of the rinderpest epidemic and the fact that the N<sub>e</sub> was reducing across the relevant timeframe in our analysis, from the genome data we are not able to infer the impact of rinderpest upon population sizes. Other analyses using lower resolution genetic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] were also not able to detect a drop in N<sub>e</sub> that correlated with the timing of the rinderpest epidemic, although a recent genomic study using samples from <italic>S. c caffer</italic> did identify a very significant drop in N<sub>e</sub> over the past 500 years, which could plausibly be explained by rinderpest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] – notably the decline was particularly steep in samples from Hluhluwe-Umfolozi. While we did not have sufficient numbers in each population to robustly test N<sub>e</sub>, for the closely related groupings of Uganda, Tanzania/Kenya and Zimbabwe/Botswana N<sub>e</sub> estimates were approximately of 1300, 2,000 and 3,000 individuals, respectively. In these clusters at least, there is limited evidence for inbreeding depression, in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, the <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> and South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Hluhluwe-Umfolozi samples showed high levels of homozygosity, meaning that further population-specific work is required in order to assess inbreeding risk. The <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> Hluhluwe-Umfolozi population is known to derive from very small number of founder animals, and our finding is in agreement with previous data that has indicated high inbreeding coefficients and low genome-wide heterozygosity levels in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P28">While we have very limited numbers of <italic>S. c. nanus</italic> samples, the finding of high levels of homozygosity may be explained by the very different features of forest buffalo behaviour, in that relative to savannah buffalo forest buffalo have smaller home ranges, shorter daily movements, negligible seasonal movements and live in significantly smaller group sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This is linked to the forest habitat likely generally acting as a greater barrier to gene flow than savannah environments, limiting migration/dispersal and resulting in comparatively small and isolated populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Genetic diversity metrics such as heterozygosity/homozygosity and effective population size will clearly be an important feature for future studies, particularly where there are increasingly fragmented and isolated populations, as is the case for the West African Savannah buffalo.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Selective Sweeps</title><p id="P29">The selective sweep analyses identified tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1-like (SIRPA-like) as being under selection, independently detected using two distinct and complementary methodologies (P<sub>R</sub> and XP-EHH), and across several population groupings (Ugandan, Tanzanian/Kenyan, South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic>, intermediate and <italic>S. c aequinoctialis</italic> populations). The same locus was identified in selective sweep analyses of the Asian buffalo <italic>Bubalus bubalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and expression analysis in this species identified upregulated gene expression in a macrophage-specific cluster. Interestingly SIRPA has been associated with <italic>Theileria annulata</italic> infection in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], and its gene expression has been shown in independent studies to be significantly upregulated in host cells following infection and the cellular transformation associated with <italic>T. annulata</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].

Although only the Ugandan, Tanzanian/Kenyan and South African <italic>S. c. caffer</italic> populations are within the current distribution of the tick vector (<italic>Rhipicephalus appendiculatus</italic>) of <italic>T. parva</italic>, the historical range and selection of <italic>T. parva</italic> cannot likely be inferred by the current vector distribution. Several other genes detected in the selective sweep analysis have been implicated in the host response to apicomplexan protozoa (which includes <italic>Theileria</italic> species), which lends credence to the hypothesis that the ancient co-evolution and selection pressure exerted by <italic>T. parva</italic> in <italic>S. caffer</italic> may have played a role in shaping the patterns of diversity in relevant regions of the current <italic>S. caffer</italic> genome.

The data also demonstrated that genetic connectivity between populations has historically been constrained by geographical barriers that have shaped the modern population structure (particularly the Congo basin), and that human influence has been for ~10,000 years and remains a main pressure on effective population size and population fragmentation. While most populations do not show signs of inbreeding, particular populations do, and this has implications for conservation and management of the species. Finally, through analyses of selective sweeps, we identified infectious diseases as a likely substantial contributor to historical selection, and hypothesise that protozoan pathogens for which the buffalo has been primary host for millennia may be responsible for driving some of this selection.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P31">DNA samples were obtained through (1) active sampling of animals for this project; this was done in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya, or (2) secondary use of DNA samples previously collected; this included samples previously collected and published from Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], and Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Niger, Burkina Faso, Gabon Central African Republic and Chad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].

For the population samples, approximately 2.5 μg of total DNA from 196 animals sampled across Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Niger, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Central African Republic and Chad; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) was subjected to whole-genome sequencing by Illumina HiSeq; this was performed at a coverage of 30x for 50 samples from Tanzania, with the remaining samples being sequenced at 15x.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Genome assembly</title><p id="P34">A primary assembly of the single molecule PacBio sequencing from OPB4 (mean read lengths &gt; 10Kb) was generated using FALCON and consisted of 7,269 contigs and an N50 of 1.9 Mb. This primary assembly was scaffolded using the Hi-C libraries and the HiRise software by Dovetail. The resulting scaffold-level assembly was further improved via gap filling and polishing steps performed with PBJelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and Pilon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] respectively, as described below. Gap filling: 7,085 gaps (both inter- and intra-scaffolds) were identified in the scaffold-level assembly. A total of 78 inter-scaffold gaps were partially filled (i.e. extended on one side) using PBJelly, with 476,665 bases added in total, while none of the identified gaps were fully closed. This observation confirmed the high quality of the primary assembly achieved from PacBio reads including a post-processing step using Arrow (part of the GenomicConsensus package from PacBio). Polishing: An additional 75x Illumina short read sequencing (101bp paired-end reads) of DNA from the same individual used to build the reference genome assembly (OPB4), was used to polish the <italic>de novo</italic> scaffold-level reference genome assembly. Polishing allows the correction of artefacts due to sequencing errors in assemblies, using the pile up of short reads that are associated with low sequencing error (~1%). This process was performed multiple times and improvement upon quality metrics (i.e. reduced numbers of ambiguous bases, corrected SNPs, resolved small indels, closed gaps) were assessed after each round of Pilon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The rate of improvements reached a plateau between the third (P3) and the fourth (P4) rounds of Pilon, and therefore the resulting P4 polished assembly was considered optimal and used for downstream analysis. Given the reference genome should not contain any homozygote alternate variant calls relative to the short read data from the same sample, we compared how the number of these changed following polishing. The Illumina short reads, sequenced from the same animal as that used to generate the reference genome assembly (OPB4), were mapped with bwa-mem (BWA v0.7.17) against the polished genome assemblies (P2 to P4).

RNA-seq was performed at Edinburgh Genomics on an S2 lane of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform generating 100bp paired-end reads. Iso-Seq was performed at the Centre for Genomic Research at the Univerity of Liverpool, using RNA samples from six different tissues (prescapular lymph node, testis, liver, kidney, lung and spleen) collected from the same animal. Full-length cDNA from total RNA was generated using TeloPrime full-length cDNA amplification kit (v2) from Lexogen. A total of six barcoded TeloPrime libraries from six RNA samples were multiplexed.

The GATK (v4.0.11.0) pipeline, following the best practices as outlined at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036194592-Getting-started-with-GATK4">https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036194592-Getting-started-with-GATK4</ext-link> was used with HaplotypeCaller to identify variants (SNPs and Indels). The GATK best practice includes a Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) step that compares all variant calls to those in a high quality set to identify and flag potential false positives. Unlike in well-characterised species no gold-standard set of variants is available for the African buffalo. We therefore used a consensus set of 6,806,905 variants called from the Illumina data generated for the same sample as the reference genome using three software tools (GATK, Arrow and Longshot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]). Although we do not expect this set to be free of false variant calls, we expect it to be enriched for true positives and was therefore used in VQSR. Three VQSR tranches, 99, 99.9 and 100 (each representing the proportion of gold-standard variants that are retained at each quality threshold), were assessed. The variant set resulting from the 99.9 tranche was selected for downstream analyses with a Ti/Tv ratio of 2.07 and &gt;120M variants. The variant set was further filtered for GQ (Phred-scaled Probability that the call is incorrect) values less than 30 and site missingness of 0.9 (at least 90% of the samples contain data at this site). PLINK (v1.90) was used to calculate sample missingness, the proportion of variant sites missing from each sample, and vcftools (v0.1.13) to calculate the relatedness of all individuals. For downstream analyses, individual samples with a missingness greater than 0.15, additionally individuals that were closer than fourth degree relatedness (relatedness value 0.0625), were also removed, resulting in a variant dataset covering 163 individual animals. We checked for any mapping biases due to use of an East African reference genome, by randomly sampling three animals per country and comparing how read mapping rates differed by longitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).

ADMIXTURE and the identity-by-state phylogenetic tree can benefit from having an even sample size for the different populations/samples deriving from the same location that were tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Therefore, for these analyses we identified a representative subsample for the populations with more than 15 animals. Sample size reduction was carried out using the BITE R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>] to select a representative set of individuals for each population. The reduction process was performed on each population separately. For each group we selected the variants with very high call rate (99%) and highly polymorphic (--maf 0.3). The reduction step in BITE was performed considering only individuals with 95% call rate and up to 10K markers to compute the kinship matrix (options n.trials = 100000, ibs.marker=10000, n.k=2, ibs.thr = 0.95, id.cr=0.95).

Admixture analysis was performed using ADMIXBoots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RenzoTale88/ADMIXBoots">https://github.com/RenzoTale88/ADMIXBoots</ext-link>), a Nextflow workflow that performs bootstrapped admixture (v1.3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>], defining a consensus of the different K at different iterations using CLUMPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>] and generating plots in R. The workflow was run pruning for variants in linkage (plink --indep-pairwise 5000 100 0.3), testing every K between 2 and 15, and with 100 bootstraps of 100,000 markers each. A consensus of the different bootstraps was called using CLUMPP in LargeKGreedy mode. Bar charts for each consensus K, boxplots for the distribution of the CV errors and line plots of the H’ scores of each K were generated from the pipeline automatically. Bootstrapped identity-by-state (IBS) phylogenetic tree was calculated using the nf-PhyloTree workflow (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RenzoTale88/nf-PhyloTree">https://github.com/RenzoTale88/nf-PhyloTree</ext-link>).

These workflows then use a series of custom scripts to generate the individual phylogenetic tree, call the consensus tree and generate the input compliant for GraphLan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. In our case, we ran the workflow allowing for pruning variants in high linkage disequilibrium using plink (--indep-pairwise 5000 100 0.3), then generated 100-bootstrapped IBS-based distances using plink (--distance 1-ibs square flat-missing), allowing repeated variants in each bootstrap and sampling a number of SNPs equalling the number of pruned variants. A consensus tree was generated using a custom python script, converted to phyloXML, annotated for colour and consistency nodes and finally plotted with GraphLan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>].

The runeems_snps program was used to visualise spatial population structure in the African buffalo populations and to identify the geographic barriers to migration preventing gene flow across these populations. The runeems_snps program requires the following data as input files: (1) a matrix of average pairwise genetic dissimilarities, (2) sample coordinates, and (3) a list of habitat coordinates, here covering the natural distribution of African buffalo populations on the African continent, and listed as a sequence of vertices organised as a closed polygon. For the input files for EEMS analysis, a matrix of average pairwise genetic dissimilarities was generated from the pruned set of SNP data, using the bed2diffs_v1 program within the EEMS package. The locations of all African buffalo animals, from which DNA samples were collected for WGS and variant detection, were inputted as longitude and latitude coordinates, indicating either specific sampling locations or the centre of specific geographical regions (<italic>e.g</italic>. national parks) when no other information was available. The list of habitat coordinates was generated based on the known past and present natural distribution of the four subspecies of African buffalo populations (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]) and using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.latlong.net/">https://www.latlong.net/</ext-link> website to identify the latitude and longitude geocoding of point locations on the African continent.
