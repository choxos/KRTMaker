Research with human embryos is challenging. Thus, stem cell models that reproduce hypoblast differentiation provide valuable alternatives. We show here that human naïve PSC to hypoblast differentiation proceeds via reversion to a transitional ICM-like state, from which hypoblast emerges in concordance with the trajectory in human blastocysts. We identified a window when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is critical for hypoblast specification. Revisiting FGF signalling in human embryos revealed that inhibition in the early blastocyst suppresses hypoblast formation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the induction of hypoblast is synergistically enhanced by limiting trophectoderm and epiblast fates. This finding revises previous reports and establishes a conservation in lineage specification between mouse and human. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of human naïve PSC-based models in elucidating mechanistic features of early human embryogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">At the onset of early human embryogenesis, a fertilised zygote undergoes continuous cell division, cellular diversification, and spatial organisation to form a hollow spherical structure, the blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of three primary lineages, the epiblast, trophectoderm, and hypoblast, which will develop into the embryo proper, placenta, and yolk sac. Studies in mice have established a model of sequential lineage segregation during pre-implantation embryogenesis. This begins with the first lineage segregation, which sets apart the extraembryonic trophectoderm from the inner cell mass (ICM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and is followed by the second lineage segregation when the ICM differentiates into naïve epiblast and hypoblast. Morphological observation, immunostaining, and recent advances in single-cell transcriptome analysis of human embryos suggest that the sequential lineage segregation model broadly stands in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The segregation of trophectoderm in human begins around day 4 after fertilisation (dpf) in the morula, followed by hypoblast lineage segregation around dpf 5/ 6 in the inner cell mass of blastocyst. Cross-species comparative studies have also revealed both conserved and human-specific features of lineage specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, due to limited access to human embryos, applicable approaches, and ethical considerations, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms controlling human hypoblast lineage segregation is fragmentary.</p><p id="P4">Human pluripotent stem cells and embryo models can be valuable tools to study cell fate specification. Human naïve pluripotent stem cells (naïve PSCs) display similarity to the epiblast in 6/7 dpf blastocysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We found that human naïve PSCs maintained in PXGL medium retain a greater degree of developmental plasticity compared to mouse ESC counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Inhibition of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and Activin/Nodal signalling (A83-01) enables naïve PSCs to differentiate to trophectoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, one day exposure to PD0325901 and A83-01 yielded a mixed cell culture comprising all three lineages in the blastocyst, including a small population of hypoblast-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This cellular plasticity has been exploited to form three-dimensional organoids resembling blastocysts, called blastoids, that share morphological and transcriptomic similarity to the pre-implantation embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Signalling pathways involved in trophectoderm specification have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> but the naïve PSC to hypoblast differentiation path has not been properly characterised. Furthermore, a key question remains as to how the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation process relates to hypoblast lineage development in the embryo. Here, we delineate the <italic>in vitro</italic> naïve PSC to hypoblast differentiation trajectory and compare it with embryo lineage segregation. We also explore the role of FGF signalling, which is critical for hypoblast specification in mouse, but has previously been suggested to be less important in human.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Initial MEK/ERK and Activin/Nodal inhibition enables hypoblast differentiation from naïve PSCs</title><p id="P5">We have previously shown that human nPSCs differentiate mainly (&gt;60%) to trophectoderm over three days continuous culture in N2B27 basal medium containing MEK/ERK inhibitor (<underline>PD</underline>0325901) and Activin/Nodal inhibitor (<underline>A83</underline>-01)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, one day in <underline>PDA83</underline> followed by N2B27 alone yielded a mixed culture containing a small population of hypoblast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We used this adherent nPSC differentiation to investigate the signalling requirements for hypoblast differentiation. To this end, we generated an OCT4-eGFP and SOX17-tdTomato knock-in double reporter naïve iPSC cell line, niPSC-OS1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). niPSC-OS1 cells expressed the pluripotency marker OCT4-GFP in PXGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, but few, if any, SOX17-tdTomato positive cells were observed during self-renewal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). SOX17-tdTomato positive cells became readily visible under fluorescence microscopy in differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We quantified reporter expression by flow cytometry over the course of the three days of differentiation in either continuous PDA83 (PA condition) or one day in PDA83 with release into N2B27 (PA-N condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The PA condition predominantly gave rise to reporter negative cells with a minor population of OCT4 positive cells. Little or no SOX17-tdTomato expression was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). The double negative cells expressed the trophectoderm marker GATA3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). In the PA-N condition, SOX17-tdTomato expression emerged after 24 hours in N2B27 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>). Typically, after 3 days of culture in PA-N, we observed a mixed culture with ∼20% SOX17-tdTomato+, ∼60% OCT4-GFP+ and ∼20% double-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) and reporter expression confirmed the presence of pluripotency, hypoblast, and trophectoderm lineage markers in the three subpopulations in PA-N cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>). Importantly, when plated directly into N2B27 without PDA83 exposure, the culture largely remained OCT4-eGFP positive with only ∼1% of SOX17-tdTomato+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that exposure to PDA83 is important for both trophectoderm and hypoblast specification.</p><p id="P6">We performed single-cell transcriptome analysis across the three-day differentiation timecourse in PA and PA-N conditions to obtain information on the differentiation trajectories. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualisation showed continuous progression of three distinct fates expressing trophectoderm, hypoblast or formative epiblast markers respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Consistent with our previous reporter profile, continuous PA predominantly induces trophectoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. By contrast, cells in PA-N differentiated to all three fates: a major fraction of cells downregulated expression of naïve epiblast markers, KLF4, KLF5, and TFCP2L1 and acquired expression of later epiblast markers, SFRP2, ETV4, and ETV5, indicative of early formative transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1H</xref>). The remaining cells diverged along the extraembryonic fates: one merged towards the trophectoderm population differentiated in PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E,F</xref>); the second progressively upregulated hypoblast markers GATA6, PDGFRA, GATA4 and FOXA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>In vitro hypoblast differentiation resembles the emergence of nascent hypoblast in the embryo</title><p id="P7">We sought to compare the in vitro differentiation path with hypoblast formation in embryo development. We took advantage of a recent high-resolution embryo single-cell UMAP embedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This integrated embedding utilises entropy sort feature weighting (cESFW) for feature selection (3012 genes). The data covers pre-implantation (dpf 3 to 7) to in vitro cultured post-implantation (dpf 8 to 14) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The UMAP displays a continuous trajectory for formation of hypoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Following the segregation of trophectoderm, ICM cells reach a branch point at dpf 5/6 expressing both ICM (NANOG, LAMA4) and early hypoblast (PDGFRA, GATA6) markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These cells resolve to either NANOG negative nascent hypoblast, or GATA6 negative nascent epiblast. The nascent hypoblast cells at dpf 6/7 begin to express FOXA2 and GATA4, two markers expressed exclusively in the hypoblast lineage in the pre-implantation blastocyst. The hypoblast continues towards hypoblast derivatives in extended culture samples (dpf 8-14 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), with upregulation of APOB, PODXL, HABP2, which have been shown to be expressed in yolk-sac endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The definitive endoderm, which emerges during post-implantation gastrulation stage embryogenesis, shares many markers, such as SOX17, GATA6, FOXA2, with the hypoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We therefore took advantage of a recent scRNA-seq resource of a ∼dpf19/cs7 gastrulation stage embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> to identify genes that are either lowly or non-expressed in definitive endoderm but are present in hypoblast, such as PDGFRA, RSPO3, HNF4A, LGALS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). These genes all show significant expression in nPSC-derived hypoblast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We projected the in vitro differentiation time course onto the embryo embedding based on transcriptome similarity over the 3012 gene set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, most naïve PSCs in PXGL position over dpf 6/7 naïve epiblast. The initial 24h of PDA83 treatment did not change this placement. Releasing into N2B27, however, saw a sub-population of cells shift to the epiblast/hypoblast branching point within 24 hours and reach the dpf 6/7 nascent blastocyst stage after 48 hours. In the embryo embedding, the nascent hypoblast emerges from a cluster of cells expressing NANOG, PDGFRA and GATA6. By immunofluorescence, we confirmed widespread co-expression of NANOG and GATA6 protein, as well as the presence of a subpopulation of triple-positive NANOG/GATA6/PDGFRA cells following release into N2B27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, NANOG/GATA6 double positive cells had low-mid expression of NANOG. These observations are consistent with previous descriptions of a mutually antagonistic interaction between these transcription factors in the mouse ICM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Few cells cultured in PXGL co-express NANOG/GATA6 with no PDGFRA expression detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results suggest that naïve PSC to hypoblast differentiation in PA-N proceeds via reversion to the epiblast/hypoblast branching stage of ICM.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Naïve PSC to hypoblast differentiation requires FGF signalling</title><p id="P9">The preceding results show that MEK/ERK inhibition initially enables hypoblast differentiation potential of naïve PSCs, but the inhibition must be relieved for specification to occur. In the mouse ICM, the FGF/ERK/GATA6 signalling axis plays an instructive role in specifying hypoblast fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The FGF expressing cells activate FGF signalling in receptor-expressing cells, which leads to ERK-dependent upregulation of GATA6, downregulation of NANOG, and initiation of the hypoblast specification program. We surveyed FGF receptor and ligand expression in human embryo data and PA-N differentiation time course. In embryos, FGFR1 and FGFR2 are broadly expressed in ICM, epiblast, and hypoblast. Low expression of the FGF ligands, FGF4, was detected in ICM and followed by a prominent upregulation in nascent epiblast cells. This expression pattern resembles the restricted FGF4 expression in mouse ICM and epiblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Human naïve PSCs express FGF2 and FGF4 but lack an appreciable expression level of FGF receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). In vitro hypoblast differentiation is associated with the downregulation of FGF4/FGF2 ligands and upregulation of FGF receptors as well as GATA6 and PDGFRA upon release from PDA83 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We directly examined the function of FGF signalling during PA-N differentiation. We applied a FGF receptor inhibitor PD173074 (PD17) to inhibit the activation of FGF signalling and assayed hypoblast differentiation efficiency by OCT4-eGFP/SOX17-tdTomato reporter expression. We added PD17 either immediately following PDA83 induction (PA-PD17) or delayed for 24 hours after PDA83 (PA-N-PD17). We thus aimed to investigate FGF function at two hypoblast differentiation stages – during the epiblast/hypoblast branch point (PA-17) or after the branch point (PA-N-PD17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed a dramatic reduction of SOX17-tdTomato + population from ∼14% to ∼2% in PA-PD17 condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). However, delayed FGF inhibition in PA-N-PD17 condition failed to effectively block SOX17-tdTomato expression, as only a small reduction in SOX17-tdTomato expressing cells, from ∼14% to 11%, was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), indicating that most cells released for 24 hrs in N2B27 had already been specified to hypoblast fate, and the establishment of FOXA2+ GATA4+ nascent hypoblast cells is not dependent on FGF signalling. These results point out that FGF signalling is crucial in initiating hypoblast lineage at the epiblast/hypoblast branch point but is not required for later progression.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Hypoblast formation in blastoids also requires FGF/MEK/ERK signalling</title><p id="P11">We and others have previously reported the formation of a 3D blastocyst model, the blastoid, from naïve PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Immunostaining and single cell transcriptome analysis revealed that the fully expanded blastoid contains hypoblast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the dynamics of hypoblast lineage segregation in the blastoid have not been described. We examined hypoblast lineage marker expression by immunofluorescence staining over the course of blastoid formation. Blastoids were formed by clustering naïve PSCs in non-adherent U-shaped wells in trophectoderm inductive PDA83 medium for 2 days, followed by one day of A83 treatment, and then one day of N2B27 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We saw widespread upregulation of GATA6 after 48 hours in PDA83 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Following medium exchange to A83, the early hypoblast marker PDGFRA appeared in some inner cells at 60 hrs and was widespread by 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). FOXA2 was detected later than PDGFRA, matching the sequence of activation observed in the blastocyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, FOXA2-positive cells were almost always positioned beneath the OCT4-positive epiblast population, indicating that this marker appears during or after spatial segregation of the hypoblast. The number of FOXA2+ cells was variable between blastoids. We quantified OCT4+ epiblast cells and FOXA2+ hypoblast cells in 15 blastoids at time points during blastoid formation. We saw sporadic FOXA2 in a minority of blastoids at 60 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Over the following 2 days, the number of FOXA2 cells increased. By 96 hrs all blastoids examined contained FOXA2-positive cells, comprising from ∼2% to ∼25% of total inside cells.</p><p id="P12">We investigated whether FGF signalling underpins hypoblast formation in blastoids. We made blastoids from niPSC-OS1 and showed that inhibiting FGF signalling early in PD17, after release from PDA83, abolished nearly all SOX17-tdTomato+ cells in blastoids examined at 96 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>). 24 hours of delay in application of PD17 showed a reduced effect. 35 of 36 blastoids contained bright SOX17-tdTomato+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). Likewise, we made blastoids using HNES1 GATA3:mkO2 cells and similarly showed that inhibiting FGF signalling directly after release from PDA83, abolished nearly all FOXA2+ hypoblast cells in blastoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I, J</xref>). Delayed application of PD17 led to a mild reduction in FOXA2+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I, J</xref>). In mouse, FGF promotes hypoblast specification via activation of MEK/ERK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We examined hypoblast formation in niPSC-OS1 blastoids subjected to MEK/ERK inhibition with PD03 following release from PDA83. We found that 2-3 uM PD03 impeded Sox17-tdTomato+expression effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>). However, lower concentrations of PD03 (1uM) showed only partial inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that FGF/MEK/ERK signalling is required in hypoblast specification in human blastoids.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Signalling environment enhances hypoblast differentiation</title><p id="P13">Hypoblast-like cells constitute less than 20% of cells after 2D differentiation in PA-N. We investigated whether this could be increased by adjusting the signalling environment. Release from 24hrs PDA83 treatment into varying concentrations of FGF2 (up to 250 ng/ml) or FGF4 led to only a modest increase in the number of SOX17-tdTomato + cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref>), indicating that autocrine FGF production is near saturating. Supplementation with Activin or the GSK3 inhibitor, Chiron 99021, two components purported to promote mouse and human extraembryonic endoderm differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, reduced the SOX17-tdTomato population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The reporter assay and differentiation trajectory analysis showed that epiblast and trophectoderm cells are major populations in the PA-N differentiation. We reasoned that hypoblast differentiation may be enhanced by reducing the epiblast and trophectoderm potential. We tested Activin/Nodal inhibition by A83-01 to destabilise pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and tankyrase inhibition by XAV-939 to limit trophectoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The addition of A83-01 reduced OCT4 positive population by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>), and the addition of XAV-939 reduced the trophectoderm (SOX17<sup>-</sup>/OCT4<sup>-</sup>) population as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). However, treatment with single inhibition did not dramatically increase SOX17+ population. Either combined with FGF2 (25 ng/ml) synergistically increased the SOX17-tdTomato+ population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Combining all three inhibitors FGF2+A8301+XAV939 (hereby referred to as FA83X) resulted in the most significant increase in SOX17-tdTomato+ population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). One day of PDA83 treatment followed by two days of FA83X culture yields ∼40% SOX17+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). We sorted SOX17+ cells by flow cytometry and examined the gene expression profile of the FA83X differentiation time course by bulk RNA sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5G</xref>).

PA-N and PA-FA83X cells largely intermingled along the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Leiden cluster analysis identified 10 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Marker expression assigned three main trajectories along the differentiation time course. Naïve PSCs (cluster 0) either transitioned to formative epiblast (clusters 1, 8, 9, 10) or reached a branching population (cluster 2) from which they diverged to hypoblast-like (clusters 3, 4) or trophectoderm-like fate (cluster 6, 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). By the end of the differentiation, a distinct cluster (Cluster 5) is present. This cluster showed enriched expression in genes associated with extraembryonic mesoderm in marmoset peri-implantation embryos, including genes related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (BMP4, LEF1, ZEB2, ETS1, MEIS2, FLI1, and HAND1) and extracellular matrix organisation (COL4A2, ITGA3, HAPLN1, KDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). We therefore annotated this cluster as ExEM-like cells.</p><p id="P18">We focused on characterisation of hypoblast formation in PA-FA83X. We first examined global transcriptome similarity to embryo lineages and projected the PA-FA83X time course on the integrated embryo UMAP embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Like the PA-N time course, PA-FA83X differentiation begins with a transition towards a branching point where ICM cells bifurcate to epiblast and hypoblast before progressing to dpf 6/7 nascent hypoblast. Compared to PA-N, FA83X accelerated hypoblast lineage maturation. After 48 hours in FA83X, cells are positioned adjacent to hypoblast derivatives while PA-N cells mostly remain over nascent hypoblast.</p><p id="P19">We collated panels of genes enriched in epiblast and hypoblast lineages and examined their expression dynamics along hypoblast development in the embryo embedding and in the FA83X differentiation time course UMAP (cluster 0, 2, 3, 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). The genes are grouped into 5 classes according to expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Group 1 are pluripotent genes, including NANOG and DPPA5, which are expressed in ICM and sustained in the epiblast/hypoblast branch and epiblast but switched off in the nascent hypoblast. Group 2 are ICM markers and mostly sustained in epiblast/hypoblast branch, but downregulated in the epiblast and nascent hypoblast, such as GSC and LAMA4. Group 3 are expressed in ICM and throughout hypoblast development (GATA6, PDGFRA). Group 4 and Group 5 are hypoblast-specific markers that appear either in mature blastocyst hypoblast (FOXA2, GATA4) or late in hypoblast derivatives (APOB, IHH). In vitro hypoblast differentiation exhibited similar gene expression dynamics to the trajectory in the real embryo from the ICM-like branching population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). In vitro differentiation began with NANOG and DAPPA5 expressing epiblast-like cells (cluster 0), Cells expressed ICM and early hypoblast markers including GATA6, PDGFRA, GSC and LAMA4 within 12 hrs in FA83X after release from PDA83 (mostly cluster 2). Over the following 36 hours in FA83X the expression of epiblast and ICM markers NANOG, DPPA5, GSC and LAMA4 gradually diminished, and hypoblast-specific gene expression was up-regulated (cluster 3,4). After 48 hours of differentiation in FA83X, a group of peri/post-implantation yolk-sac endoderm markers are detected including IHH and APOB, two markers expressed in primate hypoblast lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). By pseudo-temporal ordering, we delineated the sequential activation of a spectrum of markers along the morula to hypoblast trajectory in the embryo embedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). We plotted these markers in our 10x in vitro timecourse and found they broadly mirrored the temporal upregulation of the hypoblast markers in embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Taken together, the global transcriptome and marker expression comparison between embryo and in vitro differentiation support the conclusion that both PA-N and PA-FA83X differentiation reflect hypoblast lineage specification dynamics in the blastocyst. In vitro differentiation is initiated with the onset of co-expression of ICM and early hypoblast markers, partially overlapping with the late ICM and epiblast/hypoblast branch in the embryo embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, 5D</xref>). We refer to this as a naïve epiblast towards ICM-like reversion, a pivotal step in enabling hypoblast lineage specification in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Hypoblast lineage specification in the human embryo depends on FGF signalling</title><p id="P21">These stem-cell based studies indicate that FGF is critical to initiate hypoblast differentiation from an ICM-like state. We therefore examined whether FGF signalling plays a similar role in the embryo. To capture the window of emerging hypoblast, we applied PD17 to early day 5 blastocysts, a stage when most ICM cells are positioned before the epiblast/hypoblast branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We removed the zona pellucida to ensure free access of the inhibitor to the embryo. The freshly thawed dpf 5 embryos were cultured either in N2B27 basal medium or with 0.5 μM PD17 for 24-40 hours until they developed fully expanded blastocoel cavities with a recognisable ICM and the appearance of smaller trophectoderm cells, traits of late dpf 6/7 blastocysts. The embryos were fixed and immunostained for NANOG (epiblast), SOX17 and FOXA2 (hypoblast), and GATA3 (trophectoderm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We examined thirteen PD17-treated embryos and eleven control (N2B27) embryos in three independent experiments. All control embryos contained SOX17 or FOXA2-positive hypoblast cells within the ICM, exclusive of NANOG-positive cells. In PD17-treated groups, two embryos did not contain an ICM. Seven out of the remaining eleven embryos contained NANOG positive epiblast but were devoid of hypoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). PD17-treated embryos contained on average a higher number of epiblast cells compared to the control embryos, which is consistent with a hypoblast to epiblast lineage switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). This result mirrors the phenotype of mouse embryos treated with FGFR or MEK inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The PD17-treated embryos had an intact blastocyst cavity, indicating no general cellular toxicity. However, four of the 11 PD17-treated embryos escaped the hypoblast lineage blockage, displaying a similar hypoblast cell number as the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The developmental pace of human IVF embryos varies and staging based on morphology is not precise. We speculate that the embryos that formed hypoblast in PD17 may have been at a more advanced stage when exposed to PD17.</p><p id="P22">Finally, to examine whether FGF can promote hypoblast formation, we cultured dpf 5 embryos until the late blastocyst stage in medium supplemented with FGF2(250 ng/ml). Quantification of FOXA2 and NANOG expressing cells within the ICM showed a dramatic increase in hypoblast cell number at the expense of epiblast in 4 out of 4 FGF-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E, F, G</xref>). These results together reveal the critical role of FGF in hypoblast lineage specification in early human blastocysts and establish consistency with findings in the mouse embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Embryogenesis is a process of dynamic cell fate specification and spatial organisation, which must be well-coordinated to ensure developmental robustness. The limited research access to early embryos has hampered studies of human embryogenesis. Stem cell-based embryo models are, therefore promising as a scalable alternative. However, to be a useful model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate specification during development a model must faithfully capture the developmental dynamics and signalling logic in the early embryo. In this study, we establish an in vitro cellular model for human hypoblast lineage segregation. Following a short period of exposure to MEK/ERK and Activin/Nodal inhibition, human naïve pluripotent stem cells transition to an ICM-like state whence they give rise to hypoblast and trophectoderm. Single-cell transcriptome analysis indicates that the in vitro ICM-like state to hypoblast differentiation mirrors the ICM to hypoblast trajectory in the embryo. Authentic nascent hypoblast emerges in in vitro cultures that closely approximates dpf 6/7 hypoblast <italic>in vivo</italic> and further develops features of yolk-sac-like endoderm.</p><p id="P24">A key finding in hypoblast differentiation in both adherent and blastoid cultures is the indispensable role of FGF signalling. Our experiments have uncovered a transient developmental window during which FGF signalling plays a critical role in determining the fate of the hypoblast. This 24-hour window in the differentiation timeline aligns with the early dpf5 embryo before the divergence of hypoblast and epiblast within ICMs. Our in vitro findings align with <italic>in vivo</italic> results, as inhibiting FGF signalling in dpf 5 embryos led to the suppression of hypoblast formation. Additionally, we demonstrated that the addition of FGF2 to dpf 5 embryos resulted in the conversion of nearly all ICM cells into hypoblast cells, further substantiating the pivotal role of this signalling pathway in hypoblast specification. It must be noted that two previous studies with human embryos failed to establish a requirement for FGF signalling in hypoblast lineage specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, those experiments used the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 at concentrations of only 0.5 μM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> or 1.0 μM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> while we found a concentration of 2.0 μM is required to suppress hypoblast specification in blastoids. Thus, by enabling more systematic investigation, the stem cell models have clarified the signalling mechanism directing hypoblast specification in human embryo.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="P25">Currently there is limited transcriptome data available on post-implantation stage human embryo hypoblast derivatives. Consequently, we cannot accurately distinguish the various derivatives of the hypoblast generated by in vitro differentiation. Moreover, additional single cell transcriptome data for dpf 5-dpf 6 embryos may provide greater resolution of, and more markers for, the late ICM hypoblast-epiblast branch point. The limited availability of human embryos and the challenges in precisely determining their developmental stage constrain the scale and scope of our study. In addition, we no longer have access to morula stage embryos and therefore cannot repeat inhibitor experiments exactly as performed in earlier studies. Two factors that may have influenced the outcome of previous studies, the half-life of inhibitors in culture with embryos and the effect of the zona pellucida on access to the embryo, have not been quantified.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Thawing and culture of human embryos</title><p id="P26">Use of supernumerary embryos is approved by the Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, approval 04/MRE03/44, Integrated Research Application System (IRAS) 21/PR/1231 and licensed by the Human Embryology and Fertilization Authority of the United Kingdom under the research license R0178.</p><p id="P27">Surplus frozen human embryos were donated for research after informed consent by couples following in vitro fertilization treatment.
