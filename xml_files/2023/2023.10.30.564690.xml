Viruses such as influenza A viruses (IAV) interact with RBPs to regulate processes including splicing, nuclear export and trafficking, while also encoding RBPs within their genomes, such as NP and NS1. But with almost 1000 RBPs encoded within the human genome it is still unclear what role, if any, many of these proteins play during viral replication. Using the RNA interactome capture (RIC) technique, we isolated RBPs from IAV infected cells to unravel the RBPome of mRNAs from IAV infected human cells. This led to the identification of one particular RBP, MKRN2, that associates with and positively regulates IAV mRNA. Through further validation, we determined that MKRN2 is involved in the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of IAV mRNA likely through an association with the RNA export mediator GLE1. In the absence of MKRN2, IAV mRNAs accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells, which we suspect leads to their degradation by the nuclear RNA exosome complex. MKRN2, therefore, appears to be required for the efficient nuclear export of IAV mRNAs in human cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In recent years, our understanding of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactome has become significantly more informed. The development of methods such as RNA-interactome capture (RIC), enhanced RIC (eRIC) and RNA affinity pulldown mass spectrometry (RAP-MS), has allowed researchers to further elucidate the true RBPome of total mRNAs, as well as individual RNAs, in a given cell population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> These techniques, in addition to viral cross-linking and solid-phase purification (VIR-CLASP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> have now been used to good effect to identify the RBPome of viral RNAs from Sindbis virus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Chikungunya virus (CHIKV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and, in multiple studies, SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">It has been reported previously, in cell culture, that influenza A virus (IAV) mRNAs can comprise up to 50% of the total mRNA population of an infected cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we reasoned that use of the RIC method, resulting in the purification of total mRNAs and their interacting proteins, would be ideal for the identification of pro-viral host RBPs potentially hijacked during IAV replication. Unravelling the IAV RBPome is essential to better understand the post-transcriptional regulation of IAV mRNAs. Additionally, this knowledge is critical for a better comprehension of the properties surrounding viral RNA stability, nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, and translation, all of which are governed by RBPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> In particular, this method could provide a more thorough understanding into how intronless IAV mRNAs escape the nucleus after transcription. Though this is still an open question, a recent study by Bhat et al (2023) has shed some light on this process of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking. The authors reported that the TREX-2 complex is recruited to viral mRNAs, then through an association with NXF1, the viral mRNAs are efficiently exported via the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P4">Herein, we aimed to unravel novel host factors important in the post-transcriptional processing of IAV mRNA. Indeed, we identified numerous RBPs that, when their expression was manipulated, had a negative impact on viral replication kinetics. This work concentrates primarily on the understudied MKRN2 protein, a member of a family of Makorin zinc finger domain-containing proteins, that encodes for 4 classical C<sub>3</sub>H zinc finger RNA binding domains, an RNA binding Makorin Cys-His domain, and a RING-type zinc finger domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> MKRN2 has previously been implicated in mouse infertility, and cancer cell proliferation, while one recent report revealed its involvement in mRNA nuclear trafficking in zebrafish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">In this study we uncover differences in the RBPome of poly(A)+ RNA upon infection with different strains of H1N1 IAV. We reveal the importance of one of these RBPs, MKRN2, in the post-transcriptional processing of IAV mRNAs, specifically in regard to viral mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate that GLE1, a proven interactor of MKRN2 and a component of mRNA nuclear export machinery elicits the same effects on viral mRNAs. Finally, we speculate that MKRN2 may act as an mRNA export adapter protein to recruit factors such as FYTTD1 and the nuclear export complex, leading to the efficient export of viral mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RIC methodology effectively identifies RBPs in influenza A virus-infected cells</title><p id="P6">To initially determine the RBPome of mRNAs from influenza A virus-infected cells, we employed the RIC approach referred to previously. This technique allows for the purification of all proteins bound to poly(A)+ RNA through conventional UV crosslinking, followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Minimally, influenza A virus encodes for 10 distinct poly(A)+ mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Following pulldown of all poly(A)+ mRNA and covalently crosslinked proteins, from mock, A/WSN/33 infected or A/California/7/2009 infected A549 cells, a silver stain was performed to confirm the presence of a diverse protein population suitable for mass spectrometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Indeed, we suspected that viral NP protein was visible as a band at approximately 55kDa on the A/WSN/33 pulldown sample, and to a lesser extent in the A/California/7/2009 pulldown sample. Additionally, Western blot analysis confirmed the viral RBP NP was present only in infected samples, as well as in pulldown samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). The presence of a known cellular mRNA RBP, YTHDF2, was confirmed in all RIC samples, while ACTB, not believed to be an RBP, was also blotted as a RIC negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Finally, we confirmed by qPCR that the RIC samples contained substantial amounts of viral mRNAs, namely NP and NA mRNA, when compared to the mock, while the GAPDH and ACTB mRNAs were equally distributed among all 3 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of the mRNA RBPome of influenza A virus infected cells</title><p id="P7">Upon TMT labelling, mass spectrometry and quantitative analysis of the 9 RIC samples on MaxQuant and Perseus, we determined the RBPome for each test condition. Additionally, we quantified enrichment of RBP abundance in A/WSN/33 over mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), and A/California/7/2009 over mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Adjusted P values were also calculated, with a cutoff of p&lt;0.05. NP was found to have the strongest P value of any RBP for both viruses, which is not surprising considering its strong RNA-binding capabilities. The same is true for NS1, which was the most highly enriched protein in the A/WSN/33 infected samples. For A/WSN/33 infected cells, the 3 influenza polymerase proteins, PB2, PB1 and PA, as well as HA and M1 were also found to be enriched, likely as these proteins are not present in the mock sample. Statistically, they could be misinterpreted as overrepresented in the A/WSN/33 RBPome. So, their inclusion here does not confirm or discount their potential to be mRNA binding proteins. Altogether, we observed good concordance between the RBPs in the A/WSN/33 and A/California/7/2009 infected samples, with &gt;75% and &gt;78% of all enriched and depleted RBPs, respectively, found in both datasets. We then sought to better understand whether RBPs involved in specific pathways or processes are being enriched or depleted in these IAV infected samples. We generated a list of proteins that were altered by &gt;0.5 fold in A/WSN/33 infected cells and determined the biological Slim GO term associated with these datasets. We found that the RBP dataset we identified as being enriched on poly(A)+ RNA in A/WSN/33 infected cells is predominantly comprised of proteins involved in cellular stress responses, such as temperature. In contrast, the dataset from depleted RBPs was comprised of proteins involved in splicing and mRNA transport. The reduction in the binding of RBPs related to splicing function in A/WSN/33 infected cells can be explained by the fact that only M and NS segment are spliced in A/WSN/33.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Validation of potential pro-viral IAV mRNA binding proteins</title><p id="P8">To validate selected enriched RBPs from our RBPome dataset, we used a A/WSN/33 reporter virus expressing a PA-mNeon fusion protein in place of wild-type PA. Infected cells were identified by the presence of green fluorescence. siRNA mediated knockdown was performed in A549 cells for 8 different RBPs identified from our dataset, alongside a non-specific control siRNA (NSC), and a control siRNA targeting ALYREF, a cellular RBP involved in the export of spliced host mRNAs. An siRNA targeting FYTTD1, a known nuclear mRNA interacting protein, was also included. After 48h of siRNA knockdown, cells were infected with the reporter virus for 16h, before the visualisation of cells by fluorescence microscopy and protein extraction and Western blotting. Western blotting revealed a clear decrease in viral protein expression in cells depleted for SUMO3, HNRNPA1, MKRN2 (but not MKRN1) and EIF5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). For the most part, this was consistent with the quantification of mNeon positive cells by fluorescence microscopy, with all 4 of these knockdowns almost completely abrogating WSN PA-mNeon protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B &amp; C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Interestingly, the enriched RBPome dataset contained MKRN1 and MKRN2, two RBPs from the same protein family with similar structures. However, depletion of these proteins yielded very different effects on A/WSN/33 infection. We were curious as to the cause of this phenotypic difference, so we chose to proceed with the characterisation of MKRN2 and its role in IAV replication. Viral RNA-binding capabilities of MKRN2 were validated through CLIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). HEK293T cells expressing a C-terminally Flag-tagged mCherry or MKRN2 were infected with wild-type A/WSN/33 virus for 16h. Cells were then UV crosslinked, lysed and an immunoprecipitation was performed for Flag. Input and pulldown protein samples were assessed by Western blotting, demonstrating a purification of Flag-tagged mCherry or MKRN2 and the absence of ACTB in the pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). Additionally, RNA was isolated from the input and pulldown samples, followed by qPCR to quantify the levels of NP and NA mRNA. Normalising to the mCherry input levels, we observed that the NP and NA mRNA input levels were comparable, while in the pulldown samples the viral transcripts were enriched by up to 60-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). These findings provided strong evidence for the RNA-binding capabilities of MKRN2 to IAV mRNAs in this context.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MKRN2 as a novel pro-viral host factor</title><p id="P10">We sought to further our understanding of the pro-viral nature of MKRN2, and whether the observed relationship is conserved among additional IAV strains. After validation of the MKRN2 siRNA pool by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), we performed multicycle infections of A549 MKRN2 depleted cells with A/WSN/33, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 A/California/7/2009 virus and an H3N2 A/Norway/466/2014 strain. MKRN2 knockdown resulted in a significant and reproducible reduction in viral replication of all three strains at 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B-D</xref>). As the A/California/7/2009 strain is more clinically relevant and similar to a bona fide and circulating human H1N1 seasonal strain of IAV, we decided to proceed with further characterisation of the mechanism of action of MKRN2 using the A/California/7/2009 virus. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B-D</xref>). To confirm if the observed phenotypes are MKRN2 specific, we generated a stably expressing Flag-tagged MKRN2 overexpression A549 cell line via lentiviral transduction and single cell cloning. We aimed to use this cell line as a rescue system. Western blotting confirmed that the Flag-tagged and endogenous wild-type MKRN2 were expressed in untransfected and siNSC transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). The MKRN2 siRNA used throughout, termed here as siCDS due to its targeting of the coding sequence, successfully knocked down the expression of both forms of MKRN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). Whereas a newly designed siRNA targeting the 3’ UTR of MKRN2, termed siUTR, that is only present on the wild-type mRNA, depleted only the endogenously encoded MKRN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). The increased levels of MKRN2 did not alter the replication dynamics of A/California/7/2009 (data not shown). Similarly, to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>, we observed a robust decrease in viral titres from MKRN2 overexpression cells when overall MKRN2 protein levels are reduced. In contrast, when only the endogenous wild-type MKRN2 protein is reduced, we see no significant reduction in viral titre, likely due to the ongoing expression of Flag-tagged MKRN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>). This confirmed that the siRNA mediated reduction in viral titres observed was MKRN2 specific.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MKRN2 expression is positively correlated with IAV mRNA levels</title><p id="P11">Given the global reduction in IAV gene expression and replication in MKRN2 depleted cells, we proceeded to investigate which stage of the viral replication cycle is likely affected by the loss of MKRN2. To accomplish this, we performed single cycle growth curves and assessed A/California/7/2009 NP mRNA and vRNA levels by qPCR. We detected a significant reduction in NP mRNA in siMKRN2 treated cells at 6 hpi, however, no difference in NP-vRNA levels was observed at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). This phenotype was recapitulated in A/WSN/33 growth curves, where viral mRNA levels in a single round infection were significantly lower when MKRN2 was depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 2</xref>). This suggests a role of MKRN2 in regulating viral mRNA early in infection.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>MKRN2 nuclear relocalisation upon infection affects IAV mRNA levels</title><p id="P12">As we observed this inhibitory phenotype early in infection, we wanted to better understand the role MKRN2 may play at this stage of the IAV replication cycle. We therefore decided to visualise the subcellular distribution of MKRN2 over the course of an infection. The localisation of MKRN2 and NP were imaged at 0, 4 and 8 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). It was initially observed that MKRN2 has a uniform distribution in A549 cells across both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, amounting to an average nuclear fraction of 0.24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>), and remaining mostly unchanged at 4 hpi. As expected, the percentage of NP protein in the nucleus increased during the course of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). However, at 8 hpi, we observed a significant shift in MKRN2 distribution from the cytoplasm to the nucleus amounting to on average an ~0.35 nuclear fraction of MKRN2 protein This constitutes an almost 50% increase in the nuclear fraction of MKRN2 in infected cells, and hints at a role for MKRN2 in the processing of IAV mRNA in the nucleus.</p><p id="P13">With this clear relocalisation of MKRN2 occurring after 4 hpi, we analysed the effect of MKRN2 depletion on primary influenza mRNA transcripts after this timepoint. For this, we halted translation via cycloheximide treatment at 1 hpi and quantified the levels of 8 A/California/7/2009 mRNAs by qPCR at 6 and 8 hpi (M1 and NS1 cannot be quantified without also detecting M2 and NS2 transcripts, respectively). As expected, MKRN2 mRNA levels were significantly depleted in siMKRN2-treated cells, while NP vRNA levels were unaltered at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). At 6 hpi we did not observe a significant change in the levels of any IAV transcripts, though they were all on average decreased in siMKRN2 treated cells compared to siNSC treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). However, by 8 hpi, the primary IAV transcripts in the MKRN2 depleted cells were significantly decreased when compared to NSC treated cells, except for NA mRNA, which on average was lower but not significantly reduced (p=0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). Between 6 and 8 hpi, the levels of IAV transcripts were not significantly altered in the control, as we believe primary transcription is likely to have peaked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>). Due to the differences in IAV mRNA levels between 6 and 8 hpi in depleted cells, we hypothesise that IAV mRNAs may be accumulating in the nucleus of MKRN2 treated cells, likely leading to the degradation of viral mRNAs by the nuclear RNA exosome machinery. Therefore, we sought to uncover how the presence of MKRN2 may prevent the degradation of viral mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Nuclear export of IAV mRNA is inhibited by MKRN2 depletion</title><p id="P14">One recent study by Wolf et al. (2020), performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of GFP tagged human RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases, including MKRN1, MKRN2 and MKRN3. We acquired and reanalysed the raw MS data to compare protein interactors between these three MKRN-family RBPs. Given the discrepancy between MKRN1 and MKRN2 in reducing IAV expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A &amp; B</xref>), we were interested in determining the specific interactome of each protein. In total, all 3 MKRN proteins were found to interact with a common set of 226 proteins. MKRN1 and MKRN3 interacted with 3 unique proteins, while MKRN2 had 7 unique interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>), 5 of which were in common with the original published analysis. STRING analysis of the latter set of proteins uncovered that the 7 interactors complex together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>) and are generally found to be involved in RNA transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). This finding, in conjunction with the observations of Wolf et al. (2020) highlighted that MKRN2 association likely affects mRNA nuclear export. Alongside the relocalisation of MKRN2 during infection this prompted us to investigate if MKRN2 aids IAV mRNA export, which would in turn prevent their degradation mediated by nuclear retention.</p><p id="P15">To this end, we performed a nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionation followed by qPCR in siRNA transfected cells infected with A/California/7/2009 for 8h and treated with cycloheximide at 1 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). The purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was confirmed by Western blotting for Lamin A/C (nuclear) and GAPDH (cytoplasmic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). qPCR analysis revealed an approximately 4-fold increase in the concentration of PA and NP mRNA in the cytoplasm when compared to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>). GAPDH, HPRT1, and ACTB were found to be increased ~5-fold in the cytoplasmic over the nuclear fraction. MKRN2 mRNA levels served as an additional control for our fractionation. As expected, we only observed a knockdown of MKRN2 mRNA levels in the cytoplasm, consistent with the subcellular localisation of the RISC complex. Upon siRNA knockdown of MKRN2, we observed a significant decrease in PA and NP cytoplasmic mRNA levels, while levels of GAPDH, HPRT1 and ACTB were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>). These findings indicated to us that a loss of MKRN2 inhibits efficient export of viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P16">To confirm the persistence of this phenotype beyond the context of infection, a mini-replicon assay was performed in siRNA treated cells. Components of the influenza polymerase complex were transfected into HEK293T cells allowing the transcription of authentic viral mRNAs from a full length A/WSN/33 HA segment or a control mCherry mRNA pseudo segment carrying the HA packaging signal (psi) within the 5’ and 3’ UTRs. Consistent with previous results, upon fractionation we observed significantly less HA mRNA and mCherry-HApsi mRNA in the cytoplasmic fraction upon depletion of MKRN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6G</xref>). This indicated to us that MKRN2 association with viral mRNA is likely mediated by the 5’ and 3’ psi.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>The MKRN2-GLE1 complex contributes to IAV mRNA nuclear export</title><p id="P17">To decipher whether MKRN2 and GLE1 work in concert to mediate nuclear-cytoplasmic export of viral mRNA, we repeated the fractionation experiment in the context of GLE1 knockdown. Interestingly, knockdown of GLE1 phenocopied MKRN2 depletion, with both PA and NP mRNA levels significantly reduced in the cytoplasm, while again levels of GAPDH, HPRT1 and ACTB remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6H</xref>). Additionally, GLE1 knockdown was confirmed by qPCR were a knockdown of expression occurred solely in the siGLE1 cytoplasmic fraction. To confirm that this observed reduction in cytoplasmic viral mRNA levels was reflected at the protein level, we performed a mini-replicon assay with the mCherry pseudo segment and measured the red fluorescence in cells depleted for MKRN2 or GLE1. Indeed, in the absence of MKRN2 or GLE1, we observed a significant reduction in mCherry signal. While GFP expressed from pcDNA 3.1 was unaltered under all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6I</xref>). This demonstrates that reporter transgenes under a polII promoter are not affected by a loss of MKRN2.</p><p id="P18">Following on from this, we wanted to ascertain whether the disruption of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking due to a lack of MKRN2 was mediated by the coding sequence of IAV mRNAs or the packaging signal and conserved UTRs. In parallel, we aimed to identify whether transcription from the influenza viral polymerase was required to exploit MKRN2-mediated trafficking. To assess this, we designed PolII expression systems under a CMV promoter encoding for wild-type HA, NP or NA transgenes, or mScarlet and EBFP with the HA or NP packaging signals, respectively. We observed that both wild-type and reporter mRNAs demonstrated significantly reduced nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking when MKRN2 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6J</xref>). Interestingly, for the wild-type CMV driven mRNAs we also observed a minor but significant increase in the nuclear fraction when MKRN2 expression was reduced. This led us to the conclusion that the 5’ and 3’ ends of IAV mRNA are necessary for MKRN2-associated nuclear export and that transcription via the viral polymerase is not required for MKRN2-mediated mRNA export.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Influenza A virus represents a highly infectious human pathogen ripe with potential for zoonotic spillover. IAV utilises a plethora of host proteins and pathways to successfully transcribe, translate and replicate its genome. A particularly fascinating aspect of IAV biology, in stark contrast to most other RNA viruses, is that RNA synthesis occurs in the nucleus. IAV mRNA synthesis is further complicated by the fact that, minimally, 8 out of the 10 predominant IAV mRNAs are not spliced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Splicing in eukaryotic cells generally leads to the direct recruitment of nuclear export factors such as NXF1 followed by the rapid trafficking of spliced mRNA to the cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> However, this is not the case for the majority of IAV transcripts, and successful replication necessitates other means to effectively export IAV mRNAs.</p><p id="P20">The export of IAV mRNAs, particularly the unspliced ones, is a poorly understood process.

An earlier study investigated the dependence of various known mRNA export factors for IAV mRNA export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> The authors found that different IAV transcripts were either more or less reliant on cellular factors including NXF1 or UAP56.

We next looked to validate some of the more interesting RBPs that we found to be enriched on mRNAs from IAV infected cells. Here, our aim was to determine which, if any, played a crucial role in viral replication. Using a fluorescent reporter virus, we found that MKRN2 depletion appeared to quash viral protein expression, while a similar protein from the same family, MKRN1, was not found to be required for viral protein expression. However, previous data surrounding the emergence of the <italic>MKRN2</italic> gene make this result less surprising than at first thought. <italic>MKRN2</italic> appears to have arisen from a gene duplication of <italic>MKRN1</italic> over 450 million years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Phylogenetic analysis has shown that for most of its history, the <italic>MKRN2</italic> gene lacks any significant evolutionary divergence. In fact, when the MKRN1 and MKRN2 proteins of human, mouse, zebrafish and yellowfin tuna were analysed for sequence conservation, each was found to cluster with its own orthologues, forming 2 distinct paralogous groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> This implies that MKRN1 and MKRN2 likely have distinct roles within the cell, while the lack of evolutionary divergence between orthologues hints that MKRN2 has a conserved cellular role among vertebrates.</p><p id="P23">In 2020 Wolf et al. published one of the only mechanistic studies to date into the potential role of MKRN2 as an RNA-binding protein. Their work indicated that MKRN2 binds to a subset of cellular mRNAs, but that in general MKRN2 acts to halt nuclear export of these mRNAs to the cytoplasm. The authors also identified GLE1 as an interacting partner of MKRN2. They speculate that binding of MKRN2 to an mRNA blocks GLE1 association with said mRNA and prevents efficient nuclear export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> We performed our own analysis of the same IP-MS raw data to uncover any novel interactors that are unique to MKRN2, over MKRN1 and MKRN3 that may have been overlooked in the initial study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). As we have already shown that a loss of MKRN1 does not phenocopy a loss of MKRN2 in the context of IAV replication, we reasoned that identifying MKRN2-specific interactors would aid in developing more mechanistic insights. On analysis, we found GLE1 alongside several other proteins described by Wolf et al., that are directly involved in RNA transport and nuclear export; ZC3H14, RAE1, FYTTD1 and NUP42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B &amp; C</xref>). In addition though, we uncovered 2 components of the exon junction complex, MAGOH and SAP18, that associate with MKRN2 but not MKRN1 or MKRN3. MAGOH is an RBP and has been reported to bind to the known mRNA export factor NXF1. Interestingly, MAGOH remains associated with bound mRNAs even after nuclear export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> While SAP18 has previously been described as a late associating factor of the exon junction complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Taken together, this list of interactors is compelling evidence that MKRN2 is involved in nuclear export of bound RNA, but that MKRN2 would likely positively regulate nuclear export as it distinctly associates with many well-established components of mRNA nuclear export. This is further validated herein, where we find a significant cytoplasmic depletion phenotype for IAV transcripts when expression of either MKRN2 or its co-factor GLE1 is reduced in infected cells.</p><p id="P24">As stated above, it has already been shown that GLE1 is involved in the recycling of NXF1 back into the nucleus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and that MKRN2 has been validated previously as a GLE1 interacting protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> With recent work demonstrating a role for TREX-2 mediated recruitment of NXF1 to viral mRNAs for efficient nuclear export,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> it may be important to investigate any potential links between MKRN2 and TREX-2, in the presence and absence of virus infection. In fact, the IP-MS published by Wolf et al (2020) demonstrates that MKRN2 associates with FYTTD1, a UAP-56 interacting protein, a known interactor of the TREX complex. We have already demonstrated herein that a reduction in FYTTD1 reduced IAV infection kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Taken together, these data may implicate MKRN2 as an RNA-binding mRNA export adapter protein for a subset of cellular and viral mRNAs. Previously, two splicing factors 9G8 and SRp20 have been described as export adapter proteins, through binding to target mRNA and direct recruitment of NXF1 to mediate mRNA export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that MKRN2 may be important for the recruitment of the export complex, explaining how a loss of MKRN2 prevents efficient nuclear export of IAV mRNAs.</p><p id="P25">We have shown that MKRN2-mediated viral mRNA export is indeed occurring, at least for the primary transcripts generated upon IAV infection. It is likely though that this binding and nuclear export continues throughout infection as MKRN2 association appears to be mediated by the sequence of the transcript itself. With all this in mind, we are proposing a model for IAV mRNA nuclear export. Upon IAV infection MKRN2 protein begins to accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells. This nuclear MKRN2 then binds to IAV transcripts and potentially recruits export adapter proteins such as FYTTD1 of MAGOH. This in turn recruits export machinery such as TREX leading to trafficking to the NPC, where the complex interacts with GLE1, and viral mRNAs are efficiently exported to the cytoplasm. What is clear from the work presented here is that MKRN2 is an important RBP in the export of IAV mRNAs from the nucleus and that MKRN2 likely carries out this role through its proven association with members of the mRNA export machinery, of which GLE1 is one.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cells</title><p id="P26">For this work immortalised A549 (ATCC; CCL-185), HEK 293T (ATCC; CRL-3216) and MDCK (CCL-34) cells were used.
