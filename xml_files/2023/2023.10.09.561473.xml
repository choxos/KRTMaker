The recombinant viruses were characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Viral entry, cell-cell fusion, viral plaque size, and viral replication kinetics of the rWA1-Omi-S virus were markedly impaired when compared to the rWA1-D614G virus, demonstrating a lower fusogenicity and ability to spread cell-to-cell of rWA1-Omi-S. To assess the contribution of the Omicron BA.1 S protein to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis the pathogenicity of rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S viruses were compared using a feline model of infection. While the rWA1-D614G-inoculated cats became lethargic and showed increased body temperatures on days 2 and 3 post-infection (pi), rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated cats remained subclinical and gained weight throughout the 14-day experimental period. Animals inoculated with rWA1-D614G presented higher levels of infectious virus shedding in nasal secretions, when compared to rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated animals. In addition, tissue replication of the rWA1-Omi-S was markedly reduced compared to the rWA1-D614G, as evidenced by lower <italic>in situ</italic> viral RNA and lower viral load in tissues on days 3 and 5 pi. Histologic examination of the nasal turbinate and lungs revealed intense inflammatory infiltration in rWA1-D614G-inoculated animals, whereas rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated cats presented only mild to modest inflammation. Together, these results demonstrate that the S protein is a major virulence determinant for SARS-CoV-2 playing a major role for the attenuated phenotype of the Omicron virus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in a cluster of people presenting with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Current evidence on the viral origin suggest that horseshoe bats are the likely reservoir for the virus, with human spillover potentially involving a yet unidentified intermediate animal host in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan. Notably, 20 of the first 47 human cases in Wuhan had an epidemiological link with the Huanan market where several live wild animal species, including many that are now known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, were sold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, there have been 764 million confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and over 6.9 million deaths, reported to World Health Organization (WHO). While circulating in the human population, SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve, with new variants causing significant waves of infection worldwide. Importantly, several of the emerging variants present altered transmissibility, immune evasion capability, and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The first mutation established on the SARS-CoV-2 genome was the D614G substitution in the Spike (S) protein, detected for the first time in February 2020 and which is present in all SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide since then [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. As genome mutations accumulated and viral properties changed over time, some SARS-CoV-2 lineages were classified as variants of concern (VOC) by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. As of October 2023, five VOC have been defined: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. All these VOC emerged independently and rapidly became dominant, outcompeting previous variants regionally or globally. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC (BA.1), emerged in late 2021, and rapidly achieved global predominance by early 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. A marked increase in the cases numbers was observed worldwide when the Omicron BA.1 variant became predominant owing to high re-infection and vaccine breakthrough rates of this virus due to its ability to evade neutralizing antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Hospitalizations and deaths, however, were lower during the Omicron BA.1 surge suggesting lower pathogenicity of the virus compared to previous SARS-CoV-2 lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The Omicron BA.1 sublineage differs from the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 virus by 59 amino acids, with 37 of these changes present in the S protein, a key viral protein involved in virus entry (receptor engagement and fusion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Among these, 15 amino acid substitutions are in the receptor binding domain (RBD) with several additional mutations located near the furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction and near the S2ʹ site which could modulate host protease cleavage by furin and transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2), respectively, potentially resulting in altered entry preference and fusogenicity, and likely affecting replication and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The Omicron BA.1 is less dependent on TMPRSS2, less efficient in S cleavage, less fusogenic, and presents an altered propensity to utilize the plasma membrane and endosomal pathways for virus entry. Specific mutations in the S protein have been linked to the attenuated phenotype of the Omicron BA.1 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Additionally, amino acid mutations in the receptor binding motif (RBM) contribute to escape from vaccine-induced humoral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Experimental studies in animal models showed that the Omicron variant causes attenuated disease in humanized mice and hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Using a feline model - a natural susceptible animal species - we have demonstrated that the Omicron BA.1.1 variant presents lower pathogenicity when compared to D614G (B.1) and the Delta lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. To assess the contribution of the S gene in this viral phenotype, we generated recombinant viruses based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain backbone harboring the S D614G mutation (rWA1-D614G) and the Omicron BA.1 S gene (rWA1-Omi-S). The role of the S gene on virus entry/infectivity, fusion and replication were characterized <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the infection dynamics, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of the viruses were assessed and compared <italic>in vivo</italic> using the highly susceptible feline model of infection and pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The Omicron BA.1 S induces efficient viral entry, but leads to reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P6">The role and contribution of Omicron BA.1 S for virus infectivity, fusogenicity, cell-to-cell spread, and replication were investigated in cell culture <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two recombinant viruses based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 genome backbone harboring the S D614G mutation (rWA1-D614G) and the Omicron BA.1 S gene (rWA1-Omi-S) were generated and rescued (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Initially, infectivity of rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S were investigated in cells stably expressing human (h) or cat (c) angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2_BHK21 and cACE2_BHK21, respectively), Vero E6, and Vero E6 TMPRSS2 cells and virus infectivity was determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) followed by quantification of infected cells. In both ACE2 expressing BHK21 cells and in Vero E6 TMPRSS2 cells, the rWA1-Omi-S virus showed higher infectivity at early time points of 4- and 8-hours post-infection (hpi) when compared to the rWA1-D614G (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). At 12 hpi, both viruses showed comparable infectivity in hACE2_BHK21 and cACE2_BHK21 cells as evidenced by similar percentage of infected cells; however, from 12 hpi onwards the rWA1-D614G overtook the rWA1-Omi-S virus and at 24 hpi a significantly higher percentage of infected cells were noted in rWA1-D614G infected cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). On the other hand, in Vero E6 cells, both recombinant viruses showed comparable infectivity throughout the course of infection. We then performed multi-step growth curves with both rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S in hACE2 and cACE2 expressing BHK21 cells, and Vero E6 cells, to assess the effect of S on virus replication. In both ACE2 expressing BHK21 cells, the rWA1-Omi-S virus presented slightly lower viral yields, suggesting lower replication ability of this virus, in comparison to the ancestral rWA1-D614G virus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Whereas, both recombinant viruses presented comparable replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). These results are consistent with the infectivity assays performed in these cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The Omicron BA.1 S reduces fusogenicity and cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P7">The fusogenic activity of the Omicron BA.1 was evaluated and compared to the D614G S. For this, BHK21 cells stably expressing hACE2 or cACE2 were transfected with plasmids encoding the S gene from D614G and Omicron BA.1 and the fusogenic activity of the respective variant proteins were evaluated by determining the number of nuclei incorporated into the syncytia observed in transfected cells. Expression of Omicron BA.1 S in both hACE2 and cACE2-expressing BHK21 cells resulted in lower fusogenic activity as evidenced by significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) lower syncytia formation/nuclei incorporation when compared to expression of the ancestral D614G S protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Notably, the lower fusogenicity of Omicron BA.1 S protein was confirmed in the context of virus infection. BHK21 cells expressing hACE2 or cACE2 infected with rWA1-Omi-S presented markedly lower fusogenicity as evidenced by lower number and smaller syncytia when compared to cells infected with the ancestral rWA1-D614G virus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2C</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Next, we assessed the effect of Omicron S protein on cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2 by using plaque assays. The rWA1-Omi-S formed significantly smaller plaques (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) when compared to the rWA1-D614G virus in all three cell lines tested (hACE2_BHK21, cACE2_BHK21 and Vero E6) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2E</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), indicating a reduced ability of the rWA1-Omi-S to spread from cell-to-cell and confirming the contribution of S protein for this phenotype. Collectively, these results demonstrate that while the Omicron BA.1 S enables efficient virus entry and infectivity, it reduces the overall fusogenicity and ability of the rWA-Omi-S virus to spread from cell-to-cell.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SARS-CoV-2 D614G and Omicron BA.1 S present similar ability to inhibit interferon-beta (IFN-β) mediated luciferase activity</title><p id="P8">Given the reduced ability of the Omicron BA.1 strain to spread from cell-to-cell, we investigated the potential role of interferon (IFN) pathway in inhibiting viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been shown to inhibit the IFN pathway by antagonizing viral RNA pattern recognition receptor RIG-I signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Using luciferase reporter assays we assessed the effect of D614G- and Omicron BA.1 S proteins on activation of the IFN-β and NF-κB signaling pathways. For this, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding D614G- or Omicron BA.1 S proteins, or an empty vector, together with IFN-β or NF-κB Firefly luciferase reporter plasmids. At 24 hours post-transfection cells were stimulated with Sendai virus (SeV [Cantell strain], potent IFN inducer) or TNF-α (potent NF-κB pathway inducer) and incubated for 12 hours. After incubation Firefly luciferase activity was measured and used to assess and compare the inhibitory activity of the D614G- and Omicron BA.1-S proteins on these critical signaling pathways. Both D614G and Omicron BA.1 S proteins significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) inhibited SeV-induced IFN-β signaling, and no differences between the S variants was noted (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). No inhibitory activity in the NF-κB signaling was observed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Expression of D614G- and Omicron BA.1 S in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Importantly, results from the Western blot also demonstrated a lower cleavability of the precursor Omicron BA.1 S protein, as evidenced by markedly lower levels of the S2 subunit in Omicron BA.1 S transfected cell when compared to D614G S (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). These findings suggest that the lower fusogenicity of the Omicron BA.1 S and the impaired ability of the rWA1-Omi-S virus to spread from cell-to-cell are likely due to a less efficient cleavage of S and further rule out the involvement of the innate IFN response on this important biological property.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The rWA1-Omi-S leads to subclinical infection and limited viral shedding in cats</title><p id="P9">The dynamics of infection, virus replication, and virus shedding of rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S were next assessed in cats. Following inoculation, clinical parameters, including rectal temperature, body weight, and clinical signs of respiratory disease, were monitored daily (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Animals inoculated with the rWA1-D614G became lethargic and presented increased body temperatures on days 2 and 3 post-infection (pi) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), whereas rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated cats remained subclinical. Additionally, rWA1-D614G-inoculated cats lost weight between days 1-7 pi, while all rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated cats gained weight throughout the 14-day experimental period (1 - 12% of their initial body weight) similar to the control mock-inoculated animals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To assess virus replication and shedding dynamics of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 following inoculation, nasal and oropharyngeal secretions and feces were collected using nasal (NS), oropharyngeal (OPS), and rectal swabs (RS). The samples were initially tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Viral RNA was detected between days 1 and 14 pi in NS and OPS secretions in the inoculated cats, with higher viral RNA loads detected between days 3 and 5 pi, which decreased thereafter through day 14 pi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4D</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Viral RNA load was higher in nasal secretions of rWA1-D614G-inoculated animals when compared to rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated cats on days 1 and 3 pi (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

Viral RNA was detected in BALF of all inoculated animals on days 3 and 5 pi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). All control cats (mock-inoculated) tested negative by rRT-PCR. On day 3 pi, infectious virus titers in BALF of cats infected with rWA1-D614G varied from 3.5 to 5.0 log TCID<sub>50</sub>.mL<sup>-1</sup>, whereas rWA1-Omi-S-inoculated animals, presented lower infectious virus titers ranging from 1.3 and 2.5 log TCID<sub>50</sub>.mL<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4K</xref>).

In cell culture systems, the Omicron BA.1 S seems to mediate efficient entry into host cells, however, the rWA1-Omi-S presented reduced fusogenicity and ability to spread from cell-to-cell when compared to the B.1 D614G S bearing rWA1-D614G. In cats, the rWA1-Omi-S presented subclinical infection, reduced replication in the upper respiratory tract, and decreased virus shedding and pathology, when compared to the ancestral rWA1-D614G virus, indicating that the S protein is as a major determinant of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.</p><p id="P22">The S protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant possesses 36 mutations compared to the ancestral D614G lineage. Several of the affected residues modulate receptor binding, protease cleavage efficiency, and cell-to-cell fusion, and contribute to virus replication and escape from NAbs. The S protein binds to the hACE2 receptor and mediates entry into susceptible host cells. Studies showed that the S protein of Omicron variant utilizes the hACE2 receptor with enhanced efficiency than ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains, a feature that has been speculated to contribute to rapid transmission of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Omicron BA.1 S protein presents an enhanced RBD-ACE2 binding interface through the interactions of amino acids N501Y, Q498R, and T478K with the host receptor in target cells. Notably, these mutations are reminiscing features of other variants, including Alpha (N501Y) and Delta (L452R and T478K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Additional mutations such as Q493R and S477N also contribute to enhanced S-ACE2 interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Notably, results of the infectivity assays in the present study using infectious recombinant viruses (rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S) demonstrated a more efficient entry of the Omicron BA.1 S harboring virus when compared to the ancestral D614G S virus. As the infection progressed, however, the rWA1-D614G virus, owing to its enhanced fusogenic activity and ability to spread from cell-to-cell, overtook the rWA1-Omi-S-infection resulting in higher spread and replication efficiency of the virus.</p><p id="P23">Recent studies demonstrated that the Omicron variant BA.1 is less dependent on transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), less efficient in S cleavage, less fusogenic, and favors the endosomal pathway for virus entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In line with this, results here with the Omicron S protein and the infectivity assays with the rWA1-Omi-S also showed reduced fusogenicity and syncytia formation in hACE2_BHK21 and cACE2_BHK21 cells as compared to the D614G S and the rWA1-D614G, indicating that S protein of Omicron contributes to this phenotype. The lower fusogenicity of the Omicron S could also affect the ability of the virus to spread from cell-to-cell. This was confirmed by the smaller plaque size observed for the rWA1-Omi-S compared to the rWA1-D614G. S mutations H655Y and T547K have been shown to contribute to the low fusogenicity of Omicron variants, while the H655Y mutation also dictates the enhanced endosome entry pathway utilization of Omicron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 S antagonizes viral RNA recognition by RIG-I blocking the induction of IFN and downstream IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Subsequent studies showed that the S protein interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to block its association with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Considering about 36 amino acid mutations in the S protein between Omicron BA.1 and B.1 D614G variants, we examined if these S proteins modulate innate immune inhibitory pathways differently. Differential modulation of innate responses and more specifically of IFN pathways could, for example, account for the reduced plaque size and lower ability of the rWA1-Omi-S virus to spread from cell-to-cell. Results from an IFNβ-driven luciferase reporter assay, however, revealed comparable inhibition of the IFN-β reporter activity by B.1 D614G and Omicron BA.1 S proteins. Together these results rule out impaired innate immune modulation as a factor contributing for the lower replication ability and cell-to-cell spread observed for rWA1-Omi-S virus. These observations further point towards the decreased cleavability and fusogenic activity of the Omicron BA.1 S as a major driving force contributing to the lower overall infectivity and ability of the virus to spread from cell-to-cell.</p><p id="P24">The Omicron BA.1 variant is more immune evasive and less virulent than the other major identified variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].

Similarly, using domestic cats, a naturally susceptible animal species, we recently showed that Omicron BA.1.1 causes lower pathogenicity than ancestral B.1 and Delta variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Here by using recombinant chimeric viruses (rWA1-D614G and rWA1-Omi-S) we sought to determine and dissect the role and contribution of the S protein for the attenuated disease phenotype of Omicron BA.1. For this, we inoculated cats with rSARS-CoV-2 carrying Omicron S (rWA1-Omi-S) and D614G S (rWA1-D614G) in the backbone of ancestral WA1 isolate. While rWA1-D614G inoculated cats were febrile, lethargic, and lost or maintained steady body weight, rWA1-Omi-S inoculated cats remained subclinical and gained weight throughout the experiment. Similarly, the rWA1-Omi-S presented significantly lower replication in the respiratory tract and associated lymphoid tissues of inoculated animals, as evidenced by lower virus shedding and milder viral replication and pathological changes in target respiratory organs. These results confirm a major role for the Omicron BA.1 S for the attenuation of the virus in the feline model of infection. However, the role and contribution of Omicron-specific mutations that fall outside of S protein for virus infection and disease pathogenesis cannot be formally ruled out. In fact, recent studies using K18 transgenic hACE2 mice showed that S contributes to the attenuated phenotype of Omicron BA.1 and mutation outside S protein are also likely to contribute to the virulence of the virus in this mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. In these studies, intranasal inoculation of K18 transgenic hACE2 mice with Omicron BA.1 caused no significant body weight loss, while the rWA1 bearing Omicron S caused less severe disease than the ancestral virus but was not as attenuated as the natural Omicron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Survival assessments revealed non-fatal infection in Omicron-infected mice compared to the 100% and 80% mortality in ancestral D614G and Omi-S infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].

More recently, another study showed that while Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 cause minimal to negligible morbidity and mortality in K18 hACE2 mice, animals infected with Omicron BA.5 exhibited high weight loss and mortality that was dependent on the age of the mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P25">Mutations in the S protein of the Omicron variants, particularly in the RBD, lead to widespread escape from NAb responses causing vaccine breakthrough infection and increase transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].

After stimulation cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured using the dual luciferase assay (Promega, E2940). Luminescence was measured using a luminometer plate reader (BioTek Synergy LX Multimode Reader). The ratio of luminescence obtained from the target reporters (IFN-β-Luc or NF-κB-Luc) to luminescence from the control Renilla reporter (pRN-Luc) was calculated to normalize the transfection efficiency. Then, the relative IFN-β- or NF-κB-driven luciferase activity was calculated as fold change over the unstimulated cells.

summary</title></caption><p id="P48">The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineage BA.1 spread rapidly across the globe in late 2021/early 2022. Experimental studies have shown an overall lower pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1 when compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1 (D614G). Recently, we have demonstrated that the Omicron BA.1.1 variant presents lower pathogenicity when compared to D614G (B.1) lineage in a feline model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are over 50 mutations in the Omicron genome, of which more than two thirds are present in the S gene. To assess the role of the Omicron BA.1 S on virus pathogenesis, recombinant viruses harboring the S D614G mutation (rWA1-D614G) and the Omicron BA.1 Spike gene (rWA1-Omi-S) in the backbone of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA1 were characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the Omicron BA.1 S gene results in early entry into cells, the rWA1-Omi-S presents impaired cell-cell spread and fusogenic activity. Inoculation of cats with the recombinant viruses revealed an attenuated phenotype of rWA1-Omi-S, demonstrating a critical role for S protein on the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and indicating that the Omi-S is a major determinant of the attenuated disease phenotype of Omicron strains.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><title>The role and contribution of Omicron BA.1 S to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and replication.</title><p>(A) Schematic presentation of the rSARS-CoV-2 harboring D614G (rWA1-D614G) and Omicron BA.1 S (rWA1-Omi-S).
