Here, we used in-gel digests and mass spectrometry to monitor the migration and topography of 5,040 plant proteins of agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> within a protein gel. By plotting the peptides over the gel slices, we generated peptographs that reveal where which part of each protein was detected within the protein gel. These data uncovered that 60% of the detected proteins have proteoforms that migrate at lower than predicted molecular weights, implicating extensive proteolytic processing. For instance, this analysis confirms the proteolytic removal and degradation of autoinhibitory prodomains of most but not all proteases, and revealed differential processing within pectinemethylesterase and lipase families. This analysis also uncovered intricate processing of glycosidases and uncovered that ectodomain shedding might be common for a diverse range of receptor-like kinases. Transient expression of double-tagged candidate proteins confirmed various processing events <italic>in vivo</italic>. This extensive proteomic dataset can be investigated further and demonstrates that most plant proteins are proteolytically processed and implicates an extensive proteolytic machinery shaping the proteome of agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>protein processing</kwd><kwd>protein migration</kwd><kwd>molecular weight</kwd><kwd>agroinfiltration</kwd><kwd><italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Agroinfiltration of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> is routinely used in plant science and has emerged as a powerful protein expression platform in molecular pharming. Yet, the yields or recombinant protein production are hampered by processing and degradation caused by endogenous plant proteases. The <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> genome encodes for &gt;1,200 putative proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jutras et al., 2020</xref>), but little is known on their endogenous substrates. Most processing events may inactivate proteins, but protein cleavages can also regulate proteins for instance by releasing active proteins from their precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dissmeyer et al., 2018</xref>). Protein processing can also change the subcellular location of proteins or their ability to interact with other components inside and outside the cell. Understanding protein processing in plants is limited by the absence of global studies on protein processing that reveal endogenous protein substrates.</p><p id="P3">Several global studies on protein processing include the use of shotgun proteomics on isotope-labeled Arabidopsis cell cultures to monitor life times of plant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>); the use of Terminal Amine Isotope Labelling of Samples (TAILS), e.g. to monitor the role of PRT6 in the N-terminome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>); and the use of COmbined FRactional DIagonal Chromatography (COFRADIC), e.g. to identify substrates of metacaspase-9, based on the detection of N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tsiatsiani et al., 2013</xref>). These, and similar powerful proteomic methods resulted in many candidate protease substrates that remain to be confirmed. Candidate substrates identified by TAILS, COFRADIC and shotgun proteomics are challenging to confirm because neo-termini can originate from proteins that are only incompletely processed or already degraded. In addition, neo-termini that appear near the termini of proteins are difficult to confirm by detecting shifts in molecular weight (MW).</p><p id="P4">Here, we take a different, complementary approach to identify candidate protease substrates by a shift in migration in protein gels. We use the PRotein TOpography and Migration Analysis Platform (PROTOMAP) to identify proteins that migrate in the protein gel at a different than predicted MW. PROTOMAP is a proteomic analysis approach that charts tryptic peptides detected by mass spectrometry (MS) from gel slices of a 1D-SDS-PAGE gel in two dimensions: the protein sequence (x-axis) and the gel slice at which the peptide was detected (y-scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dix et al., 2008</xref>). By including MS data from all gel slices of an 1D-gel and including replicates, this PROTOMAP approach results in a global overview of where within the protein gel, which part of the protein is migrating. This analysis generates the same type of information as western blots, but then for all detectable proteins simultaneously. Thus, in contrast to other proteomic techniques, PROTOMAP will display changes in the migration of proteins within protein gels.</p><p id="P5">PROTOMAP was originally used to identify 261 processing events during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dix et al., 2008</xref>) and was used to demonstrate that phosphorylation sculpts the apoptotic proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dix et al., 2012</xref>). PROTOMAP has also been used to profile protein processing during infection with the malaria parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bowyer et al., 2011</xref>), but hasn’t been used in plant science because of the high demand on machine time. For instance, the generation of PROTOMAP data for a single proteome involves the analysis of ~100 in-gel tryptic digests by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="P6">Here, we sought to generate a PROTOMAP dataset from agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, taking advantage of its recently improved genome annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ranawaka et al., 2023</xref>). Transient expression by agroinfiltration of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> is frequently used in plant science to study e.g. subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions, and in molecular pharming to produce pharmaceutical proteins and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Eidenberger et al., 2023</xref>). However, the proteolytic machinery of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> includes &gt;1,000 putative proteases that hamper molecular pharming and research in plant science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jutras et al., 2020</xref>) and therefore the characterization of protein processing in agroinfiltrated leaves will benefit both plant science and molecular pharming. In addition, by analyzing processing in agroinfiltrated leaves, we should be able to verify processing events upon transient expression of reporter-tagged precursor proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">To generate the PROTOMAP dataset, we separated the soluble proteomes of extracts from agroinfiltrated leaves in adjacent lanes on a 4-12% gradient Bis-Tris protein gel and cut each lane into 24 gel slices, covering a range of 10-180 kDa indicated by the flanking marker lanes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). We digested the proteins in these gel slices with trypsin and analysed the released peptides by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We annotated the spectra to predicted tryptic peptides generated <italic>in silico</italic> from the recently released LAB3.60 annotation of the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ranawaka et al., 2023</xref>). The annotation to the LAB3.60 drastically increased the frequency of unique peptides when compared to our earlier NbDE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kourelis et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). A total of 36,967 different tryptic peptides derived from 5,040 plant proteins were detected in these 96 gel slices, making this the largest proteomics dataset available for agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplemental File S1</xref>). Almost 82% of the detected proteins were identified with more than one single peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The 919 proteins that were identified by a single peptide are retained in this analysis because their detection within the gel is often consistent with the predicted MW and the migration of homologous proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next plotted the predicted MW on the x-axis against the gel slice with the highest number of peptides (y-axis) for each protein. Since we are interested in secreted proteins, we also calculated the predicted MW of the protein without its SignalP-predicted signal peptide (SP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Teufel et al., 2022</xref>). This graph shows a linear correlation between the predicted and apparent MW (r = 0.399, p = 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, there are also 1,052 proteins from which most peptides were found at MW 10% below the predicted MW. Likewise, 1,059 proteins have the highest peptide count at MW 10% above the predicted MW. Another 59 proteins have their highest peptide count in slice 1 (top slice), which is either caused by protein insolubility or the protein being too large to migrate into the polyacrylamide gel.</p><p id="P9">Most proteins (74.3%) are not detected in a single slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For 79.5% of these 3,744 proteins (2,977 proteins), peptides from the same protein were detected in adjacent gel slices, which is presumably caused by diffuse protein signals within the protein gel. For 3,011 proteins, however, peptides were also detected at two or more gel slices distant from the gel slice with the main count, indicating that we are detecting multiple proteoforms for 59.7% of the 5,040 detected proteins.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Building an upgraded PROTOMAP dataset</title><p id="P10">To map the distributions of the peptides over the detected protein (x-axis) and the gel slice (y-axis), we produced an R script that generates peptographs for each protein, similar to how PROTOMAP was built originally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dix et al., 2008</xref>), but with several important upgrades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). First, we highlight all unique peptides with red edges. Second, we depict in how many of the four replicates the peptide was detected in the thickness of the peptide box to signify robustly detected peptides. The peptides are also depicted translucent to show partially overlapping peptides. Third, we depict the average signal intensity of each peptide using the greyscale to highlight peptides detected at higher ion intensities. Fourth, we added horizontal lines to indicate the gel slice in which the protein is expected to accumulate, based on the predicted molecular weight for the protein without SignalP-predicted signal peptide and predicted <italic>N</italic>-glycans (red horizontal line) or with predicted <italic>N</italic>-glycans (blue horizontal line), based on the presence of sequons (NxS/T, +3 kDa each). <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation was not considered as it is less common and less predictable when compared to <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation. Fifth, instead of the average spectral counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dix et al., 2008</xref>), we plotted the total peptide count for all four replicates for each gel slice in the graph on the right to indicate gel slices containing the strongest protein signals. Finally, we highlight the position of putative <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (NxS/T sequons) in the protein, together with InterPro-predicted PFAM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mistry et al., 2021</xref>), SignalP-predicted signal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Teufel et al., 2022</xref>), and TMHMM-predicted transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>). And as with the original PROTOMAP, we provide the annotation of the putative protein function (top), an explanation of the PFAM domains, and the protein sequence (bottom). These peptographs have been generated for every detected protein in a PDF format that can be searched for accession numbers, PFAM domains, keywords and sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>). The R script to produce these peptographs is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplemental File S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Secreted proteases accumulate as mature enzymes lacking autoinhibitory domains</title><p id="P11">To investigate if the PROTOMAP dataset displays known protein processing events, we mined the dataset for secreted proteases that carry an autoinhibitory prodomain that is removed upon activation, resulting in a mature protease with a lower MW. Using searches for the PFAM code of the catalytic domain for proteins detected with more than a single peptide, we identified 24 subtilisin-like proteases (SBTs, family S08, PF00082); 16 papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs, family C01, PF00112); 14 pepsin-like aspartic proteases (family A01, PF14541); and three vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs, family C13, PF01650). Most of these proteases accumulate at a MW that is predicted for the mature proteases and not their proenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that these enzymes do no longer carry their autoinhibitory prodomain. The position of the identified peptides within the protease precursors confirms this pattern: most peptides originate from the protease domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The absence of peptides from the prodomain in any gel slice indicates that these domains are degraded <italic>in vivo</italic>, presumably to avoid inhibition <italic>in trans</italic>.</p><p id="P12">Notable exceptions are subtilases NbL03g00730 (<italic>Nb</italic>SBT1.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), NbL17g25630, NbL06g14490 and NbL16g14350, for which peptides were detected of the prodomain, but these peptides were only detected at 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>), indicating that these prodomains have been removed by processing but that they persist. Likewise, peptides for the prodomain were also detected at 15 kDa for PLCP NbL05g12610, an aleurain-like protease (<italic>Nb</italic>ALP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that also this prodomain persists after release. By contrast, peptides of the prodomain were also detected for PLCPs NbL12g09520, NbL13g16620 and NbL04g14460 but these peptides all migrate at the predicted MW of these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>), indicating that they are from precursor proteases. Another exception is the detection of peptides from the C-terminal inhibitory domain of VPE NbL17g4760, which were detected both at the predicted MW and at 20 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>), indicating that only part of this protease is processed but that the inhibitory domain can persist separately.</p><p id="P13">Interestingly, peptograph of subtilase NbL02g06410 (<italic>Nb</italic>SBT1.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), also displays C-terminal peptides corresponding to the fibronectin type-III domain (PF17766) at 12 kDa, indicating that this domain is released from these subtilases. Released Fn3 domains were also detected for subtilases NbL16g14350, NbL06g14490, NbL03g00730 and NbL13g19160. By contrast, the peptograph of subtilase NbL11g14620 (<italic>Nb</italic>SBT1.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) displays multiple C-terminal peptides at 35 kDa, indicating that this subtilase is processed more upstream in the protease domain, severing the catalytic Ser from the catalytic Asp and His residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). It is unclear at this stage what the consequences of these cleavages are. One distinct subtilase not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> is tripeptidyl peptidase (<italic>Nb</italic>TPP2, NbL03g11790), which was identified at 150 kDa with &gt;250 peptides covering its entirety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>), consistent with the high abundance and high predicted MW (147 kDa) of this cytoplasmic subtilase.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SCPL proteases/acyltransferases are differentially processed into functional heterodimers</title><p id="P14">The PROTOMAP dataset contains peptographs of 18 Serine Carboxypeptidase-Like (SCPL) proteins with more than a single peptide, carrying catalytic domain PF00450. SCPLs can be carboxypeptidases or acyltransferases involved in secondary metabolism (Mikowski and Strack, 2004). The peptograph of <italic>Nb</italic>SCPL20a (NbL09g13440, see phylogeny in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>) shows that this 51 kDa enzyme is cleaved into an N-terminal 37 kDa fragment in slice 15, and a C-terminal 19 kDa fragment in slice 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Peptographs of 11 additional SCPLs also indicate that they accumulate as cleaved proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>; NbL01g02560, NbL02g23560, NbL06g01240, NbL07g00400, NbL07g17710, NbL09g11980, NbL09g13440, NbL13g00950, NbL13g01230, NbL14g14490, NbL16g05780 and NbL18g14840). These data are consistent with processing of SCPLs into a large and small subunit that function together as a disulfide-linked heterodimer. Oat SCPL1, for instance, is cleaved into 29 and 19 kDa subunits that stay together as a disulfide-linked heterodimer that mediate a step in the biosynthesis of antimicrobial avenacins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mugford et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, brassinosteroid insensitive-1 suppressor BRS1 of Arabidopsis is processed into 34 and 19 kDa subunits, resulting in a heterodimer acting as secreted carboxypeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zhou and Li, 2005</xref>). It is unclear at this stage if SCPL processing is required for their activity and which endopeptidase cleaves these SCPLs.</p><p id="P15">By contrast, peptides from <italic>Nb</italic>SCPL50 (NbL15g24880, see phylogeny in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>) are mostly in gel slice 11 at 50 kDa, consistent with an uncleaved predicted MW of 48 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Peptographs of five additional SCPLs show peptides mostly at their predicted MW, indicating that these SCPLs are not processed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>; NbL01g18230, NbL02g04500, NbL04g07300, NbL05g22050, NbL07g00690, NbL12g02780, NbL14g17630 and NbL15g24880). The differential processing of SCPLs is thought to be caused by the length and sequence of the linker peptide located between the two subunits in the SCPL sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mugford et al., 2009</xref>). Shorter linker peptides are generally not processed. Indeed, alignment of the 18 detected SCPLs, ranked on the length of the linker region reveals that uncleaved SCPLs have a short linker region (4-15 residues), in contrast to cleaved SCPLs that have longer linker regions (32-65 residues, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). The alignment also shows that these cleaved SCPLs have highly polymorphic linker sequences, although many carry dibasic motifs that might be targeted by subtilases that have furin-like activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PMEs are differentially processed to remove the inhibitor domain</title><p id="P16">The PROTOMAP dataset contains 12 type-I pectinemethylesterases (PMEs) with two or more peptides. Type-I PMEs consist of a signal peptide for secretion, followed by a 20 kDa inhibitory domain (PF04043) and the 35 kDa PME domain (PF01095). Eight of the detected PMEs migrate in protein gels as processed, mature enzymes at 35-45 kDa. <italic>Nb</italic>PME3 (NbL03g24710, see phylogeny in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>), for instance, shows peptides of the catalytic domain at 40 kDa and peptides of the inhibitory domain at 20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). By contrast to the eight processed PMEs, the other four PMEs are detected close to the predicted MW. For instance, peptides from both the inhibitory and catalytic domains of <italic>Nb</italic>PME51 (NbL05g19120), are detected at 60 kDa, close to the predicted MW of 62 kDa, confirming that this PME accumulates as an uncleaved precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The removal of the inhibitory domain is required to activate and secrete PMEs, which then regulate the direction of cell growth by targeted cell wall relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>;). A dibasic motif (e.g. RRLL) at the junction between the inhibitory and catalytic domains is required for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>) and Arabidopsis SBT3.3 was found to be responsible for processing PME17 (Senechal et al., 2014). Interestingly, all eight processed PMEs detected by PROTOMAP contain either RRLL (4x), RKLL (2x), RVLL or RTLL at the putative cleavage region, whilst four unprocessed PMEs lack basic residues in this region with the exception of <italic>Nb</italic>PME40 (NbL01g19610), which carries RALL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>GELPs are differentially processed, separating its catalytic triad</title><p id="P18">The PROTOMAP dataset contains 33 GDSL esterases/lipases (GELPs, PF00657, see phylogeny in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Figure S8</xref>), with two or more peptides. GELPs are lipolytic enzymes that contain a 35 kDa catalytic domain that contain the catalytic Ser in an N-terminal GDSL motif (Shen et al., 2002). Peptographs of eight GELPs (e.g. NbL02g18830, <italic>Nb</italic>GDSL1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) show additional peptides at 25 kDa from the C-terminal half and peptides at 13 kDa from the N-terminal half of the catalytic domain. This indicates that these GELPs are processed into two subunits that are stable, possibly by remaining in a heterodimeric state. Interestingly, such processing would separate the catalytic triad, which consists of the catalytic Ser residue in the N-terminus, and the catalytic Asp and His residues in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although several plant GELPs have been biochemically characterized (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), their processing <italic>in planta</italic> has not been reported before.

Many GHs carry carbohydrate binding motifs (CBM) that enable substrate selection and localization. Interestingly, the peptographs of GHs often indicate that the CBM or other C-terminal domains is processed and can be detected at a low molecular weight, indicating that it is not degraded. β-galactosidase-1 (<italic>Nb</italic>BGAL1, NbL07g00850, family GH35) for instance, carries a galactose-binding lectin domain (PF02140) at the C-terminus, which is detected at 15, 28 and 40 kDa in the <italic>Nb</italic>BGAL1 peptograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Peptides from the catalytic domain (PF01301) of <italic>Nb</italic>BGAL1 migrate at the predicted MW (90 kDa) and at 48 kDa, consistent with activity-based labeling of this proteoform in our previous experiments (Chandrasekar et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill et al., 2019</xref>). The four other detected BGALs of family GH35 (NbL03g01030, NbL02g14360, NbL13g19810 and NbL03g00970), all have similar peptographs, indicating that the processing of the C-terminal lectin domain is common for the GH35 family.</p><p id="P20">Likewise, putative β-xylosidase (<italic>Nb</italic>BXYL, NbL11g10980, family GH3) carries a C-terminal fibronectin III-like domain (Fn3, PF14310) that can be detected at 75 kDa as part of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition to the full-length protein, peptides of the catalytic domain are also detected at 60 kDa but this gel slice lacks peptides of the Fn3 domain, indicating that this proteoform is C-terminally truncated. Although no peptides of the Fn3 domain can be detected for the four other GH3-family β-xylosidase carrying an Fn3 domain (NbL11g20540, NbL04g10020, NbL15g17830, and NbL01g14480), they all show peptides from only the catalytic domain migrating at 60-65 kDa, below the predicted MW, indicating that the C- terminal Fn3 domain has been removed from all these GH3 β-xylosidases. The function of the Fn3 domain in GH3 β-xylosidase is unknown but it might be involved in anchoring the enzyme on large polymeric substrates and in thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pozzo et al., 2010</xref>).

This shorter proteoform lacks peptides from the C-terminal region, whilst this C-terminal region is detected at 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This indicates that the C-terminal region is removed from this GH127 glycosidase. The C-terminal region has homology to two β-sandwich domains that are important for homodimerization of a bacterial GH127 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ito et al., 2014</xref>), but it is unknown how this processing might influence GH127 function.</p><p id="P22">Several other glycosidases show interesting processing events. The peptograph of heparanase-like NbL13g02440 (<italic>Nb</italic>HEPA, family GH79) for instance, has peptides covering the most of the protein at 58 kDa, consistent with its predicted MW (56 kDa), but also peptides of the catalytic domain (PF03662) at 35 kDa and even a smaller fragment at 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental File S2</xref>), indicating that this glycosidase is processed. In addition, the peptograph of putative α-mannosidase NbL03g02970 (<italic>Nb</italic>AMAN, family GH38) shows peptides across the protein at 130 kDa, close to its predicted MW (114 kDa), but much more and intense peptides of the N-terminal GH38 domain (PF01074) at 65 kDa and peptides of the C-terminal GH38 domain (PF07748) at 50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that most of this hydrolase is cleaved into two subunits. This peptograph is consistent with the observation that a homologous GH38 α-mannosidase from tomato fruits contains 70 and 47 kDa subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hossain et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Transient expression of double-tagged precursors confirms processing in vivo</title><p id="P23">To confirm the existence of proteoforms of secreted proteins in vivo, we transiently expressed several extracellular proteins with suspected processing by agroinfiltration with tags on both sides of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We added an N-terminal RFP and a C-terminal GFP protein to detect expression before protein extraction and to ensure that also processing near the N-and C-terminus can be detected by western blots. We also added an N-terminal FLAG tag and C-terminal His tag because we found that antibodies against these tags are more sensitive than anti-RFP/GFP antibodies. The double-tagged protein was fused behind the signal peptide of PR1a to ensure entry into the secretory pathway. These double tagged constructs were driven by the 2x35S promotor and contain an intron to exclude bacterial expression.</p><p id="P24">We first selected two SCPLs that are processed according to the PROTOMAP dataset.

Western blot analyses of double-tagged SCPL25 confirmed the accumulation of both the tagged N- and C-terminal fragments, accumulating at 65 and 55 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).

This indicates that <italic>Nb</italic>GMCO is cleaved between the N-terminal FAD-binding domain and the substrate binding domain. To confirm this observation, we double-tagged GMCO and monitored its accumulation upon transient expression by agroinfiltration. Western blot analysis confirmed the accumulation of the N-terminal processing product, accumulating at 75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), but the C-terminal processing product could not be detected, possibly because of another processing event at the junction with the 2xHis-GFP reporter tag.</p><p id="P26">The peptograph of the putative serine protease <italic>Nb</italic>EDA2 (NbL06g09140, S28 family, PF05577) shows most peptides at 53 kDa, consistent with its predicted MW (52 kDa), but also shows N-terminal peptides at 28 kDa and C-terminal peptides at 25 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure S9D</xref>).

Interestingly, this cleavage would separate the catalytic triad since the catalytic Ser residues locates in the N-terminal half, and the catalytic Asp and His residues at the C-terminus. However, as with SCPLs, this cleavage might result in a functional heterodimer.</p><p id="P27">Finally, the peptograph of putative Golgi-localized peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase A (<italic>Nb</italic>PNGaseA, NbL17g03090), shows peptides of the majority of the protein at 58 kDa, which might be the full-length protein (62 kDa), and both C- and N-terminal peptides at 45 kDa, indicating that this protein is processed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure S9E</xref>).

This was unexpected because the sample preparation included the removal of insoluble material by centrifugation before boiling in lithium dodecyl sulfate. To investigate this further, we searched the data for RLKs using PFAM identifiers for the protein kinase domain (PF00069 and PF07714) preceded by a signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain. This search delivered 37 putative RLKs, each with at least two peptides, including likely orthologs of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1/SR160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wang et al., 2018</xref>); chitin receptor CERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Miya et al., 2007</xref>); RALF1 receptor FERONIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>); cell wall sensor HERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>); BAK1-regulator BIR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Halter et al., 2014</xref>); and auxin coreceptor TMK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Friml et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Notably, most RLK-derived peptides were found in gel slices much below the gel slice that is predicted to contain full-length, <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated RLKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that these RLKs are truncated. This truncation is consistently 50-70 kDa, irrespective of the type of RLK. Further inspection of the detected peptides revealed that nearly all RLK-derived peptides originate from ectodomains and only few peptides are from kinase domains, despite being a substantial part of the RLK protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Putative brassinosteroid receptor BRI1/SR160 (NbL15g00030) for instance, is detected by peptides exclusively from the ectodomain at 90 kDa, 100 kDa below its predicted MW when fully <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Taken together, these data indicate that we detected a wide range of ectodomains that were cleaved from the membrane, releasing a soluble extracellular domain. The remaining TM-kinase domains probably remained in the membrane fraction that was pelleted during sample preparation. These data suggest that ectodomains of RLKs representing different RLK subfamilies are shed from the membrane.</p><p id="P30">A notable exception is LRR-RLK NbL10g02260 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>), which has a predicted MW of 90 kDa including <italic>N</italic>-glycans, but for which peptides derived from the kinase domain were detected at 40-44 kDa, corresponding to the predicted MW of the cytoplasmic domain. The peptograph also shows peptides of the ectodomain at 55 kDa, consistent with ectodomain shedding. These data suggest that this LRR-RLK is cleaved on both sides of the membrane, releasing both a soluble ectodomain, and a soluble kinase domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Our conceptually simple PROTOMAP experiment has uncovered 2,977 endogenous plant proteins that have multiple signals in protein gels. Whilst most are novel and implicate extensive protein processing in agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, these processing events are consistent with the literature. Nine processing events were confirmed by western blot analysis by transiently expressing double-tagged proteins. The PROTOMAP dataset is an extensive source of putative endogenous protease substrates to unravel the proteolytic machinery of this protein production platform in the future.</p><p id="P32">The PROTOMAP dataset is a rich source of proteoforms in agroinfiltrated leaves, most of which have not yet been reported before. This PROTOMAP dataset outperforms more modern approaches to detect protein processing such as COFRADIC and TAILS for several reasons. First, although TAILS and COFRADIC will reveal cleavage sites, they do not display the molecular weight of the precursor, meaning that the identified neo-termini can also originate from further degradation products. Second, it is unclear from TAILS and COFRADIC datasets if the detected processing event is a minority or majority processing event. PROTOMAP, by contrast, displays the relative abundance of the cleaved products and precursor, forcing the focus on major cleavage events that cause a shift of the protein in the gel. Third, PROTOMAP displays many more putative cleavage events. Our own TAILS analysis on the exact same proteomes only revealed 688 cleavage events in 1038 protein groups, and 31% of these proteins were not even detected in the PROTOMAP dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Thomas, 2020</xref>). Unfortunately, the RAW datasets of these TAILS samples were not maintained and could not be annotated to LAB3.60 and included in this study. This study nevertheless indicates that this PROTOMAP dataset contains highly valuable protein processing and abundance information that could not have been generated through modern approaches that are sometimes presumed to be better. Although the cleavage sites remain to be revealed, this dataset will focus further research on major processing events that can easily be detected by a shift in protein gels.</p><p id="P33">The PROTOMAP dataset is an extensive source of proteoforms that can be explored further for protein processing and abundance in agroinfiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. We mostly focused our further analysis on secreted proteins and have highlighted several phenomena in this dataset, which are briefly discussed below.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Zymogen maturation</title><p id="P34">PROTOMAP analysis uncovered numerous processing events that are consistent with the literature. For instance, the prodomain of proteases was found to be removed in our dataset for papains, subtilases, legumains and pepsins. It is interestingly to note that we did not detect peptides of most of the prodomains, indicating that they are degraded as soon as they are released from the precursor protein. The differential stability of different parts of secreted proteins indicates mechanisms in extracellular protein homeostasis that are not yet understood.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Differential processing within protein families</title><p id="P35">We also detected differential processing of SCPLs, PMEs and GELPs. Processing of these proteins is consistent with the literature on family members. In SCPLs, cleavage occurs in a polymorphic linker region and cleaved proteins continue to function as heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mugford et al., 2009</xref>). The PMEs require processing at a dibasic RKxL/RRxL-like motif to remove the autoinhibitory prodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>). Processing of GELPs separate their catalytic triad but the cleavage site is unknown, and it is unknown if this affects the function of these enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Processing of glycosidases</title><p id="P36">We also discovered that glycosidases are processed. We detected the separation from the C-terminal domain in three different glycosidase families, and we highlighted the processing of glycosidases of the GH79 and GH38 families. It is unclear how these processing events affect glycosidase function, but the removal of CBDs is likely to affect the localization and specificity of these enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>RLK processing</title><p id="P37">Interestingly, the PROTOMAP dataset contains peptides of 37 RLKs suggesting receptor processing. Processing leads to the regulation of the activity of receptors via activation or deactivation but also to the generation of proteoforms with novel functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lichtenthaler et al., 2018</xref>). In most cases, peptides from ectodomains but not of the kinase domains were found. These data are consistent with ectodomain shedding that has been reported widely in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lichtenthaler et al., 2018</xref>). In plants, by contrast, only few ectodomain shedding events have been reported: chitin receptor CERK1 in Arabidopsis is cleaved in the second LysM motif of its ectodomain generating a N-terminal 33 kDa fragment. The <italic>cerk1-4</italic> mutant harbors a point mutation that impedes the generation of this N-terminal shedding product and these mutants are still able to perceive chitin but show enhanced cell death upon biotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Petutschnig et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, processing in the extracellular malectin-like domain of SYMRK from <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> generates a truncated version of the receptor that still contains an extracellular LRR domain but is less stable and more prompt to form a complex with the Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) thereby activating symbiotic development (Antolin-Llovera et al., 2014).</p><p id="P38">We also found one LRR-RLK (NbL10g02260) that not only shows putative ectodomain shedding, but also a kinase migrating at 40-44 kDa, indicating that this kinase is released from the membrane. Research on Notch receptors in mammals has shown that ectodomain shedding can induce subsequent processing and release of a cytosolic proteoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>). In plants, the proteolytic generation of cytosolic proteoforms of RLKs has been reported in four cases (Xa21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Park &amp; Ronald, 2012</xref>), BAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), TMK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gu et al., 2022</xref>) and FERONIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2023</xref>)). But in none of these cases, an ectodomain shedding event as reported preceding cytosolic processing How processing of the detected RLKs regulates signaling in plants is an exciting topic for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Double-tagged processing reporters</title><p id="P39">We used western blot analysis of transiently expressed double-tagged proteins to confirm several of the observed cleavage events. We noticed that some processing events were not detected by western blot of double-tagged precursors. There are several reasons for this. First, all proteins also accumulated as full-length proteins, even though these were often not detected in the peptographs. This is probably caused by the continuous overproduction of these proteins, causing either an overdose when compared to the processing enzymes, or an accumulation of the precursor before their processing. Second, not all processing events were detected with double tagged vectors. This could be caused by additional processing events closer to the N- and C-termini resulting in the removal of the reporter tags. The bulky reporter tags may also have caused misprocessing or mislocalization of the tagged protein. We nevertheless were able to confirm processing of several proteins, testifying that these cleavages occur <italic>in vivo</italic> and enabling us to use these proteins in the future as reporters to identify the proteases responsible for these cleavage events.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Further use of PROTOMAP data</title><p id="P40">Our PROTOMAP dataset can be mined further by searching the peptographs in the PDF file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>) with identifiers, PFAM domains, sequences, and functional names. A PDF editor can be used to quickly extract all peptographs with shared PFAM codes, identifiers or functional names. Extra care should be taken with the interpretation of peptographs showing very few peptides, but these peptographs are usually consistent with peptographs of other members of the same protein family. It should be stressed that the different proteoforms in peptographs may also result from alternative splicing and alternative initiation of transcription and translation. These cases can be identified using alternative gene models and mapping RNA seq reads on genome sequences. In addition, our PROTOMAP dataset lacks information of cleavage sites because it only contains tryptic peptides. Our searches for half-tryptic peptides reduced the confidence threshold, which drastically reduced the number of tryptic peptides and did not deliver many reliable cleavage events.</p><p id="P41">In conclusion, this PROTOMAP dataset revealed many fascinating novel proteoforms of plant proteins. We discovered that 59.7% of the proteins exist in multiple proteoforms that run at different apparent MWs in protein gels and are presumably the result of protein processing by proteases <italic>in vivo.</italic> This includes prodomain removal, the separation of catalytic triads and receptor shedding.

Spectra were searched against the LAB3.60 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> proteome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ranawaka et al., 2023</xref>). Permitted modifications included static carbamidomethylation and cysteines, variable N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation and trypsin specific digestion. The instrument type in Andromeda searches was set to Orbitrap and the precursor mass tolerance was set to ±20 ppm (first search) and ±4.5 ppm (main search). The MS/MS match tolerance was set to ±0.5 Da. The peptide spectrum match FDR and the protein FDR were set to 0.01 (based on target-decoy approach). Minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids. For protein quantification unique and razor peptides were allowed. Modified peptides were allowed for quantification. The minimum score for modified peptides was 40. Label-free protein quantification was switched on, and unique and razor peptides were considered for quantification with a minimum ratio count of 2. Retention times were recalibrated based on the built-in nonlinear time-rescaling algorithm. MS/MS identifications were transferred between LC-MS/MS runs with the “match between runs” option in which the maximal match time window was set to 0.7 min and the alignment time window set to 20 min. The quantification is based on the “value at maximum” of the extracted ion current. At least two quantitation events were required for a quantifiable protein.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>PROTOMAP analysis</title><p id="P50">Peptide reads were analysed in R with customized scripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplemental File S3</xref>). Contaminants and non-plant sequences were removed prior to any processing. To suppress noise signals of ions that were detected across many gel slices caused by high ionisation efficiencies in contrast to other peptides of the same proteins, we removed peptides from gel slices that were detected at &lt;10% of the total ion intensity of that peptide across all gel slices. For each protein, peptides were plotted along the sequence across each gel slice on peptograph with ggplot2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wickham, 2011</xref>). The number of peptides from each gel slice were plotted alongside as a reference of signal strength from the slice.
