Yet, our knowledge about the occurrence of these molecules in the marine environment, namely in planktonic protists, is still elusive. To fill this gap of knowledge we developed LncPlankton v1.0, which is the first comprehensive database of marine plankton lncRNAs. By integrating the predictions derived from ten distinctive coding potential prediction tools in a majority voting setting, we identified 2,210,359 lncRNAs distributed across 414 marine plankton species from over nine different phyla. A user-friendly, open-access web interface for the exploration of the database was implemented (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lncplankton.bio.ens.psl.eu/">https://www.lncplankton.bio.ens.psl.eu/</ext-link>). We believe LncPlankton v1.0 will serve as a rich resource for studies of lncRNAs that will contribute to small- and large-scale analyses in a wide range of marine plankton species and allow comparative analysis well beyond the marine environment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Often referred to as the “dark matter” of genomes, the non-protein coding DNA portion of eukaryotic genomes has, in the last decade, been shown to be much bigger than what could have been anticipated. Furthermore, with the advent of deep sequencing it has become clear that genomes are pervasively transcribed and that the non-coding fraction generates huge amounts of transcripts that cannot be accounted for as simple “junk” or transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Among this non-coding fraction, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the most abundant and prevalent class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). LncRNAs are arbitrarily defined as transcripts of more than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length that lack consensual open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Like mRNAs, lncRNAs are largely polyadenylated, capped and processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, besides their lack of protein coding potential, lncRNAs exhibit certain characteristics that distinguish them from mRNAs. These include a low GC content, low number of exons, short sequence length, low sequence conservation, and low expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In terms of function, lncRNAs have been shown to play important regulatory roles in various biological processes and diseases, namely cancers, which involve the control of epigenetic modifications as well as gene and protein expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">With the booming of high-throughput sequencing techniques and the exponential rise of transcriptomics data in public repositories, several databases dedicated to lncRNAs have been developed. Some are exclusively devoted to human lncRNAs, like GeneCaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and LNCipedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), while other databases have grouped together a significant number of lncRNAs coming from photosynthetic organisms such as CANTATAdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and GREENC v.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The NONCODE knowledge database v6.0 on the other hand compiled lncRNAs from 39 species including 16 animals and 23 plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and the RNAcentral catalogue is an extensive database of lncRNA sequences from a broad range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Despite such extensive work on the identification of lncRNAs in animals and plants, the ocean remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap of knowledge, our study took advantage of the publicly available transcriptomic data originating from more than 400 marine protists from the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project MMETSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), to perform a thorough screening to identify and annotate lncRNAs in marine plankton. In order to do this, a computational pipeline using a majority voting-based ensemble learning technique was developed and applied. The objective was to increase the reliability and promote the diversity of the ensemble model. Furthermore, a joint prediction is likely to behave better than any single model as recommended by Duan Y. et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and likely obtain higher cross-species prediction performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In order to use the strength of multiple classifiers and to enhance their performance, several ensemble methods have been developed in recent years, such as TLClnc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), which combined a stacking of SVM predictors and a naïve Bayes classifier. Conversely, Simopoulos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) proposed a prediction method based on the stochastic gradient boosting of random forest classifiers, and LncRNApred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) proposes a method using hybrid features. To promote the reliability of the results, CRlncRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) was developed on the basis of five machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict cancer-related lncRNAs. In our study, we combined ten coding potential prediction classifiers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) into a single meta-learner. The selected tools used different AI algorithms, provided models pre-trained with diverse fine-tuned features, were non-species specific and achieved good performance within a reasonable runtime. Furthermore, two tools considering full and partial sequence length were included, mRNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and LncADeep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In addition, the tools selected presented a good usability score, which is based on ease-of-use in installation and running of the tool as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Briefly, each transcript was predicted by each classifier and labelled as “Coding” or “Noncoding”, and the class with the highest number of votes was the outcome. Several filters were applied on the “Noncoding” set to discriminate between lncRNAs and sncRNAs.</p><p id="P4">The predicted lncRNAs and their annotations, including the nucleotide sequence, the encoded ORF(s), the folding energy, and the predicted secondary structure were organized and stored in a database, LncPlankton, with the aim to update it periodically on the basis of new knowledge and a potential expansion in the number of planktonic species screened. A user-friendly, open-access web interface for the exploration of the database was also implemented (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lncplankton.bio.ens.psl.eu/">https://www.lncplankton.bio.ens.psl.eu/</ext-link>). The user interface provides modules for browsing, searching, and downloading lncRNA data per species and/or per phylum, as well as interactive graphs, and an online BLAST service. Additionally, a SHINY application was integrated which allows the user to customize and visualize the classifications. With this user-friendly interface, we anticipate that LncPlankton will provide a rich source of information about lncRNAs for small-and large-scale studies in a variety of plankton taxa and contribute significantly to future efforts aimed at deciphering the biology and evolution of lncRNAs in diverse eukaryotic lineages.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Data sources</title><p id="P5">In the current version of LncPlankton (version 1.0), transcriptomic data of 406 marine micro-planktonic species derived from the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) were used. The most represented phylum is Bacillariophyta (diatoms), to which we have additionally added the transcriptomes of six other cosmopolitan diatom genera, originally not included in the MMETSP project. Furthermore, the transcriptomes of the two reference diatom species, <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and <italic>Thalasiossira pseudonana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), were also included and assembled using an in-house assembly pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Taken together the transcriptomes screened covered &gt; 9 phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In total, 11,623,179 contigs were obtained across 414 species, almost half of which belonging to the Dinophyta and Bacillariophyta groups, with 3.4 and 2.4 million contigs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The average contig length varied between 593nt (Dinophyta) and 949nt (Cercozoa) with a median = 651nt across all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Data analysis pipeline</title><p id="P6">The assembled transcriptomes (in a <italic>FASTA</italic> format) provided by the MMETSP project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) were screened for the prediction and identification of lncRNA-like transcripts, in each species, using the majority voting-based procedure inspired by the ensemble machine learning methods. The aim was to increase the reliability and promote the diversity of the ensemble model by combining all the predictions from multiple models. To achieve that, 10 protein coding potential prediction tools were selected and used in the pipeline. Each tool used a different algorithm and different training features, and may produce a different classification result. Aggregating those different techniques in a majority setting led to a single prediction representing the group’s consensus. We believe that such a hybrid technique leads to more reliable results and acceptable performance.</p><p id="P7">We selected the 10 tools according to the following criteria: i) the tools must use a different AI approach: among the 10 tools, 3 used a SVM-based model CPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), LncFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and longdist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), 2 were based on XGBOOST LncDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and RNAmining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>); 2 on maximum likelihood estimation MLE, and logistic regression LGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and CPAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), respectively; and 3 other tools were based on deep learning approaches with different intrinsic architectures; convolutional neural network CNN in RNASamba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), Recurrent neural network RNN in mRNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and deep belief network DBN in LncADeep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>); ii) the tools must provide pre-trained models with diverse fine-tuned classification features; and iii) the tools should achieve good performance, particularly for cross-species prediction within a reasonable ease-to-use score according to the usability score defined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In addition, the tools should accept sequences presented in a <italic>FASTA</italic> format. The tools selected and the key characteristics of each of them are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p><p id="P8">The selected tools were applied using their default parameters and their default pre-trained classification models. The Python package <italic>ezLncPred</italic> (V.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) was used to run the following tools: CPC2, CPAT (<italic>-p Human</italic>), LGC and longdist. The remaining tools were run using an in-house script with the following parameters: LncADeep (<italic>-MODE lncRNA</italic>, and the coding potential probability of a transcript was calculated as the mean of probabilities generated by the 21 intrinsic models of the algorithm), lncFinder (<italic>svm</italic>.<italic>model=“human”</italic>), mRNN (mRNN_ensemble which used the weighted average prediction of the five best single mRNN models), RNAmining (<italic>-organism_name Homo_sapiens</italic>), and RNASamba (Full and partial weighted models were included). The <italic>FASTA</italic> files containing the sequence contigs were used as an input to the pipeline displayed in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Basically, a transcript sequence was inputted to each tool which predicted both the forward and the reverse strand, and labelled them as “Coding-like” or “NonCoding-like”. A transcript was considered as “NonCoding-like” within a single tool only if both strands were labelled “NonCoding-like”, otherwise it was assigned the “Coding-like” label. For the assembly of the two species <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and <italic>Thalasiossira pseudonana</italic>, stranded libraries were used, thus only the forward strand was assessed. The majority label output from all the tools was considered as the final coding potential class. Alongside the majority class, a non-coding potential score was calculated as the number of tools labelling the transcript as “NonCoding-like” divided by 10. This score was used to calculate the reliability (confidence level) of the lncRNA transcripts identified. The transcripts with significant hits in either the Pfam (V.35.0) or SwissProt (V.2023.01) databases were filtered out. A series of stringent filters was then applied to the “NonCoding-like” transcript sequences to classify them as long noncoding RNAs “lncRNAs” or small noncoding RNAs “sncRNAs” on the basis of transcript length and peptide length information.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Evaluation of the performance of the majority voting-based procedure</title><p id="P9">The majority voting-based pipeline was tested on different sets of coding and non-coding datasets related to 18 different organism species and compared to the state-of-the-art coding potential prediction tools. Each tested dataset was independent of the training sets used in the construction of the pre-trained classification models related to each method. Among the 18 organisms tested, 10 datasets were perfectly balanced, containing the same number of coding and non-coding RNA transcripts. Furthermore, in order to test the robustness of the tools towards biased datasets, 7 highly imbalanced testing sets were considered. The description of the tested datasets is provided in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Each tool was applied to each tested dataset to predict the classes of the transcripts.

The API returns documents in the JSON format and can be used in any programming language. In the current version of LncPlankton, three APIs were implemented and documented to access and use data: <list list-type="bullet" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P29"><italic>GET /lncRNA_details:</italic> information about lncRNA transcript including: sequence length, peptide length, reliability (confidence calculated by the majority voting-based procedure), GC content, ORF coverage, MFE, Fickett score, isoelectric point, nucleotide sequence, peptide sequence.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P30"><italic>GET /search_per_species:</italic> detailed information about species including the number and the percentage of transcript predicted.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P31"><italic>GET /search_per_phylum</italic>: detailed information about phylum including number of species, and statistics about the prediction of the transcriptomes of the species.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Discussion and Future Directions</title><p id="P32">Determining the coding potential of a transcript is a crucial step in the identification of lncRNAs, yet it represents a complex task due to overlapping characteristics and functions that exist between coding and noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To overcome this challenge, many computational methods have been developed. The majority of tools use features derived from the nucleotide sequence of the transcript such as the Fickett score, GC content, and kmer composition. Some of the tools like lncFinder use secondary structure properties to try to improve the discrimination between non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs. Despite the good performances reported in many studies for those tools, they generate a significant number of false positives and false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and their reliability is questionable, which introduces uncertainty to the findings. As reported in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), the lncRNA content of the LncPlankton database varies according to the coding potential prediction tool used; for instances only 7.73% of the transcripts of the MMETSP datasets were predicted as lncRNAs when using mRNN but this number reached 33.64% with LGC. Such difference in findings is inevitably caused by the intrinsic algorithms used by each method, the training set, and the fine-tuned learning features and parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table S1</xref>). In our pipeline, we opted for the use of a combination of multiple tools in a majority voting setting, inspired from the ensemble method technique used in machine learning. With this approach, 19% of the whole planktonic transcriptomes surveyed in this study was labelled as “lncRNAs”.</p><p id="P33">The choice of the coding potential prediction tool is not trivial and in most cases the criteria of evaluating these tools was based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the computational time, but nothing has been reported about the reliability. In our case, the reliability of a predicted lncRNA transcript was calculated as the number of tools labelling the transcript as lncRNAs and dividing by 10, the total number of used tools. Therefore, a non-coding score value closer to 1 denotes a higher reliability. The density of this score, calculated on the lncRNAs found by our pipeline and distributed across groups shows high density at 0.6 and 0.7, decreasing at higher score values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). A significant part of lncRNAs found have a <bold>medium</bold> reliability of 0.6 or 0.7, meaning that at least 6 or 7 tools have predicted them as lncRNAs. A less significant number of lncRNAs have a score = 1 (239,116, ~10,8% of the predicted lncRNAs), which means all the tools agreed that those transcripts are indeed lncRNAs. We called these <bold>high confidence</bold> lncRNAs. The remaining lncRNAs found have a <bold>good</bold> reliability with a score ranging between 0.8 and 0.9.</p><p id="P34">Regarding the filters introduced in our pipeline to discriminate lncRNA from other transcripts, default values were used for the transcript length (= 200nt), and the putative peptide length (= 100aa). Regarding peptide length, 1,475,973 lncRNA-like having predicted peptides &gt; 3aa long which represent ~ 67% of the total identified lncRNAs. Since lncRNAs are likely to possess ORFs purely by chance, discarding any transcripts containing ORFs would result in losing a significant number of true lncRNAs. Although this value has no fixed limit, the user can customize it in the SHINY prediction application developed and integrated to the LncPlankton user interface.</p><p id="P35">As part of our pipeline, we used a meta-learner combining multiple and diverse protein coding potential tools. We assessed the performance of our meta-learner using gold standard metrics such as the accuracy and AUC-ROC, and compared to each single tool. Overall, our method showed similar performance to the top performing coding potential tools, and it maintained a good performance in challenging cases in which some tools found difficulties to discriminate coding from non-coding transcripts. For highly imbalanced datasets like <italic>B_taurus, X_tropicalis</italic>, and <italic>M_mulatta</italic> which have a 1:72, 1:32, and 1:22 ratio of the number of coding to non-coding instances, some tools performed poorly longdist and RNAmining, while our method preserved a high accuracy meaning that our method is not impacted by the imbalancedness between coding and non-coding classes. The following aspects supported our choice to use the meta-learner proposed: <bold>i)</bold> the meta-learner used diverse and heterogeneous models covering a broad range of species since each model related to each tool was trained using transcripts of different species. Therefore, we believe that our method is a suitable choice for cross-species prediction; <bold>ii)</bold> our method achieved the highest accuracy. There are two reasons why the meta-learner outperforms others. First, our method benefited from the ensemble method principle since it combined multiple single tools. Second, the method integrated information from different types of features to enhance lncRNA prediction performances; <bold>iii)</bold> our method is robust showing a low variability of the prediction across the different testing datasets; <bold>iv)</bold> our method promotes the diversity which is coming from the different mathematics and algorithms used by each single tool, and fine-tuned features and parameters. Indeed, by pooling all the tools together, our method allowed an in-depth analysis of the transcripts by using all possible features describing the sequences; <bold>v)</bold> the reliability of the prediction in our method can be measured by the non-coding potential probability of the ensemble. It reflects the agreement of the tools to recognize the correct class of a transcript. In our method, we set the threshold to a value = 0.6 i.e. if at least 6 out of 10 tools recognized a transcript as non-coding RNA, it is more likely to be a non-coding RNA than a coding RNA. Increasing this threshold to 1 means that all the tools recognize it as a non-coding RNA. We believe the majority voting tool offers us a reliable choice for lncRNA identification, beyond what a single tool can offer at the moment.</p><p id="P36">We collected all the reliable lncRNAs predicted by our pipeline and their information, and stored them in a MySQL database termed LncPlankton. Many databases of lncRNAs have been implemented in the past few years but most of them are dedicated to humans, vertebrates and plants. To date, no other database of this scale collecting non-coding transcripts on planktonic organisms, with representatives from the major branches of the eukaryotic tree of life, has been developed. Although a few algal species have been included in plant lncRNA databases: 6 algae in GreenC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and 3 algae in Cantatadb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), no database was completely dedicated to lncRNA in planktonic species. Compared with other lncRNA databases, the lncRNA transcripts of LncPlankton were predicted using the majority voting pipeline with stringent filters making them more reliable than what we could get with other pipelines using a single coding potential prediction tool.</p><p id="P37">Similar to other lncRNA databases, LncPlankton v1.0 includes all the basic information of a given lncRNA including the nucleotide sequence, the longest ORF sequence, and the predicted secondary structure. Two missing features of lncRNA recorded in LncPlankton v1.0 are the genomic coordinates (the start and stop position, and the strand information), and the expression profiles. This is due to the lack of an annotated genome for the species surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In addition to the regular update of the database, the following future developments will be considered: <bold>i)</bold> the genomic coordinates of lncRNAs will be incorporated to further classify the lncRNAs identified as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic-lncRNAs, or antisense as this information becomes available; <bold>ii)</bold> the expression patterns can be integrated for the functional study of lncRNAs identified; <bold>iii)</bold> even if lncRNAs do not show high conservation at the nucleotide level, a sequence clustering using <italic>Orthofinder</italic> algorithm will be performed to provide information about highly conserved lncRNAs; <bold>iv)</bold> given that lncRNAs of related functions often share similar short motif profiles, we will use a kmer-based approach called <italic>SEEKR</italic> proposed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) to quantify the nonlinear sequence homology and the evolutionary relationships between the lncRNAs predicted in LncPlankton.</p><p id="P38">In addition, the UI will be improved accordingly by adding a submit page to the LncPlankton interface to enhance the interaction between the research community and the database, and to encourage all scientists to supply their own assembled contig data. All submitted entries will be processed by our procedure described in Materials and Methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p id="P39">Supplementary Data are available at bioRxiv online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS190626-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has used the computational resources of the Bioclust cluster (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioclustg01.bioclust.biologie.ens.fr/">https://bioclustg01.bioclust.biologie.ens.fr/</ext-link>).
