While WCMs offer deeper insights into how cells behave, they also require significant computational resources to run, making their development and use challenging. To address this limitation it is possible to use simpler machine learning (ML) surrogates that can learn to approximate specific behaviours of larger and more complex models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. Here, we show how a ML surrogate can be trained on WCM outputs to accurately predict whether cells divide successfully when a subset of genes are removed (knocked out). Our ML surrogate performs simulations up to 15 times faster than the original WCM. We then used the surrogate and a genome-design algorithm to generate an <italic>in silico</italic> reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> cell, where 40% of the genes included in the WCM were removed. These results demonstrate the value of adopting WCMs and ML surrogates for enabling genome-wide engineering of living cells, offering promising new routes for biologists to design cellular phenotypes, and understand how they can emerge from engineered genotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Whole-cell models (WCMs) are comprehensive computational models that aim to capture the dynamics of all core biomolecular processes and components of a cell, as well as their interactions with the wider environment. The development of whole-cell modelling is considered a grand challenge of the 21<italic><sup>st</sup></italic> century and is seen as particularly useful for understanding the complex relationship between the genotype and phenotype of a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The derivation of WCMs has been made possible by the rapidly increasing availability of experimental data and high-throughput assays that allow researchers to gain a more holistic understanding of biological processes. There are currently three published WCMs: one for <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], one for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and one for the minimal synthetic cell JCVI-syn3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM is represented mechanistically both at the single-cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Numerous biological discoveries have arisen from the development and utilization of WCMs. For example, Sanghvi <italic>et al.</italic> used a WCM in conjunction with experimental data to examine the growth rates of <italic>M. genitalium</italic> and make predictions concerning kinetic parameters of specific enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. By cross-validating numerous <italic>E. coli</italic> datasets during the construction of the WCM, Macklin <italic>et al.</italic> identified several inconsistencies in the literature, which when resolved, enabled the model to accurately predict <italic>in vitro</italic> protein half-lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Additionally, the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM has recently been applied to better understand the differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of tRNA aminoacylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The population-level <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM, which considers many independent cells within a shared environment, has been instrumental in assessing antibiotic responses and identifying sub-generationally expressed genes that significantly impact cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Design-build-test-learn cycles can also be optimized using WCMs, with the <italic>M. genitalium</italic> WCM being used to predict minimal genomes <italic>in silico</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the relationship between gene knock outs, cellular subsystems and phenotypes has been better understood through a combination of WCM simulations and machine learning-based classifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The comprehensive nature of WCMs enables detailed spatial-temporal tracking of cellular processes and components. However, this detail also imparts a substantial computational burden. Simulating a single generation of the <italic>M. genitalium</italic> WCM can take between 5 and 12 hours using a single CPU and 8 GB of RAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In comparison, simulating a single cell division of <italic>E. coli</italic> using the single-cell model only takes approximately 15 minutes on a similar computer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Despite simulation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM being much faster than for the <italic>M. genitalium</italic> model, the increase in the number of modelled genes enlarges the possible combinations that have to be tested when using these models to predict phenotypes from genotypes over several cell divisions (i.e. generations). The complexity of WCMs in general stems from the massive number of time series they generate, tracking the tens of thousands of variables (i.e. molecule counts) that are present. Nevertheless, in many applications, researchers are only interested in a specific subset of these outputs (e.g., the overall cellular mass). ML surrogates represent a solution to address this computational burden by exclusively making predictions for the outputs of interest after being trained on data generated by a WCM.</p><p id="P6">ML surrogates, or emulators as they are sometimes known, are black-box models trained to approximate the behaviour of complex and computationally expensive mathematical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The major advantage of their use is the reduced computational resources required, thus allowing the simulation time to fall from hours or days to seconds. ML surrogates are trained using data simulated by mechanistic models, taking as input their initial conditions and/or parameters, and are designed to predict some or all of the original model’s outputs. The choice of ML algorithm depends on the nature of the problem, the amount and type of available data, and the desired accuracy. ML surrogates have been used to emulate several biomedical mechanistic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and some molecular biology systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], allowing for efficient exploration of a mechanistic model’s parameter space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], as well as supporting model optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. ML surrogates have emulated mechanistic models based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)-based models have only been used to show how a surrogate can be trained, but no significant improvement in computational time was observed for the system analysed to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In this study, we use a random forest-based ML surrogate to simulate <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with reduced genomes (i.e. genomes containing fewer genes). Experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and <italic>in silico</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] studies have aimed to design reduced genomes for different organisms, removing as many genes as possible, while ensuring the cell remains viable (i.e. is able to divide and replicate). WCMs have already been used to design minimal genomes <italic>in silico</italic> for <italic>M. genitalium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], which was possible due to the small size of the genome (401 genes modelled) and the fact that the cells were simulated for only one generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM (used here) captures the functionality of 1,219 genes and can be run for as many generations as we choose. Given this additional complexity, we estimated that using a similar approach to the one used by Rees-Garbutt et al. for <italic>M. genitalium</italic> would not be possible for <italic>E. coli</italic> without reducing the simulation time. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show how an ML surrogate can emulate a large and complex biological model, that integrates different mathematical modelling techniques and contains over 10,000 equations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Data preparation for the ML surrogate</title><p id="P8">The ML surrogate presented in this study, trained on data produced by the <italic>E. coli</italic> single-cell WCM, aims to predict whether a cell will divide when a subset of its genes are removed. Before we could train the ML surrogate, it was necessary to perform some data pre-processing on the WCM outputs. Firstly, we needed to decide how long the simulations should be run for (e.g., the number of generations) and what features/states from the WCM to use to train the ML surrogate. Preliminary experiments where we simulated cell growth for four generations showed that in some cases the cells divided but also exhibited significant growth defects, especially in protein mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S.1 and S.2</xref>). This suggested that more than four generations should be simulated. The analysis presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.1</xref> showed that 96% of the cells that failed to divide in eight generations, actually did so in the first six generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S.3</xref>) and therefore this number of generations was used to generate the ML surrogate training data.</p><p id="P9">Additional decisions had to be made regarding the features to be used. Due to the high dimensionality of the WCM (over 10,000 equations and 19,000 parameters), we began by looking only at 22 different macromolecular masses as variables that could capture a summary of the cell’s state. We compared the accuracy of ML surrogates using the values of these variables (i.e. features) either at the beginning of the simulations (<italic>t</italic> = 0, generation 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.1</xref>) or at the end of generation 1, just before the first cell divides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.3</xref>). We saw an improvement of approximately 16% in the F1-score of the training set and 18% for the test set, when using values at the last time step of generation 1 as features. Therefore, for the rest of this study, we chose to use as features the state of the cell at the last time step before the first division. A summary of the training procedure that will be used in this study can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and the data preparation techniques are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.1</xref>. An overview of the simulations run to train the ML surrogates is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">Upon further investigation, we found that many of the macromolecular masses used as features to train the ML model were highly correlated, suggesting that not all 22 features were necessary. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S.4</xref> shows the correlation matrix between all the 22 features. These values were used to select only those features with a Pearson correlation &lt; 0.95, allowing us to reduce the number of features used to train the ML model to 12 (cell mass, growth, DNA mass, tRNA mass, extracellular mass, protein mass, projection mass, pilus mass, mRNA mass, small molecule mass, instantaneous growth rate, membrane mass). This reduction did not affect the accuracy of the ML surrogate.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Training the ML surrogate</title><p id="P11">We ran 924 single gene knock out simulations corresponding to the knock out of 462 genes, each run twice, of which 738 were used to train the ML surrogate and 186 to test it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The 12 key macromolecular masses at the last time point of the first generation were then used by a random forest classifier to predict whether all cells in 6 generations divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">A random forest classifier was chosen due to its simplicity, explainability and performance for classification tasks in diverse contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. To assess the random forest model proposed here we used k-fold cross-validation on the training set to tune the model’s parameters and avoid overfitting. We also tested the model’s performance on a hold-out test set (containing data not used when training). We obtain an F1-score of 0.92 on the training set, 0.9 when averaging the cross-validation results, and 0.93 on the hold-out test set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.3</xref>). The corresponding confusion matrices show that when the ML model predicts that not all cells in 6 generations will divide (i.e. the gene knock out impacted viability), it is correct for 259 out of 261 cases (99%) of the data points in the training set, and 74 out of 76 (98%) of the data points in the test set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.A</xref>). In the context of minimal genome design, this suggests that guided by the ML surrogate, it is possible to limit the removal of essential genes, that upon deletion from the genome cause failure in the division of at least one cell in six generations.</p><p id="P13">Our random forest classifier was trained, validated and tested repeatedly on these selected 12 features and the results showed that only four of them were necessary for making an accurate prediction. One of the advantages of using a random forest classifier is that it also ranks the importance of the features used for a prediction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that the most important feature is the cell mass, followed by the DNA mass, the extracellular mass and the membrane mass. More details about the impact of the features on the classifier and the misclassified data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.2</xref>.</p><p id="P14">This initial random forest surrogate was trained on single gene knock outs and tested on both single and double gene knock outs. The F1-score when testing the surrogate on double gene knock outs was 0.93 and there were no false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.3</xref>). However, testing this initial ML surrogate on multiple gene knock outs (necessary for generating a reduced genome) resulted in an F1-score of 0.82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.3</xref>), a drop in performance when compared to the single and double gene knock out results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> shows a scatter plot of the main two features used by the classifiers (at the end of generation one, just before cell division). We observed that when deleting more genes, the cell and DNA masses become more similar among the deadly and non-deadly knock outs. Specifically, both the DNA and cell mass of the deadly knock outs are higher compared to when we knock out single genes. This suggests that in order to classify multiple gene knock outs, the surrogate has to be retrained using more features and data representing multiple gene knock outs.</p><p id="P15">To address this, the surrogate was retrained by extending the initial training set of 738 single gene knock outs to additionally include 248 multiple gene knock outs, each run once for 6 generations (a list of the genes knocked out can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The F1-score when tested on single and double gene knock outs remained similar, but when tested on the hold-out set of multiple gene knock outs (that were not used for training) it was 0.88, representing a 0.06 increase in F1-score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) despite dealing with a much more challenging task compared to classifying single gene knock outs. When retraining using the multiple gene knock outs, we used 11 of the uncorrelated macromolecular masses obtained following the correlation analysis described previously (the instantaneous growth rate was removed due to its similarity to the growth output perceived by the random forest). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the DNA mass, the membrane mass and the projection mass are essential for making accurate predictions. More information on the data used to retrain the ML surrogate can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genome reduction</title><p id="P16">To demonstrate the value of the trained surrogate model, we showed that it can be used to design a reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> genome that still functions (i.e. divides) <italic>in silico</italic>. To do this, we used Minesweeper, an algorithm inspired by laboratory fragment-cassette-fraction genome engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] that employs a divide and conquer approach, which was used previously to find minimal genomes using the <italic>M. genitalium</italic> WCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Minesweeper requires simulating single gene knock outs and thousands of multiple gene knock outs. To do this, we used our trained surrogate model.</p><p id="P17"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the framework used to obtain the reduced genome using Minesweeper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. This algorithm was used to identify genes that can be removed from the genome, without losing the cell’s capability to divide successfully in six generations. Stage one of Minesweeper predicted the essentiality of every single gene in the WCM. This was done using the initial random forest surrogate trained only on single gene knock outs for all modelled genes (1219), as the F1-score was sufficiently high for single gene knock outs. The algorithm predicted that 1047 genes were non-essential and 172 genes were essential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Only the 1047 genes predicted as non-essential were considered for future deletions.</p><p id="P18">In stage two, we created 56 groups containing different percentages of genes to be removed from the genome (this is a modification compared to the previous version of Minesweeper, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for details). The simulations corresponding to the removal of these groups were run using the WCM (simulating six generations). Out of the 56 deletion groups, the removal of 20 of them produced dividing cells in six generations. These 20 groups correspond to two 12.5% groups, four 10% groups and fourteen 5% groups.</p><p id="P19">At this point the ML surrogate was retrained using combinations of these 20 segments as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.3</xref>. Next, stage three took the three largest segments that the WCM suggested can be deleted in stage two (two 12.5% groups and one 10% group) and created powersets: all possible combinations for each of these largest segments and the remaining division-producing segments from stage two that do not overlap with the largest segment. The retrained ML surrogate was used at this stage to predict whether all cells in six generations divided when these combinations were deleted. To make sure that the largest deletion that divided was carried to the next stage of Minesweeper, we tested the top 20 largest deletions using the full six generations simulations of the WCM.</p><p id="P20">Stage four is cyclical. It started by taking the largest segment from stage three (for each of the three segments tested), which when removed produced a dividing cell, and it generated eight groups from the remaining genes (not included in the segment). After that, it created a powerset of combinations between these groups of genes and the current largest deleted segment. If some deletants formed by the removal of these combinations divided, it updated its record of the largest deletion segment and the remaining genes accordingly. If none of the combinations divided, it appended individual genes to the previous largest deletion segment. If some of these divided, it updated the list of remaining genes. If none divided, the algorithm stops. We ran this cycle three times starting from the largest deletions of each of the three groups from stage three. The retrained ML surrogate was used to make predictions for these three iterations, after which additional data was added to the training set and the surrogate was trained once again (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Section S.3</xref>). These three cycles produced three reduced cells (i.e. ignoring the single gene additions to the largest deleted set from stage four in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The size of these reduced cells varies between 803 genes at the beginning of stage four simulations and 737 genes at the end.</p><p id="P21">The final and smallest reduced genome, EMine-737, contained 737 genes out of the 1219 modelled by the WCM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). This represents a 40% reduction of the WCM’s genome in minimal M9 media supplemented with 0.4% glucose. To obtain this result, we simulated 1525 genomes running the WCM for 6 generations and 39,086 genomes running the WCM for one generation and predicting division using the ML surrogates. Assuming that we are running simulations using one CPU on a standard desktop computer and that all cells in six generations would have divided, running all simulations (1525 for six generations and 39,086 for one generation) would have taken approximately two and a half years. Without the ML surrogate (running all simulations for six generations) would have taken approximately 36 years, resulting in a reduction in computational time of 94%. The simulations used in this study were run in parallel, on a supercomputer, where possible. In total, all simulations described above took approximately 4 months to complete.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Reduced <italic>in silico</italic> genome (EMine-737) analysis</title><sec id="S7"><title>Reduced genome growth analysis</title><p id="P22">The reduced genome was simulated 50 times for six generations (each dividing cell producing two daughters) using the WCM to assess its stability.

We compared the growth and masses of the 50 repetitions of EMine-737 to those of 50 repetitions of wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that the average cell mass of the EMine-737 cells is 1286.96 fg compared to 1669.52 fg for wildtype cells. The reduced genome cells also grow more slowly (0.13 average growth rate of EMine-737 compared to 0.24 for wildtype cells) and therefore take longer to divide compared to their wildtype counterpart, which may be caused by the fact that the cells simulated by the WCM need to reach a certain mass before they divide. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that the RNA and protein mass of the reduced genome are often higher than those of wildtype cells. However, when looking at the statistics across the time series, the average protein mass over six generations is 215.64 fg for EMine-737 and 230 fg for wildtype cells, while the standard deviation of the protein mass over six generations is 89.14 fg for EMine-737 and 54.18 fg for wildtype cells.</p><p id="P23">To further assess the stability of the EMine-737 genome, we also ran 10 generation simulations for 50 repetitions (seeds) using the WCM, where each dividing cell produced only one daughter (to ensure reasonable computational demands).

The eighteen categories with all categorised genes removed from the genome correspond to ten biological processes (representing different catabolic and metabolic processes, as well as the import of different substances across the plasma membrane), four cellular components (represented by genes involved in different complexes) and four molecular functions (representing genes involved in activities such as oxidoreductase, dehydrogenase and hydratase). All these gene ontology terms and their corresponding genes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 8</xref>.</p><p id="P25">The cells simulated in this study are grown in M9 media with glucose under aerobic conditions. Therefore, they will primarily rely on glucose metabolism pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production and carbon metabolism, suggesting that genes involved in the breakdown and metabolism of other sugars might not be essential in this environmental context. To exemplify this, the gene ontology analysis of the genes removed from EMine-737 showed the genes involved in the glycolate catabolic process, the glyoxylate catabolic process and the glyoxylate metabolic process are removed from EMine-737. The glycolate degradation pathway that feeds into glycolysis is essential for <italic>E. coli</italic> to grow on glycolate or glyoxylate substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], but not when glucose is the carbon source. Another two processes removed from EMine-737 that involve the breakdown or synthesis of sugars are the D-tagatose 6-phosphate catabolic process and the dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].

Similarly, the L-ascorbic acid degradation process was also affected in EMine-737 by the removal of the <italic>sgbU, ulaE</italic> and <italic>ulaF</italic> genes, which in aerobic conditions may affect the cell’s capability to use L-ascorbic acid as a carbon source, however since the media is supplemented with glucose, this is unlikely to be a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Another set of gene ontology terms removed from EMine-737 include the transport of amino acids such as L-histidine and L-glutamine across the plasma membrane.

In fact, all the genes involved in the biosynthesis pathway of L-histidine (<italic>hisABCDFGHI</italic>) and L-glutamine (<italic>glnA</italic>) are still present in the EMine-737 genome.

The removal of the epoxidase complex is likely to affect the cell’s ability to metabolize certain aromatic compounds efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], but these do not seem to significantly affect the ability of the cell to grow or to produce ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> can use alternative terminal oxydase pathways to cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase complex and respiratory chain complex I, in aerobic conditions, for energy production, such as the cytochrome <italic>bd</italic>-I and cytochrome <italic>bd</italic>-II complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The genes involved in the oxidoreduction transmembrane activity (one of the molecular functions removed from EMine-737) are the same as those involved in the cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase complex and they are classified in the literature as non-essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P28">The dimethyl sulfoxide metabolic process is also removed from EMine-737, which represents a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], but without significant activity in aerobic conditions. Similarly, the plasma membrane fumarate reductase enzyme complex removed in EMine-737 is catalysing the reduction of fumarate to succinate in anaerobic conditions, but its absence in aerobic conditions should not affect the cell significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The other two molecular function ontology terms removed from EMine-737 involve a combination of the genes <italic>fadBIJ</italic> and <italic>paaFHZ</italic>.

Specifically, we showed that a search that on a typical desktop PC would take over 36 years, can be reduced to approximately 2.5 years. Here, we used our ML surrogate model to predict a binary variable (cell division), but we are confident that this approach can be expanded to predict continuous variables such as metabolic yield, or to forecast time series corresponding to some variables of interest. To predict continuous variables, it would be necessary to train regression-based surrogate models, while for time series forecasting, deep learning approaches such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks could be used. These methods could be useful when using the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM for metabolic engineering, particularly when many simulations need to be run.</p><p id="P33">Typically, ML surrogates are trained on initial conditions and/or the parameters of mechanistic models. In this study, this was not possible due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the WCM. We would have needed more than 10,000 training examples to avoid having more features than training data. Instead, the surrogate presented here was trained using feature variables that summarise the state of the cells (i.e. macromolecular masses). Moreover, rather than using the initial state of these variables, we chose to use the state at the end of the first generation of each genome simulation, which increased the F1-score of the classifier by 16-18%, as shown in the data preparation section. This suggests that there is not enough information regarding the cellular dynamics at the beginning of each simulation to make an accurate prediction. Even with this approach, the number of cells that had to be simulated in six generations was reduced from 63 using only the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM to one using the ML surrogate (assuming all daughter cells in six generations divide).</p><p id="P34">The performance of our surrogate, F1-score of 0.93 on single gene knock outs test set suggests that the cell mass, DNA mass, extracellular mass and membrane mass at the end of generation one hold enough information to predict the future viability of the daughter cells for another 5 generations. Regarding the false negative predictions made by the ML surrogate, they are likely caused by the fact that the decrease in cell and DNA mass is not obvious enough at the end of generation one, resulting in the ML surrogate misclassifying the knock out. Gene ontology analysis performed on the misclassified genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 10</xref>), did not reveal any obvious pattern regarding a particular type of genes that are more likely to be misclassified. False negatives are not a problem in the context of genome reductions, as misclassified knock outs will still be identified in later stages of reduction. In contrast, false positives are more problematic, as they decrease the potential pool of genes to be deleted when searching for a minimal genome. The ML surrogates presented in this study have a small false positive rate of 1-2%. The performance of the ML surrogate could potentially be further improved by building a time series classifier that takes as input the whole time series representing the macromolecular masses of first generation cells and predicts whether all cells in the future generations divide.</p><p id="P35">The genome obtained by using a combination of six generations of WCM simulations and the ML surrogates was reduced by 40%, from 1219 genes to 737. A direct comparison to the literature <italic>in vivo</italic> results is not possible because the WCM only includes the functionality of a fraction of <italic>E. coli’s</italic> MG1655 genome. Despite this limitation, the 383 genes deleted only in EMine-737 genome (i.e. not removed as part of MS56’s genome reduction) should be analysed further and tested experimentally. Mathematical models are not perfect and we are aware of the current limitations of the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM (e.g. not all genes are modelled yet, the WCM was built using data from several strains, it was not tuned to perform genome design tasks), therefore we do not expect that when the genome proposed here is tested experimentally, the cell will remain viable. However, we believe that this data could guide future experimental avenues for obtaining reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes.</p><p id="P36">The increase in protein and RNA mass of the reduced <italic>in silico</italic> genome is another avenue worth investigating in future experimental and computational studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, to what we observe here, other studies have also shown that genome reduction in <italic>S. lividans</italic> increased the secretion of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. One of the main reasons for building reduced genomes is to have organisms that are highly efficient at utilizing the resources available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], for example, more efficient synthesis of proteins and RNAs could yield heightened gene expression levels, with more proteins produced per given unit of cellular resources.</p><p id="P37">In this study the Minesweeper algorithm was stopped before converging due to the high number of simulations already run (over 39,000) and resulting time constraints, emphasising the importance of using a surrogate. However, it is possible that if continued, this approach can lead to a further reduced genome. Additionally, as more genes are added to the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM, the number of algorithmic iterations needed to search for reduced genomes will increase. As WCMs become more powerful and better at matching cellular phenotypes, their computational complexity needs to be addressed for genome design tasks, making the use of ML surrogates timely and advantageous.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>The <italic>E. coli</italic> whole-cell model simulations</title><p id="P38">In this study, we are using the single-cell version of the <italic>E. coli</italic> whole-cell model, which can be thought of as a large system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) where the state variables of the ODEs correspond to different cellular states, and the differential equations correspond to cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].

The process for training such a machine learning model involves running the mechanistic model several times in order to generate the training and test sets. After that, the ML model is trained using this data, and once the accuracy is satisfactory, it can be used to replace the original mechanistic model in future simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Some common techniques used to create surrogate models include regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], Gaussian processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], support vector machines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], decision tree-based models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P42">Typically, a machine learning surrogate model is trained on the parameters and/or initial conditions of the mechanistic model. However, due to the high number of parameters and variables of the WCM, this was not possible in this study due to the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, the ML surrogate is trained on the final state (just before division) of the first cell simulated for each repetition, and it predicts whether all the cells in the future five generations will divide. The advantage of this approach is that once it is trained, the mechanistic WCM has to be run for one generation, rather than six, and the data from this first generation is used to predict the fitness of all the cells in the future five generations.</p><p id="P43">In this paper we assess the accuracy of the ML surrogate using the F1-score metric, which combines the precision and recall scores of the models.

The final predicted class is the one that was output by the majority of the decision trees. This ensemble-based approach reduces overfitting and aids interpretability since it becomes possible to understand which features contributed to the prediction the most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], by averaging the gini impurity of the trees. Furthermore, compared to more complex deep learning models, random forest can be trained very quickly and it often has comparable accuracy.

It was originally published in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] to predict minimal genomes using the <italic>M. genitalium</italic> WCM, and it is freely available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GriersonMarucciLab/Minesweeper">https://github.com/GriersonMarucciLab/Minesweeper</ext-link>. Minesweeper starts by running all the single gene knock outs. In the original model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], during the second stage, all the predicted non-essential genes are split into 26 segments of sizes 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 33%, 25% and 12.5%. Since the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM includes three times more genes, the 12.5% deletion segments were too big. To address this, we added 30 additional segments of 10% and 5%, respectively. During the third stage of the algorithm, the largest three deletions that produced dividing cells in six generations during stage two, are combined with smaller, dividing, non-overlapping segments. Powersets of unique combinations of these segments are generated and simulated. The largest segment that when deleted produced dividing cells from each of the three groups moves forward to stage four, where it is combined with the remaining non-essential genes that are split into eight groups. The powersets of these segments are simulated and if none of the reduced cells divide, the remaining genes are appended individually to the largest deletion segment. The genes that are individually added and do not produce a dividing cell are not considered for further combinations. This stage is cyclical and it stops when there are fewer than 16 genes (in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] this was eight) to be added or if the deletion of none of the combinations obtained after adding individual genes produced dividing cells. The threshold for stopping stage four was changed from eight to 16 genes to reduce the number of repetitions of this cycle, again due to the larger <italic>E. coli</italic> genome compared to <italic>M. genitalium</italic>. Also, as noted in the conclusion, the algorithm was stopped before this cycle ended. The main reason for this was the high number of simulations that were already run, time constraints and the fact that a significantly reduced genome was already obtained.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p id="P46">Gene Ontology (GO) is a major bioinformatics initiative that aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.

1</label><caption><p>A random forest model is trained to emulate the behaviour of the <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM. To obtain the training data for the ML surrogate, the WCM is run for six generations. Simulating the WCM for six generations is computationally expensive and time consuming (red arrows). Therefore, we use the macromolecular masses at the end of generation one to train a random forest model that predicts whether all the cells in six generations will divide (e.g. Cell 1 and all its replicates) or not (e.g. for Cell 2 the orange replicate in generation 2 did not divide). Once the model is trained, for future use, only one generation of the WCM will have to be run (instead of six), and the ML surrogate can be used to predict whether all the cells in six generations divide. This process is significantly faster (blue arrows).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190499-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Results of the initial ML surrogate trained on single gene knock out (KO) data.</title><p>(A) The confusion matrices for the training of the ML surrogate on single gene knock outs, and testing on single, double and multiple gene knock outs.

The process started by using the ML surrogate trained on a subset of single gene knock out data to predict the essentiality of every single gene knock out (not included in the training set). Only the genes characterised as nonessential go to stage two (grey circles). In stage two, 56 groups representing different percentages of the non-essential genes were deleted individually from the genome, and the corresponding simulations were run for 6 generations using the WCM. Permutations of these groups were used to re-train the ML surrogate on multiple gene knock outs. In stage three, we show examples where we took the two largest deletion segments that when removed produced cells that divided (red and blue), appended all combinations of the division-producing non-overlapping segments from stage two, created a powerset of combinations from these segments and ran the corresponding simulations where they were removed (not all combinations shown). The fourth stage is cyclical and predictions were made using the retrained ML surrogate, randomly testing the dividing genomes using the six generations WCM simulations and retraining once.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190499-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Data from fifty <italic>in silico</italic> repetitions of EMine-737 (first row) and wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> WCM (second row), run for 6 generations, with each cell division producing two daughters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190499-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>A comparison between the molecule counts of ATP, L-histidine and L-glutamine between wildtype cells and EMine-737 cells.
