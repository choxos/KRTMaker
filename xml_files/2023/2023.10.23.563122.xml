Particularly powerful implementations capable of 3D, multi-color and high-throughput imaging have yielded key biological insights although widespread access to such technologies has been limited. The purpose of this protocol is to provide a guide for interested researchers to establish high-end SMLM in their laboratories. We detail the initial configuration and subsequent assembly of the SMLM, including instructions for alignment of all optical pathways, software/hardware integration and operation of the instrument. We describe validation steps including the preparation and imaging of test- and biological samples with structures of well-defined geometry and assist the user in troubleshooting and benchmarking performance. Additionally, we provide a walkthrough of the reconstruction of a super-resolved dataset from acquired raw images using the Super-resolution Microscopy Analysis Platform (SMAP). Depending on the instrument configuration, the cost of components is in the range $80,000 – 160,000, a fraction of the cost of a commercial instrument. A builder with some experience of optical systems is expected to require 3 - 6 months from the start of system construction to attain high-quality 3D and multi-color biological images.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique based on the precise 2D/3D localization of individual fluorophores. Unambiguous localization relies on spatial sparsity of the single molecule emitters. Following many rounds of imaging, each comprising a small fraction of all fluorophores, their positions are determined with a precision in the single nanometer range (under ideal conditions) and used to reconstruct a super-resolution image. The required sparsity of fluorophores may be regulated through photochemical on/off switching of the fluorophores, for example, in the cases of (fluorescence) photoactivation localization microscopy, ((f)PALM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] or (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ((d)STORM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. On-off binding of fluorophores provides an alternative route, for example, in DNA-based point-accumulation in nanoscale topology microscopy (DNA-PAINT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] target structures are tagged with short single-stranded DNA, and fluorescently-labelled complementary strands stochastically bind and detach to elicit a blinking effect.</p><p id="P3">Engineering labs operating highly-optimized custom microscopes have driven the development of SMLM with their creations typically outperforming commercially available variants in terms of image quality, stability and robustness. Furthermore, the custom-build approach provides agency in the design process, freedom from reliance on service technicians to maintain advanced imaging devices, and ability to upgrade hardware freely. The efforts of many to democratize SMLM technology have centered largely on developing particularly low cost systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. While this is a worthwhile pursuit, such systems often omit powerful features, lack the convenience and feature set of turnkey systems, and generally do not reflect the current state-of-the-art. For more advanced implementations, the technical challenge associated with replicating a system with limited documentation and instruction limits the widespread application of the associated advances. Nevertheless, the benefits of the custom-build approach make dissemination of these devices of crucial importance for biological imaging.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Development of the protocol</title><p id="P4">In this protocol, we seek to bridge the gap between entry-level open-source projects and costly, though not necessarily more capable, commercial systems by providing a detailed and complete guide to allow non-specialist labs to establish a single molecule localization microscope with state-of-the art performance and advanced features and apply it to their biological studies. To encourage builders to configure the instrument as they wish, the microscope presented is modular and configurable in design. The scheme outlined includes the necessary resources to construct and use an advanced SMLM system. All necessary validation steps, processes for acquiring benchmark images and their subsequent analysis are similarly included.</p><p id="P5">More than a decade at the forefront of SMLM development has provided a unique view on the desirable features of the associated microscope. While many technical developments from our lab and others have expanded the capabilities of SMLM, there is clearly a judgement to be made regarding cost/complexity vs. performance/usability. In this regard, we assert that the following features are suitable to cover most applications and user needs spanning (d)STORM, DNA-PAINT and PALM workflows and are well-suited to a multi-functional system covering many such applications.</p><p id="P6">The first feature concerns an inverted microscope body. In order to deliver a spatial resolution at least one order of magnitude better than in standard widefield epi-fluorescence microscopy, mechanical disturbances such as drift and vibration have to be minimized. A suitably custom machined body provides a substantial improvement over a commercial inverted microscope stand in this regard. We included long range (several mm) refocusing to accommodate different sample types, hot-swappable optics (e.g., dichroic mirrors), transmission illumination, and the controlled heating of the microscope for live-cell imaging under physiological conditions. These features are typically missing in custom microscopes, but have proven useful across the developmental lifetime of the microscope reported herein. We also include a focus lock system to minimize axial drift. While real-time lateral drift correction schemes have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], we correct it during post-processing.</p><p id="P7">From an illumination perspective, homogeneity is a primary concern but so too is the possibility for high quality TIRF illumination. Although schemes effectively demonstrating both exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], they have not been transferred to open-source systems with multiple laser lines. Achieving suitable irradiance of the sample in often power-hungry applications is of similar concern. Even when sufficient laser power and minimally-lossy schemes are available, statically sized illumination fields do not allow for optimization of the intensity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup> with respect to the background generated nor avoid damage to expensive objective lenses where high power lasers are used to illuminate an unnecessarily large field of view. Particularly in multi-user settings, such field adjustable illumination, which maintains homogeneity and TIRF-compatibility are invaluable.</p><p id="P8">On the emission side, multi-color imaging is, of course, desirable and can be achieved serially. However, many powerful methods such as (d)STORM and smFRET (single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer) require synchronous acquisition of multiple color channels to discriminate as many as 4 spectrally-overlapping far-red fluorophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and elucidate close contacts between FRET-pairs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Given the resolution of modern sCMOS cameras, image splitters forming a pair of images on a single camera provide such capabilities without sacrificing field of view and offer a doubling of imaging speed even for applications where serial acquisition is tolerable. Given the inherently 3D nature of biological samples, the ability to discriminate emitters based on depth information is critical to many SMLM applications and the related PSF-engineering approaches to do so have been among the most impactful extensions of the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. To date, however, open-source SMLM systems have not provided an option for 3D imaging which we view to be one of the key areas of innovation in SMLM. One exception in this regard, utilized a specialist sample preparation whereby the known geometry of a labelled microbead provides a fixed reference to the z-position of an emitter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, more optimized 3D imaging strategies, which offer a greater degree of control of the PSF shape have not been employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Advanced microscopes such as SMLM systems require suitable control systems in the form of software with an intuitive interface and powerful acquisition engine, electronics and hardware synchronization. Moreover, SMLM acquisitions are typically long, requiring tens of thousands of images to reconstruct a single super-resolution view of the sample. As such, and given the need for statistical significance and perturbations in biological studies, automation of SMLM plays a key role in its success. The supplied control systems and associated hardware must therefore be capable of unsupervised imaging, not only moving from point to point in a predetermined manner, but also performing quality checks and where appropriate modulating photoactivation parameters in line with on-the-fly detected emitter density. Naturally, the data and metadata structures should streamline subsequent analysis by being fully integrated with freely-available modern analysis software.</p><p id="P10">The capabilities of various open-source SMLM projects have been well-summarized as they relate to a recent implementation, the NanoPro 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. We do not replicate this discussion but extend the analysis of these systems in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>: Features Comparison of Open-Source SMLM Systems. As can be seen from the feature list, the 3D-SMLM system reported herein delivers all desired features highlighted in Danial et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], including several missing in the NanoPro 1.0 such as fully-integrated 3D capability. In addition, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> expands this wish list to consider many additional features. Ultimately, our 3D-SMLM has been designed to optimize performance and functionality while maintaining sensitivity to pricing such that the instrument represents a substantial saving compared to similar commercial systems. Labs wishing for an entry-level SMLM system without many features described are advised to seek out many of the excellent open-source SMLM projects, some of which are optimized for low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and ease of construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P11">The instrument detailed herein, represents the 6<sup>th</sup> generation refinement of our SMLM developments across more than a decade of development and features improvements to the optical, mechanical, electronic and computational designs reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. These microscopes were instrumental for key biological discoveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Microscopes constructed from this scheme are currently in use in research and service settings at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), while implementation of previous generations has been carried out in several labs worldwide. We note that the most recent generation of the microscope has been developed at the EMBL Imaging Centre, as part of efforts to develop custom imaging technologies in partnership with EMBL developer labs. The particular challenges inherent in deployment of such technologies in a multi-user environment for advanced service provision require a greater flexibility of approach than would be the case for a single research lab with a narrower research focus. The aspects developed to serve the range of needs encountered are fully represented in the instrument described herein accordingly.</p><p id="P12">Successful implementation of the protocol is contingent on some familiarity with the construction of optical systems and a working understanding of SMLM. We expect a full-time builder would require 6 months to successfully implement the protocol described, culminating in the reconstruction of exemplary super-resolution images, while an expert builder may require as little as 3 months. A full list of materials including parts list (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.

CAD models are included in SolidWorks (Dassault Systèmes) assembly and part file format for those wishing to modify the design. For those wishing to follow the protocol as written, the CAD assemblies are also provided in eDrawing format, which can be viewed using a freely available eDrawing viewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/download-edrawings">https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/download-edrawings</ext-link>).

Toleranced drawings for the custom mechanical parts are provided as SolidWorks drawings and as .pdf for manufacture by a workshop with precision computer numerical control (CNC) milling capabilities. We advise that labs wishing to replicate the system first familiarize themselves with the assemblies and contact the EMBL mechanical and electronic workshops (<email>mw@embl.de/ew@embl.de</email>) to discuss appropriate sourcing of parts and to seek direct correspondence with the authors before embarking on the protocol to clarify uncertainties and check for forthcoming updates.</p><p id="P13">We note that the parts provided at the time of publication are by no means final as the system undergoes continuous improvements and the online resources noted will be maintained accordingly. Furthermore, we encourage builders to engage in this effort by modifying or otherwise suggesting modifications of part files to further improve their functionality or suggest desirable features that could be developed.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Overview of the automated 3D multi-color single molecule localization microscope</title><p id="P14">A CAD rendering of the microscope is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In essence, the SMLM comprises an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope constructed around a robust, yet flexible, custom microscope body. The body incorporates xy stages, a z-focusing piezo and long-range travel platform for the objective lens/piezo as well as switchable kinematic mounts for dichroics, housing for a tube lens and optional filters and, if specified, the capacity to operate at elevated temperatures suitable to mammalian systems. Samples mounted on coverslips are subject to widefield laser illumination via an objective lens, which collects fluorescence and separates the emitted light from the excitation source on a dichroic mirror. The emission path further comprises a tube lens and additional optics for spectral discrimination and image relaying to produce two synchronously captured color channels on a scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. For example, ratiometric imaging with two spectrally distinct channels may be employed to separate multiple spectrally overlapping far-red dyes suitable to dSTORM imaging. For 3D imaging, a distortion-free and tunable astigmatism module allows fine control over the extension of the PSF in two orthogonal axes either side of the native focus. As such, one may attain localization precisions as high as 2 nm in xy and 8 nm in z under idealized conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] using a calibrated spline model of the PSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Excitation can be provided by single-mode or multi-mode laser sources, or a combination of the two, depending on specific requirements to yield a uniform illumination field using various homogenization schemes. The laser excitation can be centered/offset at the back focal plane of the imaging objective lens via a motorized mirror to provide epi-/HILO/TIRF illumination. A focus lock system is included, comprising a near infrared (NIR) laser at 808 nm under total internal reflection from the coverslip and subsequent height sensitive detection using a position-sensitive detector with feedback to the piezo-coupled objective lens. Sample throughput presents a challenge to SMLM since large numbers of camera frames are required to reconstruct a single image and constant user input may be required during the experiments. Thus, the microscope provides automated acquisition capabilities comprising multiple field of views (FOVs) and featuring real-time feedback to activation lasers to regulate the number of emitters during a single exposure for unsupervised acquisition of data.</p><p id="P15">The microscope comprises four optomechanical subsystems: the body, and the excitation, emission and focus lock paths, described below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The beam paths are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. There is some flexibility in the system to tune the configuration to the end-user’s needs, budget and proficiencies in optical system construction. The optomechanical configuration must be determined before sourcing commercial and custom parts. For selection of costly hardware elements such as stages, cameras and lasers, please refer to the respective section under Materials. The CAD assembly files provided are configurable allowing the builder to construct the appropriate system <italic>in silico</italic> before proceeding. The parts list is similarly structured to allow easy identification of components required for different configurations. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref> is provided to estimate the final cost for the system.</p><sec id="S4"><title>The body</title><p id="P16">The body comprises an inverted microscope frame constructed from aluminum, stainless steel, brass and plastic (detailed in the technical drawings). It has been designed with several criteria in mind. First, it should provide an extremely stable platform suited to SMLM (see Protocol: Performing drift and vibration checks). Second, the body should retain much of the flexibility of a commercial inverted microscope stand and be able to accommodate multiple sample preparations/formats. Thirdly, the body should be easily assembled from appropriately toleranced custom parts using dowel pins to constrain the placement of elements.</p><p id="P17">Considering the specifics of the body, a highly rigid square base and frame provides up to four optical ports for the emission, excitation and focus lock optics. A removable cover of the body mounts a white LED ring suited to brightfield imaging. Below lies an xy microscope stage. In the base configuration, a Smaract SOM-12090 is specified but mounting points are included for legacy Smaract stages, which are in use on all previous generations of the microscope. With some adaptation of part files and assuming existence of a device adapter for μManager, other stages can also be used. Below the stages sits an objective lens long-range travel stage held in place under spring tension. The stage can be mechanically-driven over several mm in z by a system of belt-coupled fine-pitch actuators. A piezo flexure stage (Physik Instrumente PIFOC P-726.1CD) sits atop the stage and mounts the objective. Below the objective stage is an optional recess for a heating foil and temperature probe. The lower half of the body is thermally isolated from the top to obviate thermal drift. An optical mounting pillar is situated at the core of the body in the lower section and provides a single interface to the dichroic and broadband mirrors routing laser/emitted light into or out of the optical ports on the side of the body. The pillar and associated optical mounts are available in right- and left-handed versions to allow the microscope to be constructed in the desired orientation on the optical table by switching the excitation optical port between two opposing sides of the body. A primary dichroic mirror (DM1, TIRF quality) is situated at the top of the pillar below the isolating layer, which couples in the excitation light while passing the longer wave emission and focus locking laser. Below this sits a secondary dichroic mirror (DM2, super-resolution imaging quality), which reflects the emitted light towards the tube lens (via an optional piezo resonant slider, COTS-ELL9, in which additional filters may be placed as desired) and again passes the longwave focus lock laser. A subsequent broadband (NIR coated) prism mirror below DM2 reflects the focus lock laser on its way in and out of the body. See Supplementary Note 2: Selecting spectrally discriminative optics for a list of filters currently used on our most recent generations of the microscope.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Illumination path</title><p id="P18">The illumination path may be configured by the builder to include suitably homogenized single-mode and/or multi-mode laser sources. These sources can be combined and together comprise the illumination path. The rationale for offering a range of options in this regard relates to the properties of single- and multi-mode lasers as well as the desire to be able to configure highly capable systems to suit a range of budgetary constraints. Single-mode lasers require homogenization to achieve a uniform illumination field. Often this is simply achieved using a field aperture to apodize the Gaussian profile and pass only the approximately uniform core of the beam. While this is a workable solution, it results in substantial loss of power from the Gaussian input. For example, achieving a uniformity of ± 10%, results in a loss of ca. 90% of the beam power. Conversely, the coupling of light into a multi-mode fiber, combined with appropriate mode scrambling, produces a highly homogeneous illumination spot with only fiber insertion and transmission losses to consider. Nevertheless, single-mode laser systems allow for high-fidelity TIRF illumination since they can be focused to a very small spot on the back focal plane of the imaging objective lens, while multi-mode schemes are generally incompatible with high-quality TIRF illumination. The scheme outlined permits the combination of up to two TIRF compatible single-mode sources and one multi-mode source. The single-mode sources are homogenized by reshaping rather than apodizing the Gaussian beam with only negligible loss of power. The following description considers multiple laser sources:</p><sec id="S6"><title>Single-mode laser engine</title><p id="P19">the fiber-coupled output of the single-mode laser engine is expanded, and passed by an optional polarizing beam splitter that is included for booster laser integration (see below). The Gaussian beam is subsequently homogenized by a refractive beam shaper. An iris, placed at the exit aperture of the beam shaper, is conjugated to the object via two 4f systems. The first comprises one of four exchangeable telescopic systems (4f Keplerian arrangement), which allow the homogenized illumination field area to be varied by a factor of ~32.5× (0.5 to 2.85× magnification to achieve ⍰13.5 - 77 μm homogenized illumination fields). A piezo resonant stage actuated mirror situated intermediate within the second 4f system (tube lens/objective lens) allows tuning of the illumination angle for epi-/HILO/TIRF illumination. The lasers are coupled into the objective lens via the primary dichroic mirror (DM1) to reconstitute a variable-sized homogenized illumination field. A laser clean-up filter installed in the shared path with the optional booster laser removes any contribution from wavelengths outside a narrow window defined by the laser line that otherwise would contribute to background.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Single-mode booster laser</title><p id="P20">The optional free-space booster laser, typically at 640 nm, is spatially filtered and expanded before being steered to and combined with the common optical path at the polarizing beam splitter.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Multi-mode laser engine</title><p id="P21">Additionally/alternatively, multimode excitation can be coupled into the microscope from a custom low-cost laser engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The multimode path consists of a compound achromatic lens that projects a magnified image of the square multimode fiber tip onto an adjustable slit. This image is subsequently contracted and re-imaged onto the object via a tube lens and the objective lens. The tube lens is of a retrofocus type using only commercial parts. The retrofocus design allows the lens focal length to remain relatively short (f = 125 mm), with a much longer working distance on the infinite conjugate side (350 mm) such that it can be placed outside the body while maintaining strong coupling of the multi-mode laser into the objective lens. When using the multi-mode illumination, the piezo resonant stage actuated mirror used to position the single-mode beam(s) at the back focal plane for epi-/HILO/TIRF illumination is moved fully out of the beam path, thus passing the multi-mode lasers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Emission path</title><p id="P22">The emission path configuration is largely fixed, although the selection of dichroic mirrors and filters is at the discretion of the user to suit the application in question (See Supplementary Note 2: Selecting spectrally discriminative optics). The optical scheme has been developed to work with 45 mm parfocal length (mounting flange to object side focus) objective lenses, specifically those that do not rely on a paired tube lens to correct residual chromatic aberrations (Olympus and Nikon are major manufacturers conforming to this design principle, whereas Leica and Zeiss opt to use the tube lens for chromatic correction). Moreover, to achieve a suitable pixel size (when demagnified into the object space), we specify the use of one of three objective lenses (all Olympus, RMS-threaded): 100x/1.5 oil (UPLAPO100XOHR), 100x/1.35 silicone oil, (UPLSAPO100XS) 100x/1.45 oil (UPLXAPO100XO). Note, that the latter is untested but provides a comparatively inexpensive option with regard to the 100x/1.5 oil lens and is expected to provide good performance. With limited modification of the part files, it is possible to use objective lenses from other manufacturers (See Supplementary Note 2: Using non-specified objective lenses). Emitted fluorescence is collected by the objective lens, passes the primary dichroic mirror (DM1) and is reflected by the secondary dichroic mirror (DM2). An optional motorized filter slider can be incorporated into the infinity space before a tube lens produces a primary image. This image is limited in spatial extent by an adjustable slit to ensure that the multiple color channels do not spatially overlap on the camera. A first relay lens restores the image to an infinite conjugate and produces an accessible conjugate to the objective back focal plane (BFP) where a variable astigmatism module comprising a pair of rotationally offset cylindrical lenses can be situated for 3D imaging. Placement of the astigmatism module at the BFP, affords minimized distortion and provides extensibility by maintaining compatibility with advanced PSF-engineering approaches using deformable mirrors (e.g., for aberration correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]) or phase masks (e.g., for double-helix PSFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]). A subsequent tertiary dichroic mirror (DM3) in the reconstituted infinity space, splits the emitted light between short and longwave channels, each of which includes a motorized filter wheel. Note, that these channels will often be referred to as reflected or transmitted based on their reflection/transmission at DM3. This should not be confused with reflective or transmissive imaging that generate contrast based on scattering and absorption of light by the sample. A second relay lens produces secondary images in the two pathways, which are recombined by a knife-edge mirror to coincide with the camera chip. Note, it is possible to perform 3D imaging via the biplane method whereby two images with a small defocus offset are used to attribute axial position to an emitter. Biplane imaging is beyond the scope of this article but it is worthy of note that with small modifications it is can be realized with the 3D-SMLM. In this case, one would omit the astigmatic lens and associated components, typically exchange DM3 for a 50:50 beam splitter (although biplane/ratiometric imaging has been reported using a dichroic mirror with the two channels encoding both depth and emitter information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]) and appropriately defocus one of the second relay lenses.</p><p id="P23">A Bertrand lens may be introduced in front of the camera via a motorized stage, thus producing an image of the back focal plane on the camera, which aids in observing unwanted bubbles in immersion oils and alignment of the lasers more generally. The emission path has been designed using ray-tracing software (Zemax, OpticStudio) to achieve diffraction limited performance over a large field of view and for control of the 3D point spread function (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1 - 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Focus lock path</title><p id="P24">The focus lock path comprises a NIR laser, typically 785 or 808 nm, which is steered to pass through the secondary and primary dichroic mirrors (DM2, DM1) with its focus laterally offset at the back focal plane to incline the collimated beam at the coverslip/sample boundary. In the case of oil objectives where the refractive index contrast between the immersion media (n = 1.51) and sample (n = 1.33 - 1.4) is substantial, the inclination is set to fulfil the condition of total internal reflection resulting in a strong focus lock signal. In the case of silicone objective lenses for which the refractive index contrast between the immersion media (n = 1.406) and sample is smaller, the inclination is set to maximize Fresnel reflections, which increase with incident angle. Such reflections are weaker but still easy to detect. In either case, the reflected light passes out of the objective on the opposing side of the back focal plane and is then spatially separated from the incoming beam to arrive at a position sensitive detector. The detector captures any change in height between the objective and coverslip as a positional offset and provides a corrective signal to the piezo flexure stage driving the objective lens.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Control and synchronization</title><p id="P25">Control of the microscope including previewing and acquisition functions is carried out using the open-source μManager software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and a custom htSMLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] (high-throughput single molecule localization microscopy) graphical user interface (GUI). μManager allows common hardware functions to be mapped to specific core functionalities providing great flexibility to specific hardware choices. As long as the hardware chosen permits the required functionality, and a device adapter for the hardware is available, the user may deviate from the specific hardware choices outlined in the protocol (see Supplementary Notes 3 - 6, Using non-specified objective lenses/single-mode lasers and laser-engines/XY stages/cameras). Pre-compiled versions of the htSMLM GUI and device adapters, which are not available in the core μManager build, are provided as part of the protocol. A guide to configuration of μManager and the htSMLM GUI is provided in the protocol. The microscope makes use of the open-source microFPGA project for synchronization of hardware components and for monitoring of signals related to the microscope focus lock system. Here, we provide microscope-specific configuration files for the FPGA, board files for reproduction and a detailed build up yielding the required functionality. A more generally applicable description of the highly-configurable microFPGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] has been provided elsewhere and may prove useful for particularly adventurous builders who want to further expand the microscope functionality or use microFPGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] for other projects.

In general, applications requiring spatial resolution beyond that which can typically be achieved by stimulated emission depletion (STED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], structured illumination (SIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] or image-scanning microscopy (ISM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] may be ideally suited to the use of 3D-SMLM.</p><p id="P27">The microscope presented herein has been used extensively across multiple generations of development for 3D super-resolution imaging of biological samples with an associated localization precision, σ typically down to 2/8 nm laterally/axially under ideal conditions (the associated resolution is typically 2.3σ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]). Using oil or silicone oil objectives as well as TIRF/HILO/epiillumination one may image structures close to the coverslip boundary or as far as 50 μm beyond. The microscope acquisition workflow is flexible enough to allow for multiple SMLM imaging modalities including (f)PALM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], (d)STORM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and DNA-PAINT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. For example, in our group we used the automated high-throughput mode to determine the distribution of the majority of proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and the high 3D resolution allowed us to investigate the precise dynamics of membrane curvature generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, we extended 3D imaging to cells and investigated the structure and stoichiometry of nuclear pore complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and the kinetochore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P28">The microscope has the flexibility to provide a field of view as large as 77 μm in diameter, or to optimize for increased laser intensities over a smaller field of view for increased speed, blinking contrast, and lower auto-fluorescence background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Combined with the automated imaging capabilities, the instrument is thus equipped for high-throughput applications, akin to previous studies which resolved the structural organization of large numbers of endocytic proteins through such workflows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Comparisons with other methods and limitations</title><p id="P29">Regarding the specific 3D-SMLM implementation presented here, one must consider the associated limitations relative to other SMLM setups. As discussed previously, the microscope is functionally more capable than previous open-source SMLMs as defined by our experiences with SMLM. Others may have other preferences, for example, the maximum illumination field is a relatively modest 77 μm in line with comparable commercial systems (e.g., Nikon N-STORM, ONI NanoImager, Bruker Vutara, Zeiss Elyra), whereas several reports have described SMLMs, with larger fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. We have constrained the system as such for several reasons. First, the illumination field stated approximately corresponds to the maximum practical field of view offered by high-NA oil and silicone oil lenses for which field aberrations are low. Since a spatially invariant point spread function (PSF) is critical for precise fitting of single molecules, this is a crucial factor in the use of SMLM for structural biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Secondly, a larger illumination field requires more laser power, which increases the background caused by autofluorescence in the objective and optics, and which can lead to damage of the expensive objective lenses, especially in TIRF illumination where the laser is focused onto a tiny spot at the periphery of the back focal plane and misalignments may result in damage to the objective back aperture. Thirdly, a smaller illumination field allows one to image two channels onto a single camera while maintaining spatial sampling requirements. For users wishing to optimize throughput, we again note that the most effective strategy is automation. In pursuit of performance, we have selected high-quality components that make the 3D-SMLM a relatively expensive build at the upper end of the budget ($160k). Furthermore, we have optimized the system for stability and ease of construction/use using a large number of custom parts, which have to be sourced, rather than relying on more generic commercial options. There are certain sub-systems, for example, the dual-channel image splitter, that can be assembled largely from commercial components if preferred, although the assembly and alignment process is less-straightforward. With regard to similar commercial systems, (e.g., Nikon N-STORM, ONI NanoImager, Bruker Vutara, Zeiss Elyra) control of the microscope may seem cumbersome and will require a greater degree of expertise to achieve the highest performance. However, this is a general point shared by most custom microscopes and the fine control of the device afforded by the control scheme presented will ultimately deliver superior results when employed correctly.</p><p id="P30">In addition to the benefits of the technique discussed, 3D-SMLM features unique limitations. Notably, the low temporal resolution arising from the need to acquire tens to hundreds of thousands of frames to restore single super-resolved images renders live-cell time-lapse imaging challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], which may be better suited for e.g., SIM/ISM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, in the implementation presented, automation of the microscope ensures that long acquisitions may proceed unsupervised to provide high-throughputs. An additional bottleneck to throughput can be the image reconstruction. However, with proper management and appropriate IT infrastructure the data volume/processing is manageable. We recommend on the fly analysis during data acquisition to help to identify problems before a more complete reconstruction is carried out in post-processing.</p><p id="P31">Although the resolution achievable with 3D-SMLM is far superior to diffraction-limited techniques as well as STED/SIM/ISM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], more specialized fluorescence microscopies such as interferometric SMLM analogues employing dual opposed imaging pathways (e.g., 4pi-SMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] or coordinatetargeted approaches such as MINFLUX/MINSTED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] typically achieve superior resolution in one or all dimensions. However, a recent study based on Exchange-PAINT and 3D-SMLM achieved Ångström level resolution in fluorescence microscopy for the first time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Setting aside this impressive demonstration, 3D-SMLM offers a simpler, less expensive and more robust route to obtaining super-resolution images than offered by MINFLUX/MINSTED/4pi-SMS.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Overview of the Protocol</title><p id="P32">Full setup and validation of the microscope performance is an involved procedure encompassing multiple disciplines. The protocol is broken down into a number of discrete tasks, which should be carried out in the order specified and care must be taken to properly benchmark performance as indicated before moving on.</p><p id="P33">Prior to the protocol we include an Experimental Design section detailing first steps such as hardware selection and provision of an appropriate environment in which the system may be constructed as well as an Equipment Set Up section, which describes best practices for optical alignment amongst other useful guidelines.</p><p id="P34">The protocol, which details the construction of the system and its subsequent validation, is subdivided as follows.</p><p id="P35">First, the microscope body, comprising more than half of the custom parts of the microscope is built up (steps 1 - 67). Before any optical alignment can be performed, it is advisable that the various hardware elements can be controlled and configured from a single interface. To this end, the microFPGA, which allows for monitoring and analog/digital control of hardware, is constructed (unless specifically sourced in an assembled state, see Electronics rationale and sourcing) (steps 68 - 103) and configured (steps 104 - 107). Next, all software for acquisition is set up and configured, including μManager and the EMU htSMLM plugin, which together provide the user interfaces for the microscope (steps 108 - 130). Having installed μManager, it is possible to fully test the microFPGA functionality (for self-assembled microFPGAs only) (steps 131 - 137). Electrical connections between many of the hardware elements and the microFPGA are then made (steps 138 - 142). Subsequently, a camera and transmission target are set up to provide an infinite conjugate reference, the use of which allows us to correctly focus the emission optics (steps 143 - 152). The microscope alignment then commences with routing of an alignment laser through the emission path (steps 153 - 174) and aligning the various lenses to produce a pair of secondary images on the camera corresponding to the two pathways of an image splitter (steps 175 - <bold>Error! Reference source not found</bold>.). Following from the emission path, the illumination path is then set up for simple epi-fluorescence imaging with a spatially inhomogeneous Gaussian illumination field (steps 230 - 258). The microscope is then focused and initial checks of PSF quality are performed (steps 260 - 272). The illumination optics are subsequently augmented by a field variable, beam homogenization unit (steps 273 - 313) as well as optional steps of setting up of a booster laser (steps 314 - 335), configuring for TIRF/HILO illumination (steps 336 - 344), installation of a multi-mode laser engine (steps 345 - 373), and calibration of the photodiode used to monitor the laser power (steps 374 - 379). Subsequently, a series of checks and calibrations relating to the 2D imaging performance are carried out to prevent crosstalk between the image splitter channels, determine the object space pixel size and assess the field-dependence of the PSF under homogeneous illumination (steps 380 - 392).</p><p id="P36">Having achieved a final illumination configuration, the emission path is extended for 3D functionality via the installation and adjustment of a variable astigmatic lens (steps 393 - 414). The following tasks relate to the focus lock system, including the alignment of the focus lock laser into and out of the body via (total internal) reflection at the coverslip the body (steps 415 - 433), setup of the focus lock electronics (steps 434 - 445), focus locking the microscope (steps 446 - 449) and establishing the stable operating regime of the focus lock laser (steps 450 - 458). The microscope is fully functional at this stage and further steps require the installation of the SMLM data analysis software SMAP (steps 460 - 465) for analysis of the data. As a first step towards 3D imaging a PSF calibration is performed using a fluorescent bead sample and the 3D imaging performance of the system is adjusted (steps 466 - 473). Having completed the PSF calibration, the next steps detail the use of SMAP for 2D and 3D calibration based on a Gaussian or experimentally-derived model of the PSF respectively (steps 474 - 487). The following section considers the rendering of the localized data including the merging, filtering and drift-correction of the individual localizations (steps 488 - 494). At this juncture the necessary tools and knowledge have been established to make additional quality checks including checks of the focus lock systems’ ability to correct axial drift, as well as assessment of lateral drift and vibrations (steps 495 - 517). Subsequent performance benchmarking of the microscope for biological imaging includes 2D (steps 518 - 550) and 3D single-color and 3D multi-color imaging (steps 551 - 562) of nuclear pore complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Experimental Design</title><sec id="S16"><title>Personnel</title><p id="P37">For successful completion of the protocol including planning, procurement of commercial and custom parts, construction/alignment and validation, one full-time scientist or engineer is required. Preferably this person would have some familiarity with optical systems although such experience is not strictly required. Alternatively, it may be desirable to split certain tasks over more specialized or suitable individuals. For example, samples may be prepared by life-science technicians. From the point where all required hardware is available, we assert that the protocol may be completed in 3 - 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Laboratory environment</title><p id="P38">For best results and ease of implementation, the selection of a microscopy-dedicated laboratory environment is preferable. We note, however, that much of the development of this microscope has taken place in general laboratory space with excellent results. This distinguishes the 3D-SMLM system reported from other super-resolution microscopes, which may suffer more from thermal drift or vibrations such as 4pi SMLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] analogues, which require perfect co-alignment of two opposed imaging paths and STED, which requires perfect co-alignment of a toroidal depletion beam with the excitation beam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, the ideal environment is temperature controlled (to within ± 1 °C) to obviate thermal drift, which under hysteresis results in the slow misalignment of optical components. Since the microscope may exhibit substantial thermal inertia, the desired operating temperature should be maintained over evenings, weekends and other periods of closure. Moreover, the laboratory itself should not have too strong vibrations (better than 10 μm/s RMS velocity, vibration criteria category: VC-C/VC-D). Ideally the lab would be located on the ground or basement level of buildings and to avoid coupling of vibrations through plastic-lined laboratory floors, the optical table would be supported directly on the concrete floor below with cut-outs in the plastic lining (if present) made accordingly. For more remote locations, higher building levels may also be acceptable. Similarly, sources of vibration native to the building itself should be avoided and the laboratory should be situated away from compressors or circulation systems (for example, those relating to cooling/cryogenics or ventilation) as well as lifts/elevators and centrifuges. Nevertheless, even in relatively poorly suited surroundings, the optical table does efficiently isolate the microscope. Sources of dust should be avoided as much as possible. For example, air conditioning systems should provide filtered air and, if possible, a slightly higher pressure than surrounding rooms to prevent ingress of dust. Dust generation in the laboratory can be further minimized by regular cleaning and using replaceable adhesive floor mats at the entrances to remove soiling from footwear. Ultimately some dust is unavoidable but its impact can be minimized by enclosing the optical table and microscope itself.</p><p id="P39">The lab space itself should be large enough to accommodate a 1.5 × 0.9 m optical table, fitted with an appropriate enclosure for laser safety and stability, as well as a desk for the instrument control PC while maintaining access to three or more sides of the optical table, ideally including the two long sides. We note a suitable optical table in the parts list. To achieve optimal results similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, one should aim to enclose the optical table itself and provide additional sub-divided enclosures on the table itself around the various optical modules to obviate drift and prevent specular/diffuse reflections of the lasers escaping the optical table or being captured by the camera. The design of each enclosure will depend on the optical table, placement of electronics and other factors that cannot be predicted <italic>a priori</italic> and so is not included in the protocol.</p><p id="P40">For builders wishing to use a pre-existing optical table, it should be at least 1.5 × 0.9 m with a 25 mm pitch, M6 tapped hole pattern and not so much larger that access for alignment of the optical pathways is impaired. Imperial configured tables with a 1” pitch, ¼”-20 tapped hole pattern cannot be used without redesign of many components.</p><p id="P41">We note that in tight spaces with only weak air conditioning systems, the additional thermal burden of lasers, controllers, and PCs may result in a greater fluctuation of temperature during operation. In any case, we would recommend powering the instrument several hours before its intended usage to allow rooms to equilibrate as best as possible. The optical table specified in the parts list uses an integrated design whereby the four legs are attached as a single frame. Alternatively, one may use individual floated legs and an appropriate table top at least 100 mm thick if such a setup is available. Two optimal layouts of the microscope in typical/small rooms or space of 2.25 × 3.45 and 2.35 × 2.90 m are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Ideally the desk for the PC(s) should be positioned such that one can pivot on a lab chair from the desk to the body of the microscope where the sample is placed.</p><p id="P42">Ideally, all sources of heat and vibration should be located off the optical table. In practice this may not always be possible but one should seek to locate all electronics off the optical table. Necessary exceptions are free-space booster lasers and the camera. The specified sCMOS camera is fan-cooled as standard. However, operation of the fan can result in noticeable vibrations in images. As such, the fan-cooling should be switched off and water cooling should be provided. The cooling unit should not be located on the optical table. Instructions for doing so are included in the protocol. This process may differ for other cameras. Regarding the lasers, fiber-coupled options can be readily accommodated off the optical table and builders should seek this approach where possible. The small fiber-coupled focus lock laser can be located on the optical table if desired and a part file is provided to mount it as such (FAB-EMBL-000088). The multi-mode laser engine, particularly the agitation unit used for mode-scrambling in the fiber, should not be located on the optical table.</p><p id="P43">All local guidelines regarding laser safety should be followed. Note, during system alignment where the path of the beam may be ill-defined additional care is warranted. Laser-safety glasses should be used and minimal laser power/appropriate beam-blocking as needed. A particular hazard is presented by collimated lasers emerging from high NA objective lenses. A high NA objective can launch a laser over a solid angle approaching 2π, with only minor steering of the beam on the infinity-side resulting in large swings in angle. Although the beam waist will be small and thus will expand noticeably away from the objective lens due to diffraction, the laser(s) can still cause permanent damage to eyes. Take particular care whenever aligning the laser to the objective lens or when installing the objective lens to project a realigned beam. Block the beam passage as a first step when unsure of the beam pointing out of the objective and follow the beam as it propagates. The instructions provided are designed to ensure that highly inclined beams are not launched directly off the near side of the optical table but nevertheless, the responsibility for laser safety ultimately resides with the builder. We have operated the microscope with a security relay to close the laser interlocks only when the microscope cover is in place. The system features an override mechanism to allow uninterrupted use only while aligning the system. Those wishing to implement a similar approach are encouraged to contact the EMBL electronic workshop for further information.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Mechanical parts rationale and sourcing</title><p id="P44">The microscope detailed requires many tens of custom mechanical parts. Where possible we have used commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) components given that requirements for i) stability, ii)ease of assembly and iii) complexity are met. For example, while it is possible to construct an inverted body fully from COTS parts, stability and functionality may be lacking and the assembly may be needlessly complex. We provide toleranced drawings for the custom parts for fabrication at a suitable facility. Note, where tolerances are not specifically defined by the ISO standard, we assume a relatively coarse tolerance of ± 0.05 mm (or ± 2 thousands of an inch for workshops more familiar with such conventions) on mechanical dimensions. Facilities with well-operated, maintained and calibrated computer-numerically controlled (CNC) mills are generally required for timely production of many of the parts and should be capable of holding tolerances at or approaching 5× better than this coarse measure. Particularly for dowel-pinned components, holding such tight tolerances is required to minimize the effects of tolerance stacking. We use dowel pins throughout for alignment as well as pocketed features to define the position of several components. The need to remove parts and install temporary alignment fixtures means that holes for dowel pins should be machined for a slip/transition fit. We also note that tightly toleranced dowel pins of the recommended specification should be used throughout. When a press/interference fit is required, this is indicated from the toleranced drawing. In such cases, for example for the idler or bearings for the belt-drive objective lens translation mechanism, ideally the associated commercial part should be provided for the workshop to judge tolerances. We urge caution in installing these parts as incorrect placement may be difficult to correct once dowel pins or bearings have been pressed in place. Many workshops will work with an external facility to anodize machined components, which is strongly recommended owing to laser safety and general back reflection concerns. Moreover, dowel-pin holes have been specified assuming subsequent anodizing to avoid under-sized holes. Nevertheless, a supply of minimally under-sized dowel-pins is a wise precaution. Many parts require tapping to produce an internal thread for the mount of optical components (e.g., RMS thread for the objective lens), the thread specification for these threads should be available from the manufacturer, the threads are called-out in the corresponding feature in the CAD file and bore sizes are sized at 83.3% thread.</p><p id="P45">Since it is undesirable to leave expensive optical components with mechanical workshops, commonly available optical component thread adapters provide a budget-friendly option to allow the facility to test fits. Additionally, very fine-pitch threads (&lt; 0.25 mm), required in one case, may prove difficult for some workshops to machine successfully. For this reason, we provide an alternative option based on a commercial fine pitch actuator and an additional, more-easily fabricated component with a machined hex-key interface. In addition to the machined components, two of the part files are supplied for 3D printing (in .sldprt and .stl format). These parts are included for completeness to mount certain boards and do not warrant high-precision CNC machining. One of these parts (FAB-EMBL-000095) includes bores for heat-installed threaded inserts, which can be installed using a soldering iron on a low setting.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Electronics rationale and sourcing</title><p id="P46">The microscope makes use of the microFPGA control platform to trigger lasers and the camera, modulate laser diodes associated with a low-cost laser engine, and monitor signals from power and position monitoring photodiodes. The generic/multi-purpose microFPGA design, functionality and assembly has been described by Deschamps et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Here and in the protocol, we refer to a specific implementation of the microFPGA that is suited to the needs of the microscope while providing some additional functionality. For example, additional transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals can be provided to drive e.g., flipper mirrors and servo motors. This added functionality is included in the base configuration described, as, in our collective experience, it is typical that builders will want to control additional hardware later and the various signal conversion boards included as standard, already provide the auxiliary functionality.</p><p id="P47">At the core of the microFPGA is a low-cost hobby-grade FPGA (Alchitry Au+). In addition, various commercially available and custom boards are connected to the FPGA. These additional boards act to protect the FPGA, ensure proper connection with labelled SMB connectors, scale I/O voltages appropriately, and low-pass filter PWM signals to produce analog outputs. The data required for reproduction of all custom boards is included (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ries-lab/3DSMLM">https://github.com/ries-lab/3DSMLM</ext-link>), with original board files (in Altium), the Gerber files, bill of materials, schematics, and board files as .pdf. A list of all boards and parts required for the microFPGA is given in the parts list. Depending on the builder’s expertise in electronics we suggest the following options. Firstly, a pre-assembled microFPGA can be sourced directly. Those wishing to make use of this option should contact the technology transfer department of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL/EMBLEM). For those with access to a capable electronics workshop it may be preferable to purchase all commercial and custom boards and self-assemble and test the microFPGA. There are few specific requirements on PCB manufacturers used and the builder is advised to select on the basis of professional recommendation, price and general rapport. A full guide to assemble the microFPGA from the complete electronics boards is included in the protocol. We note that there is no need for the builder to interact with or compile the microFPGA code, which is simply flashed to the device via the manufacturer supplied software.</p><p id="P48">In addition to the microFPGA the microscope employs a custom white-light ring LED with associated controller as well as an amplifier for the QPD used in the focus lock system. The former is not strictly required and can be omitted (if transmission imaging functionality is not required) or replaced by a suitable triggerable/directly modulatable (not pulse-width modulated) ring LED source. Doing so will require some modification of the CAD files to mount the device. Again, full data required for reproduction of the custom boards including the board-mounted LED ring is included (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ries-lab/3DSMLM">https://github.com/ries-lab/3DSMLM</ext-link>). Conversely, the focus lock electronics are required and comprise a commercially available amplifier board (see parts list), which simply requires appropriate packaging including provision of appropriate power and making connections to various input/outputs, which can be handled by the builder or electronics workshop as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>General components sourcing</title><p id="P49">Under typical procurement conditions, 4 months is sufficient to acquire the necessary materials. Where certain components are not immediately available or facing undue delays, it is possible to reorganize some of the protocol or otherwise to begin sections before completing earlier ones. Achieving the highest level of performance is contingent on the correct function of various components, none more so than the objective lens. We note that all new/pristine standard oil objectives listed that we have received to us delivered the expected performance. Testing lenses from demo stocks may be less informative than one would expect as the use and misuse of these examples often renders their performance sub-par. Compared with the standard oil lenses, the analogous silicone oil objective lens, however, exhibit far stronger field-dependent aberrations (primarily coma), which make precise fitting of experimentally-determined average PSFs difficult. The builder is urged in this case to directly purchase the objective lens tested if the performance is determined to be sufficient over the required field of view and limit the field of view of the microscope accordingly. For example, it is not recommended to use illumination fields larger than ca. 30 μm with the silicone objective lens (limiting the recommended telescopic magnification to 1×, see iii Emission path). Moreover, for this reason, it is recommended to purchase an oil objective alongside the silicone objective to make setting up the microscope easier.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Computational infrastructure</title><p id="P50">Handling the data stream from the sCMOS camera is the primary consideration for the computer. The typical maximum data rate of the instrument is &gt; 200 MB/s (See Supplementary Note 7: Camera data rate) and more commonly it is substantially less than this. Additionally, one must consider storage capacity. For the largest imaging field and a particularly long acquisition of 500,000 camera frames, a single field of view may occupy up to 1 TB. For a standard field of view, and a more modest acquisition of 200,000 frames, ca. 100 GB is required. In either case, one may quickly exceed the limits of local storage and should consider networked solutions. To achieve the required data rate and storage volume, we stream the data directly to networked storage preferably via a 10 Gbps (1.25 GB/s) fiber connection. Other local solutions include single solid-state drives (SSDs). To extend the capacity of a number of inexpensive SSDs one may use them in a RAID0 configuration. Similarly, one may achieve the required data rate with several mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs) in RAID0 and in this way provide storage capacity in the tens of TB. The builder is advised to contact local IT infrastructure management to better understand the options available locally. During initial setup of the instrument, it is typically sufficient to buffer images in RAM before they are more slowly written to disk or to use a single modest-capacity SSD for the minimal test data required.</p><p id="P51">Producing super-resolved images from the 3D-SMLM data is contingent on fitting of the single emitters and rendering the molecule positions <italic>in silico</italic>. Without appropriate consideration of this aspect and its hardware underpinnings, fitting may ultimately limit throughput more than the microscope itself. Considering the analysis machine, here one may specify according to the available budget. However, since the fitting of emitters is performed using CUDA, a recent Nvidia GPU provides a minimum requirement. Excellent results (several thousand localizations per second) can be achieved with a relatively inexpensive consumer grade GPU. See the Equipment section for details. Note that a separate computer for analysis is not a requirement but can provide benefit depending on the setting. In research-based settings where the microscope and acquisition PC is hosted and used by a single lab, we have predominantly performed single-molecule fitting on the microscope acquisition PC. Whereas in a service setting we have preferred to separate the task between two machines to allow users to perform data analysis at a later date without interrupting other users acquiring data.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Data analysis and rendering</title><p id="P52">During data acquisition the raw camera frames and metadata describing the state of the microscope are saved by μManager. This data requires extensive analysis steps to yield biological insights: fitting of single molecule positions, post-processing such as filtering and drift correction, rendering as a super-resolution image and quantitative evaluation. We developed the super-resolution microscopy software platform SMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and here detail the analysis steps using this solution, but there are numerous other software, notably Picasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] and ThunderStorm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] that can be equally used. For an overview of the performance of different localization algorithms, we recommend users study the results of the SMLM software challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>].</p><p id="P53">To analyze 3D or multi-color data in SMAP, first the PSF of the microscope and/or channel transformation are calibrated from image stacks of fluorescent beads. Then SMAP identifies possible single-molecule events in the raw camera frames and determines their position with sub-pixel precision by maximum likelihood estimation. Localizations with low accuracy can be filtered out, before residual drift is corrected and a super-resolution image is rendered. These steps can be performed on the fly during data acquisition. SMAP provides numerous plugins to segment and quantitatively analyze cellular structures based on the coordinates of the detected fluorophores.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><sec id="S24"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P54">CAUTION: All reagents present potential hazards and should be handled correctly by personnel trained in general laboratory safety and materials handling.

In addition, all configurations require an objective lens either of oil- or silicone oil-immersion type and a refractive beam homogenizer is required for certain configurations. Independent of the final configuration, the microscope is composed of &gt; 90 custom mechanical parts, which need to be sourced from an appropriate workshop (see: Mechanical parts rationale and sourcing). In addition, &gt; 350 COTS optical and optomechanical components are required as well as additional electronic and mechanical components. The parts list is correct at the time of publication, however, improvements and additions to the design are ongoing.

The custom electronics can be sourced as discussed in Electronics rationale and sourcing. Transmission illumination is provided by an LED ring source, which directly mounts to the microscope cover. A QPD and associated amplifier are used for focus locking and an optional single-element photodiode (with electronics integrated into the FPGA and signal conversion unit) can be used for recording of experimental laser power. At the heart of the microscope control scheme lies a low-cost hobby-grade field-programmable gate array (FPGA, Alchitry Au) and a number of signal conversion boards (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA">https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]) to provide synchronization of hardware, readout of the QPD, analog/digital control of the single/multi-mode laser engine(s), and more generally to provide the builder with the flexibility to add and control additional hardware.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Motion control/Mechatronics</title><p id="P91">Several motion control/mechatronic systems are used in the microscope and together provide a substantial portion of the budget. This includes an objective lens piezo flexure stage to focus and focus lock the objective lens as well as the long travel XY stage for sample positioning. Additional piezo resonant stages are required for positioning the laser incidence at the objective back focal plane to incline the illumination suitably for epi-/HILO/TIRF illumination modes and to select between 2D/3D modes by positioning an astigmatic lens in the emission path. Furthermore, several motorized filter wheels and piezo-sliders are required to select emission filters and introduce a Bertrand lens to the emission path to view the objective back focal plane on a camera.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Laser sources</title><p id="P92">The microscope uses lasers for excitation of various fluorophores as well as for on-switching in (d)STORM/PALM and to provide a positional reference for the focus lock system. The microscope can be configured for different requirements and budgets through the provision of various laser sources. For lower budgets and where TIRF illumination is not required, a low cost multi-mode laser engine can be constructed according to a previously published scheme, which provides a well-homogenized illumination source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. This is a particularly budget-friendly option where only diode lines (typically 405, 488, 640 nm) are required as the range 520 - 620 nm (typically 561 nm) requires an additional commercially packaged laser head. Where TIRF illumination is desired, the base-configuration includes a single mode fiber-coupled laser engine. Note, it is possible to combine several illumination options as desired or add additional ones as the need arises.</p><p id="P93">Typically, the single-mode laser engine is the largest budgetary portion of the microscope, if included. While the standard configuration includes excitation/activation sources at 405, 488, 561, 640 nm, the microscope can in principle be adapted to other applications by specifying alternative laser lines that are similarly commercially available at time of purchase. However, the stated wavelengths are the most commonly used in SMLM and biological imaging more broadly. For power hungry applications an additional free-space single-mode laser can be provided at a single wavelength, most commonly at 640 nm owing to the tendency to perform dSTORM imaging (with far-red dyes) at high laser power. As default configuration from the manufacturer, the recommended booster lasers do not allow for digital modulation. Ensure to specify this option when sourcing these components.</p><p id="P94">The single-mode lasers are homogenized and expanded to produce a uniform and variably sized illumination field at the object. It is possible to adapt the scheme provided to omit the variable magnification or homogenization units (or both), opting instead for a fixed size illumination field and lossy homogenization scheme based on use of a field aperture to heavily apodize the Gaussian beam. This configuration is not specifically supported but it is comparatively simple to implement with some considerations of the necessary beam expansion. Those wishing to develop such a scheme are advised to contact us to discuss any possible issues that may arise. Additionally, builders may use other single-mode lasers or engines than those specified, for example, where hardware already exists in the lab (see Supplementary Note 4: Using non-specified single-mode lasers and laser-engines). However, we cannot comment on the availability of μManager device adapters for unsupported hardware.</p><p id="P95">The focus locking system uses a near infrared 808 nm fiber-coupled single-mode diode laser to be spectrally separable from the excitation/activation sources and emitted fluorescence, which even for far-red dyes is negligible beyond ca. 750 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Imaging camera</title><p id="P96">A single camera is used to capture fluorescence images, even when two spectral channels are employed. We have used several cameras successfully across the many generations of the microscope. The base configuration specifies a Hamamatsu Fusion BT sCMOS camera, which represents a substantial fraction of the total budget. See Supplementary Note 7: Camera data rate for a discussion of camera data rate to determine whether it is necessary to purchase the CoaXPress frame grabber card for the camera. Typically for the FOVs defined by the illumination system and typical exposure times, this is not necessary but for those wishing to substantially adapt the design for larger FOV imaging, the card may be necessary. The Hamamatsu Fusion BT sCMOS camera has three imaging modes, defined here as slow, normal and fast mode. Each has their benefits for imaging, with the slow mode having just 0.7 electron read noise being particularly well-suited to slowSTORM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Unless otherwise noted, use the normal mode for general imaging e.g., of fluorescent bead and dye samples and for various calibration/alignment procedures. For the dSTORM imaging presented as a route to validation of the microscope, the slow mode is optimal, but the normal mode can be used e.g., for larger field of views where the limited frame rate of the slow mode makes imaging less practical.</p><p id="P97">Lower-cost generation II sCMOS cameras such as the Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 v2 have also been used and are also well-suited as the imaging camera, albeit with higher noise and lower quantum efficiency. Similar cameras from other manufacturers for example Andor Zyla 4.2, PCO Edge 4.2 may be equally performant but prospective builders are recommended to thoroughly test cameras and their μManager device adapters before committing to purchases. Although we have operated 3D-SMLM systems with electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) cameras (Photometrics Evolve 512, Andor iXon), they require substantial adaptation of the emission path to increase the magnification to accommodate the larger pixel size.</p><p id="P98">Owing to their readout architecture, sCMOS cameras are characterized by having pixel to pixel variability in noise. For older generation II sCMOS chips and particularly for uncooled industrial CMOS cameras, the variation can be large enough to require calibration of the noise characteristics such that it may be accounted for in localizing fluorophores. Builders wishing to use generation II sCMOS cameras should follow published protocols for generation of the dark offset and variance maps required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] and the SMAP user guide detailing how to include these in final localization analyses. For the generation III Hamamatsu Fusion BT, the read noise is low enough and design of the camera is such that the fraction of pixels with abnormal noise characteristics is vanishingly small and therefore calibration of the noise characteristics is not required.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Microscope control computer</title><p id="P99">The microscope control computer can be configured as desired with a few points worth noting. If the same machine is to be used for analysis tasks, one should ensure that both sets of requirements are met. Smooth performance can be achieved by choosing a central processing unit (CPU) with at least 4 cores, for 8 threads in the tested 64-bit Windows 10/11 environment. Lesser configurations may result in μManager 2.0 struggling to achieve a suitable image refresh rate (&gt;10 Hz) during acquisitions, which is crucial to be able to assess conditions for blinking. We strongly recommend installing the operating system on an SSD and to reserve this disk for the operating system and required software and drivers.</p><p id="P100">Other than these concerns, refer to the Computational infrastructure section for a discussion of data transfer and storage. Depending on the specific configuration chosen, 1 - 4 PCI express (PCIe) ports are required. For example, high-speed SSDs, camera frame grabbers, network cards and GPUs may all occupy this interface. Consult the manufacturer of these components for specification of the port. For example, frame-grabber cards often specify PCI express x8 or x16. One PCIe port is also recommended for a modest graphics processing unit (GPU). Depending on the model chosen, the GPU may occupy more back panel space and block other PCIe ports. There are many USB and RS232 serial devices to connect. As such, it is recommended to use high-quality mountable USB and serial hubs which may be situated closer to the hardware elements and allow a greater number of communications channels than the back/front panel connectors of the acquisition computer.

For on-the-fly data analysis, which is helpful for quality checking and optimization of experimental parameters, this is often the preferred route as the acquired data are inherently available. We have often adopted this approach. We have also split the acquisition and analysis tasks over two machines, each connected to a file server where data are stored via a 10 Gbps network connection. SMAP uses GPU acceleration for parallelized fitting of experimentally-derived PSFs based on CUDA (Nvidia), as such a CUDA-compatible GPU is required. Naturally, performance will scale with hardware availability. Note, if using a single machine for analysis and acquisition, avoid connecting the monitor to the GPU used for analysis as this may interfere with the monitor refresh. In this case, favor the motherboard-integrated GPU for connection of the monitor.

For the former, camera software with on-the-fly calculation of various beam dimensions is preferred since the refractive beam shaper requires a tightly specified input beam diameter for optimum performance. An open source project using μManager/ImageJ is available in this regard, requiring only a compatible camera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. However, for truly quantitative results one must consider variations in pixel response if, for example, a low-cost industrial CMOS camera is used (with the addition of a high neutral density blocking filter to obviate overexposure of the sensor). Commercially available laser profiling cameras include the necessary corrections to meet the relevant industrial ISO standards for definition of various beam parameters and software to allow readout thereof.

The emission path must be aligned with dichroic beamsplitters in place since they impart a shift to the system optical axis upon transmission. For a 3 mm dichroic in air, the shift is approximately 1 mm for 45-degree incidence, assuming a refractive index of 1.5. Although even μW power levels are visible to the naked eye depending on wavelength, adjusting lens tilt by viewing the inherently dim back reflection requires a moderate power alignment laser (&gt;1 mW) which is passed efficiently by the primary dichroic mirror. Since the primary dichroic will typically be selected for reflection at typical 3D-SMLM laser wavelengths: 405, 488, 561, 640 nm, it is advisable to avoid these wavelengths and a narrow window around them of ±10 nm. The most suitable commonly available wavelength, which features the additional benefit of being ideally suited to visual inspection, is 532 nm. We note a 532 nm laser system in the parts list. Note that a 532 nm laser will be reflected by the image splitter dichroic (assuming a 665 nm long-pass dichroic, see Supplementary Note 2). To aid alignment of the image splitter system the tilt of the lenses is fixed by pins and the bleed-through from the dichroic is sufficient to align the lens to the beam-axis. The alignment laser itself is mounted to an optomechanical assembly that allows alignment of the laser (x/y, pitch/yaw) to the optical axis of the objective lens port (which provides a sufficiently accurate proxy for the objective lens optical axis) via two adjustable irises. The parts required are included in the parts list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and with all CAD files.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Infinite conjugate transmission target and infinite conjugate viewing camera</title><p id="P146">Assembly of the emission path requires an infinite conjugate transmission source to provide a reference for focusing of an object at infinity (as provided by an infinity corrected objective imaging at its native/design focal plane). Since incorrect spacing of the emission path lenses may produce a focused image featuring strong spherical and axial chromatic aberrations, this reference provides a route to check that the emission path does indeed focus to the correct plane for which the objective lens is designed. Setting up such a source requires an infinite conjugate viewing camera. The infinite conjugate transmission target assembly includes a transmission target (a coverslip with flecks of ink from a permanent marker is sufficient) and a focusable lens (f = 200 mm). This may be backlit by a suitable white light LED, LED array or flashlight provided by a smartphone as desired. Such a backlight is required for several other steps in the protocol. The infinite conjugate viewing camera comprises a camera and focusable lens (f = 100 mm). Any c-mount camera can be used in principle. Although the camera may also be used for beam profiling (as desired), using the imaging sCMOS camera is not advised as it is useful to have continued access to the infinite referencing assemblies even after the microscope is constructed. To aid focusing of the two assemblies, an adjustable optomechanical scheme is provided as a CAD assembly using COTS components. The parts required are also included in the parts list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Shear plate interferometer</title><p id="P147">Assembly of both the excitation and emission paths requires a shear plate interferometer (referred to as shear plate throughout the protocol) to collimate single-mode fiber sources and judge distance between lenses. The shear plate provides a readout of the collimation state of the laser via the presence of interference fringes and their orientation with regard to a witness line. The parts required and the CAD assembly are included in the parts list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Refer to the section: Use of the shear plate interferometer for correct operation of the shear plate.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Alignment targets</title><p id="P148">Several targets are used throughout to aid with construction and alignment. For example, owing to the position of the emission path tube lens within the microscope body, it is difficult to use the back reflection method (see Orienting and aligning optical elements) to align the lens to the alignment laser beam installed in the objective port. Instead, an alignment target is used to position the tube lens mount appropriately such that the alignment laser passes through two obstructions in series. In some cases, it is necessary to precisely position and configure COTS components to position a target (often an iris) at a specific beam height. In these cases, use calipers to set the height of the assembly. For example, in the typical case of a ½” optical post and optical post holder, the height can be adjusted by sliding the post into the holder with the callipers and tightening the screw to secure it in place. Omit the components mounted to the post and use the calipers to push the post slowly into the holder with the holder screw just tight enough to provide some resistance. Determine the correct spacing of the holder base and top of the post and secure in position at said spacing. When using the target, ensure that the axis of the iris is coaxially aligned to the beam (i.e., not tilted). Moreover, for iris targets mounted on posts, consider that rotating about the post axis results in both translation and rotation of the iris since the iris itself is not aligned to the rotational axis of the post.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S44"><title>Reagent preparation</title><sec id="S45"><title>Enzyme stock solution</title><p id="P149">Prepare 5 mL of a 20x concentrated enzyme stock solution by mixing 60 mg Glucose Oxidase (168 U/mg), 3 mL of 85% Glycerol, 250 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 330 μL Catalase (44560 U/mg) and 1.42 mL dH<sub>2</sub>O.

In short, a magnetic metal plate with a hole in its center serves as a base for the sample ⍰24 mm coverslip. By placing a ring magnet on top, the coverslip is fixed in place, and a chamber is formed that can be filled with the required imaging solution. The magnet ring is encased in a hard PVC casing. To ensure thorough sealing, an O-ring is installed in a corresponding groove on the underside of the magnet casing. Since the ring magnet is in direct contact with the sample and the sample buffer, it must be wrapped in fresh parafilm to avoid carryover of fluorescent material between experiments. To wrap the magnet, a square piece of parafilm is placed on the underside of the ring magnet (clean side facing outward). The edges of the square piece of parafilm are then folded over the outside of the ring and fixed on top. Using a 1 mL pipette tip, the parafilm is pushed through the center of the ring from below (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The edges of the resulting tube can then be pulled over the top using the same pipette tip. The magnet should now be completely wrapped by parafilm and can be placed on top of the coverslip and filled with imaging solution. For prolonged imaging of biological samples, acidification of the imaging buffer can be slowed down by additionally sealing the chamber with parafilm on top.</p></sec><sec id="S60"><title>Fluorescent bead samples</title><p id="P167">Fluorescent bead samples are required for instrument alignment and PSF assessment/fitting. For the former, a denser bead sample (ideally 50 - 100 beads per ⍰35 μm FOV) is preferable to better indicate variations in intensity across the FOV while for the latter, a sparser bead sample (ideally 10 - 20 beads per ⍰35 μm FOV) is preferable such that the PSFs derived from the bead containing sub-volumes do not overlap with each other. To prepare a bead sample, add 40 μL of 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> at the center of a ⍰24 mm coverslip, already placed on the sample holder. Dilute 0.8 μL of the bead stock solution in 360 μL dH<sub>2</sub>O and vortex the solution for 20 s. Then add the bead solution to the MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution on the coverslip and pipette up and down until mixed. Incubate the sample for 3 min. Then replace the mix with 400 μL dH<sub>2</sub>O. Such a bead sample is generally stable for an hour, after which the beads will start to detach. To keep the beads attached to the coverslip for longer one can replace the dH<sub>2</sub>O with 400 μL of a 0.1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution.</p><p id="P168">Alternatively, one can also immobilize beads in the long term on a coverslip using poly-L-lysine. To this end, add 100 μL of poly-L-lysine to the center of a ⍰24 mm coverslip. After 10 minutes gently wash the solution away using dH<sub>2</sub>O. Dry the coverslip using clean compressed air. The presence of the poly-L-lysine layer can be seen as a surface film by tilting the coverslip to the light. Mix the undiluted bead stock by sonicating/vortexing for 1 minute to break up aggregated beads. Prepare a bead stock as a 1:50 or 1:250 vol/vol dilution with distilled water for the dense and sparse sample respectively. Mix the diluted stock as previously described and pipette 100 μL onto the coverslip to cover the poly-L-lysine coating. Leave for 10 minutes. Gently wash away the bead stock with distilled water and dry with clean compressed air. Bead samples can be stored dry at room temperature for several weeks if protected from light.</p><p id="P169">When imaging fluorescent bead samples, ensure that they are immersed in water or buffer solution. This is particularly important when assessing the PSF quality or 3D imaging performance since spherical aberrations in aqueous media (n = 1.33 - 1.34) will be comparable to those encountered in tissues (n = 1.36 - 1.4), whereas air (n = 1.00) provides a much larger refractive index mismatch between the coverslip and sample and stronger spherical aberration accordingly. In addition, when assessing conditions for (total internal) reflection from the coverslip, aqueous media provides a reasonable approximation of tissue and allows the required obliquity of the incoming beam to be determined more accurately, with only small readjustments required for tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S61"><title>Fluorescent dye sandwich</title><p id="P170">A dye sandwich is used to assess and optimize the uniformity of the illumination field.

For custom made parts, check all toleranced dimensions with calipers, tapped holes with their respective threaded component and dowel pin holes with correctly toleranced dowel pins. Dowel pin holes may become undersized during the anodizing process. If this occurs, the holes should be re-machined to the required tolerances. We note a few general points regarding laser safety, optical alignment and best working practices. The various aspects described are not repeated throughout the protocol. The builder is assumed to have familiarized themselves sufficiently with the notes below before proceeding.</p><sec id="S68"><title>Conventions</title><p id="P183">Throughout the protocol, elements in the various optical paths are referred to as being situated or placed up- or downstream. Upstream refers to a position closer to the light source or earlier in the sequence than the current element or position currently considered. Conversely, downstream refers to positions further away from the light source or later in the sequence than the subject element. Naturally, upstream elements have impacts on downstream components and generally downstream elements have no impact on upstream components. When referring to alignment of components, the terms lateral and longitudinal are used to refer to positioning of the element relative to the beam axis. The two lateral axes are mutually perpendicular to each other and the beam axis. The lateral axes may thus include a height component when the beam is travelling parallel to the optical table surface. The longitudinal axis is aligned to the beam axis. Furthermore, when specifying that a given component should be introduced, this indicates that the component should be placed approximately as determined by the CAD or as otherwise indicated without achieving a final position or alignment. For example, one may be instructed to introduce a lens, implying that the lens should be oriented correctly, placed in an appropriate position to elicit an effect but without securing in position. Conversely, when instructed to install a component, this indicates that the element should be placed correctly and secured in place. Often this will concern components whose position is fixed by other pre-installed/assembled features. It is assumed throughout that introduction and installation of components takes place with reference to the CAD design. There are cases where the positioning of components may ultimately depart from the CAD design, for example, when placing lenses in positions to maintain beam collimation and conjugation of various upstream/downstream optical elements, which is affected by focal length tolerances, precise collimation states of the probe laser and uncertainty of the precise back focal plane position of the objective lens. In these cases, adjustments must be made to the positioning of downstream components accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="S69"><title>Mechanical assembly</title><sec id="S70"><title>Securing components</title><p id="P184">The various mechanical parts comprising the microscope should be fastened with appropriate screws. The specific screw to use is not included in the parts list or CAD assembly unless there is a specific reason for doing so, e.g., when providing an important mating feature. Metric screws are used almost exclusively throughout. Exceptions to the metric format are called out in the protocol. For example, UNC #4-40 screws are used as required. The builder is expected to provide a reasonable stock of appropriate screws. To some extent the builder is free to choose the screws they want to use although the screw type is fixed by the respective feature in the mechanical part. Where generic screws and other small fittings (e.g., dowel pins, hex standoffs) are included in the parts list (typically since they constitute a mating feature in a CAD assembly), the part number for a US-based vendor has been provided owing to their extensive CAD support (McMaster-Carr), similar parts can be sourced from other suppliers.</p><p id="P185">In some cases, it is necessary to use a thread adapter to affix components with different threads. For example, M4/M6 external/external thread adapters are required (see parts list). When selecting a screw length consider the depth of the threading and that 3 - 5 threads are sufficient for robust tightening. For example, for an M6x1.0 thread, 3 - 5 threads are equal to 3 - 5 mm. In the construction of the body, we specify the length of screw and dowel pin to use for best results. Where possible the addition of a washer ensures the most robust fastening and avoids damage to anodizing or components themselves resulting from over tightening of screws. Builders may seek generic information about optimal screw tightness and tighten with a torque wrench if desired (not specified in tools required). However, as a good rule of thumb, tighten the screw to finger tightness by rotating the long arm’s axis of the hex key between one’s fingers and then tighten no more than a quarter turn by rotating the short arm while holding the long arm for superior torque.</p></sec><sec id="S71"><title>Use of positionally locating mechanical features</title><p id="P186">Several of the custom components feature locating features. In the case of dowel pins, install in all available positions unless otherwise informed, for example, where dowel pins may over-specify positions under conditions of tolerance stack-up, or where additional adjustment is required. In some cases, the position of a component can be fixed in one or two dimensions by a locating surface or pocket. For example, the emission path tube lens can be removed and replaced repeatedly without misaligning the system owing to a pocketed mount. In these cases, ensure that components are installed with the appropriate locating feature flush to the surface(s). In the absence of locating features, components should be installed in the position determined by screws and without biassing screws to either side of their clearance holes. For example, the optical table does not provide locating features and so assemblies that are directly affixed to the table must be manually positioned (e.g., the microscope body and the image splitter platform are the largest components affixed to the optical table).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S72"><title>Optical alignment and practices</title><sec id="S73"><title>Handling optics</title><p id="P187">To avoid soiling surfaces of lenses, mirrors, beamsplitters and filters, wear suitable gloves when handling optical elements. Even so, one should avoid making contact with optical surfaces. This is particularly important for optics with large clear apertures and those installed in confined spaces, which are easily soiled by accident during installation. For example, the emission path tube lens should be introduced and adjusted with particular care. If soiled, optics should be cleaned immediately flowing best practices with solvents, lens tissue and without applying pressure. Flat optics are easily cleaned fully while lenses or optics in housings (e.g., filters) can be more difficult. When cleaning housed optics, use minimal solvent to prevent its ingress into the housing. Lenses and mirrors can become soiled with dust over time. Purified air dusters or bulb blowers may be used to remove dust from optics periodically while persistent soiling may require removal and replacement of the optic. In some cases, and with care, this can be performed without misalignment of the system. When securing mirrors in mounts ensure that they are firmly held but do not overtighten, which even for thick optics can result in warping. Similarly, for lenses in lens tubes secured by retaining rings, do not overtighten the rings to avoid damage to the optic and where possible, install the second retaining ring with the lens tube facing up/down such that the optic sits as flat as possible. Always use an appropriate spanner wrench (e.g., COTS-SPW602) to tighten retaining rings (COTS-SM1RR).</p></sec><sec id="S74"><title>The shear plate interferometer</title><p id="P188">The shear plate interferometer is an optical device allowing judgement of the collimation state of the laser. Generally, the user is advised to follow the manufacturer notes. However, we note that additional parts are specified to aid normal alignment of the beam onto the device (see parts list/CAD files). In addition, consider that the human eye is most able to resolve fine details in the green-yellow portion of the visible spectrum. When a choice of wavelengths is available such as is the case of the laser engine(s) opt for the closest wavelength to 550 nm (e.g., 561 &gt; 532 &gt; 488 &gt; 640 &gt; 405 nm) and use minimum power or attenuate with neutral density filters to allow the eye to better resolve the interference fringes. Note for beams smaller than ca. 3.0 mm, the size of the fringes will be small enough that may make visual inspection difficult. In such a case it is helpful to use a magnifying adapter for the viewing screen. The use of the shear plate is not possible nor necessary with the NIR lasers for the focus lock system. Throughout the protocol, no reference is made to the size of beam or the specific plate to use. In each case, this is readily determined by simple considerations of input beam size and system magnification.</p></sec><sec id="S75"><title>Walking the beam</title><p id="P189">Throughout the protocol it is necessary to walk the beam to achieve fixed height travel from the optical table, potentially with alignment to other alignment features, or to ensure the beam passes correctly into or out of the objective lens port. Doing so usually requires two spaced targets at the correct height/position placed downstream of the element(s) that will be adjusted. For an arbitrary height and angle input, two steerable elements are required to walk the beam. One should iteratively use the first steerable element to align to the closest target and the second to the furthest target.</p></sec><sec id="S76"><title>Orienting and aligning optical elements</title><p id="P190">The spectrally discriminative optics (filters and dichroics) have dielectric coatings requiring a specific orientation of the optic, which is often indicated by a caret or arrow on the side of the optic. Consult manufacturer datasheets for correct orientation, which differs between manufacturers. Lenses have a specified orientation with their flatter (greatest radii of curvature, thus lower optical power) surface facing the beam focus. When uncertain, consult the CAD and/or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for guidance. In the case of the tube lens, the infinite conjugate (collimated) direction is indicated by an infinity symbol. However, for lenses mounted in tubes it is easy to lose the orientation and align the lens incorrectly. For this reason, it is good practice to indicate the infinite conjugate side of the lens on the lens tube. Additionally, when aligning lenses mounted in tubes via a split clamp, lock the lens position with the clamp beforehand and loosen only to adjust collimation before locking again. Doing so ensures that the lens is correctly positioned during the alignment process. The specific degrees of freedom available will determine how a lens is aligned. Generally, one starts with a beam travelling at a fixed height from the optical table and potentially aligned to specific optical table hole features. The lens is aligned by positioning its optical axis to the beam axis. When the lens is placed correctly, the resulting beam does not deviate from its original course but may change in diameter as it propagates due to focusing by the lens. In most cases during the protocol, one is able to position lenses laterally (orthogonal to the optical axis) and longitudinally (along the optical axis). Lateral positioning is most critical for minimizing beam-deflection, while correct positioning in z is critical to achieve collimation and conjugation of various optical elements in the system. In addition, the yaw angle can be adjusted by rotating lenses on their mounting posts, while the pitch is fixed. In this case, incorrect placement/orientation leads to only small beam deflections but contributes to off-axis aberrations such as astigmatism and coma. To align a lens, place and secure iris targets up- and downstream of the intended lens position aligned to the fixed height beam. Introduce the lens and laterally position it to roughly align the beam through the downstream iris. Check for back reflections from the lens, which should be visible on the backside of the first iris. If they are not present, adjust the lens yaw until they can be seen. The objective is to align the back reflections to each other and back through the iris. The relative positions can be adjusted by lateral translation and the combined back reflections can be redirected back through the iris by adjusting the pitch and yaw. Since pitch is typically not an adjustable degree of freedom it may not be possible to achieve perfect overlap of the back reflections and vertical alignment back through the iris. In this case, assuming the input beam is indeed propagating at a fixed height, horizontal overlap of the back reflections is sufficient. The longitudinal alignment of a lens depends on whether one has a collimated or divergent output. Bringing a divergent beam into collimation is achieved by longitudinal positioning of the lens and assessing the collimation on a shear plate interferometer. Generally, in the case of the placement of lenses to focus a collimated beam, the protocol will outline steps to present the alignment as a collimation step. In some cases, trying to simultaneously ensure collimation and alignment to the optical axis presents a challenge that is best broken down into constituent parts. First the position for collimation is determined (with very rough alignment to the optical axis) and a locating feature is installed to allow the longitudinal position to be indicated for subsequent alignment to the axis. This will be indicated in the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S77"><title>Affixing dichroic beamsplitters in glue-in mounts</title><p id="P191">Improper mounting of dichroic beamsplitters whereby differential stress is applied, e.g., via a retaining screw, will result in curvature of the mirror resulting in strong aberrations e.g., astigmatism/coma in the resulting image. To avoid this occurrence, the dichroic mounts are designed to mount the elements via an adhesive only. Note, that CAD files for the dichroic mounts are provided for 1 (illumination only), 3- and 5-mm thick substrates with lateral dimensions no larger than 25.5 × 36 mm. For other lateral dimensions or thicknesses, the builder is advised to make the appropriate modification to the CAD part. It is imperative that the correct thickness is used with the correct mount for alignment purposes. Generally thicker dichroics are able to hold a tighter tolerance on surface flatness, (λ/10 desirable over the used aperture, but as low as λ/4 may prove acceptable). This is particularly important for reflection of the emitted fluorescence by the emission dichroic, where a poor surface flatness will result in aberrations in the final image. Additionally thicker substrates are more resistant to bending under stress. Nevertheless, dichroics should not be mounted in such a way that stresses are applied. Before mounting the dichroics, clean the mounts with isopropanol and clean compressed air.</p><p id="P192">Regarding choice of adhesive, A UV-cured epoxy is well-suited with the following caveats: i) the dichroic should be affixed only at two corners along the same edge of the optic, ii) the UV curing process should not be carried out under conditions of elevated temperature, e.g., under lamps. The mounting part will deform with changes in temperature and the epoxy affixes the optic very stiffly such that deformations of the mount may deform the beamsplitter. Minimal affixing points help to reduce any deformations. An alternative is to use a silicone sealant to hold the dichroic in place. The flexible sealant obviates deformations but does not provide as strong adhesion, so care must be taken to seat the dichroic correctly in the mount and in handling the mounted optic. The sealant can be easily removed, whereas epoxy should be considered a permanent solution, although the recommended epoxy can be removed with immersion in dichloromethane. Whichever solution is chosen, one should ensure that the dichroic sits flat in the mount and that adhesive does not seep under the optic. This is best achieved by holding the optic in place using light downward pressure from an optics-grade cotton tipped applicator on the dichroic during gluing.</p></sec><sec id="S78"><title>The alignment laser and aligning with lasers</title><p id="P193">the alignment laser assembly includes two adjustable irises to ensure on-axis passage of the beam through the threaded assembly thus ensuring that the beam enters the microscope emission path aligned to the optical axis of the objective lens. Use the pitch/yaw (COTS-KAD11F) and X,Y mounts (COTS-CXY1) to iteratively align the laser through the first and second irises respectively. The beam incidence on the irises may be viewed through the cut-outs in the slotted lens tubes with the covers rotated appropriately. It is assumed in the protocol that the alignment of the alignment laser through the two irises is correctly established and maintained throughout. During alignment, the second of these irises may be stopped down to limit the size of the beam, which generally improves accuracy in positioning of lenses and alignment to various downstream apertures and targets. When assessing beam collimation, for example, in the axial positioning of lenses, a larger beam is preferable for readout of the collimation state and so the iris should be fully opened. When inserting optical elements into the beam path, first turn off the alignment laser and be aware that the beam path may have changed. Use laser safety screens (see parts list) as appropriate to intercept stray beams. When using laser sources to image samples, it is assumed that the microscope cover is installed. This is particularly important when aligning the illumination and focus lock beams for (total internal) reflection from the coverslip, where the beam will be launched obliquely from the objective lens constituting a particular laser safety hazard. Otherwise, the instruction to ensure the cover is correctly installed is left to the builder to exercise good judgement. When using targets for alignment purposes or the shear plate interferometer, secure these parts with appropriate base clamps to avoid losses of position due to unintended movement of the element.</p></sec><sec id="S79"><title>Use of neutral density (ND) filters</title><p id="P194">The neutral density filters offer a logarithmic scale for laser attenuation. At certain stages of the protocol, it may be necessary to use ND filters to attenuate the beam, particularly when it will be incident on a camera (beam profiling cameras may include an appropriate ND filter). To avoid damage, never allow an unattenuated laser to illuminate the camera chip. Start with a high ND filter (e.g., ND6) and work downwards to achieve the required attenuation. Note that absorptive ND filters can be stacked to provide additive neutral density. If using pre-existing reflective ND filters, stacking may result in multiple reflections and is thus not recommended. The parts list provided specifies neutral densities of 1, 2 and 4. By combining these filters one may achieve effective ND1-7. When placing ND filters, ensure that their face is perpendicular to the beam optical axis to avoid steering the beam unintentionally.</p></sec><sec id="S80"><title>Cleaning the objective lens</title><p id="P195">The immersion oil(s) used can leave a residue on the objectives that is not removed by mild solvents such as isopropanol alone. We recommend routine cleaning of the lens after each imaging session and when replacing the immersion oil using a mixture of 85% Petrol ether and 15% Isopropanol vol/vol. For deeper cleaning of the objective lens, other mineral or immersion oils as well as optics grade polymer cleaning sprays/solutions are effective for removal of the residue. The builder is advised to proceed with caution applying other treatments and follow usual practices such as using only high-quality lens tissue, clean air-blowers and never applying pressure when cleaning lenses, filters and mirrors.</p></sec><sec id="S81"><title>Use of the Bertrand lens</title><p id="P196">The Bertrand lens allows viewing of the objective lens back focal plane. Once the Bertrand lens is correctly set up (see: Emission path alignment (Timing: 5 days)) and a fluorescent sample is mounted and imaged in focus on the camera, the back focal plane of the objective lens is visible as a bright disk in one or both channels (depending on choice of excitation wavelength/emission filters). The focused single-mode excitation spot (if present) should be visible at the center of the disk for epi illumination or offset for HILO/TIRF. The focus lock laser spot, when correctly aligned, should also appear as a spot towards the periphery of the back focal plane. It may be possible in some cases to see a dimmer reflected spot on the opposite side of the back focal plane, which also allows the Bertrand lens to be used to judge the total internal reflection condition. The presence of dark occlusions on the disk indicates the presence of bubbles in the immersion oil, which aberrate the PSF and degrade image quality. As such, the Bertrand lens can be used for quality checking and should be used whenever mounting a sample. It may also be used effectively for multi-position acquisition workflows, where bubbles may move around as the oil is spread around the coverslip by its motion. When bubbles are seen to be present, clean the objective and sample with isopropanol and lens tissue before adding more oil and replacing the sample.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S82"><title>Control of the microscope and hardware</title><sec id="S83"><title>Using μManager and the htSMLM GUI</title><p id="P197">Throughout the protocol a multitude of instructions will be given requiring interaction with software to control hardware and acquire data. The builder is expected to familiarize themselves with the software and controls prior to continuing with the protocol. For brevity, specific instructions regarding how to achieve a given command are provided. For example, the instruction: Image fluorescent beads, assumes that the user is familiar with previewing and acquiring images using the μManager GUI. Similarly, it is assumed that the user can set laser power, region of interest (ROI) and exposure time or select filters appropriately to achieve a desired temporal resolution and image signal to noise or exposure level.</p></sec><sec id="S84"><title>Making connections with cables and handling electronics</title><p id="P198">A specific list of cables required is not provided since the lengths required will depend on how the hardware and room are laid out. However, some general points are worth considering. The microFPGA front panel connectors are all SMB-type (jack/female) and so a supply of SMB cables is generally required, additionally other hardware elements use SMA (sCMOS camera) and BNC (piezo flexure stage) connectors. The builder is free to choose connectors when packaging the focus lock QPD amplifier and so cables should be determined accordingly. The builder should take care to not over flex cables, particularly those that are not removable/replaceable such as those of the XY stage, QPD stage and piezo flexure stage. Take appropriate care when handling electronic boards to avoid electrostatic damage. Ideally handle all boards using an anti-static wrist band with earthing connector.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S85"><title>Protocol</title><sec id="S86"><title>Microscope body build-up (Timing: 3 days)</title><p id="P199">The microscope body provides the core of the microscope around which the illumination, emission and focus lock optical pathways are constructed.

The microFPGA is then assembled with its enclosure: boards are mechanically mounted and the Breakout (Br) and custom shield (CS) are installed on the FPGA before all electrical connections are made. Note that the signal conversion board is not needed for any of the microscope components specified but adds flexibility for extension or changes of camera, which may operate at a 5V logic level that could otherwise damage the FPGA. The builder may omit this board and ignore all related protocol steps as desired, instead connecting the camera exposure input directly to the custom shield.

For example, the piezo flexure stage controller needs to be configured in its host-software such that it provides appropriate positional feedback on the basis of the analog signal provided by the focus lock system QPD. The various piezo resonant stages used for illumination control (epi-/HILO/TIRF), back focal plane viewing and astigmatic lens positioning also require that a unique address is established for each in their host software. μManager, which ultimately provides the basis for hardware control must be installed. Communication with the various hardware devices from μManager requires that a hardware configuration is established, whereby communication with each device is defined via its device adapter (e.g., COM port etc. for serial devices). All required device adapters for the hardware elements described are available in μManager with one exception, the objective lens piezo flexure stage uses a modified version of the PI_ZStage device adapter, PI_FocusLock, a pre-compiled version of which is available on our GitHub. The htSMLM graphical user interface (GUI) is provided as a configuration for μManager’s EMU plugin.

To establish the route of the emission path, an alignment laser is aligned to the objective lens port to indicate the optical axis of the emission path. The image splitter platform and a pair of pinned alignment targets are first used as a guide to ensure proper reflection of light out of the microscope body. The image splitter platform is subsequently installed in place for imaging operation and the beam split by a dichroic mirror. The two beamlets are subsequently steered to route the corresponding image channels onto the camera with appropriate spatial separation using an alignment tool. This tool provides a reference position where the two beams from the reflected and transmitted pathway should cross each other owing to a small tilt of the two images with respect to the camera.

The tube lens mount is aligned to the optical axis using an alignment assembly and positioned for telecentricity by passing the alignment laser through the tube lens (to produce a focus at the back focal plane) and subsequently collimating the beam with the objective lens. The objective and tube lens thus provide a 4f imaging system yielding a ca. 92× magnification primary image. Spacing and alignment of the first relay lens is similarly achieved by using the tube lens to generate a focus from an infinite conjugate source and collimating with the relay lens accordingly. To aid alignment, the second relay lenses of the reflected and transmitted paths of the image splitter feature mounts with circumscribed degrees of freedom: a dowel pin slot and a pair of dowel pins in the base allow lateral translation but not reorientation of the mount. The tube lens is removed from its base adapter to produce a focus from the first relay lens thus again presenting the longitudinal positioning of the second relay lens as a collimation operation. Once correctly positioned, the emission path and image splitter are set up to produce two secondary images on the camera with ca. 61× magnification. The addition of blocking filters for the laser lines used for illumination/focus lock and various emission filters allows for fluorescence images to be collected in subsequent steps.

If the position of the second relay lens to achieve collimation is substantially shifted relative to the nominal position, problems may arise. First, if the lens is placed too far upstream, it may occupy the space required to later install the filter wheel. Second, if the lens is placed too far downstream, the lens tube (COTS-SM1L10) in which it is mounted may result in vignetting of the image and/or spatial variations in PSF shape owing to blocking of the reflected light from the subsequent steering mirror. If either of these cases are apparent, it is necessary to adjust the position of the entire image splitter platform (FAB-EMBL-000077) to lie further upstream or downstream respectively. For small adjustments (up to 25 mm), one may reposition the image splitter platform without compromising the alignment. In this case, use two fixed kinematic stops (COTS-KL01L) to indicate the position of the side of the platform running parallel to the transmitted path optical axis.

Several exchangeable Keplerian telescopes are aligned to the single-mode laser path to allow the user to quickly optimize the illumination field size for a given application. Each telescope has an equal 4f track length ensuring that various conjugates are maintained through the optical path upon exchange. Note that builders wishing to omit the exchangeable telescope system can do so either by choosing one telescope to set a fixed non-unit magnification or omitting the relay entirely and positioning the iris at the conjugate image plane one focal length upstream of the illumination tube lens. In this case, some modification of the protocol steps and parts used will be necessary. An iris is installed upstream of the telescopes, providing a field aperture to allow clean-up/cropping of the illumination field independent of the telescopic magnification. Subsequently, a refractive beam shaper is introduced to flatten the Gaussian output. It should be noted that while the beam shaper is achromatic in design, unavoidable small spectral variations (± 10 %) in the beam diameters from the single-mode laser engine, results in a homogenization efficiency that scales accordingly. Nevertheless, when correctly adjusted, the beam homogeneity for all wavelengths is better than the case of a Gaussian beam truncated at 80% peak intensity and achieves ca. 10 × greater power throughput/efficiency. Subsequent alignment of the beam shaper requires careful pitch/yaw and lateral alignment to produce a homogenized output and the use of the beam profiling camera to assess the homogeneity of the output. <list list-type="simple" id="L20"><list-item><label>273</label><p id="P485">Install the shear plate assembly (3D-SMLM-EMBL-005) at the objective port (FAB-EMBL-000043) using an RMS to SM1 thread adapter (COTS-SM1A4) and lens tube (COTS-SM1S10)</p></list-item><list-item><label>274</label><p id="P486">Install the kinematic magnetic bases (COTS-AKP-BF, COTS-AKP-BC, COTS-AKP-BV) with the telescopic relay breadboard (COTS-M-SA2-04X12, 3× COTS-AKP-TF) in the nominal position on the optical table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 40</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><label>275</label><p id="P487">Leaving the kinematic magnetic bases (COTS-AKP-BF, COTS-AKP-BC, COTS-AKP-BV) in place, assemble additional breadboards (COTS-M-SA2-04X12, 3× COTS-AKP-TF) to mate with the kinematic magnetic bases for each additional magnifying telescope (as specified by the builder).</p></list-item><list-item><label>276</label><p id="P488">For the 0.5, 1 and 2× telescopic relays, install all lenses (2× COTS-AC254-040-A, 2× COTS-AC254-060-A, 2× COTS-AC254-080-A) approximately half way down the length of their lens tubes (COTS-SM1M10) using two retaining rings (COTS-SM1RR) to secure them in place.

Delivering HILO/TIRF illumination requires that the illumination lasers are shifted from the center of the objective back focal plane towards its periphery such that the collimated beams are launched obliquely by the objective lens to just avoid (HILO) or fulfil the total-internal reflection criterion (TIRF). This is accomplished via a positional shift of the illumination inclination control mirror/stage. In the case of a silicone oil objective lens, the refractive index contrast between the immersion oil and the sample is too small to fulfil the TIRF condition at the angle defined by the maximum NA of the objective lens.

The laser should now be reflected at the coverslip/sample boundary and should pass back through the objective lens and should be visibly apparent passing back down the illumination path laterally offset a few mm from the illumination beam on its way into the microscope. For example, the incoming illumination and outgoing total internal reflected beams are focused intermediate between the two lenses of the illumination telescope, which facilitates their viewing (at low laser power) with paper. The reflected beam may also be visible on the opposite side of the back focal plane image. Check also that the beads remain visible on the coverslip without major changes in the illumination spot shape or homogeneity. TROUBLESHOOTING!

The multi-mode lasers are coupled into the illumination path by moving the illumination inclination control mirror (for HILO/TIRF illumination) fully out of the beam path, thus allowing the multi-mode lasers to pass into the microscope body. Note, if building the microscope with the option of multi-mode illumination only, the entire illumination periscope and inclination control assembly can simply be omitted. The alignment laser is used to define the route of the beam and to align/focus the retrofocus tube lens to the back focal plane of the objective. A slit is installed as a field aperture (placed conjugate to the object plane) with the assistance of the infinite conjugate viewing camera. Having established the multi-mode path, the multi-mode fiber is introduced and focused relative to its projecting lens to image the fiber tip onto the slit and in turn onto the sample. Note, the path length from the beam launch to the adjustable slit will determine the precise magnification of the square fiber tip and the illuminated field of view accordingly. While exact placement of the beam launch, adjustable slit and intervening mirrors is not critical, deviation from the intended placement/path length should be minimized.

The astigmatic lens consists of a pair of cylindrical lenses of equivalent power and opposite sign. Introducing a relative rotation between the zero-power axes of the lenses results in a variable amount of astigmatism being introduced, which allows the axial position of emitters to be encoded via the resulting lateral PSF asymmetry and orientation. The astigmatic lens is placed at a conjugate of the back focal plane of the objective and is thus expected to introduce minimal distortion associated with anisotropic magnification. The correct placement of the astigmatic lens is assessed by imaging an aperture target onto the camera with the help of the Bertrand lens, which has been pre-configured to image the back focal plane and its conjugates.

Setting up the focus lock system requires aligning a near-infrared (808 nm) laser to the optical axis of the objective lens, focusing it to the back focal plane and then shifting the focused spot to the periphery of the back focal plane to fulfil the condition for total internal reflection. The reflected beam is subsequently routed to the QPD where an axial drift of the objective-coverslip spacing is detected as a lateral shift of the reflected beam. When setting up the microscope with a silicone oil objective, start with 20× higher resistance to provide higher detector sensitivity. In the case of a silicone oil objective lens, the refractive index contrast between the immersion oil and the sample is too small to fulfil the total internal reflection condition at the angle defined by the maximum NA of the objective lens. In this case, one can still focus lock via Fresnel reflection of the tilted beam at the interface. In this case, the reflected signal will be much dimmer than for total internal reflection. The focus lock path needs to be constructed in a stable manner with minimized beam path lengths since any drift in the beam pointing will result in focus drift.

Focus locking is necessary in this case, since the calibration requires that a large number of individual bead-derived PSFs are averaged, which in turn requires imaging over a large region of the coverslip, which may vary slightly in height. An iterative process of optimizing correction collar and astigmatism settings is performed to attain the best possible 3D imaging performance. Subsequently, we will describe how to perform a PSF calibration with SMAP and use this for 3D fitting. This procedure is used later to check for drifts and vibrations and to fit the example data for performance characterization. <list list-type="simple" id="L32"><list-item><label>466</label><p id="P690">Mount a fluorescent bead sample.

The minima of the CRLB x and y plots should be approximately 400 nm apart in z height for both the oil and silicone oil objectives. In general, stronger astigmatism is associated with improved z localization precision but also a larger distance between the x and y minima resulting in a reduced effective operating z range. Results from a typical 3D calibration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.

In PSFx and PSFz the individual bead profiles should envelop the average. In ‘validate’ the central part should consist of parallel straight lines. ‘CRLB’ calculates the achievable localization precision for a hypothetical photon count of 5000 and a background of 50 photons. An asymmetry of the z localization precision about the plot’s z center (ca. z = 0 nm assuming that the z-stack is well centered on the focus where the elongation in either axis is at a minimum) often hints at the presence of spherical aberrations. A peak in the z localization precision at or close to z = 0 nm suggests that the astigmatism is too weak.

Under ‘global fit parameters’ check ‘make T’ and select ‘right-left mirror’ and main Channel ‘d/r’. The resulting calibration will be shown in a new window, and the Matlab file as well as the figure are saved automatically to the imaging folder. TROUBLESHOOTING! In the calibration figure, the results for each channel are shown (‘first channel’ and ‘second channel’). For each tab the quality of the calibration can be assessed as described in step 474. Two additional tabs can be inspected for dual-color data. In the ‘transformation’ tab, the transformation of channel 1 onto channel 2 is evaluated. Check ‘transformation:pos’ tab to check that most beads found in channel 1 are matched to a specific bead in channel 2. Beads for which no matching was possible are marked as ‘+’ and should be significantly fewer than matched beads marked as ‘o’. Ensure that most beads across the entire field of view are paired. The ‘CRLB’ and ‘validation’ for the global transformation are found in ‘global cal’. Similar as described in step 474, the ‘validation’ tab should show a central part with straight and parallel lines. ‘CRLB’ should show a symmetric localization precision for z, which can be expected to reach approximately 10 – 15 nm. Similarly, x and y localization precision should be symmetrical, and at a low value around 5 nm. In the PSF tabs, the cross-section through the PSF model along x (‘PSFx’), y (‘PSFy’), and z (‘PSFz’) are shown. The traces for PSFs calculated for individual beads (light blue) should follow the smoothed PSF model (dark blue) with minimal deviations. Should the spread between individual beads and the model be too wide, the bead calibration has to be optimized. In the ‘validation’ tab check that zfit for all beads is linear with the frame and that all lines are parallel to the zfit for the average model (black line). Deviations at the extreme frames are expected and result from the bead calibration spanning a larger z range than that which is useable. Experimental reasons for imperfect bead calibration include the presence of an air bubble when imaging, poor choice of bead regions such as overlapping beads, flickering and bleaching of beads because of high laser powers or saturation of the camera. It is thus recommended to re-mount the sample and acquire a fresh bead stack. Check if the model properly fit the individual beads (‘global cal’/’validate’) and that all curves fall onto the same linear relationship for most of the frames. Check the cross-section through the model along the z-axis to see if the model well represents the individual beads (‘global cal’/’PSFz’).

From all pairwise displacements a drift trajectory is then calculated and used to correct the data. In the plugin you need to select if only to ‘correct xy-drift’ or also to ‘correct z-drift’. The main parameter you need to choose is the number of time windows called ‘timepoints’. More time points lead to a smoother curve, but if the data is sparse, at some point the noise increases.

Here, we want to test the effective resolution achievable on a biological sample. To this end, we require a well characterized and homogenous biological structure that can serve as a reference standard. The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), responsible for transfer of molecules across the nuclear membrane, has been thoroughly studied with complementary methods including cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryoEM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. It comprises ~30 proteins, of which Nup96 is our preferred candidate for benchmarking. This protein is present in 32 copies within the NPC, and distributed symmetrically across the structure, with 16 copies forming the cytoplasmic ring, and 16 copies forming the nucleoplasmic ring. Each ring contains 8 corners formed by two Nup96 proteins. Two Nup96 proteins in one corner are 12 nm apart, two corners are 42 nm apart, the entire ring has a diameter of 107 nm and the two rings are separated by 50 nm. This 8-fold symmetrical distribution of Nup96 makes it an ideal candidate to estimate the resolving power of the set up, and resulting images and downstream computational analyses allow for the identification of potential issues and more targeted troubleshooting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. We note that for the following sections concerning biological validation of the microscope performance, the builder should refer to Supplementary Note 2: Selecting spectrally discriminative optics to aid in selection of appropriate filters and dichroics suited to the far-red ratiometric dSTORM scheme. Since we are acquiring 2D data, one should follow the instructions in section 474 - 480 for 2D fitting. Fitting can be performed after the acquisition has finished. Alternatively, it can be performed ‘online’ to assess the reconstructed image in real-time during acquisition. This early evaluation offers the ability to detect any issues or artefacts during imaging and make necessary adjustments or abort the acquisition and restart with optimized settings. To investigate image quality (both during and after acquisition) visual inspection can be complemented with a statistical analysis of the image. It is important to understand the acquired data quality to identify potential points for troubleshooting. The following steps will outline a brief quality assessment.

To distinguish both fluorescent species, a ratiometric imaging approach is applied, where signal from both fluorophores is split into short- and longwave components by a dichroic and imaged simultaneously on two separate regions of the camera chip. Assignment of a given localized emitter to a specific fluorophore is then based on the intensity ratio between both camera channels.

By determining the ring separation in the data set using advance geometric model fitting, the deviance from this expected value can be calculated and the z-scaling of the data corrected accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d249aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_6.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_7.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplementary Table 8</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_8.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Supplementary Table 9</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_9.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Supplementary Table 10</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_10.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdElB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>Supplementary Table 11</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_11.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEmB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD13"><label>Supplementary Table 12</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_12.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEnB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD14"><label>Supplementary Table 13</label><media xlink:href="EMS190118-supplement-Supplementary_Table_13.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d249aAdEoB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S117"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christian Kieser (EMBL Electronic Workshop) for help with construction of and documentation for the microFPGA.

The resulting flat-top intensity profile is further expanded by exchangeable telescopes to control the size of the illumination field. Setting the angle for TIRF/HILO illumination is accomplished by positioning of a motorized mirror. The laser power is monitored in real time by measuring the &lt;1% transmission of the laser lines at the illumination dichroic mirror. Emission path (green): A primary image is produced by a tube lens, restricted in spatial extent by a slit and relayed in a 4f configuration via a spectrally discriminative image splitter to form two secondary images on an sCMOS camera. A variable astigmatic lens (cylindrical lens pair) can be removed/inserted for 2D/3D imaging, while a Bertrand lens allows viewing of the objective back focal plane. Focus lock path (red): The focus lock laser is separated from emitted fluorescence by the emission dichroic mirror, focused to the objective back focal plane and launched obliquely to return under the TIRF condition allowing axial drift of the coverslip relative to the objective lens to be measured via a quadrant photodiode and corrected via the control loop of the piezo flexure stage mounting the objective. B) For clarity the multi-mode laser illumination path (orange) has been shown separately but all modules are co-compatible. A magnified image of the tip of a square core multimode fiber (coupled to a multimode laser engine) is produced and re-imaged onto the sample via a tube lens in a retrofocus arrangement and the objective lens. The multi-mode laser is coupled into the microscope by translation of the motorized mirror (HILO/TIRF) fully out of the beam path</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190118-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The fully assembled inverted microscope body.</title><p>Top/left: The microscope body with covers installed for laser safety and to aid thermal stability.

The second steering mirror is on a manually adjustable translation stage to offset the beam at the BFP to achieve the condition for total internal reflection at the coverslip sample interface (for oil objectives) or to optimize for Fresnel reflections (for silicone oil objective lenses). The returned beam is picked off by a D-shaped mirror and captured on a quadrant photodiode (QPD). The QPD measures focal drift as a positional offset of the returned beam and sends a corrective signal to the objective lens piezo flexure stage accordingly. Mounting the QPD on a motorized stage allows refocusing during focus lock operation by translating the QPD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190118-f006"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>3D calibration of the microscope based on fluorescent bead z-stacks.</title><p>The SMAP GUI with default parameters and examples of the results window for a suitable bead calibration.
