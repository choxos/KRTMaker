This intricate organization generates a myriad of electrophysiological signatures. While specific aspects of these activity patterns have been explored, a comprehensive understanding of the hippocampal layer-embedded dynamics remains elusive. Here, we developed a low-dimensional manifold to capture electrophysiological patterns, mapping their anatomical trajectory along the CA1-to-DG axis, and distinguishing layers based on sharp-wave and theta profiles. This profiling led to the characterization of selective theta-nested gamma signatures for each layer. It further revealed spike patterns associated with gamma rhythms, which highlight specific firing motifs between principal cells and interneurons, and differential firing properties within pyramidal sub-layers. These findings support a holistic understanding of the spatio-temporal activity patterns across hippocampal layers for unraveling the network operations that drive memory-guided behavior.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The hippocampus is a neural network at the nexus of the brain circuitry dedicated to processing mnemonic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). The culmination of the vast computations within this network is embodied in the diverse firing patterns of the CA1 pyramidal cell ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>). This output, shaped by numerous inputs from both inside and outside the hippocampus, is further refined by local processes to guide memory-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). These neural inputs exhibit an orderly arrangement along the somato-dendritic axis of CA1 principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Spruston, 2008</xref>). The structured radial organization across the distinct anatomical layers of the hippocampus results in multiple electrophysiological patterns, observable in the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded along that axis. Reaching a comprehensive understanding of these network activity signatures would shed light on the intricately woven spatio-temporal processes that dynamically support the pivotal contribution of the hippocampus to memory and behavior.</p><p id="P3">The hippocampal network patterns are behavioral state-dependent and grounded in cellular processes. During sleep and immobility periods, prominent phenomena include the sharp-wave ripple (SWR) complex in the <italic>Cornu Ammonis</italic> (CA) and dentate spikes in the dentate gyrus (DG). Dentate spikes represent intermittent, large amplitude events that are recorded in the LFPs of the DG granule cell layer and associated with entorhinal cortex inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bragin et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penttonen et al., 1997</xref>). SWRs arise from a current sink in the CA1 radiatum layer (the sharp-wave) caused by CA3 inputs, which culminates in brief high-frequency (100 – 250 Hz) oscillations (ripples) within the CA1 pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Csicsvari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Ylinen et al., 1995</xref>). Deciphering the neural mechanisms behind these phenomena has generated a wealth of research, notably elucidating the role of SWRs in offline memory stabilization and awake learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van de Ven et al., 2016</xref>). During active exploration periods, the hippocampus predominantly exhibits theta (5 – 12 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Vanderwolf, 1969</xref>). This rhythm not only coordinates multiple hippocampal circuits but also orchestrates their interaction with extrahippocampal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hyman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>). A prominent feature of the theta rhythm is its nested gamma oscillations (25 – 150 Hz), a set of diverse, rapid oscillatory bursts that reflect the activity of distinct neural circuits and pathways across the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bragin et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tort et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these distinct network patterns provide a nuanced lens into the versatile functional dynamics of the hippocampus across varying behavioral states.</p><p id="P4">In this study, to explore the temporal architecture of hippocampal layer-related network activity, we developed a low-dimensional feature manifold embedding electrophysiological patterns recorded in freely behaving mice. We demonstrate that individual LFP signals along the CA1-to-DG axis carry sufficient information within their theta and sharp-wave profiles to discern the radially organized hippocampal layers. Furthermore, we observe that each discerned layer displays a distinct theta-nested gamma profile, underscoring the coexistence of multiple gamma oscillations within the hippocampus. We analyze the relationships between these gamma oscillations and the firing patterns of CA1 principal cells and interneurons, uncovering distinct firing motifs associated with gamma rhythms. Leveraging our LFP-embedded manifold, we further categorize CA1 principal cells into deep and superficial pyramidal sub-layer subpopulations, showing differences in their firing properties. Altogether, these results reveal the complex temporal architecture of hippocampal layer-related activity dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identifying individual hippocampal layers along the CA1-to-DG axis</title><p id="P5">We first tested whether electrophysiological patterns of the LFPs could distinguish between the radially organized anatomical layers from CA1 to DG in the dorsal hippocampus. For this, we implanted linear silicon probes in six mice along the somato-dendritic axis of CA1 principal cells, extending up to the first DG blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This configuration provided simultaneous LFP recordings across the hippocampal layers as mice explored open fields and underwent sleep/rest periods. From these recordings, we examined network activity patterns within each recording channel and their cross-channel interactions, including CSD analyses. We used three electrophysiological patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>): theta oscillations (5 – 12 Hz) prevalent during exploratory behavior, as well as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs; 100 – 250 Hz) and dentate spikes (DS1 and DS2), both observed during sleep/rest. We determined the CA1 pyramidal cell layer channel as the one with the highest ripple power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The radiatum layer channel was identified as the one exhibiting the strongest current sink coinciding with the peak of ripple amplitude in the CA1 pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Buzsáki et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Karalis and Sirota, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Ylinen et al., 1995</xref>). The hippocampal fissure channel was marked by the highest theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Buzsáki et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Gerbrandt and Fowler, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Green and Rawlins, 1979</xref>), while the lacunosum-moleculare channel was identified as being 40–50 μm above the fissure. The outer and mid-molecular layers of the DG corresponded to channels with the deepest current sinks for DS1 and DS2 events, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bragin et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Karalis and Sirota, 2022</xref>). We recognized the inner molecular layer by the secondary current sink associated with the radiatum sharp-wave event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Karalis and Sirota, 2022</xref>). The DG granular layer channel was determined from the strongest current source of DS beneath the molecular layer channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bragin et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Karalis and Sirota, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penttonen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>). Thus, we used electrophysiological patterns to map the distinct hippocampal layers along the radial CA1-to-DG axis. These tempo-spatial patterns were consistent across mice and silicon probe layouts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The layer assignment above benefited from linear silicon probes that enabled simultaneous recordings from uniformly spaced channels along the CA1-DG axis. Next, we sought to determine how much information for layer assignment could be drawn only from the theta phase reversal and changes in the sharp-wave waveform on a per-channel basis. For this, we employed ISOMAP embedding to represent data from both theta and sharp-wave waveforms across hippocampal layers and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) into a 2-dimensional feature space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). This dimensionality reduction method revealed that channels recording from the same hippocampal layer tend to form separate clusters from those of other layers. Additionally, the derived feature trajectory naturally connected anatomically adjacent layers, even without explicitly feeding this layer adjacency information into the manifold embedding.</p><p id="P7">To further assess the electrophysiological distinguishability of hippocampal layers, we employed nearest neighbor and nearest centroid-based classifiers, training them to recognize each individual layer from its feature components, using a leave-one-out cross-validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). For the pyramidal, radiatum, mid molecular, and granular layers, this approach achieved optimal classification with both classifiers. The inner molecular layer achieved near-optimal classification. While the lacunosum-moleculare layer, hippocampal fissure, and outer molecular layer could be effectively differentiated from all other layers, splitting this group of three coalescing layers was not possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; top panels). To quantify how much layer-specific information can be obtained from the feature manifold, we measured the Shannon information between actual and predicted layers by the classifiers. These values significantly exceeded those from control sets with shuffled labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; bottom panels). Together, these findings demonstrate that LFP-based features can discern different anatomical layers spanning the hippocampal CA1-DG axis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Laminar profile of CA1-DG theta-nested gamma oscillations</title><p id="P8">Theta oscillations influence broad brain networks, while hippocampal gamma oscillations are believed to relate to finer-grained neural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, analyzing gamma patterns across layers could aid reaching a comprehensive understanding of the intricate local dynamics and functional microarchitecture of the hippocampus network. Accordingly, we generated theta-gamma profiles for each layer identified in our LFP manifold embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), using two evaluations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). First, we gauged the amplitude of individual frequencies within the gamma range using the theta rhythm from the CA1 pyramidal layer as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; left panel for each layer). This allowed comparing amplitudes of gamma frequencies within each layer. Second, we normalized the amplitude of each frequency by its minimum value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; right panel for each layer). This rendered a perspective on the amplitude modulation of various gamma oscillations in relation to the theta phase, regardless of their individual magnitudes.</p><p id="P9">In CA1, we found mid gamma (range: ∼50 – 90 Hz) oscillations across all layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), with the maximum amplitude occurring just after the CA1 pyramidal layer theta peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). The pyramidal layer was characterized by a fast gamma oscillation (range: ∼100 – 250 Hz) that increased at the theta trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). The radiatum layer featured a slow gamma component at the descending phase of theta, near the trough (range: ∼25 – 45 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>), along with a slightly slower fast gamma than that in the pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). The lacunosum-moleculare layer showed mid gamma oscillations, without clear slow or fast gamma components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings were reproducible across mice with different silicon probe implants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In the DG, two distinct fast gamma components emerged. The first was evident in the mid-molecular layer, emerging just after the CA1 pyramidal theta trough; while the second was localized to the granular layer, just prior to the CA1 pyramidal theta trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). The granular layer also displayed a slow gamma component that was aligned with the slow gamma observed in the radiatum layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Like CA1, all DG layers displayed mid gamma oscillations. Additionally, a beta component (range: ∼18 – 35 Hz) was observed in mid-molecular layer channels, peaking post the CA1 pyramidal theta peak, coinciding in theta phase with mid gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). This beta component occupies the lower gamma frequencies but was distinct from the slow gamma oscillations. While the slow gamma oscillations partially overlap with the beta range, they distinctly emerge in the radiatum, with their amplitude achieving a maximum near the pyramidal theta trough.</p><p id="P12">Assigning a precise frequency range for gamma oscillations is challenging. This issue is heightened for fast gamma oscillations, which exhibit significantly lower amplitudes than mid gamma oscillations and can therefore be overshadowed in non-normalized spectrograms. On the other hand, normalized spectrograms may distort the frequency range of overlapping gamma components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). To circumvent this, we identified bursts of filtered LFP signals within their corresponding bands and calculated the average broadband LFP spectrograms centered around the maximum amplitude of these bursts (see Methods). This indicated a frequency peak of ∼31 Hz for slow gamma in the radiatum, and ∼35 Hz in the granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; left panel). Mid gamma displayed a main frequency of ∼68 Hz across all layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; mid panel). Fast gamma oscillations exhibited a peak frequency of ∼130 Hz in the pyramidal layer, and ∼120 Hz in the radiatum, molecular layer, and granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; right panel).</p><p id="P13">In sum, these observations obtained from the signals recorded using linear silicon probes consistently revealed slow gamma oscillations in the radiatum and granular layers, as well as a widespread mid-gamma component across all CA1-to-DG layers and mice. Notably, this layer profiling also suggested the existence of four fast gamma components across the pyramidal, radiatum, mid molecular, and granular layers. Finally, the consistency observed in the gamma profiles across mice provides important cross-validation to the hippocampal layer delineation, as gamma oscillations were not utilized in the LFP feature manifold.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Laminar signatures retrieved in independently moveable tetrode recordings</title><p id="P14">To assess the generalizability of the obtained hippocampal activity layer profiling across mice and recording techniques, we employed the manifold analysis to guide tetrode placement in additional mice implanted with independently moveable tetrodes. For each recording, we lowered tetrodes individually in a stepwise manner, acquiring their signals at each step while maintaining one tetrode in the pyramidal layer as a reference channel for ripple power peak and theta phase. Subsequent histological evaluation validated the accuracy of the manifold-derived predictions. Notably, tetrodes identified in the radiatum, lacunosum-moleculare, mid molecular, and granular regions indeed corresponded to their respective anatomical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Further, we found that these (manifold-positioned and anatomically confirmed) tetrodes displayed gamma signatures consistent with those obtained in the corresponding layers from silicon probe recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, fast gamma oscillations were consistently observed in the pyramidal, radiatum, and mid molecular layers, occurring just after the pyramidal theta trough. In the granular layer, they preceded the pyramidal theta trough. Importantly, the radiatum fast gamma was more prominent below the “center” of this layer manifold coordinate, that is in a distal part of this layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Slow gamma components were also consistently present in the radiatum and granular layer channels with tetrodes, as they were with silicon probes. A beta component was also primarily found in the molecular layer channels. Mid gamma oscillations were also observed across all layers with tetrodes, as with silicon probes. These findings support the presence of distinct theta-gamma profiles locally in each of hippocampal layers individually recorded in the tetrode dataset, in line with the laminar recordings of the silicon probe dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Differential spiking correlates of layer-defined gamma oscillations</title><p id="P15">Gamma oscillations are thought to represent excitatory postsynaptic potentials influencing local spiking activity. Investigating the temporal interplay between neuronal spiking and gamma oscillations offers a window into their foundational circuit mechanisms and significance. In line with this, we observed a strong relationship between the phase of gamma oscillations and the timing of CA1 spikes in both principal cells and interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Aligning the activity of both cell populations by a single trough of radiatum slow gamma per theta cycle showed clear slow gamma-paced spiking spanning at least 5 cycles in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). Furthermore, the mean phase for both CA1 principal cells and interneurons was consistent at the radiatum slow gamma troughs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The same analysis applied to mid gamma oscillations recorded in the lacunosum-moleculare layer revealed 3 cycles of mid gamma-paced modulation in the spiking activity of CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">E</xref>). We however noted that while CA1 principal cells consistently fired preferentially around lacunosum-moleculare mid gamma ascending phase, interneurons displayed varied firing phases from the mid gamma trough to its peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We subsequently analyzed the modulation of CA1 cell spikes by fast gamma oscillations recorded either from the pyramidal layer or the distal radiatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G-I</xref>). Using gamma trough-triggered averages for each layer-specific fast gamma, we discerned 2 to 3 cycles of fast gamma modulation in the spiking activity of CA1 principal cells and interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>; left and middle columns). These findings provide evidence that genuine oscillations at this higher frequency exist in the hippocampus, beyond any potential contamination from spike-leakage artifacts. To draw a comparison, we repeated the same analysis for ripples oscillations, which share a similar frequency range as fast gammas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>; right column). We found that aligning the spiking activity of both principal cells and interneurons to a single ripple trough per SWR event revealed at least 4 ripple cycles. Regarding the average firing phase, CA1 units consistently preferred the onset of the ascending phase of pyramidal fast gamma troughs, with principal cells notably preceding interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>; left panel). This temporally structured firing relationship with pyramidal fast gamma closely resembled that observed for ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>; right panel). Conversely, we observed an opposite spike timing relationship in radiatum fast gamma oscillations, with the firing of CA1 interneurons recorded in the pyramidal layer occurring at earlier phase compared to principal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>; mid panel). This pointed to different generating mechanisms for the two CA1 (pyramidal versus radiatum) fast gamma oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Profiling deep versus superficial CA1 pyramidal sub-layers</title><p id="P17">Recent studies have highlighted differences in the firing characteristics of CA1 principal cells within the radial axis of the pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Navas-Olive et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Valero and de la Prida, 2018</xref>). We thus examined whether our feature manifold approach offered the resolution necessary to discern sub-populations of (tetrode-recorded) principal cells within the pyramidal layer. The gradual shift of the sharp-wave waveform recorded along the pyramidal layer radial axis with silicon probes provided the foundation for this estimation. Specifically, the waveform started as a positive deflection near the oriens layer, subtly shifting to a minor negative deflection in the pyramidal layer, before becoming the distinct negative sharp-wave in the radiatum layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). By then projecting each tetrode signal onto the manifold, we obtained a bimodal distribution of estimated depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; left panel). This bimodal organization reflected that even minor adjustments in tetrode positioning around the polarity inversion point of the sharp-wave resulted in pronounced shifts in the manifold feature space, producing a gap in the projection distribution. Consistent with the silicon probe recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), the tetrodes localized in the pyramidal layer closer to the radiatum layer exhibited a stronger theta-nested slow gamma component than those localized near the oriens layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; right panels). In fact, we found a strong relationship between the amplitude of the sharp-wave and the intensity of theta-nested slow gamma across recording channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>; Spearman correlation = 0.53, p &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>), while no such correlation was observed with mid gamma intensity (Spearman correlation = 0.027, p = 0.46).</p><p id="P18">Next, we categorized CA1 pyramidal cells into deep and superficial by applying a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model classifier to their estimated depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). During awake theta oscillations, deep pyramidal sub-layer cells significantly fired at a higher rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; 2.56 spikes/sec, 99% CI: 2.43 – 2.69) compared to superficial sub-layer cells (2.24 spikes/sec, 99% CI: 2.11 – 2.37; p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup> for both bootstrap and permutation tests). During SWR events in sleep/rest (analyzed using a 10-ms window centered at the ripple power peak), superficial cells fired significantly more frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; 19.90 spikes/sec, 99% CI: 18.96 – 20.88) than deep cells (13.62 spikes/sec, 99% CI: 13.13 – 14.14; p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup> from both bootstrap and permutation tests). The mean theta firing phases also distinguished the two pyramidal sub-layer cell groups. Specifically, spikes from deep principal cells exhibited an earlier mean theta phase relative to superficial cell spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup> for both bootstrap and permutation tests). When assessing spike-to-theta phase coherence, superficial cells exhibited a more pronounced coupling than deep cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup> for both bootstrap and permutation tests). This difference in coherence stemmed from deep pyramidal sub-layer cells firing proportionally more spikes around the theta peak compared to superficial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), nudging their mean phase closer to the peak, and resulting in diminished modulation depth.</p><p id="P19">Given that low and high firing rate CA1 principal cells are hypothesized to exhibit different properties and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gava et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016</xref>), it remained plausible that the observed disparities in mean theta phase and coherence in fact arose from firing rate differences rather than anatomical positioning. To clarify this, we performed an additional analysis, subsampling from both deep and superficial cells to match their firing rate distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). This further supported the fact that the variations in mean theta phase and coherence stemmed from differences in CA1 radial location. Specifically, superficial cells had a later mean theta phase than deep cells (mean phase difference = 7.42 degrees; 99% CI: 6.26 – 8.56 degrees, p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>). Similarly, superficial cells were more coupled to the theta phase (mean vector length difference = 0.029; 99% CI: 0.026 – 0.033, p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>).</p><p id="P20">We further examined the coupling levels between gamma oscillations and pyramidal sub-layer cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Understanding the cellular operations and substrates of this brain network is essential for understanding how it supports memory formation, storage, and retrieval. By placing electrodes in the different circuits composing this network, we can capture a myriad of electrophysiological patterns, which reflect not only the activation of these individual circuits but also their dynamic interactions. Thus, through the identification and comprehension of these network activity patterns, we gain important insights into the underlying cellular mechanisms of their corresponding circuits and, ultimately, their contribution to memory.</p><p id="P22">In this context, we provide a detailed characterization of the diverse electrophysiological patterns along the CA1-DG axis. Using the theta phase reversal and the sharp-wave waveform, we crafted a feature manifold that maps the multiple layers of the hippocampal network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We observed that these layers present distinct theta-gamma profiles, delineating their unique electrophysiological hallmarks. Importantly, this laminar profiling is consistent across different mice and recording techniques. We propose that such an approach is adaptable to other layered brain regions and different across animal species.

When CA3 terminals in CA1 are optogenetically suppressed, slow gamma power is reduced while mid gamma oscillations remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">El-Gaby et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, activating dorsal CA3 parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, which curtails CA3 principal cell spiking output, also leads to a significant decrease in slow gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aery Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">López-Madrona et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, we highlight the pronounced presence of slow gamma oscillations in the radiatum layer of CA1. While these oscillations can be detected in the pyramidal layer, they are mainly evident in the pyramidal sub-layer proximal to the radiatum, corresponding to channels that display a negative sharp-wave. The slow gamma observed in the pyramidal layer is presumably propagated through volume conduction from the radiatum layer. The dense cellular structure of the pyramidal layer likely acts as a physical barrier, constraining the spread of this oscillation towards the oriens layer. In the lacunosum-moleculare layer, though slow gamma can be observed, it is often overshadowed within its average theta cycle by the more dominant mid gamma oscillations in that layer.</p><p id="P24">Mid gamma oscillations are proposed to originate from the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>), which is the main CA1 target of entorhinal cortex layer 3 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Desmond et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Van Groen et al., 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, we detected mid gamma activity in more remote layers like the oriens. While volume conduction might account for the detection of oscillations far from their source, slow gamma oscillations emanating from the radiatum layer are not clearly seen in the other side of the pyramidal layer. In addition, despite the potential low pass filtering of currents from the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells as they travel to the soma, the spiking of these cells was still clearly modulated by this rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This probably arises from mid gamma-paced inputs from the entorhinal cortex to CA1 activating interneurons in the radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014</xref>). By resonating with the mid gamma rhythm, a particular set of specialized interneurons could then modulate the firing patterns of pyramidal cells, fostering synchronicity between their activity and mid gamma-associated inputs. While these interneurons play a pivotal role, it is also worth noting that other cell types may have a different impact. For instance, a recent study suggested that neurogliaform cells in lacunosum-moleculare can decouple cortical gamma inputs and CA1 pyramidal cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sakalar et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P25">CA1 fast gamma oscillations are primarily contained within the CA1 pyramidal layer, likely reflecting interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2014</xref>). Although concerns regarding contamination from spike waveform leakage have been substantiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2013</xref>), our prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>) and current observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) demonstrate genuine rhythmicity, as observed when aligning spike trains of CA1 neurons to a single fast gamma trough per theta cycle. This underscores that despite potential spike-leakage contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>), pyramidal fast gamma oscillations remain authentic neural rhythms. We further provide findings suggesting that CA1 pyramidal fast gamma oscillations could arise from a pyramidal-interneuron network gamma (PING) circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Whittington et al., 2000</xref>). Within this framework, pyramidal cells activate local interneurons, which then inhibit the activity of the pyramidal cell population through lateral inhibition. Once the inhibition wears off, and if the excitatory drive into the pyramidal cells persists, these cells re-initiate firing, thus beginning a new cycle. We note that this model could similarly account for the ripple oscillations within the same neuronal population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). We therefore propose that the most parsimonious explanation is that CA1 pyramidal fast gamma and ripples arise from the same cellular foundation. The distinguishing factor would be the initiating drive: pyramidal fast gamma would be triggered by a theta-associated drive, while ripples are spurred by sharp-wave related inputs. Additionally, optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal cells can activate this oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the timing relationship between pyramidal cells and interneurons associated to the radiatum fast gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) cannot be explained by the same mechanism. Instead, this rhythm likely stems from feedforward inputs directed to the radiatum and/or lacunosum-moleculare layers.</p><p id="P26">Fast gamma oscillations in the DG have been documented in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>) and have been identified as distinct from CA1 fast gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2017</xref>). In our current work, we build from these findings by distinguishing two fast gamma oscillations within the DG. One is more pronounced in the molecular layer, while the other is dominant in the granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Earlier studies also identified slow gamma oscillations in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2017</xref>). Given their theta phase relationship (mirroring CA1 radiatum slow gamma), and the pronounced entrainment of DG cells by CA1 slow gamma oscillations (even more so than CA1 cells), it is postulated that both might share a common oscillatory source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2017</xref>). One possibility is that these oscillations initiate in the DG, are transmitted to CA3, and subsequently manifest in CA1 radiatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bragin et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2017</xref>). Alternatively, a potential source of slow gamma oscillations might be outside the hippocampus, possibly within the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Király et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, Fernandez-Ruiz et al (2021) recently suggested that DG slow gamma might originate from inputs of the lateral entorhinal cortex layer 2.

We replicated findings from prior studies using silicon probe recordings, thereby possessing a ground truth for the relative positioning of recorded cells. Specifically, we observed that during awake periods of exploratory behavior, CA1 principal cells in the deep pyramidal sub-layer are more active in theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>), whereas those in the superficial sub-layer are more active in SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). The rate difference in SWRs aligns with <italic>in vivo</italic> patch-clamp studies which indicate that superficial cells experience a heightened excitatory drive during SWR events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Valero et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">2015</xref>). These consistent observations further validate our LFP-based depth estimation approach. Moreover, we observed that superficial pyramidal sub-layer cells have a more pronounced coupling to the theta phase than their deep counterparts. Conversely, deep cells demonstrated an average heightened synchrony with both ripples and gamma oscillations. Notably, the sole exception was slow gamma, where both principal cell subpopulations exhibited comparable synchrony. These firing properties likely arise from the fact that local fast spiking interneurons exert stronger control in deep principal cells than in superficial ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The heightened response of superficial cells to CA3 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Valero et al., 2015</xref>) might account for their equivalent modulation with deep cells for slow gamma. It is also possible that deep cells are more responsive to gamma-associated currents. This pronounced response to gamma currents may divert deep cells from the primary sway of theta rhythms, leading them to discharge proportionally more spikes outside their preferred theta phase. Crucially, these findings are not attributable to rate differences between the two principal cell subpopulations. Thus, they are more likely tied to cell radial location within distinct sub-layers, rather than a simple disparity between highly active versus less active cells. The distinction between deep and superficial cells within the CA1 pyramidal layer is now emerging as a critical factor in hippocampal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>).

These rhythms manifest in distinct layers of the CA1-DG axis and relate differently to the theta cycle. Particularly, the two fast gamma oscillations in CA1 — one in the pyramidal layer and the other deep in radiatum — reveal different timing relationships between pyramidal cells and interneurons. We also observed a beta component, which sits within the slower range of the broad gamma band. Past studies have defined slow (or low) gamma as the oscillation associated with CA3-to-CA1 inputs, most prominent during the descending phase of theta and linked to the CA1 radiatum layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; Bragin et al., 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lasztóczi &amp; Klausberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>).

For example, hippocampal CA1 “slow gamma” might be more aptly termed “CA3-to-CA1 gamma”, thereby emphasizing its anatomical and functional basis over its frequency band. Similarly, CA1 pyramidal layer “fast gamma” would be more appropriately named CA1 “perisomatic gamma” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014</xref>). Such a framework implies that if a hippocampal gamma oscillation in another species has the same cellular foundation, it would then be recognized as the same oscillation even if it has a different frequency band. Conversely, a signal with a similar frequency band but recorded in another brain region, such as the visual cortex, would not be regarded as equivalent. Adopting this circuit-based approach would minimize potential confusions while emphasizing the physiological significance of brain rhythms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals</title><p id="P31">These experiments used 32 adult mice (4–6 months old; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

For tetrode recordings, the tetrodes were individually moved from their original post-surgery location to the CA1 pyramidal layer, which could be distinctly identified by the pronounced presence of SWR events. Before beginning the recordings each day, the position of the tetrodes was fine-tuned to optimize both the clarity and the number of spike waveforms, based on visual assessment. Moreover, tetrodes targeting layers ventral from the CA1 pyramidal layer, or the dentate gyrus were moved downwards until they reached their intended target (see <italic>Tetrode feature-based placement</italic> section for details).

Initially, LFPs from the dentate gyrus region were subtracted using a reference channel located at the top of the probe, typically positioned in the cortex or high in the oriens/alveus region. After this subtraction, the differential signal underwent filtering within a frequency range of 1-200 Hz using a 4<sup>th</sup>-order Butterworth filter. Peaks in this filtered differential signal that surpassed a threshold, set at seven times the median absolute value, were identified as candidate dentate spike events. To ensure the removal of high-amplitude artifacts, any candidates with peaks exceeding a threshold—defined as the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the peak distribution added to 20 times its interquartile range—were excluded. This detection procedure was applied to channels within the dentate gyrus region, determined through visual inspection, and events from these channels were then combined. If multiple events were detected within a 50ms window, only the event with the highest peak was retained. To categorize dentate spikes into DS1 and DS2 types, we analyzed the CSDs of each event, computing the CSD at its peak from the pyramidal layer channel to the final dentate gyrus channel. We then employed Principal Component Analysis on these CSD vectors, projecting each individual CSD onto the first principal component. Classification was then achieved using a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In recordings that covered the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus, this method consistently identified two distinct CSD patterns, each with primary sinks located at different points within the dentate gyrus channels. The DS1 group was characterized by its primary sink situated closer to CA1, while the DS2 group had its main sink nearer to the hilus. If the GMM-defined classes showcased identical primary sinks, we labeled all dentate spike events as DS1. This designation indicated that the recordings lacked a granular layer channel.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>LFP feature manifold</title><p id="P49">We used the silicon probe recording dataset to construct the LFP feature manifold. For each mouse, we computed the sharp-wave and theta waveforms from each recording channel, thus extending from the CA1 pyramidal layer to the DG granular layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). These waveforms represent the average raw LFP signals for each of these individual channels, centered around either the ripple power peaks or the theta descending zero-crossings. The length of these triggered averages was 500 ms for sharp-waves and 150 ms for theta. For uniformity across mice, we sampled channels at 50 μm steps (40 μm for mice with 20 μm-spaced channels; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Each waveform was then z-scored individually to focus this analysis on the waveform shapes and not the relative amplitudes across channels. We next extracted the first four principal components from these waveforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Using these principal component projections, the manifold was then computed employing the Isomap method from the manifold submodule of sklearn (version 1.3; with parameters n_neighbors = 15 and n_components = 2). We next obtained a trajectory that connects layer centers as follows. To enhance resolution between distantly situated clusters in the feature space (e.g., between radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare), we incorporated intermediate points prior to interpolation. The number of intermediate points between successive layer pairs was determined by dividing the distance between points in the 2-D feature space by 20. With this derived count, we selected an equivalent number of equidistant channels in the real anatomical space for each mouse. Subsequently, we calculated the average for each control point (layer coordinates and intermediate points) across all the mice. The final trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, black trace; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>, right panel) was determined by quadratic interpolating these average control points.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Classification of layers from manifold projections</title><p id="P50">We evaluated the separability of the layers within the feature manifold using cross-validated classification. Leveraging a leave-one-out methodology, each classifier was trained on all available data points except one, which was subsequently used for testing. It is worth noting that each mouse contributed a single layer channel; hence, the classifiers primarily decoded the layer data based on datasets from other mice. We utilized both the k-neighbors classifier (parameters: weights=‘uniform’, algorithm=‘auto’, and k=4) and the nearest centroid classifier (using metric=‘euclidean’ and shrink_threshold=None). Both classifiers were obtained from the ‘neighbors’ submodule of sklearn (version 1.3.0). The choice of k=4 for the k-neighbors classifier corresponds to the smallest sample size across layers.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Supra-theta wavelet spectrograms</title><p id="P51">Spectrograms were generated using the complex Morlet Wavelet Transform technique. For this analysis, we selected a range of 24 log-spaced frequencies, spanning from 18 Hz to 310 Hz unless stated otherwise. We applied L1 normalization to each wavelet kernel. In L1 normalization, the sum of the absolute values of the elements in a vector is ensured to equal 1. This ensures that the wavelet does not amplify or attenuate the amplitude of individual frequency components.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Gamma filtering and instantaneous phase and amplitude</title><p id="P52">For amplitude or phase analyses of specific gamma oscillations in this study, we filtered the LFP signals within the relevant bands using a 4<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth filter. The bands were defined by the following cutoff frequencies: 20-45Hz for slow gamma, 50-100Hz for mid gamma, and 100-250Hz for fast gammas. We then determined the instantaneous amplitude and phase using the Hilbert transform.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>ICA-based extraction of fast gamma oscillations</title><p id="P53">Isolating fast gamma oscillations poses a challenge due to their relatively low amplitude, especially in tetrodes that exhibit higher amplitude mid gamma oscillations. Any overlap with mid gamma oscillations can contaminate the signal filtered for the fast gamma range, given the comparable magnitude of the high-frequency tail of the mid gamma spectrum and the fast gamma oscillation itself. To address this, we adopted an ICA-based method inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fernández-Ruiz &amp; Herreras (2013)</xref>. This approach leverages spatial data from silicon probe recordings to differentiate fast gamma from mid gamma oscillations. Specifically, ICA was applied to LFP traces extending 200 μm around a targeted channel with fast gamma interest (e.g., pyramidal, distal radiatum, mid moleculare, or granular layer), and we extracted independent components with peak frequencies above 100Hz. We used the amplitude of such signals for the fast gammas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Determination of gamma main frequencies</title><p id="P54">To discern the primary frequency components of each gamma oscillation, we first pinpointed the strongest bursts within the theta cycles by computing the envelope peaks for the appropriate gamma band during individual cycles, retaining only the top quartile of these peaks. Using these peaks, we generated the mean spectra by averaging wavelet spectrograms within a 40-ms window centered on the burst peaks. Before averaging across mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), we normalized the triggered average spectrogram of each individual mice for its overall standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Tetrode feature-based placement</title><p id="P55">To target layers below pyramidal CA1 with tetrodes, we implemented a stepwise, gradual lowering approach.

We ensured that tetrodes were adjusted by no more than ∼60μm in a 20-minute interval. Once a tetrode reached its target layer, we allowed a 90-min break before starting the recordings.</p><p id="P56">Regarding the tetrode data analysis on spike correlations with specific gamma oscillations, we performed the analysis within the appropriate layer for the given rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Slow gamma was consistently assessed from radiatum channels, while mid gamma was derived from lacunosum-moleculare channels. In contrast, fast gammas were measured from their respective local layers.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Spike detection and unit isolation</title><p id="P57">Spike sorting and unit isolation were performed with an automated clustering pipeline using Kilosort via the SpikeForest framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Magland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). To KiloSort data acquired using tetrodes, the algorithm restricted templates to channels within a given tetrode bundle, while masking all other recording channels. The resulting clusters were verified by the operator using cross-channel spike waveforms, auto-correlation histograms, and cross-correlation histograms. Each unit used for analyses showed throughout the entire recording day stable spike waveforms.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Principal cell versus interneuron classification</title><p id="P58">To evaluate the waveform consistency for each unit, we focused on the waveform with the maximum amplitude across the tetrode channels for each cluster. Our primary aim was to compare the prominence of a unit mean waveform amplitude to the standard deviation stemming from all its spikes. This waveform score was defined as:<disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P59">where <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> is the value of the mean waveform at sample <italic>I</italic>, <italic>σ<sub>i</sub></italic> is the standard deviation at sample <italic>i</italic> across all spikes, and n is the number of waveform samples (in this context, n=32). This metric essentially quantifies the relative magnitude of the mean waveform amplitude against the spike-to-spike variability. Clusters presenting a waveform score below 0.75 or spike trains with a refractory period violation exceeding 2% (quantified as the proportion of intervals shorter than 2 ms in the ISI distribution) were categorized as multi-units and excluded from subsequent analyses. Additionally, clusters displaying positive spikes were also disregarded, as these could potentially originate from non-somatic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Someck et al., 2023</xref>). Only the units that passed these criteria were considered well isolated and included in further analyses.</p><p id="P60">Finally, we categorized units as either putative interneurons or pyramidal cells, relying on the width of their waveform as indicated by the trough-to-peak latency. To achieve a finer resolution, we increased the 32 waveform points sampled at 20kHz by a factor of 100, utilizing quadratic interpolation (employing the interpolate function from scipy). In a prior dataset of ∼4,000 well-isolated neurons, we noted a bimodal distribution in trough-to-peak latency. Fitting this with a 1-dimensional, 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from sklearn, we set the classification threshold where the two Gaussian components intersect. Using this threshold on our current dataset, units with latencies above were labeled as putative pyramidal cells, and those below as putative interneurons. In total this study included 3,012 principal cells and 546 interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Gamma and ripple trough triggered averages</title><p id="P61">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, we computed the mean spiking activity or LFP signals centered around the most prominent troughs of the targeted gamma rhythm or ripples. We began by filtering the LFP signals from the specific layer within the relevant frequency range as mentioned above. For gamma oscillations, the most profound trough within each theta cycle was identified and we used only the top quartile in terms of amplitude for the triggered-average analyses. By aligning data (spike trains or LFP signals) to one distinct gamma trough within each theta cycle, we can accurately depict the gamma rhythmicity. This method gives clarity on the existence and sequence of following gamma cycles, all referenced from that single trough. Similarly, for ripple triggered averages, we filtered pyramidal LFPs within 100-250Hz and used the deepest trough of ripples for each SWR event.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Spike to phase coherence analysis</title><p id="P62">Theta oscillations are asymmetrical (non-linear), resulting in an uneven distribution of phases. In recordings from the pyramidal layer, the rising phase is shorter than the falling phase, leading to a predominance of the latter in the recordings. This disparity can skew coherence analyses, showing an artificial increase in spikes associated with the longer, falling phase of the theta oscillations. To correct this, we normalized the spike-phase coherence against the likelihood of a spike occurring in each theta phase bin. This was done by dividing the distribution of theta phases associated with neuron spikes by the overarching theta phase distribution. These distributions were represented as histograms with 64 equally spaced phase bins. The spike-to-phase coherence was quantified using the mean vector length, with each phase bin center weighted by its assigned probability. This approach was also applied to ripples. For gamma phase coherence, the methodology mirrored the theta analysis, but with a modification due to the transient nature of gamma oscillations. We introduced a threshold based on the gamma envelope, considering only the spikes and gamma phases where the gamma envelope surpassed its 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. This precaution ensured our data was sourced from periods with a genuine gamma presence in the signal.</p><p id="P63">For a given oscillation, we restricted phase coherence analysis to units that recorded at least 250 spikes coincident with that oscillation, following the criteria outlined above. To assess its significance, we employed a spike shift control. For each neuron, we shifted spikes to random time points, ensuring the original theta phase and gamma amplitude were preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). We repeated this surrogate process to obtain a null hypothesis distribution with 10,000 surrogate values. The p-value for each neuron was then calculated based on the proportion of surrogate values that matched or exceeded the actual coherence value, indicating the likelihood of such an observation occurring by chance. Only units demonstrating significant coupling (p&lt;0.01) had their mean phases estimated.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Classification of deep and superficial principal cells</title><p id="P64">In the analyses depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, we distinguished principal cells as either deep or superficial based on the LFP features of the tetrodes from which neuronal activity was recorded. The categorization relied on the linearized projection of these features to the feature manifold (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). Notably, the distribution of these projections across our dataset was distinctly bimodal. To model this, we applied a 1-dimensional, 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from sklearn. The resulting Gaussians are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> superimposed on the projection distribution. We set the classification threshold for deep versus superficial at the intersection of these Gaussian distributions, which approximately equated to 5.5.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Bootstraps and permutation tests</title><p id="P65">For analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we used permutation tests to determine the significance of differences between cell groups. The core of this method involves comparing the actual mean difference between two groups to a distribution of mean differences generated from random group assignments. As an illustration, when assessing the mean rate difference between deep and superficial cells, we randomly shuffled cell labels and stored the mean difference of these shuffled groupings. This shuffling was done 100,000 times to produce a null hypothesis distribution, representing the likelihood of observing a certain mean difference when cell group assignments are random. The p-value was then computed based on how the actual mean difference compared to this null distribution. In the bootstrap analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, we resampled data points with replacement from the original dataset. The 99% confidence intervals were derived from the 0.5<sup>th</sup> to the 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of this resampled distribution. To compute a bootstrap-based p-value, we constructed a distribution based on the differences between the resampled distributions of two groups. The p-value was then determined by the proportion of these differences that were above (or below) zero.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Anatomy</title><p id="P66">After completion of the electrophysiological recordings, mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA (150ml, 8 – 10 ml/min).
