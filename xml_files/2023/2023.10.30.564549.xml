The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered upon recognition of an apt stimulus by the sensor protein, resulting in binding to pro-caspase-1 via the adaptor protein ASC. Inflammasome activation results in the maturation of the precursor forms of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, along with caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death. Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of lipid metabolism in inflammasome activation; however, the precise mechanisms by which lipids regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome remain ambiguous. A multi-enzyme protein, fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a central regulator of lipid metabolism partaking an essential role in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway by catalysing the production of palmitic acid. Palmitic acid acts as a precursor to long-chain fatty acids and additionally regulates cellular functions by palmitoylation, a process in which palmitate is reversibly added to cysteine residues of target proteins, modifying protein localization and function. Here, we undertook a pharmacological approach to investigate the roles of fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of FASN in primary mouse and human macrophages abrogates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in blunted caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, this phenomenon relied on protein palmitoylation as <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> abrogation of palmitoylation similarly reduced NLRP3 activation, which could be restored by exogenously supplementing palmitate in cultured cells. Consequently, an acyl biotin exchange assay corroborated NLRP3 palmitoylation. Notably, activation of the dsDNA sensing AIM2 inflammasome remained unaltered when either FASN or palmitoylation was blocked. These results therefore highlight the pivotal role of FASN and palmitoylation, shedding new mechanistic insights into the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NLRP3</kwd><kwd>Inflammasome</kwd><kwd>Palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>FASN</kwd><kwd>Lipid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes which are assembled in response to infectious, endogenous, and environmental stimuli. The assembly of the inflammasome, composed of a sensor protein which is bound to pro-caspase-1 through the adaptor protein ASC, results in the cleavage of the inflammatory pro-caspase-1, which in turns results in the processing and maturation of cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their biologically active forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The mature caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin-D (GSDMD) resulting in the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD translocating to the plasma membrane where it is involved in pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The pores thus formed allow cytokines and other cellular contents to be released extracellularly resulting in an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The well-studied NLRP3 inflammasome responds to a range of stimuli and comprises a two-step mechanism in which the NLRP3 is first expressed in an NF-kB dependent manner followed by the assembly of the inflammasome upon sensing apt pathogen-associated and danger-associated molecular patterns. Dysregulated NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in a range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the ambiguity in the activation mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome has impeded the development of precise therapeutics to target this inflammasome.</p><p id="P3">The activation mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome are not completely understood. However, potassium efflux is largely accepted as a consensus event that must occur prior to NLRP3 inflammasome activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, post-translational modification of inflammasome components may further regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence over the past several years has implicated key roles for lipids in NLRP3 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, cholesterol egress from the endosome/lysosome compartment and subsequent trafficking to the ER is critical for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. While the detailed mechanism remains to be established, cholesterol may provide a conducive milieu in these organelles for efficient sensing by NLRP3. A role for cholesterol biosynthesis involving the transcription factor SREBP2 has also been reported to contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. On the contrary, the roles of SREBP1, the transcription factor that regulates the biosynthesis of fatty acid synthesis are less well defined. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a major enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, has been implicated in immune signalling by regulating the TLR4 pathway and the levels of downstream inflammatory cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This is largely attributed to the de novo activity of FASN fuelling sphingolipid production, thereby exerting influence on membrane raft formation and precise Rho-GTPase trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These studies therefore imply an indirect role for FASN in inflammasome priming. However, the role of FASN in NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains ambiguous.</p><p id="P4">Lipids have also been implicated in defining the precise localization of the NLRP3 inflammasome which has been debated almost since the discovery of the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. A recent study demonstrated that a polybasic region in the NLRP3 PYD to NACHT linker region associates with the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the dispersed <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network (dTGN) before NLRP3 inflammasome can be assembled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Other studies have demonstrated that the double-ring cage structure of the active NLRP3 inflammasome is promoted by membrane association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that NLRP3 is tethered to a membrane. However, mechanisms necessary for the membrane association of the NLRP3 inflammasome remain ambiguous.</p><p id="P5">Despite gaining some understanding in recent years, the precise mechanism through which lipid metabolism influences NLRP3 activation remains ambiguous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, a definite link between NLRP3 activation and lipid signalling remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in inflammasome activation. Our data shows that the pharmacological blockade of FASN in mouse macrophages specifically regulates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This effect of FASN is intricately linked to NLRP3 palmitoylation. Consequently, ablation of cellular palmitoylation dampened NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which could be restored by exogenous addition of palmitate. By contrast, activation of the AIM2 inflammasome remained unrestricted. Moreover, these findings were replicated <italic>in vivo</italic> where the inhibition of FASN or palmitoylation led to a significant reduction in serum IL-1β levels. Altogether, these results demonstrate that fatty acid metabolism and NLRP3 palmitoylation play critical roles in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Inhibition of FASN reduces caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptosis</title><p id="P6">FASN is a crucial multi-functional enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The enzyme utilizes acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as substrates, converting them into saturated fatty acids in a series of reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These fatty acids play key roles in structural integrity of the membranes, energy homeostasis, hormone production and as signalling mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A previous study suggested a role for FASN in inflammasome priming by contributing to the production of lipids rafts which facilitate TLR4 signalling at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, a direct role for fatty acid synthesis, and particularly FASN, in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. In order to interrogate this, we exposed LPS-primed mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to FASN inhibitor, cerulenin. Cerulenin is a natural mycotoxin which specifically and irreversibly inhibits the β-ketoacyl synthase activity resulting in a dead-end FAS inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. It has also been demonstrated to exhibit selective cytotoxicity in several established cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. BMDMs exposed overnight to cerulenin displayed morphological features of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). In order to specifically examine the role of FASN during NLRP3 activation, cerulenin was added to media 2h after LPS priming by which point the cells displayed abundant expression of NLRP3 sensor protein and additionally exhibited no characteristics of cytotoxicity as observed by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ATP resulted in cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to its 20 kDa active form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, the processing of caspase-1 was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in cells exposed to cerulenin demonstrating reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, C</xref>). Active caspase-1 further leads to the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), the N-terminal of which translocates to the PM resulting in pore formation and induction of inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In agreement with reduced caspase-1, inhibition of FASN resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in GSDMD N-terminal cleavage as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, C</xref>). Consequently, the secretion of caspase-1-dependent cytokine IL-1β also exhibited a significant decrease in response to cerulenin while the levels of secreted TNF-α and IL-6 remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In order to further validate these findings, we next employed a potent synthetic inhibitor of FASN, C75. C75 competitively interferes with the binding of malonyl-CoA to the β -ketoacyl synthase domain of FASN inhibiting long-chain fatty acid elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Similar to the data obtained with cerulenin, exposure to C75 resulted in a decrease in caspase-1 activation and GSDMD processing compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). In agreement, IL-1β secretion was also decreased in LPS-primed cells exposed to C75 even though the secretion of the inflammasome-independent cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 exhibited no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). These results were also mirrored in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages where a lower concentration of C75 potently decreased IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>), and in BMDMs upon activation of the non-canonical inflammasome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). In order to further examine whether the response is specific to TLR4 or the purinergic receptor, P2X<sub>7</sub>R, we substituted stimuli and instead primed cells with TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, and a microbial toxin, nigericin, as an activation signal in these experiments. In agreement with the results above, inhibition of FASN resulted in reduced caspase-1 activation suggesting that FASN is vital for NLRP3 inflammasome activation irrespective of the upstream priming and activation signals involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>). These results, therefore, demonstrate a critical role for fatty acid synthesis in calibrating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Palmitoylation is essential and specific to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome</title><p id="P8">The FASN pathway catalyzes the synthesis of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, which serves as a precursor to long-chain fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, palmitate can be directly utilised in palmitoylation (<italic>S</italic>-acylation), a post-translational modification in which palmitate is reversibly added to cysteine residues of target proteins enabling their association with cell membranes and influencing modulation of protein localization, function, and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In order to next examine whether the FASN pathway regulates inflammasome through palmitoylation, we independently examined the impact of palmitoylation on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. To probe this, we blocked palmitoylation by exposing cells to a competitive analogue of palmitate, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), and interrogated caspase-1 cleavage in response to NLRP3 activating stimuli. In parallel, a separate set of cells were exposed to cerulenin as a control. As expected, cerulenin diminished caspase-1 activation and cleavage of GSDMD N-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In agreement, levels of the mature form of IL-1β were also decreased in response to cerulenin as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, C</xref>). Intriguingly, exposure to 2-BP resulted in a similar decrease in caspase-1 activation in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Similarly, the expression of GSDMD N-terminal and the cleaved IL-1β were also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Likewise, the secreted levels of IL-1β also exhibited a concentration-dependent decrease upon exposure to 2-BP as compared to control cells exposed to LPS+ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, the levels of secreted TNF-α and IL-6 remained unimpaired in response to either cerulenin or 2-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we examined whether the FASN/palmitoylation pathway broadly regulates inflammasome activation. In order to test this, cells were transfected with dsDNA to activate the DNA sensing AIM2 inflammasome in the presence of either cerulenin or 2-BP. Intriguingly, neither FASN nor palmitoylation regulated the AIM2 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Consequently, the expression of cleaved caspase-1 remained similar compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). In agreement, the levels of secreted IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 remained similar to that in control cells that were not exposed to any of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Since 2-BP inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome, we speculated that adding exogenous palmitate should rescue caspase-1 activation. Correspondingly, addition of BSA-conjugated palmitate to cells rescued the effect of 2-BP by elevating caspase-1 activation in macrophages exposed to NLRP3 stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Remarkably, while palmitate alone did not have an effect, control cells exposed to NLRP3 stimulus and supplemented with BSA-palmitate also displayed increased caspase-1 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that palmitoylation is critical and specific to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, the results propose that palmitoylation can further augment NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, underscoring a regulatory role for this post-translational modification.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NLRP3 is palmitoylated which is abrogated when FASN signalling is blocked</title><p id="P11">The dynamic control of palmitoylation is maintained by the activity of palmitoyl acyltransferases that add a palmitate on cysteine residues within the protein sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Though the exact mechanisms remain unknown, the neighbouring amino acids and secondary structures can influence the specificity of palmitoylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In order to next decipher whether any of the inflammasome components is palmitoylated, we carried out <italic>in-silico</italic> approaches to predict putative palmitoylation sites in the amino acid sequence of mouse NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 as described in detail in the methods section<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. While the amino acid sequence of ASC and caspase-1 returned no putative sites, the mouse NLRP3 sequence exhibited six putative cysteine residues which can be palmitoylated. Notably, five of the six sites were within the LRR domain of NLRP3 while one was found in the linker region between the NACHT and LRR domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In order to validate our <italic>in-silico</italic> studies and ascertain NLRP3 palmitoylation, we next established our findings by reconstituting the mouse NLRP3 inflammasome in HEK293T cells. After overnight transfection, HEK293T cells expressing the inflammasome components demonstrated caspase-1 cleavage which was reduced in the presence of both cerulenin and 2-BP demonstrating central roles of FASN and palmitoylation in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The regulation by FASN/palmitoylation was independent of whether the expressed proteins were human or mouse though HEK293T cells reconstituted with human NLRP3 inflammasome exhibited greater regulation by FASN and palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 palmitoylation is fundamental to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and that this regulation is conserved between mice and humans.</p><p id="P13">To next probe NLRP3 palmitoylation, we carried out an acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay in HEK293T cells transiently transfected overnight with Myc-tagged NLRP3. After 24h, cells were lysed followed by capping of the free cysteines in the lysates. The protein samples were divided into two fractions. In samples which are HAM (+), the palmitate residue was hydrolysed and exchanged with a thiol-reactive biotin moiety for affinity enrichment while the HAM (-) samples served as negative controls. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of <italic>S</italic>-acylated NLRP3 in HAM (+) HEK293T sample expressing Myc-NLRP3 while as expected HAM (-) and cells not expressing NLRP3 exhibited no acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We further corroborated these findings in BMDMs validating palmitoylation of the endogenous NLRP3 in response to LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These studies therefore corroborate NLRP3 palmitoylation in line with our <italic>in-silico</italic> data and define palmitoylation as a key mechanism to regulate NLRP3 activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FASN/palmitoylation axis is important for inflammasome assembly in vitro and in vivo</title><p id="P14">We next sought to determine the mechanism by which palmitoylation modified NLRP3 activation. As protein palmitoylation is typically coupled to membrane association influencing protein function, we hypothesized that palmitoylation might control the proximal event of NLRP3 assembly. Activation of the inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β secretion is dependent on the formation of a supramolecular complex termed ASC ‘specks’, which are found in detergent-insoluble cellular fraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. As expected, stimulation of BMDMs with NLRP3 agonist resulted in the formation of a 1 μm ASC ‘speck’ which was visible in control cells by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, ASC specks were significantly abolished in cells exposed to either cerulenin or 2-BP under conditions that activated the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). We next independently interrogated whether AIM2 inflammasome assembly is regulated by FASN or palmitoylation. To probe this, mouse macrophages were transfected with dsDNA, which resulted in increased ASC speck formation. However, as expected, ASC speck formation was not restricted when either FASN or palmitoylation were pharmacologically blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Furthermore, we considered the extent of ASC oligomerisation by cross-linking Triton X-100-insoluble fraction with disuccinimidyl suberate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This treatment yielded most of the ASC as highly oligomerised in ATP treated control cells but not in cells exposed to cerulenin or 2-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Taken together, these data propose that palmitoylation is pivotal to the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p id="P15">We next used a murine peritonitis model to investigate the role of FASN and palmitoylation pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. To examine this, C57BL6/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with either FASN inhibitor cerulenin, or palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP, or NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 at the same time as LPS. After 4 hours, the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated by intraperitoneal administration of ATP, and IL-1β release was measured in the serum by ELISA. ATP administration induced a significant increase in serum IL-1β levels and this was considerably diminished by NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> abolition of FASN or palmitoylation displayed a decrease similar to that observed with MCC950 indicating an NLRP3-dependent response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).

However, the precise mechanism linking lipids to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that fatty acid biosynthesis pathway is central to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Pharmacological blockade of a critical enzyme in the pathway, FASN, resulted in abrogation of caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in response to NLRP3 activation. Notably, these findings were dependent on palmitoylation, a post-translational mechanism in which palmitic acid is added to the cysteine residue of target proteins influencing their localization and function. In agreement, we observed that NLRP3 is palmitoylated and blocking palmitoylation blunted inflammasome signalling which could be restored in the presence of exogenous palmitate.</p><p id="P17">A previous study examining the role of FASN revealed a key role for the enzyme in the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in response to TLR4 ligation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Upon pharmacological inhibition of FASN, it was observed that the subsequent LPS-dependent signalling is compromised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

Other studies have confirmed a role for FASN in inflammatory signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Our study by specifically investigating the role of FASN following TLR4 ligation highlights that FASN engages unique mechanisms to regulate inflammatory signalling and inflammasome activation.</p><p id="P18">Two recent studies have demonstrated that palmitoylation of GSDMD is important for pyroptosis induction and thus IL-1β secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. These studies identified that GSDMD-NT palmitoylation at Cys191/192 (human/mouse) position regulated membrane translocation of the N-terminal fragment although the prior processing of the GSDMD protein remained unaltered. Remarkably, our experiments revealed an upstream role for palmitoylation in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Accordingly, we observed palmitoylation of NLRP3 both in HEK293T cells transiently expressing NLRP3 and the endogenous NLRP3 in primary BMDMs by ABE assay. Consequently, both caspase-1 activation and IL-1β processing were blunted in the presence of a palmitoylation inhibitor. These results therefore shed light on previously elusive mechanisms through which palmitoylation regulates distinct steps in inflammasome assembly and signalling.</p><p id="P19">A very recent study identified zDHHC12 as the acyltransferase that adds palmitate at Cys844 position in NLRP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, animals lacking zDHHC12 exhibited increased severity during an endotoxin shock model. In agreement, <italic>Zdhhc12</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> macrophages also revealed increased IL-1β secretion. It was therefore concluded that palmitoylation dampens inflammasome activation. In our study, we observed that palmitoylation promotes caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion both in WT macrophages and in reconstituted HEK293T cells exposed to a well-established palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-BP. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of 2-BP could be rescued by supplementing cells with palmitic acid. This depicts differences in results possibly due to the different approaches used in the two studies. In the previous study, assays demonstrating caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion were only carried out in <italic>Zdhhc12</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> macrophages. Since approximately 10% of the proteins coded by the human genome is palmitoylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the nature and identity of all zDHHC12 targets remain unknown.</p><p id="P20">Palmitoylation typically defines the membrane association of proteins influencing their localization and function. Therefore, our study suggests that NLRP3 or the inflammasome complex is tethered to an organelle. One study demonstrated that a polybasic region (residues 127-146) promotes association of NLRP3 with PI4P accumulated in the dTGN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Notably, the dispersal of TGN38-postive vesicles, which have since been suggested to be endosomal in nature, occurred prior to NLRP3 puncta formation suggesting that PI4P accumulation is a prerequisite for NLRP3 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, cryo-EM approaches independently revealed that the membrane association promotes NLRP3 inflammasome assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Together with our studies, this suggests that both NLRP3 palmitoylation and association with negatively charged PI4P on dTGN may be required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altogether, our study identifies NLRP3 palmitoylation as a regulatory mechanism controlling inflammasome activation, providing a novel target for calibrating NLRP3 activity in infectious and inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Fig. S</label><media xlink:href="EMS190578-supplement-Fig__S.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was in-part supported by a grant from The Medical Research Council, UK (MR/S00968X/1) to P.K.A.
