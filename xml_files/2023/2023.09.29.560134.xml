While it is important that they are readily available in case of infection, they need to be tightly controlled to prevent activation of an unnecessary cellular response. Here we describe how the bacterial cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) uses its intrinsic protein modification system to regulate the nucleotide cyclase. By integrating a Type II CBASS system from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> into the cognate host <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, we show that the Cap2 protein conjugates the cyclase exclusively to the conserved phage shock protein A (PspA) in the absence of phage. This cyclase-PspA conjugation is reversed after infection by the isopeptidase Cap3. Finally, we propose a model in which the cyclase is held in an inactive state by conjugation to PspA in the absence of phage and that this conjugation is released upon infection, priming the cyclase for activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The evolution of bacteria and their viruses (phages) has been driven by the constant arms race between them. While bacteria developed more potent defence systems, phages evolved to overcome these systems. The best-known examples for anti-viral defence systems are the adaptive and innate immune system of eukaryotes and the restriction-modification and CRISPR systems of prokaryotes. While the eukaryotic systems evolved to a much higher complexity to function in multicellular organisms, they have their ancestral roots in the prokaryotic world. Thus, the eukaryotic cGAS enzyme of the cGAS-STING pathway is a homolog of the bacterial CD-NTase (cyclic nucleotidyl-transferase), which is part of CBASS (cyclic-oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In fact, recent studies have revealed a large diversity of bacterial CD-NTase enzymes that are all related to cGAS and synthesize a diverse array of cyclic nucleotides in response to phage infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, initiating downstream effectors to modulate the bacterial immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In most cases this is thought to lead to dormancy or programmed cell death even though alternative strategies allowing bacterial survival have recently been described for other defence systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Although widespread in bacteria, key details of CBASS immunity remain unexplored. While it is a common feature of CRISPR systems to be activated by viral RNA/DNA, the signal that activates CD-NTases is more varied and in many cases still unknown. The eukaryotic homolog cGAS is stimulated by binding to double-stranded DNA or RNA in the cytosol, indicative of viral infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, it has recently been observed that CD-NTases from Type I CBASS systems in <italic>Staphylococcus schleiferi</italic> bind viral RNA, thereby triggering cyclic dinucleotide synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Phage capsid proteins have been implicated in triggering type II CBASS defence in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, while the CD-NTase DncV from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> binds folate-like molecules and the disturbance of such during phage replication is thought to activate the enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In Type III CBASS systems binding of certain phage peptides by HORMA-domain containing proteins changes their state and allows them to bind and activate the CD-NTase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Type II CBASS operons contain genes encoding homologs of the ubiquitin ligation machinery and such systems account for 39 % of all CBASS systems, highlighting the relevance of the ancillary genes <italic>cap2</italic> and <italic>cap3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Very recently, two different groups have reported that the carboxy terminus of the CD-NTase is activated by ADP ribosylation and transiently linked via a thioester bond to the Cap2 enzyme, before it is finally conjugated to its target in the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. While the first step of this posttranslational modification has been uncovered, the nature of the cellular target, the role of the regulation by conjugation of CD-NTase for immunity, as well as its link to phage infection remain largely unexplored.</p><p id="P5">To increase our understanding of CBASS regulation and to shed light onto the importance of the CD-NTase-conjugation, we studied the Type II CBASS system from the <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> strain WPySW2. This CBASS operon consists of four genes encoding a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase, a ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 domain fused to an E2 ubiquitin transferase domain (Cap2), a JAMM (Jab1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) deubiquitinating enzyme (Cap3), and a Nuc-SAVED effector (Cap4) with a DNA endonuclease (Nuc) fused to a cyclic nucleotide binding SAVED domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We transferred the system from <italic>B. cereus</italic> into the cognate host <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> which allowed us to study this CBASS system <italic>in vivo</italic> and identify cellular components relevant for CBASS immunity. Using an unbiased cell extract separation approach we observe that the CD-NTase (henceforth “cyclase”) is in-part membrane associated and, in the presence of the Cap2 enzyme, conjugated to the phage shock protein A (PspA). PspA is the main effector of the phage shock protein (Psp) system, a universally conserved bacterial response to cell envelope stress resulting from phage infection, alkali shock, or membrane targeting antibiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. On phage infection, Cap3-mediated deconjugation of the cyclase from PspA is observed. Based on our experimental data and published data on Psp systems, we hypothesize that CBASS uses the assembly of PspA in helical rods with an ESCRT-III-like fold as a platform to store individual cyclase monomers and inhibit their activity, hence preventing futile activation of the defence system.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The <italic>B. cereus</italic> CBASS system is functional in <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title><p id="P6">In order to study the CBASS system of <italic>B. cereus</italic> WPysSW2 (<italic>Bce</italic>) <italic>in vivo</italic>, the operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) was introduced into the genome of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Δ6 and expressed under a strong, constitutive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> promoter (PdegQ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Δ6 was used for the infection experiments because it is deficient of the two prophages (SPβ and PBSX) and the three prophage-like elements (prophage 1, prophage 3, and skin) in the parental <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The protective effect of CBASS against phage infection was tested by infecting the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Δ6 parental strain (from now on referred to as “no CBASS”), as well as strains containing either the full or partial CBASS operon, with four novel <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phages. We compared the genomes of the four phages to known <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phages and classified them accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Therefore, Goe16, Goe21, and Goe26 were classified to belong to the <italic>Myoviridae</italic> family and the SPO1-like phages, PBS Jumbophage and SP10-like virus genus, respectively. Goe23 is a representative of the <italic>Podoviridae</italic> family and the Phi29-like genus (for more details see Supplementary Table 1).</p><p id="P7">We observed that the type II CBASS system was able to protect bacteria from infection with all four phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). CBASS conferred 10<sup>4</sup>-fold defence compared to the parental strain for phages Goe16, Goe21 and Goe26. We did not observe a reduction in PFU count for Goe23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), however, the morphology of the plaques changed from a clear to a much more turbid plaque with no clear centre of lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Additionally, we did observe protection in liquid medium supporting the response of CBASS to Goe23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Thus, the CBASS<italic><sup>Bce</sup></italic> system is able to confer immunity against four different classes of phages with very different characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Goe21 is a jumbo phage, a class of phage known to shield their DNA in a nucleus-like structure. Phage Goe16 and Goe26 presumably use modified bases in their DNA. Goe16 encodes for homologous enzymes involved in the synthesis of hydroxymethyluracil nucleotides in phage SPO1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Goe26 encodes for homologs of enzymes supposedly capable of hypermodification of thymines in SP10 as suggested by domain conservation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. These flexibilities in both viral DNA storage and composition could be an indicator that viral DNA is not the indicator of infection detected by CBASS<italic><sup>Bce</sup></italic>. Likewise, direct detection of specific phage proteins seems unlikely given the diversity of phages studied here.</p><p id="P8">In order to assess the essential components of CBASS, we deleted parts of the operon, or introduced point mutations in relevant residues to generate protein variants. The double deletion of the <italic>cap2</italic> and <italic>cap3</italic> genes led to a complete loss of immunity, similar to the effect of deletion of the <italic>cyclase</italic> gene. In contrast, the absence of Cap3 (the JAMM protease) alone reduced, but did not abolish, CBASS immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>). This indicates that the potential deconjugating activity of Cap3 is not essential, but is important, in the CBASS<italic><sup>Bce</sup></italic> system. In contrast to Cap3, Cap2 was essential for CBASS immunity as mutation of the catalytic residues of either the E2 or E1 domain, led to loss of immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The C-terminal tails of CD-NTases are highly conserved even among distantly related Type II CBASS systems and the last amino acid of CBASS cyclases is in most cases an Ala or Gly residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This C-terminal residue is the site of conjugation by Cap2 to a lysine residue on cellular targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To investigate the importance of the C-terminal Ala in our system, we mutated Ala331 to a negatively charged Glu residue (A331E) and observed that immunity was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1bc</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The <italic>Bce</italic> cyclase is conjugated to Phage Shock Protein A</title><p id="P10">Eukaryotic cGAS associates with the plasma membrane by selective interaction of its N-terminal domain with phosphoinositide, a feature that is important for the regulation of the enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The subcellular localisation of the bacterial CD-NTase enzymes could be an important aspect of their regulation, but has not yet been explored. We addressed this by overexpressing the <italic>Bce</italic> cyclase in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains containing genomic integrations of Cap2 and the effector. We separated the cytosolic from membrane fractions and purified the cyclase by affinity chromotography via protein A-coupled beads saturated with cyclase-specific antibodies. We observed that, while most of the overexpressed cyclase was cytosolic, there was a substantial amount of the protein in the membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). We observed this for the full-length cyclase as well as a truncated mutant, in which the flexible C-terminal tail had been deleted.</p><p id="P11">In the membrane fractions, we observed a number of additional bands (at 28, 65 and &gt;200 kDa) associated with the full-length cyclase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Analysis by mass spectrometry showed the 65 kDa band (magenta arrow) contained almost equal amounts of the cyclase and a protein identified as phage shock protein A (PspA), suggestive of a 1:1 conjugated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3ab</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the <italic>pspA-ydjG-ydjH-ydjJ</italic> operon is under control of the alternative extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σW which regulates expression of several genes in response to alkali stress and infection with phage SPP1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In the higher molecular weight band (&gt;200 kDa) we identified peptides of the YdjI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). YdjI is a stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C-domain protein which localizes into liquid disordered membrane regions, and homologs assemble into higher oligomeric structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, together with the two membrane integral proteins YdjG and YdjH, it is essential for membrane localisation of PspA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The prominent band at 25 kDa proved to contain the PspA protein. Comparing the intensity of the band in the SDS gel of both the PspA monomer and the cyclase, it became apparent that PspA was present in high molar excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). It has been described that PspA proteins assemble in helical rods with an ESCRT-III-like fold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and such PspA foci have been observed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> microscopically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesize that the cyclase associates with and is conjugated to PspA rods <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P13">To confirm that the cyclase and PspA proteins were indeed conjugated by an isopeptide bond, and identify the sites on each protein, we searched the MS data for PspA peptides carrying the last tryptic peptide of the cyclase, KPGGFA, which results in a predicted mass increase of 557.3 Da. We observed this mass shift on two residues, K147 and K220, of PspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). This indicates that the C-terminal carboxyl group of the cyclase forms an isopeptide bond with the ε-amine of a lysine residue in PspA, reminiscent of ubiquitination in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As our previous experiments were performed in the absence of Cap3, as well as with overexpression of the cyclase to increase our chances of identifying the target of cyclase-conjugation, we were now interested in which components of CBASS were required for cyclase conjugation under more realistic conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this purpose, we purified cyclase from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells expressing genomically-integrated CBASS and performed Western Blot analysis to determine the level of conjugation in the different strains. As expected, the cyclase-PspA conjugate was only formed in the presence of cyclase, Cap2 and PspA, indicating that Cap2 is indeed the enzyme responsible for cyclase ligation to PspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Interestingly, in the absence of PspA, we did not observe conjugation to an alternative target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Monomeric PspA clearly co-purified with the cyclase-PspA conjugate in high molar excess, providing further evidence that the conjugate is part of large PspA assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The fact that the presence of Cap3 prevents formation of the cyclase-PspA-conjugate strongly indicates that Cap3 functions as the isopeptidase cleaving the cyclase-PspA-conjugate <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is in agreement with previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We then separated the cell extract of the same strains into membrane and cytosolic fractions and purified the cyclase from the cytosolic fraction to concentrate the sample to the same volume as the membrane fraction. Western blot analysis showed that the cyclase partitions between both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). The association with the membrane fractions was independent of Cap2, Cap3 and PspA, providing evidence that the cyclase itself could interact with membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conjugation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P15">Knowing the full-length cyclase, Cap2 and PspA are required for conjugation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we aimed to reconstitute conjugation <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, we incubated the purified proteins in our conjugation assay and analysed the reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibodies raised against the cyclase and PspA. With this, we observed conjugation of the cyclase to PspA in the presence of Cap2 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition to conjugation to PspA, the cyclase formed higher MW species in the presence of Cap2 and ATP which were stable in the presence of the reducing agent DTT, indicative of Cap2-cyclase thioester-intermediates of the conjugation reaction, as observed previously by others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Indeed, analysis of the respective higher MW species by mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of cyclase and Cap2 peptides in these bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). The physiological relevance of these species is unclear, as they were not observed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Having identified potential modification sites on PspA, we were interested in whether the conjugation to PspA was exclusive to these lysine residues. Thus, we created variant PspA proteins in which we exchanged either K147 or K220 for an arginine residue. We then tested the variants in our <italic>in vitro</italic> conjugation assay, observing that the K147R single mutant showed a 35 % reduction in conjugation, while the K220R mutant was still very efficiently targeted for conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3bc</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). We then combined the K147R and K220R mutations and tested the double mutant in the conjugation assay, observing that the additional mutation of K220 in the K147R mutant led only to a minor reduction in conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3bc</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). This indicates that K147 is a preferred residue for conjugation, while there is a certain flexibility regarding lysine residues on PspA targeted for conjugation. The low sequence conservation between PspA homologs may explain why Cap2 requires flexibility in target recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Based on this we hypothesize that interaction between Cap2 and PspA initiates conjugation of the C-terminus of the cyclase to an exposed lysine residue on the outward-facing C-terminus of PspA assembled in the large helical filament.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Relevance of conjugation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P17">To understand the relevance of conjugation during phage infection, we infected cells expressing either the full CBASS system or CBASS<sup>ΔCap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> with phage Goe23. The phage Goe23 belongs to the very well characterized phi29-like family and has a minimal genome. It also showed the most clear plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), supposedly inducing the most drastic CBASS response, and, thus, making it an ideal candidate to study our system <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cells were harvested before- and 5, 15, and 30 min post-infection, and the membranes purified. In the Western blots we observed that infection did not increase formation of the conjugate at any time point. In contrast, we observed a Cap3-dependent decrease of the cyclase-PspA conjugate 30 min after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). These data are consistent with a model involving an inhibitory effect of conjugation on the cyclase which is released upon infection with phage. To further evaluate this, we deleted <italic>pspA</italic> from the genome and infected the bacteria with each of the four phages. Deletion of <italic>pspA</italic> had no negative effect on immunity, suggesting that conjugation to PspA is not essential for the eventual activation of the cyclase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To tackle the suspected inhibitory effect of the cyclase conjugation further, we grew <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cultures expressing CBASS and infected the cultures with phage Goe23. These cultures were harvested 0, 15 and 30 min after infection and the intracellular nucleotides were extracted. We proceeded to test their ability to activate the cognate CBASS Nuc-SAVED effector in a plasmid cleavage assay. We quantified the amount of uncleaved plasmid after incubation of Nuc-SAVED with the nucleotide extracts or synthetic (3’, 3’, 3’) cA<sub>3</sub> and observed plasmid degradation only 30 min after infection, but not at time 0 or 15 min after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that the cyclase is inactive in the absence of phage and that CBASS responds rather late during the infection cycle, which is in agreement with previous observations by others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To further investigate cyclase activity, we repeated the experiment with different CBASS mutant strains and observed that the second messenger nucleotide could only be detected in extracts from cells expressing a functional CBASS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). The only mutant strain that did not produce the second messenger after phage infection was the CBASSΔCap2ΔCap3 strain that is unable to confer immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). From this we can conclude that the cyclase is inactive in the absence of phage and that Cap2 is essential for activation. As we did not observe a difference in Nuc-SAVED cleavage activity with nucleotides extracted from CBASS or CBASS Δ<italic>pspA</italic> in the initial assay, we decided to measure Nuc-SAVED activity over a broader range of time. With this we observed earlier activation of Nuc-SAVED when incubated with extracts originating from CBASS Δ<italic>pspA</italic> compared with those from bacteria encoding PspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), indicating increased second messenger production in the absence of PspA at early time points. This supports the idea that the cyclase needs to be deconjugated prior to activation and that the initial response is faster in the <italic>pspA</italic> deletion mutant.

To investigate the activity of the cyclase further, we incubated the purified cyclase protein with two different ATP concentrations and analyzed the products by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 10a,b</xref>). While the cyclase formed mainly cA<sub>3</sub> with the low ATP concentration (0.2 mM), no cA<sub>3</sub> peak appeared when the cyclase was incubated with higher ATP concentration (5 mM). However, a minor peak observed with low ATP became more prominent. To investigate which of these products activated the CBASS effector Nuc-SAVED, we performed a plasmid cleavage assay with the respective samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). Only the cyclase product containing mainly cA<sub>3</sub> (0.2 mM ATP sample) was able to induce plasmid cleavage through activation of Nuc-SAVED.

Recent studies of type II CBASS systems have uncovered the important roles for Cap2-mediated conjugation and Cap3-mediated deconjugation of the cyclase, but left several mechanistic questions unanswered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Our investigation of the type II CBASS system from <italic>B. cereus</italic> shows that Cap2 conjugates the cyclase to the major effector of the Psp response, PspA. This posttranslational modification is reversible by Cap3. Thus, to prevent activation of CBASS in the absence of phage, and hence a drastic downstream response, CBASS uses its protein modification machinery to conjugate the cyclase to the highly conserved PspA protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a CBASS system using cellular components outside of the defence system to regulate immunity. Regulation of CBASS immunity can be achieved on several levels and the conjugation of cyclase in the absence of phage to a highly conserved and abundant protein like PspA adds a novel aspect to the picture. It has been shown before that the eukaryotic homolog cGAS is activated by DNA-induced oligomerisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been described very recently for the cyclase enzyme of a short Type II CBASS system. In this case, clustering is achieved by poly-ligation of individual cyclase monomers onto each other <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, reminiscent of poly-ubiquitination. We hypothesize that by ligating the cyclase to a highly abundant protein, such clustering could be prevented. Whether conjugation to PspA is solely preventing clustering, and thus activation of the cyclase, or has an additional physiological role can only be speculated at the moment. The ability of Psp systems to respond to phage infection by sensing cell envelope damage could add another level of regulation to CBASS systems, potentially regulating Cap3-mediated deconjugation and, thus, activation of the survival program. The observed association of the <italic>Bce</italic> cyclase to bacterial membranes, a common feature shared with eukarytotic cGAS homologs, gives new insights into the cellular localization of CBASS. Whether membrane association plays a secondary role apart from positioning the cyclase in close proximity to PspA rods, can only be speculated at the moment.</p><p id="P24">The role of the Cap3 enzyme has been a point of speculation. It clearly can deconjugate CD-NTases from a range of partner proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. When a range of phages were used to challenge an <italic>E. coli</italic> CBASS system, Cap3 was essential for immunity against phages T4 and T6 but required for phages lambda and T2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, when a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> CBASS system was tested in a heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> host, Cap3 was not required for immunity against T2, T4, T5 or T6 phages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In fact, deletion of Cap3 was associated with increased levels of cGAMP production by the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cyclase immunoprecipitated from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, leading the authors to propose a model whereby Cap3 is an antagonist of Cap2 that limits cyclase priming <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Finally, Cap3 was not required for antiphage immunity in a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, the Cap3<italic><sup>Bce</sup></italic> enzyme increases immunity provided by the <italic>Bce</italic> CBASS system, as observed by improved defence against phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Our data suggests that the <italic>Bce</italic> Type II CBASS system functions by providing the cell with inactivated, Psp-conjugated cyclase, which is readily available in the event of infection. The observed inhibition of the <italic>Bce</italic> cyclase at ATP levels typical for normally growing bacterial cells could have a regulatory function <italic>in vivo.</italic> In fact, it has been described previously that phage infection affects intracellular nucleotide levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, a disturbance possibly affecting the activity of the cyclase and/or the Cap2 protein. Whether these observations compose a multi-level regulation of the cyclase, or if they evolved independently, will be interesting to study in the future.It has been observed before that CBASS, in contrast to other defence systems, responds rather late during the infection cycle of the phage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Our observations support this idea as we detected cA<sub>3</sub> only 30 min after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). After the same time, we detected a decrease in the amount of the cyclase-PspA conjugate in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Based on this and our observation of earlier accumulation of the second messenger in cells lacking PspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), we suppose that deconjugation of the cyclase is necessary for activation.</p><p id="P26">A working model for the regulation of the <italic>B. cereus</italic> type II CBASS is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. In uninfected cells, newly synthesised cyclase is conjugated by Cap2 to the abundant cellular protein PspA. An equilibrium between Cap2-mediated conjugation and Cap3-mediated deconjugation may be established, with the majority of the cyclase conjugated. This could be an effective means to prevent cyclase activation by oligomerisation – a mechanism that appears conserved in both eukaryal and bacterial systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. At later time points following phage infection, Cap3-mediated deconjugation of cyclase from PspA is observed, implying a role for Cap3 in sensing infection. It is possible that this relates to the changes in PspA organisation apon phage infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, making deconjugation more favourable. The release of cyclase from its conjugation partner could then allow Cap2-mediated activation of the cyclase, possbily due to oligomerisation of multiple cyclase molecules and concomitant activation, as observed for the type I CBASS system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. PspA is near-universal in bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, but was not observed as a conjugation partner in studies conducted in <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The use of over-expression platforms and heterologous hosts, while essential for initial biochemical studies, can mask important aspects of these defence systems. Equally, alternative conjugation partners may be utilised in preference over PspA in other bacterial lineages.
