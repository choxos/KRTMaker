The oldest and historically most influential hypothesis about the evolutionary fate and potential of duplicated genes has been proposed by Susumu Ohno in 1970. This hypothesis essentially posits that gene duplication can help genes tolerate new mutations and thus facilitates the evolution of new phenotypes. Competing hypotheses argue that deleterious mutations will usually inactivate gene duplicates too rapidly for Ohno’s hypothesis to work. Here, we provide a first direct experimental test of Ohno’s hypothesis. Specifically, we evolved one or exactly two copies of a gene encoding a fluorescent protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> through multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection. We then analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic evolutionary dynamics of the evolving populations through high-throughput DNA sequencing, biochemical assays, and engineering of selected variants. In support of Ohno’s hypothesis, populations carrying two gene copies displayed higher mutational robustness than those carrying a single gene copy. As a consequence, the double-copy populations experienced relaxed purifying selection, evolved higher phenotypic and genetic diversity, carried more mutations and accumulated combinations of key beneficial mutations earlier. However, their phenotypic evolution was not accelerated, possibly because one gene copy rapidly became inactivated by deleterious mutations. Our work provides an experimental platform to test models of evolution by gene duplication, and it supports alternatives to Ohno’s hypothesis that point to the importance of gene dosage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Because gene duplication is frequent in genome evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, it is a main source of material for novel proteins. The gene copies resulting from a gene duplication may have a variety of fates. First, loss-of-function mutations may inactivate one of the gene copies or lead to its loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Second, both copies might be conserved by natural selection for increased gene dosage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Third, mutations can cause a partial loss-of-function in either duplicate, such that the pre-duplication functions become partitioned among the duplicates in a process called sub-functionalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Finally, duplicates can gradually diverge and evolve distinct novel functions (neo-functionalization)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The factors that determine which of these outcomes occurs are still poorly understood, even though gene duplication has been the subject of many studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The last outcome, in which natural selection helps to create functional diversity from complete redundancy, has attracted the most interest, which led to multiple evolutionary models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The earliest and most influential was developed by Susumu Ohno in his book <italic>“Evolution by gene duplication”</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Ohno wrote that the most important role of a new gene copy is to provide redundancy. The redundant copy could escape from “the relentless pressure of natural selection” and accumulate “formerly forbidden mutations” to “emerge as a new gene locus with a hitherto unknown function”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Expressed in modern language, gene duplication increases the mutational robustness of the phenotype produced by the gene duplicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which relaxes the selection pressure on either duplicate, accelerates the accumulation of genetic diversity, and thus facilitates the evolution of new gene functions and phenotypes.</p><p id="P4">Ohno’s model faces a fundamental challenge. Beneficial mutations that create new gene functions are much rarer than deleterious mutations that impair or destroy gene functions. Thus, deleterious mutations may usually cause a loss of function of one duplicate long before rare beneficial mutations lead to its functional divergence. This problem is known as Ohno’s dilemma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. It has led to several alternative hypotheses for the emergence of novel protein functions after gene duplication (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>). They include the “mutations during non-functionality” model (MDN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>; the “Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation” model (DDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, the “Escape from Adaptive Conflict” model (EAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and the “Innovation-Amplification-Divergence” model (IAD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In the last model, a duplicate gene can be temporarily present in more than two copies.</p><p id="P5">Most empirical data about the evolution of duplicated genes comes from comparative genomic data analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Typically, pertinent studies compare duplicated genes (paralogs) with their single-copy relatives (orthologs) in related species. Quantities like the number of amino acid changes and the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous mutations are used as proxies for evolutionary rates and selection pressures, respectively. Such studies usually do not provide a phenotypic characterization of duplicates, especially when conducted on a genome-wide scale. Some individual duplicates and their evolutionary trajectories have been studied in more detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the comparative method mainly captures duplicates that are already fixed, functional, and selectively maintained <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, little information is usually available about the environmental conditions under which these duplicated genes have evolved. Moreover, the comparative method cannot easily distinguish the contribution of mutations to the divergence of a gene’s coding region, to its regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and to its interaction with other genes and their products (e.g. in protein complexes or as part of a regulatory network)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. All of these factors can be important for the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes.</p><p id="P6">Experimental evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> can mitigate the shortcomings of the comparative method. The DNA of populations evolved in the laboratory can be sequenced during any such experiment to reconstruct their evolutionary dynamics in detail. Any phenotype of interest can be carefully monitored during evolution. Thus, experimental evolution can help study both genotypic and phenotypic evolution. In addition, evolution experiments can be designed to test specific hypotheses, such as Ohno’s hypothesis.</p><p id="P7">A type of evolution experiment well-suited to testing Ohno’s hypothesis is directed evolution, which evolves individual genes by repeated rounds of mutagenesis and selection for specific phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Directed evolution is not only highly useful for generating commercially important proteins, it can also provide fundamental insights about protein evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Fluorescent proteins are especially useful for such experiments, because their phenotype can be measured in every individual of large microbial populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, few studies have used experimental evolution thus far to investigate the evolution of duplicated genes. These studies underline the importance of gene duplication in providing fast adaptation under changing environmental conditions. In some studies one copy was lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, while in others, additional copies were gained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Together these studies highlight that gene dosage and selection for dosage can play an important role during the evolution of duplicated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">These studies also raise the question whether gene duplication can provide an advantage beyond its effects on gene dosage. To find out it is necessary to study the evolution of gene duplicates while keeping the copy number of the duplicated gene exactly at two. This is challenging because gene duplication causes recombinational instability and high variability in copy number. No previous experimental studies were designed to control copy number. Here, we present an experimental system that allowed us to keep the copy number fixed at one or two genes, and to follow the evolution of each gene copy in the absence of any dosage increase.</p><p id="P9">Briefly, we expressed a fluorescent protein in one or two copies in <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic> and subjected it to multiple rounds of directed evolution under different conditions. We then analyzed the evolving populations at both the genotypic and phenotypic level. We observed that in the early stages of evolution, populations carrying two gene copies displayed higher mutational robustness compared to those carrying a single gene copy. As a consequence, populations with two copies experienced relaxed purifying selection, evolved higher phenotypic and genetic diversity, carried more mutations and accumulated combinations of key mutations earlier than the control populations with one copy. However, this did not manifest in accelerated phenotypic evolution in double-copy populations, possibly because one gene copy rapidly becomes inactivated by deleterious mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P10">To experimentally study the evolutionary consequences of gene duplication, we performed directed evolution of a fluorescent protein, that is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> from a single gene (single copy) or two identical genes (double copy). Our study protein was <italic>coGFP</italic>, a green fluorescent protein first isolated from the marine cnidarian <italic>Cavernularia obesa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our choice was motivated by the fact that this protein exhibits a dual phenotype that let us explore multiple selection regimes. When excited with light at a wavelength of 388 nm, its emission spectrum has two maxima, the first corresponding to blue color (456 nm) and the second corresponding to green color (507 nm), which may be caused by two different protonation states of the chromophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Because the ratio of blue and green emission is pH sensitive, we used buffers to maintain a constant pH during evolution (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Therefore, any changes in fluorescence we observed during evolution are due to genotypic changes caused by mutations. Amino acid substitutions at position 147 of this GFP lead to different ratios of blue and green fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The starting point of our evolutionary experiments was a variant with a glycine at residue 147 that fluoresces about equally brightly in green and blue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We call this variant our ancestral protein.</p><p id="P11">We mimicked the duplication event by placing two copies of the <italic>cogfp</italic> gene on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). To avoid recombinational copy number instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we inserted the two copies in opposing (convergently transcribed) directions. We placed the two copies under independent control of the inducible promoters P<sub>tet</sub> (inducible by anhydrotetracycline (aTc)) and P<sub>tac</sub> (inducible by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG)), which allowed us to express either both copies or only one copy at a time. To compare the evolution of a duplicated gene to the evolution of a single gene, we created an identical control plasmid with two gene copies, but inactivated one of the copies by three amino acids substitutions in the chromophore region (Q74A, Y75S, G76A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The advantage of this control single-copy plasmid is that it has the same size as the double-copy plasmid with two intact copies, and produces the same amount of protein, which allowed us to avoid differences in plasmid size and protein expression as confounding factors for our experiments. When induced with both aTc and IPTG the double-copy plasmid shows ~ 1.5-fold higher fluorescence than the single-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We performed directed evolution of both single- and double-copy populations by repeated rounds (“generations”) of mutagenesis, cloning of mutagenized <italic>cogfp</italic> genes into fresh (unmutated) plasmid backbone, transformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with the resulting plasmid libraries, and selection using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). After each selection step, we isolated plasmids from the cells that had survived selection to start the next generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Population (library) sizes exceeded 10<sup>4</sup> throughout our experiments, rendering the effects of genetic drift negligible on the time scale of our experiment.</p><p id="P13">Because the opposing directions of the two gene copies renders mutagenesis by the frequently used error-prone polymerase chain reaction impossible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we mutagenized our genes through isothermal DNA amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. This method introduced approximately 2 amino acid substitutions into the coding region of each <italic>cogfp</italic> gene per generation of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). After mutagenesis, we isolated the two <italic>cogfp</italic> coding sequences together before inserting them into a fresh plasmid backbone. Because this re-insertion could occur in both directions, a gene that was controlled by the P<sub>tet</sub> promoter in one generation might come under the control of P<sub>tac</sub> in the next generation, and vice versa.</p><p id="P14">Applying selection on fluorescence via FACS allowed us to apply multiple selection regimes. Specifically, our experiments used the following selection regimes: <italic>green</italic>: selection for green (no selection against blue fluorescence); <italic>blue</italic>: selection for blue (no selection against green fluorescence); <italic>green and blue:</italic> selection for both green and blue; <italic>green-only</italic>: selection for green and against blue; <italic>blue-only</italic>: selection for blue and against green; and <italic>no selection</italic> for either fluorescence color (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">For each of these regimes (except the no selection regime), we increased the strength of selection during our experiment. Specifically, we only applied weak selection to accumulate genetic diversity in the first generation, allowing 60% of cells displaying the highest fluorescence to survive. In generation two, we allowed the top 1% cells to survive, and in generations 3-5, we allowed only the top 0.01% of cells to survive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). We performed triplicate experiments for each of the above six selection regimes, and for each of the single-copy and double-copy plasmids, leading to a total of 3×6×2=36 evolution experiments, each of which lasted 5 generations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Gene duplication increases mutational robustness</title><p id="P16">One central prediction of Ohno’s hypothesis is that gene duplication increases the mutational robustness of gene duplicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In our study system, robustness refers to the preservation of the fluorescence phenotype after DNA mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). To test this prediction, we determined the fraction of cells that were still able to maintain their fluorescence after mutagenesis (shown for <italic>green</italic> selection regime in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, and for the other regimes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). In the first generation of the <italic>green</italic> selection regime, mutagenesis (before applying any selection) led to loss of fluorescence in 73.7% of variants from single-copy plasmids, but only in 59% of variants from double-copy plasmids. Thus, our gene duplicates are indeed more robust to mutations. This difference can be explained with a simple probability calculation, based on our observation that mutagenesis preserves fluorescence in a single-copy of coGFP with a probability of 0.26. Specifically, this calculation predicts that 100×0.74<sup>2</sup>=55% members of the double-copy population have no active copy anymore, which is close to the 60% we observed.</p><p id="P17">In the second generation of evolution, the cumulative effects of mutations caused a greater fraction of variants to lose fluorescence after mutagenesis, but here too double-copies remained more robust to mutations (with 36% of fluorescing cells after mutagenesis) than single-copies (18.4% of fluorescing cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). From the third generation onward, robustness increases steadily in both kinds of populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We also observed the same patterns of evolution – greater robustness of double-copy populations early on, increased robustness in all populations – also occur for the other selection regimes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). An exception is the <italic>no selection</italic> regime, where robustness does not increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). This observation demonstrates that selection is essential to increase mutational robustness in our experiment. Altogether these data show that gene duplication indeed increases mutational robustness.</p><p id="P18">Next, we analyzed the fluorescence phenotype of evolved populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). We found that populations subject to selection for green fluorescence changed their phenotype more dramatically than for other selection regimes. To keep this manuscript short, we thus focus on the <italic>green</italic> regime in the main text, and relegate data for the other selection regimes to the supporting information.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Gene duplication does not accelerate phenotypic evolution significantly, but increases phenotypic diversity</title><p id="P19">Another key prediction of Ohno’s hypothesis is that gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To test this prediction, we asked whether green fluorescence evolves faster in double-copy than in single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Double-copy populations evolved under the green selection regime displayed statistically significantly higher fluorescence than the single-copy populations throughout the 5 rounds of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; one tailed Mann-Whitney p&lt;0.05, n=3). However, if we normalize the fluorescence of the evolving populations to the fluorescence of the corresponding ancestral single- or double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), it is the single-copy populations that show a statistically significant higher fluorescence in generations 1, 2 and 5 (one tailed Mann-Whitney p&lt;0.05), whereas in rounds 3 and 4 no significant difference between single-copy and double-copy populations exists. In other words, the double-copy population does not lead to faster evolution of green fluorescence beyond the increased gene dosage provided by the second copy. However, we observed that the variance in fluorescence within a population is significantly greater in double-copy populations than in single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>One gene copy rapidly loses function after duplication</title><p id="P20">According to Ohno, a duplicated gene copy is not subject to selection for its initial function, and can thus accumulate previously “forbidden mutations” that might eventually lead to a new phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, both original and copy may also suffer a loss of function through deleterious mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> that may, for example, prevent proper folding of the encoded protein. Our experimental design allowed us to induce the two <italic>cogfp</italic> copies in a double-copy population independently from each other, which can help us to find out whether one or both copies are active in cells of a double-copy population. To this end, we chose a random sample of ~ 300 <italic>cogfp</italic> variants from the double-copy populations for each generation, and measured their fluorescence either under the induction of copy 1 (with aTc), of copy 2 (with IPTG), of both copies (with aTc and IPTG), and under no induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). The inactivation of one copy was indicated by the absence of fluorescence in the presence of one inducer. We found that the percentage of variants with two active copies decreased dramatically over time. Already after one generation of evolution, 38% of cells in a population harbored an inactive <italic>cogfp</italic> copy. This incidence of inactive copies subsequently increased further to 81% after generation four.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Populations with two gene copies carry more mutations per gene early during post-duplication evolution</title><p id="P21">After these phenotypic analyses, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of genetic variation in more detail with high-throughput single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. This long-read sequencing method allowed us to genotype an entire 1538 bp double-copy sequence variant in a single high-quality sequence read, thus preserving the linkage between two gene copies that evolved together. After quality filtering (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), we were left with 279-36000 variants per population. We focused our analysis on non-synonymous mutations, and first studied the frequency distribution of mutations.

Recall that even the single copy populations carry actually two <italic>cogfp</italic> genes, but one copy is inactivated. This inactive copy gives us a baseline of how much genetic diversity a neutrally evolving gene acquires. Therefore, we first compared the active versus the inactive copies in the single-copy populations. As expected, in single-copy populations, the active <italic>cogfp</italic> copy diversified less rapidly than the inactive copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that selection eliminated some mutations in the active copy. Next, we compared the active copy of single-copy populations with the double-copy populations. We found that indeed individual <italic>cogfp</italic> copies in double-copy populations diversified more rapidly than in single-copy populations with a significant difference in generations 1, 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, p ≤ 0.05 Mann-Whitney test, n=3). The increased genetic diversity is consistent with the increased phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>), the increase in mutational robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the rapid inactivation of one of the duplicated copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Complementary evidence for differences in genetic diversity comes from the ratio between the number of non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site (dN) to the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous site (dS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>). This dN/dS ratio is commonly used to identify the kind of selection acting on evolving genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>: dN/dS&gt;1 indicating positive selection, dN/dS=1 indicating neutral evolution and dN/dS&lt;1 indicating negative (purifying) selection. The inactive copy in single-copy populations has a dN/dS≈1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), as expected for a copy evolving neutrally. In double-copy populations, dN/dS&lt;1 averaged over both copies is smaller than one, but significantly greater than for the active copy in single-copy populations in generations 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This shows that despite selection for increased fluorescence, most mutations experienced by both single-copy and double-copy <italic>cogfp</italic> genes are deleterious and subject to purifying selection. In other words, mutations that increase fluorescence are in the minority. Purifying selection is weaker in double-copy than in single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), a pattern that is again consistent with an increase in mutational robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and rapid inactivation of one copy in at least some individuals of double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). The rapid inactivation might also lead to re-intensified purifying selection on the remaining active copy. This might explain why in later generations the differences between single-copy and double-copy populations are not statistically significant anymore.

The mutations G147S and V162D swept to the highest frequency under selection for green fluorescence. While mutations at position 147 have been previously described to influence coGFPS’s fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, the mutation with the highest frequency V162D, which reaches a median frequency of 99% in both single- and double-copy populations, has not been described as such. Both G147S and V162D lead to a more polar environment around chromophore residue Y75, thus facilitating proton transfer and green light emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. One additional mutation (L98M) reached high frequency under selection for green fluorescence, but it also did so in all other selection regimes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). Like L98M, the additional mutations S2I, V141I and V25L also occurred in all selection regimes, but they reached lower frequencies than L98M during the 5 generations of the experiment. We hypothesized that mutations observed in all selection regimes do not derive their benefit from increasing the intensity of any one fluorescent color. Instead, they may increase protein expression, solubility, or thermal stability.</p><p id="P26">To confirm the phenotypic effects of these mutations, we engineered them individually into the ancestral protein sequence and measured the fluorescence of the resulting protein variants both when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and as purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S17</xref>). This analysis confirmed the green-shifting effect (i.e. an increase in the ratio of green to blue fluorescence) of the mutations G147S and V162D. Interestingly, the purified protein carrying the green-shifting mutation G147S does not fluoresce more intensely than the ancestral protein, but <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing this variant do. A Western blot analysis revealed that this mutation increases coGFP expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18</xref>). The mutation L98M increases fluorescence at all wavelengths, and it does so by increasing the fraction of folded protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S19</xref>). In agreement with our experimental observations, computational homology modeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S20</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) predicts that mutations G147S and L98M increase structural stability.</p><p id="P27">We also engineered the double (G147S/L98M, V162D/L98M, G147S/V162D) and triple (G147S/V162/L98M) variants and characterized their phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S17 - S18</xref>).

Theoretically, the probability that at least one gene copy experiences a specific mutation is two times higher in double-copy populations than in single-copy populations, but subsequently the frequencies of these mutations are dictated by the strength of selection for them. We found that the double-copy populations have a higher median frequency of mutation G147S in generations 2 and 3, of mutation V162D in generations 1 and 2, and L98M in generations 3 through 5 (Generalized linear model, ANOVA p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) than single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The frequencies of combinations of these beneficial mutations were low and variable between replicates, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about their possible phenotypic effects in the evolving populations. Nevertheless, the multisite mutations G147S/L98M, V162D/L98M and G147S/V162/L98M emerged earlier in double-copy populations, than in single-copy populations. For example, the median frequency of V162D/L98M exceeded 1% in all three replicates of double-copy populations at generation 3, whereas it exceeded this frequency in single-copy populations only at generation 4. In addition, mutant V162D/L98M was significantly more abundant in double-copy populations from generations 3 through 5 (Generalized linear model, ANOVA p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Our aim was to study whether gene duplication can affect mutational robustness and phenotypic evolution beyond any effect of increased gene dosage provided by multiple gene copies. To this end, we needed to maintain a constant and stable copy number of duplicated genes during experimental evolution. This is challenging because of the recombinational instability inherent to repetitive DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. By drawing on our experience of using synthetic biology to study molecular evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we designed a plasmid system that meets this challenge. It allowed us to evolve a fluorescent protein encoded by either double-copy or single-copy <italic>cogfp</italic> genes.</p><p id="P30">Using this system, we experimentally confirmed the prediction that gene duplication increases mutational robustness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and renders cells more resistant to genetic perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Specifically, we showed that mutations are less likely to eliminate fluorescence in evolving populations with two gene copies than with one gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) during the first two generations of our evolution experiment. Thereafter, the difference in robustness between single-copy and double-copy populations disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). A likely reason is that in double-copy populations mutations rapidly deactivate one of the two copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>).</p><p id="P31">It is worth noticing that robustness increased throughout the experiment. Specifically, from the third generation onwards, robustness was always higher than in the preceding generation for the single-copy populations and the same was true for double-copy populations starting in the fourth generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This is likely due to the accumulation of stabilizing mutations. Indeed, we observed that such a mutation, L98M, became fixed in all populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This is in agreement with previous work demonstrating that stabilizing mutations increase robustness and tend to accumulate in directed evolution experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">The increased mutational robustness led to the accumulation of more mutations per <italic>cogfp</italic> genes in double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and to greater genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) during early post-duplication evolution. The increased robustness also caused a relaxation of selection, manifested in the ratio dN/dS of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5CD</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This ratio stayed below one, indicating purifying selection, in both single-copy and double-copy populations, but it was significantly higher in double-copy populations, pointing to relaxed purifying selection in these populations during the first three generations. Our observations are consistent with data from comparative genomics studies, which show relaxed selection shortly after gene duplication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. They also show that this relaxation is very short-lived, because most duplicates become either deactivated or diverge in function shortly after duplication.</p><p id="P33">Despite our directional selection for increased green fluorescence, dN/dS stayed below one throughout the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5CD</xref>). This can be explained by the observation that there are far fewer beneficial mutations than deleterious mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Indeed, we identified and characterized only three key mutations that reached high frequencies in all populations selected for green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>): G147S, V162D and L98M. While G147S has previously been described to influence the fluorescence of coGFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report the green-shifting effect of V162D in coGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>). Both mutations are predicted to make the environment around chromophore residue Y75 more polar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S20</xref>), thus promoting proton transfer and green emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In contrast, L98M does not change the fluorescence directly, but increases the structural stability of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) and the fraction of folded protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S19</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Although our ability to regulate the expression of the two <italic>cogfp</italic> copies independently allows us to study which of the two copies remains active in individual clones of a population, our experimental design does not allow us to distinguish active from inactive copies in a whole population from sequencing data alone. The reason is that we do not know which mutations (and combinations thereof) have deleterious effects, with the exception of (rare) premature stop codons and frame-shift mutations. In consequence, we cannot determine with certainty whether increased mutational robustness or rapid deactivation of one of two duplicates is primarily responsible for the increased accumulation of diversity in double-copy mutations. In the future, sorting the double-copy population for variants with one active gene copy from variants with two active gene copies, followed by high-throughput sequencing of these two subpopulations, might help to quantify the relative contributions of mutational robustness and gene inactivation.</p><p id="P35">Ohno also predicted that the increased robustness and genetic diversity entailed by gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To validate this prediction, we evolved coGFP populations under directional selection for green fluorescence, and asked whether double-copy populations change their phenotype faster. Green fluorescence was higher in double-copy populations throughout directed evolution, but the difference was smaller than the initial difference caused by the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). It is worth noting that we evolved each of our single- and double-copy populations separately and in parallel to follow their individual evolutionary trajectories. In a natural population, individuals with one or two copies might occur in the same population and compete against each other. In this situation any dosage advantage of a duplicate gene would itself entail selective benefit. Our approach allowed us to find out if gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution beyond any such gene dosage effect. At least for the specific genes, selection pressures, and mutation rates we used, the data suggest that it does not.</p><p id="P36">Our data also suggests two candidate explanations for this finding. The first is that the genetic changes needed to alter fluorescence in coGFP are simple and mediated by single amino acid changes, such as G147S and V162D. Both changes provide a bigger fitness (fluorescence) advantage to their carrier than the increased gene dosage of double-copy populations (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>). Given our high mutation rates and large population sizes (&gt;10’000 individuals) both mutations occur early during evolution and reach a frequency &gt; 0.1% in the first generation and in both single-copy and double-copy populations. If multiple mutations were crucial to increase fluorescence, double-copy populations may have a greater advantage. This possibility is consistent with our observation that combinations of beneficial mutations emerged earlier in double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A second, non-exclusive explanation may be the rapid inactivation of one gene copy by deleterious mutations in double-copy populations, which affected 38% of individuals in generation 1, and up to 81% after generation four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). This means that any beneficial mutations that convey an advantage to double-copy populations must occur very early after duplication.</p><p id="P37">It will be important to confirm our findings with other genes and different selection pressures. The reason is that the dynamics of mutation-driven phenotypic evolution after gene duplication may depend on gene-specific details, such as the fraction of mutations that are deleterious, or the number of mutations that are needed for a phenotypic change.</p><p id="P38">The challenge that a duplicated gene copy must remain free of frequent deleterious mutations long enough to acquire beneficial mutations that provide a new selectable phenotype is known as Ohno’s dilemma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Our experiments confirm that this challenge is highly relevant for post-duplication evolution. Other models such as the innovation-amplification-divergence (IAD) model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> postulate that this dilemma can be resolved through an increase in gene dosage that allows latent pre-duplication phenotypes to come under the influence of selection. To distinguish between the effects of gene dosage and other benefits of gene duplication, we prevented recombination and gene amplification to prevent copy number increases beyond two copies. We are aware that our experimental design does not reflect how evolution may occur in the wild. However, this design allowed us to study evolutionary forces separately that are otherwise difficult to disentangle.</p><p id="P39">In addition, because evolution experiments need to occur on laboratory time scales, such experiments incorporate design elements that may cause the evolutionary dynamics to differ from that in the wild. Examples include the use of plasmids with copy numbers higher than one, high mutation rates, and intense selection. It is possible that under natural conditions the higher frequency of beneficial mutations in the early evolution of our double-copy populations might lead to a bigger advantage of gene duplication than we observed.</p><p id="P40">The coGFP protein can be viewed as a simple model of a promiscuous protein, because of its dual color (green and blue) fluorescence. A proposed resolution to Ohno’s dilemma is that the “innovation” usually associated with neofunctionalization actually precedes gene duplication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This means that the ancestral gene, in addition to its main activity, has one or several minor side activities, i.e., it encodes a promiscuous protein. Promiscuity is a wide-spread property of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. It might thus play a key role in the critical early stages of post-duplication evolution, where selection for a side activity may help maintain a new gene copy until emerging mutations can further improve this activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. If the two activities show a strong trade-off, improvement of one would entail deterioration of the other. A single gene encoding such a protein suffers from an adaptive conflict between the two activities. Gene duplication may provide an escape from this adaptive conflict, because each duplicate may specialize on one activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. For coGFP, a trade-off likely exists for fluorescence in these two colors, because improvement of green fluorescence entails a loss of blue fluorescence during evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>). We therefore expected that during selection for both green and blue fluorescence, one <italic>cogfp</italic> copy in double-copy populations would “specialize” on green fluorescence whereas the other copy would specialize on blue fluorescence. However, when we analyzed individual population members with two active gene copies we could not find any such specialization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S21</xref>). Moreover, the identified key mutations at positions 147 and 162 have a very low frequency (&lt;1%) in these populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). Future experiments with different selection strategies might reveal the reasons for this observation and the conditions under which such a specialization can occur.</p><p id="P41">In summary, we established an experimental system that allowed us to gain time-resolved phenotypic and genotypic data on the evolution of (exactly) two gene copies to directly test Ohno’s hypothesis. Our experiments support that gene duplication increases the mutational robustness of gene duplicates. They also demonstrate that this leads to increased genetic diversity. However, we did not observe accelerated phenotypic evolution or specialization for different phenotypes. Further experiments will be necessary to clarify if these phenomena could occur under different conditions.</p><p id="P42">Importantly, our experimental system could help to answer many further questions about the evolution of duplicated genes. For example, by allowing the expression of duplicates to be controlled independently from each other, it can help answer how differential expression may affect both genotypic and phenotypic evolution after gene duplication. Furthermore, it could be used to study gene duplication under selection pressures that change in time, favoring one or the other color phenotype at different times. It could also be used to study the co-evolution of regulatory regions and gene coding regions. In sum, our system not only allowed us to validate a long-standing and difficult to test hypothesis about evolution by gene duplication, it also provides a platform for further evolutionary studies.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P43">We purchased restriction enzymes, NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix and T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs (NEB).

Since our target DNA sequence is palindromic (double-copy of <italic>cogfp</italic> in opposite orientation), smrtlink cannot differentiate a single pass through the palindromic DNA from two passes of a single copy of <italic>cogfp</italic>. To identify the passes correctly, we used recall adapter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/recalladapters">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/recalladapters</ext-link>) to manually splice adapter sequences <italic>in silico</italic>.

The first is consensus calling, which generates a consensus sequence from multiple sequencing passes. This step reduces sequencing errors. The second step is demultiplexing, where different reads are assigned to different experimental samples based on barcode sequences. This step also converts the data from bam format to fasta format.</p><p id="P77">We aligned the resultant fasta files to the reference sequence using the program minimap2 (SMRT tools, PacBio).

Furthermore, we reverse-complemented the reads that aligned with the reference sequence in the plus-minus orientation (i.e., reads that are the reverse complement of the reference sequence before alignment), so that all reads have the same orientation relative to the reference sequence.

For example, mutations with significantly higher frequency in <italic>blue-only</italic> populations relative to <italic>green-only</italic> populations may be responsible for a color shift towards blue fluorescence. In a first step, we performed this analysis for single copy libraries selected only for <italic>blue</italic> or <italic>green</italic> fluorescence. The reason is that the fluorescence of populations with two intact gene copies can result from the fluorescence of two different <italic>cogfp</italic> variants expressed in the same cell, which makes it difficult to establish which mutations are responsible for the phenotype.</p><p id="P84">To focus on mutations with the strongest influence on fluorescence, we restricted this analysis to mutations that reached the frequency of at least 5% after five rounds of evolution, in at least one replicate population selected for <italic>blue-only</italic> or <italic>green-only</italic>. We then used generalized linear models (GLM) to identify mutations that are significantly more frequent at the end of evolution in populations selected only for blue fluorescence than in populations selected only for green fluorescence, and vice versa. Specifically, we fitted a GLM with a binomial model (logit link function), using mutation counts as a response variable, and selection strategy (<italic>blue-only</italic> and <italic>green-only</italic>) as the predictor variable. Next, we performed an analysis of deviance with a likelihood ratio test using the function ANOVA (R stats package v3.4.4). This function analyses if the fitted GLM is significantly better than a null model where mutation frequencies are not affected by the selection strategy. We adjusted the resulting p-values using a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We identified mutations as differentially enriched if their Bonferroni-corrected p-values are lower than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS188547-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Julien Marquis and the team from the Lausanne Genomics Technology Facility for carrying out the SMRT sequencing.
