Loss-of-function mutations of the <italic>NPC1</italic> gene lead to accumulation of cholesterol and sphingolipids in LE/Ly, resulting in severe fatal NPC1 disease. Cellular alterations associated with NPC1 inactivation affect both the integrity of lipid rafts and the endocytic pathway. Because the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type 2 serine transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein also localize to lipid rafts, we sought to investigate the hypothesis that NPC1 inactivation would generate an intrinsically unfavorable barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry. In this study, we demonstrate that NPC1 pharmacological inactivation or CRISP/R-Cas mediated ablation of NPC1 dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. More specifically, our findings demonstrate that pharmacological inactivation of NPC1 results in massive accumulation of ACE2 in the autophagosomal/lysosomal compartment. A &gt;40-fold decrease in virus titer indicates that this effectively prevents VSV-Spike-GFP infection by impeding virus binding and entry. A similarly marked decrease in viral infectivity is observed in cells that had NPC1 expression genetically abrogated. These observations were further confirmed in a <italic>de novo</italic> SARS-CoV-2 infection paradigm, where cells were infected with the naturally pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this work offers strong evidence that NPC1 function is essential for successful SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus implicating NPC1 as a potential therapeutic target in COVID-19 management.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cholesterol uptake occurs through the endocytic pathway and relies on the activity of the intracellular cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) to deliver cholesterol to various cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). NPC1 is a 13 transmembrane domain protein of the late endosome/lysosome (LE/Ly) limiting membrane involved in the egress of endocytosed cholesterol into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>NPC1</italic> gene cause endocytosed unesterified cholesterol and other sphingolipids to clog the LE/Ly compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The impairment of the endocytic sorting/degradation/recycling is responsible for a severe and ultimately fatal inherited disease with a systemic involvement, called Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Because of entrapment within LE/Ly, normal amounts of cholesterol and sphingolipids fail to reach the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where cholesterol homeostasis is fundamental to various signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). For instance, at the level of PM, cholesterol is dynamically partitioned between the two fractions of accessible cholesterol and phospholipid- (mainly sphingomyelin) complexed cholesterol. Accessible cholesterol is metabolically active, that is readily used for covalent modification of cholesterol-regulated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), whereas sphingolipid-complexed cholesterol generates plasma membrane dynamic platform, named “rafts”. Here, cholesterol moieties ensure a tight packaging of fatty acid chains of sphingolipids, generating regions with a high structural order, to which various proteins are targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The integrity of lipid rafts and the endocytic pathway is crucial for the initial steps of enveloped virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is coated with the homotrimeric Spike (S) glycoprotein that mediates viral particle docking to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). After binding ACE2, the S protein is cleaved by the type 2 serine transmembrane protease, TMPRSS2, a membrane-bound enzyme that resides in close vicinity to ACE2, to mediate viral/plasma membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage induces conformational changes in the S protein (referred to as “priming”), as well as in ACE2, constituting a crucial prerequisite for the endocytic entry of viral particles into the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Therefore, the host cell ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 enzyme are involved in recognition and priming of the S protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and their proper localization to lipid rafts is essential for virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Alternatively, the S protein can undergo a series of cleavages by endo-lysosomal cathepsins B and L proteases when the virus is internalized <italic>via</italic> endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This ensures the uncoating of the capsid shell and the subsequent release of the viral RNA genome into the cytosol for replication. The expression level of TMPRSS2 in different host cell types determines which mechanism prevails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The requirement for NPC1 as an essential endosomal/lysosomal entry receptor is common among enveloped viruses, including Ebola, SARS, MERS and HIV viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Accordingly, NPC1 inactivation by imipramine or itraconazole has been shown to confer resistance to Ebola and HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The reliance of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the endocytic route suggested that inactivation of NPC1 could confer resistance to viral entry and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, underlying mechanisms are still unknown, with the exception of a recent study that identified NPC1 as an intracellular target of SARS-Cov-2 by demonstrating a physical interaction between SARS-Cov-2 nucleoprotein (N) and NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we sought to evaluate whether transient inactivation of NPC1 would confer resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early post-entry step. To this end, we exploited human intestine (Caco-2) and lung (Calu-3) cells, and monkey kidney cells expressing human TMPRSS2 (VERO-76), to demonstrate that NPC1 inactivation interfered with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. NPC1 inactivation was accomplished either by pharmacological inhibition with U18666A drug or by CRISP/R-Cas9 <italic>NPC1</italic> gene editing, and cell infection was carried out using a pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). These observations were further confirmed in a <italic>de novo</italic> SARS-CoV-2 infection paradigm, where cells were infected with the naturally pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the interference with NPC1 activity and cholesterol metabolism may represent a potential target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Inactivation of NPC1 perturbs ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and localization</title><p id="P7">To evaluate the effect of NPC1 inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we employed the pharmacological inhibitor U18666A that blocks the cholesterol transport activity of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The appropriate U18666A concentration and treatment duration for NPC1 inhibition were determined using dose-response curve analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary). The three cell types responded similarly to 24, 48 and 72 hours treatment with 0.02-200 uM U18666A concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary). However, filipin staining revealed that a 24-hour treatment with 2 uM U18666A produced a robust NPC1 phenotype with minimal effect on cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary, graphs). This observation prompted us to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of NPC1, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in VERO-76, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) that were either untreated or treated for 24 hours with 2 µM U18666A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Drug treatment modified transcript levels, as shown by a 2-fold increase in NPC1 transcript content in the three cell types. VERO-76 cells showed a similar 2-fold rise in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells showed about 2.5- and 1.5-fold decreases in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B, C</xref>; see legend for statistical significance). In addition, the presence of U18666A significantly increased the expression of NPC1 protein in Calu-3 cells and decreased the expression of ACE2 in both Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells (Fig.1B, C).</p><p id="P8">Next, we examined the effect of U18666A treatment on intracellular localization of NPC1 using immunofluorescence analysis. NPC1 acquired a prominent localization within the perinuclear organelles of all three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B, C</xref>, immunofluorescence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), while a similar accumulation of ACE2 to the perinuclear region was observed in VERO-76 and Caco-2 cells, but less so in Calu-3. Similarly, VERO-76 showed a TMPRSS2 re-location pattern similar to ACE, but Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells showed no change in TMPRSS2 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B, C</xref>). These results indicate that drug treatment significantly changed the localization of NPC1 and ACE2 proteins, most likely as a result of the disruption of endocytic trafficking caused by NPC1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>U18666A treatment targets NPC1 and ACE2 to the autophagolysosomal compartment</title><p id="P9">The observation that ACE2 acquired perinuclear organelle localization similar to NPC1 prompted us to characterize the compartment to which the two proteins were addressed, with particular reference to endocytic and/or autophagic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Therefore, control and U18666A-treated Caco-2 cells were processed by double immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against LAMP-2 and LC3B in order to detect the lysosomal and autophagosomal compartments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). We observed a strong co-localization of NPC1-LC3B and NPC1-LAMP-2 within perinuclear dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>), which is consistent with NPC1 targeting to the autophagosomal/lysosomal compartment. Remarkably, ACE2 was found to substantially co-localize with both LC3B and LAMP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 C, D</xref>). VERO-76 treated with U18666A showed a similar pattern of NPC1 and ACE2 targeting to the autophagosomal/lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2S</xref>). Massive ACE2 accumulation in the autophagosomal/lysosomal compartment might prevent virus-host cell interaction, reducing the susceptibility of U18666A-treated cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>NPC1 inactivation confers resistance to</italic> SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virus <italic>entry and propagation</italic></title><p id="P10">To directly investigate the possibility that cell treatment with U18886A interfered with the docking of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to the plasma membrane of host cells, U18666A- or mock- treated Caco-2 cells were infected with pseudotyped VSV-Spike-GFP virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), and infectivity measured by GFP expression. U18666A treatment dramatically reduced GFP fluorescence by &gt;90%, essentially blocking VSV-Spike-GFP infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Consistent with these results, virus titers were reduced by &gt;40-fold, compared to untreated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The percentage of apoptotic cells in U18666A-treated Caco-2 cells was comparable to that in control and U18666A-treated mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), providing additional evidence of the resistance to virus infection determined by NPC1 inactivation. In contrast, U18666A-untreated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) showed a dramatic VSV-induced cytopathic effect, with approximately 30% apoptotic cell death. A lower concentration of U18666A (0.2 uM, 72 hours, see dose-response curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary) produced results that were comparable (not shown). NPC1 inactivation in Calu-3 and VERO-76 cells produced similar patterns of resistance to VSV-Spike-GFP infection and propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A-F</xref>, Supplementary). Decreased vulnerability to VSV-Spike infection was consistent with the marked decrease in Spike expression in VERO-76 cells treated with U18666A when compared to control (p ≤0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, Supplementary). Lastly, we assessed the virus ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor and entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), observing that NPC1 inactivation results in a considerable reduction in both viral binding and subsequent entrance as evidenced by the 30% decrease in binding and the 50% decrease in viral RNA and GFP expression seen in cells treated with U18666A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, bars).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>NPC1 loss-of-function restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P11">The ability of <italic>NPC1</italic> loss to provide resistance to VSV-Spike-GFP entry was then evaluated in <italic>NPC1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> Caco-2 cells, generated by CRISP/R-Cas9 gene editing. Filipin staining revealed two clones, named LG5 and LD6, that had the intracellular cholesterol accumulation characteristic of NPC1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplementary). Consistently, NPC1 protein content was found to be below detection in LG5 cells and barely detected in LD6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplementary). Moreover, residual NPC1 protein of LD6 cells appeared to be targeted to the autophagosome/lysosome compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, Supplementary). No <italic>NPC1</italic> transcript expression was detected in LG5 with primers specific for the targeted exon 4 and a significant reduction of amplification compared to control cells with primers downstream from exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, Supplementary). A slight reduction of <italic>NPC1</italic> transcript amplification in LD6 compared to control cells was also observed.</p><p id="P12">Consistent with the solid NPC1 phenotype displayed by LG5 and LD6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplementary), cells of both clones were resistant to SARS-CoV2 infection when challenged with VSV-Spike-GFP; LG5 and LD6 displayed ~13% and ~3% GFP positive cells respectively, <italic>vs</italic> ~60% GFP positive cells in <italic>wild-type</italic> (<italic>wt</italic>) Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, left). As an additional proof of the strict dependency of virus infection on the NPC1 expression, we mixed LG5 or LD6 cells with <italic>wt</italic> Caco-2 cells at different ratios, and observed that the increase in the fraction of LG5 or LD6 cells was accompanied by a decrease of GFP-positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The relationship between NPC1 expression and virus propagation was further supported by the direct correlation observed between the fraction of Spike- and NPC1-expressing cells within the mixed population (r 07457; p 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The role of NPC1 as a critical viral restriction factor was further corroborated by infecting untreated and U18666A-treated Caco-2 cells with pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (BAVPAT-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, left bars). SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was reduced by a 42% in U18666A-treated cells compared to control, as determined by virus titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, bars on the right). A dramatic reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was also observed when <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>NPC1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> Caco-2 cells, respectively, were infected with pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was reduced by a 70% (LG5) and 97% (LD6) at MOI 1; when cells were infected at MOI 0.1, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity showed a further drop, with a 86% and 99% reduction in LG5 and LD6 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle and right).</p><p id="P14">To gain a mechanistic insight on the resistance of LG5 and LD6 clone cells to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were determined in LG5 and LD6 clones. Compared to <italic>wt</italic> Caco-2 cells, a 50% reduction in ACE2 protein expression was detected in both LG5 and LD6; expression of TMPRSS2a was also reduced, although these values did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5 Supplementary). Likewise, ACE2 transcript levels were reduced in both LG5 and LD6 cells, whereas TMPRSS2 transcripts decreased only in LD6 cells (Fig. 5, Supplementary). A pronounced co-localization of ACE2 with LC3B and LAMP2 was also detected in both clones (Fig. 5, Supplementary), which recapitulates the expression patterns observed in U18666A-treated cells. Overall, these results indicate that the internalization of ACE2 as a consequence of NPC1 ablation interferes with the docking of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein to the plasma membrane, thus increasing resistance of Caco-2 cells to SARS-CoV-2 entry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">The lipid microenvironment of various cellular organelles is known to be a critical factor for the infectivity of enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). For instance, the depletion of cholesterol and sphingolipids at the plasma membrane (PM) hinders virus entry by interfering with the docking of the Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor and the subsequent TMPRSS2 priming or clatrin- and caveoale-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The disturbance of nonvesicular lipid transport <italic>via</italic> membrane contact sites (MCVs), with particular reference to LE/L-ER MCVs, hampers virus replication, because double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that act as platform for viral replication originate from cholesterol-rich ER sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). With the present study, we demonstrate that pharmacological or genetic inactivation of NPC1 interferes with SARS-Cov-2 binding and entry, highlighting the fact that dysregulation of intracellular cholesterol trafficking and biosynthesis modulates the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p><p id="P16">U18666A has been widely used to model Niemann Pick C disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) and to investigate the effect of NPC1 inhibition on viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), whereas studies investigating its effect on viral binding and entry are scarce. The various cell types of this study had a comparable response to U18666A treatment exhibiting the expected phenotype of intracellular cholesterol accumulation, an increase in <italic>NPC1</italic> mRNA expression and NPC1 protein targeting to perinuclear organelles (reviewed in 43). On the other hand, our finding that U18666A-dependent NPC1 inhibition robustly alters the intracellular localization of ACE2 protein is a novel finding, which indicates a modification of ACE2 trafficking and/or partitioning among cell compartments. Specifically, the accumulation of ACE2 within the autophagolysosomal compartment is consistent with a dysfunctional autophagosome-lysosome fusion brought on by U18666A-dependent NPC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Concerning the change in ACE2 intracellular localization, we take into account two possible scenarios: either newly synthesized ACE2 protein is prevented from moving to the PM by a malfunctioning ER-Golgi secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), or reduced cholesterol levels at the PM cause ACE2 internalization by upsetting the ideal microenvironment for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Both scenarios are consistent with the observation that the low concentrations of U18666A employed in this study decreases the delivery of cholesterol from lysosomes to both PM and ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Although more research is needed to fully understand the effects of NPC1 inhibition on ACE2 portioning inside PM and subsequent fate, its accumulation in the autophagolysosomal compartment indirectly indicates that treatment of cells with U18666A reduces the amount of ACE2 fraction available at the PM. This offers a clear explanation for the high resistance of cells treated with U18666A to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact, it is well known that cholesterol-regulated ACE2 localization to suitable PM lipid clusters promotes viral binding and entrance, both of which - according to our data - are markedly reduced after NPC1 inhibition. Therefore, we can presume that cell treatment with U18666A hinders SARS-CoV-2 infection by modifying the cholesterol-dependent ACE2 association to PM lipid microenvironment required for virus binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). This conclusion is in agreement with the study by Takano et al., showing that membrane cholesterol levels are critical for the successful infection of host cells by feline coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Additionally, a recent study has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is strictly dependent on ACE2 portioning to appropriate PM lipid clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Conversely, because lysosomal pH is barely affected by the relatively low concentration of U18666A (2 μM) that has been used in this study to achieve NPC1 inhibition, the possibility of an antiviral effect based on the block of cathepsin protease action by an increase in lysosomal pH seems unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In addition to the impact on viral binding and entry, our results show a noteworthy reduction in released infectivity in U18666A-treated cells. Although this is in line with an impairment of viral replication as discussed above, the possibility exists that the egress of virions from infected cells is also impaired. This is because SARS-CoV-2 exploits lysosomal trafficking instead of the secretory pathway for egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Consequently, it is expected that the disruption of lysosomal transport linked to NPC1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>) will impact the release of viral particles.</p><p id="P20">Further validation of NPC1’s crucial function in controlling cell vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection is provided by experiments conducted in Caco-2 cells that have had their NPC1 expression abrogated via CRISP/R-Cas9. The two generated clones (LG5 and LD6) showed a significantly high resistance to the infection when challenged with VSV-Spike-GFP under conditions comparable to those used in U18666A-treated cells. We also provide a more concrete demonstration of NPC1 loss-of-function as a defense against SARS-CoV-2 by infecting increasing amount of LG5 and LD6 cells mixed to a fixed amount of wild-type (wt) cells. Using this approach, we were able to confirm that NPC1 expression and infection ratios are strictly correlated. Indeed, the identification of infected cells by means of either GFP or Spike expression provided the opportunity to analyze immunofluorescence data for Pearson correlation coefficient, observing the existence of a significant linear correlation between NPC1-expressing cells and Spike-positive cells. Lastly, our findings further support the study hypothesis, showing that when challenged with natural SARS-CoV-2, either U18666A-treated Caco-2 cells or LG5/LD6 cells showed a significant reduction of infection rates compared to control or wild-type cells, respectively. Moreover, the intracellular localization patterns of ACE2, in conjunction with immunofluorescence analyses of LAMP-2 and LC3B, indicate that the molecular basis of infection resistance is similar in U18666A-treated and NPC1-KO cells.</p><p id="P21">Overall, this study provides compelling evidence that NPC1 function is an important component of substantial SARS-CoV-2 infection and that blocking it may have significant therapeutic benefits.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell Culture and treatments</title><p id="P22">African green monkey kidney Vero-E6 and VERO-76 (hTMPRSS2) cells (RRID: CVCL_0603), Intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 (RRID: CVCL_0025), and human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells (RRID: CVCL_0609), were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Merck, cat #D5671) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Merck, cat #F2442), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Merck, cat #P4333), sodium pyruvate (Merck, cat #S8636), MEM non-essential Amino Acid (Merck, cat #M7145) and Normocin (Invivogen, cat #ant-nr1), in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 °C.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>A significant convergence exists between the cellular alterations associated with NPC1 inactivation and the mechanistic processes of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. These alterations affect the integrity of lipid-enriched plasma membrane microdomains and the endocytic pathway. Furthermore, the cholesterol-regulated ACE2 receptor protein that facilitates SARS-Cov-2 viral binding and entry is targeted to the autophagolysosomal compartment upon NPC1 inactivation, thus hindering virus-host cell interaction. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that NPC1 function represents a crucial factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests therapeutic opportunities.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>NPC1, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in untreated and U18666A-treated VERO-76, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells.
