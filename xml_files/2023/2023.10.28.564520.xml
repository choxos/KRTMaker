Innovations in areas such as template design and manufacturing processes are being implemented to facilitate more simple, cost-effective and scalable mRNA synthesis. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that the enzymatic steps in mRNA production (including DNA template linearization, RNA synthesis, 5′ capping and methylation) can be carried out using enzymes immobilized to a solid support. Specifically, we demonstrate efficient IVT template DNA linearization using immobilized BspQI, where the linearized template DNA can be directly used in IVT without the need of purification. We also showed that immobilized T7 RNA polymerase, Faustovirus RNA capping enzyme (FCE), vaccinia cap 2′-O-methyltransfease (2′OMTase) and a novel FCE::T7RNAP fusion enable efficient enzymatic synthesis of Cap-1 RNA in a one-pot format. This solid-phase enzymatic platform may enable highly efficient, seamless and continuous mRNA synthesis workflows that minimizes sample loss and units of operation in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Protein expression driven by exogenous synthetic mRNA was first reported in mice in 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Since then, research and development towards realizing synthetic mRNA therapeutics progressed steadily until 2020, when synthetic mRNA was used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as a vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> mRNA therapeutics have rapidly expanded since then, with many reaching clinical trials for treatment of various diseases, including heart failure and a congenital liver-specific storage disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Without the need to enter the nucleus, mRNA is a more effective and safer vaccine and therapeutic modality than DNA because of the faster protein expression, minimal risk of genome incorporation and the natural cellular degradation processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) is a cell-free production process that allows for tight control of reagents and undesirable biological contaminants. As a nucleic acid, the functionality of synthetic mRNA largely derives from its nucleotide sequence with little variation in chemical properties. Therefore, manufacturing of multiple synthetic mRNA drug substances can be readily standardized compared to recombinant proteins or small molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Thus far, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) derived from bacteriophage T7 is commonly used in IVT because of its simplicity (single protein with well-defined short promoter sequences) and high transcription efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">A functional IVT mRNA contains unique modules that contribute to the function and regulation of the molecule <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similar to endogenous mRNA, the 5′ end is modified with a 7-methylguanosine nucleoside linked through a triphosphate group to the 5′ end of mRNA. In mammals, the first nucleotide at the 5′ end is methylated at the 2′-O position of the ribose. This cap structure (Cap-1) contributes to efficient translation and evading innate immune response, among other functions. Proceeding the cap structure is a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), the open reading frame encoding the target protein, and 3′ UTR, followed by a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. The poly(A) binding proteins and translation initiation factor proteins circularize the mRNA and recruit ribosomes for initiating translation, as well as regulating the lifespan of the mRNA molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P4"><italic>In vitro</italic> mRNA synthesis involves multiple steps: DNA template preparation (comprised of plasmid preparation and linearization), the IVT reaction with templated poly(A) tail, 5′ capping and poly(A) tail addition if post-IVT enzymatic poly(A) tailing is desired. While plasmid preparation is typically done using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as the host for propagation followed by plasmid isolation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> plasmid linearization, IVT and post-transcriptional capping involves multiple enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Current workflows use separate enzymatic reactions for each of the steps. Purification of the product from the respective enzymes and reagents employed is required to avoid interference with downstream enzymatic reactions. Innovations and process design can permit consolidation of the number of overall steps. For instance, the use of cap analogs in IVT can eliminate the need for a separate RNA capping reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> However, a purification step is still required before the linearized template DNA can be used in IVT. In addition, for workflows that require enzymatic capping, the IVT product is usually purified before it can be used in RNA capping reactions.</p><p id="P5">Previously, we reported the use of immobilized SNAP-tagged poly(A) polymerase and immobilized SNAP-tagged T4 DNA ligase to Sera-Mag™ beads in direct RNA-seq, highlighting a one-pot workflow that generates a sequencing-ready library for direct loading onto a MinION flow cell. This streamlined immobilized workflow significantly lowered the input threshold for direct meta-transcriptomic RNA-seq and exhibited an improved transcriptome profiling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> SNAP-tag is a small polypeptide (20 kDa) that can easily be engineered into recombinant proteins. Immobilization via the covalent SNAP-benzylguanine linkage involves gentle conditions that are compatible to preserving enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>). We also showed that manipulation of the substrate surface chemistry, such as the addition of a hydrophilic polymer (e.g. polyethylene glycol) can significantly impact enzyme properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">In this work, we show that solid-phase catalysis can also be used to streamline <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesis of capped mRNA and reduce sample loss by eliminating purification steps. For example, plasmids linearized by immobilized BspQI can be used directly in IVT reactions without purification. In addition, some of the key enzymes in mRNA synthesis workflows exhibit excellent activity when immobilized and are more resilient to heat than their soluble counterparts. We also demonstrate that some enzymes can be used repeatedly in their immobilized form. We further show that co-immobilizing an FCE::T7RNAP fusion with vaccinia cap 2′-O-methyltransferase facilitates efficient Cap-1 mRNA synthesis in a single-step, single-vessel workflow. All in all, we show that processes requiring multiple enzymatic reactions in series can benefit from enzyme immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>), and that solid-phase enzymatic catalysis can help devise efficient, and scalable IVT processes.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>DNA template linearization using immobilized BspQI results in higher IVT output per input DNA</title><p id="P7">IVT requires DNA templates which are usually linearized plasmid DNA such that T7 RNA polymerase runs off the cleaved end of the template sequence to generate RNA transcripts that terminate at the desired position. Plasmid linearization is commonly done using a Type IIS restriction endonuclease (RE), such as BspQI, to create a “scarless” template that does not contain RE recognition sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> The linearized DNA is then purified prior to the IVT reaction to avoid undesirable reactions such as off-target cleavage of the plasmid DNA by the restriction enzyme during storage. The purification step adds time, complexity and introduces sample loss. Thus, we aimed to create a new workflow where plasmid linearization can be incorporated in-line with IVT by using immobilized BspQI in an IVT-compatible buffer so that the reaction medium containing linearized DNA template can be directly used in IVT reactions after removing the immobilized BspQI.</p><p id="P8">We first created a fusion gene expressing BspQI, a 6xHis-tag and a SNAP-tag. The SNAP-tagged BspQI fusion protein was purified and immobilized onto benzylguanine-coated magnetic beads (BspQI@BG). The estimated protein load on beads was 20 mg g<sup>-1</sup> carrier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The activity of the immobilized enzyme was first evaluated using a FAM-labeled oligonucleotide (60-bp) containing one BspQI restriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Complete cleavage of 700 nM of the DNA was achieved using 125 nM of either free or immobilized BspQI. At lower enzyme concentrations (15.62 and 7.81 nM), immobilized BspQI@BG showed approximately 15% lower activity compared to free BspQI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Free BspQI remains highly active across a broad range of temperatures, supporting greater than 80% cleavage of DNA substrates at temperatures of 25 to 37°C, and ~ 100% at 45 and 50°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.4</xref>), with a substantial activity drop at 60°C and above. Immobilized BspQI exhibited activity comparable to its free counterpart between 25 to 55°C while retaining higher activity at 60°C. Immobilized BspQI further exhibited substantial thermostability when it was re-used in cycles of 1 hour-reactions at 50°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.5</xref>), maintaining 100% activity in the first 4 cycles of reaction. Cleavage activity started to decrease at cycle 5 while exhibiting 70% activity in the 8<sup>th</sup> cycle.</p><p id="P10">Next, we tested BspQI activity on a 60-bp DNA oligo in two reaction buffers: NEBuffer 3.1, as recommended by the manufacturer, and RNA polymerase buffer, with the goal of using the cleavage product directly without the need of purification or buffer exchange. We found that both free and immobilized BspQI are more active in RNA polymerase buffer than in NEBuffer 3.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3</xref>), permitting direct interface of BspQI digestion with IVT.</p><p id="P11">To demonstrate the direct use of immobilized BspQI digestion products in IVT, a 173 nt RNA was transcribed using pRNA21 as template (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The IVT reactions were performed using (1) a traditional workflow that involves free BspQI followed by column purification and a separate IVT reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, left panel), or (2) a workflow where the template DNA was linearized by immobilized BspQI and directly used in IVT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, right panel). We found that the DNA purification step resulted in about 30% loss of linearized DNA product in the traditional workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.6</xref>). In contrast, DNA loss was not observed using immobilized BspQI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, right panel). We further assessed the impact of the workflow on IVT yield. We found that with the same amount of input DNA, the RNA yield was approximately two-fold higher using the immobilized BspQI workflows compared to the free enzyme workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, middle panel). Therefore, the use of immobilized BspQI can facilitate consolidation of plasmid linearization and IVT for a streamlined and efficient mRNA synthesis process.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription using immobilized T7 RNA polymerase</title><p id="P12">To try to further streamline the mRNA synthesis process, we created a SNAP-tagged T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) construct and immobilized the purified SNAP-tagged T7 RNAP protein on BG-magnetic beads.

Although the use of cap analogs allows for one-pot capped RNA synthesis, only a small fraction of input cap analog is incorporated into the RNA molecule, leaving most of the cap analog unusable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup></p><p id="P28">Current workflows require separate enzymatic reactions for plasmid template linearization, IVT using templated poly(A) tail incorporation, followed by enzymatic RNA capping with intermediate purifications, dilutions, or buffer exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> Streaming the manufacturing can help reduce cost and make mRNA manufacturing more environmentally sustainable. To that end, we engineered major mRNA synthesis enzymes to be immobilized to solid supports and assessed the immobilized enzymes′ performance in terms of enzyme activity, reusability, and in sequential and combined workflow settings.</p><p id="P29">We report that the immobilized enzymes exhibit similar or improved enzymatic properties compared to their solution counterparts, and that the use of immobilized enzymes in mRNA synthesis offers several advantages over the current multi-stage workflows. For example, immobilized BspQI facilitates direct interface of template linearization to IVT, eliminating the linearized plasmid purification step and improving the RNA yield per input circular plasmid. Eliminating the purification step can also prevent damage to the plasmid DNA (such as nicking) or carryover of chaotropic and organic agents used in linearized DNA purification into IVT reactions. FCE and vaccinia cap 2′-O-methyltransferase exhibit excellent enzyme activity upon repeated use in reaction cycles, potentially making mRNA synthesis a more sustainable process.</p><p id="P30">In eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis, mRNA capping is directly coupled to RNA synthesis through interactions of RNA capping enzyme with the C-terminal domain repeat sequences of RNA polymerase II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> Additional evidence supports capping enzyme-RNAP interactions separate from the CTD, and the positioning of the TPase and GTase active sites of the RNA capping enzyme at the vicinity of the RNA exit tunnel of the RNA polymerase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> Capping of nascent transcripts before their release from RNAP is an efficient natural mechanism to install the cap structures. To reproduce co-transcriptional enzymatic capping in vitro, we showed that high Cap-0 and Cap-1 mRNA (up to 95%) can be achieved using an FCE::T7RNAP fusion protein (manuscript produced concurrently). We further show in this report that co-immobilized FCE::T7RNAP fusion-cap 2′OMTase is highly effective in generating Cap-1 RNA in a one-pot co-transcriptional capping format.</p><p id="P31">In addition, immobilized enzymes could exhibit superior properties such as higher thermostability/thermoactivity, reusability and the capability of adapting a continuous flow format, as already demonstrated for many relevant enzyme-catalyzed reactions in chemical and pharmaceutical industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> These attributes can be advantageous for scale up and scale out approaches to increasing the capacity and specialization of mRNA manufacturing process. More research on immobilization substrates, surface chemistry and reaction format (such as continuous flow) can further improve the performance and the applicability of immobilized enzymes in processes such as mRNA manufacturing and molecular diagnostic applications.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, we show that solid-phase catalysts can streamline and open new possibilities for mRNA manufacturing. Elimination of intermediate purification steps and conducting one-pot multiple enzymatic reactions through enzyme immobilization and the use of novel enzyme fusions may help increase the environmental sustainability of mRNA synthesis at scale by reducing waste and reliance on cap analogs manufactured by organic synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p id="P33">Carboxylate-Modified Magnetic Beads (Sera-Mag™; 50 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and chromatography columns HiTrap® diethylaminoethyl (DEAE), HisTrap® Ni Sepharose and HiTrap® Heparin were purchased from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA).
