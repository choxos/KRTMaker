However, the success of existing chemotherapeutics can be compromised by tumor cell resistance and systemic off-target effects. Therefore, the discovery of pro-apoptotic compounds with minimal systemic side-effects is crucial. 14-3-3 proteins are molecular scaffolds that serve as important regulators of cell survival. Our previous study demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ can sequester BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family, in the cytoplasm and prevent its translocation to mitochondria to inhibit the induction of apoptosis. Despite being a critical mechanism of cell survival, it is unclear whether disrupting 14-3-3 protein:BAD interactions could be harnessed as a chemotherapeutic approach. Herein, we established a BRET-based high-throughput drug screening approach (Z’-score= 0.52) capable of identifying molecules that can disrupt 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions. An FDA-approved drug library containing 1971 compounds was used for screening, and the capacity of identified hits to induce cell death was examined in NIH3T3- fibroblasts and colorectal cancer cell lines, HT-29 and Caco-2. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest that terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide could be potentially repurposed for treating colorectal cancer. Moreover, our screening method demonstrates the feasibility of identifying pro-apoptotic agents that can be applied towards conditions where aberrant cell growth or function are key determinants of disease pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>High-throughput screening</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd><kwd>BAD</kwd><kwd>14-3-3</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated process of cell suicide. During apoptosis, cells break down into apoptotic bodies and are eventually engulfed by phagocytes like macrophages and neutrophils<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. With limited leakage of a cell’s content into the extracellular environment, apoptosis can minimize the damage to surrounding cells. The identification of molecules that safely and selectively induce apoptosis holds significant potential in treating a variety of conditions, such as cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P3">Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second most deadly cancer and accounted for about 9.4% of cancer-induced mortality in 2020<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]</sup>. CRC carcinogenesis originates from either the colon or the rectum, and most malignant adenomas develop initially from benign polyps<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]</sup>. Current therapies for CRC involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery; however, resistance to existing chemotherapeutics often leads to poor clinical outcomes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup>. Accordingly, it remains important to discover novel compounds that induce apoptosis in CRC cells.</p><p id="P4">An example of an chemotherapeutic that exploits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is Venetoclax (ABT-199). ABT-199 is a specific inhibitor of BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>. The effectiveness of ABT-199 in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) highlights the potential of targeting the actions of the BCL-2 protein to treat cancers. We previously demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ, a member of the 14-3-3 scaffold protein family, plays an essential role in maintaining the survival of MIN6 insulinoma cells through its inhibitory actions on pro-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, such as BAD and BAX<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup>. In healthy murine cells, 14-3-3 proteins sequester BAD in the cytoplasm by interacting with phosphorylated Ser112 and Ser136 residues on BAD<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</sup>. However, the induction of cell death or prolonged cell stress results in these serine residues becoming dephosphorylated, leading to the dissociation of 14-3-3 protein:BAD complexes. This allows BAD to translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with other BCL-2 proteins, such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL, to initiate apoptosis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P5">14-3-3 proteins have been found to play important roles in cancer cell survival<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup>.

From preclinical studies to clinical trials, and ultimately to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the estimated average cost per drug was over $1.5 billion between 2009 to 2018, with a development time of up to over 20 years<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>. However, even with such huge investments, only 10% of drugs that enter phase I clinical trials are approved<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup>. Given the challenges of new drug development, repurposing already approved compounds for new indications could be an attractive strategy, as it saves both time and costs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup>. To date, the most comprehensive compound screen aimed at identifying disruptors of 14-3-3 protein:BAD PPIs was performed with a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based approach, and while 16 hits were discovered from over 52100 examined compounds, an important caveat was that this assay was based on a cell-free system involving recombinant proteins<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>.Thus, it was not possible to discern if identified hits would act via receptor-mediated pathways or be transported into a cell to disrupt 14-3-3 protein:BAD PPIs.</p><p id="P7">Herein, we have developed an innovative BRET(bioluminescence resonance energy transfer)-based biosensor to detect 14-3-3 protein:BAD PPIs in intact, living cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup>. Using this sensor and an FDA-approved drug library containing 1971 compounds, we first identified 101 hits through a high throughput screening (HTS) approach in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. We next evaluated the capacity of these hits to induce cell death, and 41 compounds emerged as potential candidates. Based on their original indications and routes of administration, we further selected 13 drugs to assess their effectiveness in inducing apoptotic cell death in CRC cell lines, HT-29 and Caco-2. Our screening workflow has identified terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide as potent candidate molecules that can potentially be repurposed as chemotherapies towards inducing CRC cell death.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>BRET sensor construction</title><p id="P8">The original plasmids containing 14-3-3ζ, BAD, and BAD mutants were kind gifts from Dr. Herman Spaink and Dr. Aviva M Tolkovsky, respectively<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup>.

Treatment of sensor-expressing cells with FTY720 and I,2-5 significantly reduced BRET in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>). To optimize conditions for the following HTS, we next determined the optimal incubation time and found that 3 hours was required to reduce the magnitude of BRET to the same degree as BAD-112-136-AA, which indicated a maximal effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E,3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Screening for FDA-approved pro-apoptotic drugs</title><p id="P21">The successful implementation of our BRET-based sensor in living cells permitted the screening of previously-approved drugs (PADs) that could disrupt 14-3-3 protein:BAD interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The primary screen was conducted in a 384-well plate format and 1971 compounds were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found the median BRET reduction caused by compounds capable of reducing BRET was approximately 25%, and there were 416, 162, 31, and 16 PADs that reduced the BRET signal by 25% at concentrations of 200 μM, 20 μM, and 2 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Of these, 101 PADs showed consistent results and were further assessed for their capacity to induce cell death in NIH-3T3 cells via Hoechst/propidium iodide incorporation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Scatter density plots were used to visualize the relationship between BRET reduction and the induction of cell death at 24 and 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, 4E</xref>), and 41 PADs were found to reduce BRET by more than 34%, which is consistant with the reduction in BRET caused by 112-136F-AA-mCitrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), and induce cell death greater than 30% (Zone A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>14-3-3ζ inhibits BAD-induced cell death in CRC cells</title><p id="P22">To explore the potential of identified hits to treat diseases by triggering apoptosis in aberrant cells, we selected CRC as our disease model. We first determined whether the disruption of 14-3-3 protein:BAD PPIs could induce cell death in CRC cells. Two colorectal cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, were transfected with either BAD-mCitrine or BAD-AA-mCitrine, followed by incubation with FTY-720 or R18. BAD translocation to mitochondria following 14-3-3 protein inhibition was similar to what was observed in NIH-3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, 5B</xref>). Additionally, cell death was assessed following the over-expression of BAD or BAD-AA. After 72 hours post-transfection, a significantly higher degree of cell death was observed in cells co-expressing 14-3-3ζ and BAD-AA, compared to those only expressing 14-3-3ζ (control) or co-expressing 14-3-3ζ and BAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, 5D</xref>). These observations imply that when 14-3-3ζ is unable to sequester BAD due to S112/136A mutations or due to the presence of 14-3-3 inhibitors in CRC cells, BAD translocates to the mitochondria to induce cell death.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Examination of hits in CRC cells</title><p id="P23">Among the 41 identified lead PADs from our primary screen in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, some were immediately found to be unsuitable for systemic administration if re-purposed as chemotherapy. For example, crystal violet is a synthetic dye used for cell staining<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>];</sup> whereas some PADs are topical treatments, such as cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and thonzonium bromide<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]</sup>. Various PADs are already used as chemotherapeutics, such as entrectinib, ceritinib, and ponatinib<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]</sup>. After excluding these PADs, 25 were assessed on Caco-2 and HT-29 CRC cells. Of these, 15 PADs caused more than 30% of cell death at 24 hours or 48 hours in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), and further filtering of pro-drugs, salts, and potency narrowed our list to 13 PAD candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Dose-response studies were then conducted with these 13 agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-6N</xref>). Lomibuvir, terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide were found to be the most effective, as they significantly induced cell death at concentrations as low as 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G, 6I, 6L, 6N</xref>). Although lomibuvir consistently induced cell death at different concentrations, its efficacy in the magnitude of cell death attained was inferior to other candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6N</xref>), and it was excluded from further study.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Verifying the capacity of terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide to induce apoptosis in cancer cells</title><p id="P24">Different pathways, such as apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, can account for cell death<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. To ensure that these lead PADs induced apoptotic cell death via the disruption of 14-3-3 protein:BAD PPIs, we further assessed the relationship between apoptosis via hoechst/propidium iodide/annexin V incorporation and the mitochondrial translocation of BAD upon drug exposure. Given that caspase activation is a hallmark of apoptosis, a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, was used to attenuate lead PAD-induced apoptosis. According to time courses of PI and Annexin V incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A, B, F, G, K, L</xref>), differences in the kinetics of cell death or apoptosis were seen with lead PADs in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, such that terfenadine and penfluridol were able to induce cell death and apoptosis more rapidly than lomitapide. To assess caspase-dependent apoptosis, HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were treated for 24 hours with terfenadine (10uM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C, 7D</xref>) and penfluridol (10uM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H, 7I</xref>), or for 48 hours for lomitapide (10uM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7M, 7N</xref>), in addition to the presence of Z-VAD-FMK or the control inhibitor Z-FA-FMK. Significantly diminished lead PAD-induced propidium iodide and/or annexin-V incorporation was observed in cells pre-treated with Z-VAD-FMK compared to those pre-treated with either DMSO or a control inhibitor Z-FA-FMK, implying caspase activation following lead administration. Additionally, confocal imaging showed that mitochondrial translocation of BAD occurred after the addition of lead PADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E, 7G, 7O</xref>), demonstrating that disruption of 14-3-3:BAD PPIs by lead PADs induces apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Cancer arises from uncontrolled cell proliferation, and one of the primary goals of chemotherapies is to induce cancer cell death. The overexpression of 14-3-3ζ and its related isoforms in the context of cancer has long been associated with poor clinical outcomes due to increased cell survival <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]</sup>. Although it has been demonstrated that inhibiting 14-3-3ζ triggers apoptosis in cancer cells, there are currently no approved chemotherapies that target 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]</sup>. The primary aim of this study was to explore the possibility of identifying anti-CRC compounds by their capacity to interrupt 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions, and this was executed by the generation of a biosensor capable of detecting 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs. While a cell-free compound screen has been used in discovering inhibitors of 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs, limited data exist on whether these drugs are able to induce apoptosis in living cells or animal models<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>. To address this limitation, we developed a BRET-based biosensor that was capable of detecting 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs in living cells.</p><p id="P26">In this study, we utilized a short fragment of murine BAD to construct the BRET sensor rather than the full-length BAD. Previous research has demonstrated that BAD overexpression leads to apoptosis in various cell types<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]</sup>, and an advantage of using the BAD-112-136F is its inability to interact with its client BCL-2 proteins due to the lack of BH-3 domain, leading to reduced cytotoxicity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, it was not possible to detect BRET when the Rluc8 acceptor and mCitrine donor were fused to 14-3-3ζ and full-length BAD, respectively. Since energy transfer between Rluc8 and mCitrine requires a distance shorter than 10nm, we assumed that the inability to detect BRET was due to the distance between the fusion sites and interaction sites. Indeed, in another study using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a technique where a fluorescent protein is used as an energy donor instead of luciferase, the FRET acceptor was directly fused to the serine residue that mediates interactions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, different truncated forms of BAD were generated to identify the optimal fusion strategy for measuring BRET efficiency between 14-3-3ζ-Rluc and BAD-truncate-mCitrine. Given that the interactions between 14-3-3ζ and BAD occur between the C-terminus of 14-3-3 and S112 or/and S136 of BAD, it was not surprising that the combination of 14-3-3ζ-Rluc8 and 112-136F-mCitrine represented the optimal combination in the constructing the BRET sensor<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P27">Since it was uncertain if the BAD-112-136F could represent the full-length BAD in its interactions with 14-3-3ζ, further evaluations were conducted by introducing mutations at Ser-Ala mutations at S112 and/or S136. Unlike the S112A mutation, S136A significantly disrupted the association between 14-3-3 and BAD-112-136F, as indicated by reduced BRET. This aligns with a prior study suggesting that S136, rather than S112, primarily mediates 14-3-3:BAD interactions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, in contrast to 112-136F-AA, 112-136F is specifically sequestered in the cytoplasm. This indicates that 14-3-3ζ interacts with this truncated form similarly to how it interacts with full-length BAD, but only if the serine residues crucial for 14-3-3:BAD interactions remain intact.</p><p id="P28">To assess the capacity of this sensor to discover disruptors of 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs, we introduced two well-known 14-3-3 inhibitors, FTY720 and I-2,5, and both compounds signficantly reduced BRET. It is worth mentioning that we did not assess if there were any differences in affinity between 14-3-3ζ:BAD and 14-3-3ζ:112-136F. Nevertheless, drugs identified to disrupt 14-3-3ζ:112-136F PPI should be effective, as this smaller fragment likely accesses the binding groove of 14-3-3ζ more readily than the full-length BAD<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the high homology among different 14-3-3 isoforms permits them to share client proteins and form homo- or hetero-dimers, suggesting that the identified PADs are highly likely to disrupt PPIs not only between BAD and 14-3-3ζ but also between BAD and other 14-3-3 isoforms<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]</sup>. An important caveat of our reporter system is that we cannot distinguish if PADs directly block or disrupt the amphipathic groove of 14-3-3ζ where PPIs occur or if PADs promote the dephosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser136F on the BAD fragment<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]</sup>. Additional studies are required to examine the mechanisms of action of each lead PAD.</p><p id="P29">The efficiency of utilizing HTS to develop novel anti-cancer compounds has been underscored by the discovery of sorafenib, palbociclib, and ABT-199<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]</sup>. However, a recognized drawback of this drug discovery approach is the increased risk of false positives and false negatives due to the lack of replication and the use of miniaturized reaction systems<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]</sup>. To increase the chances of identifying potential compounds, we first ensured the robustness of our sensor by achieving a Z-factor greater than 0.5<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup>. Secondly, to minimize false negatives, we tested each compound twice at four different concentrations in our primary screens but only recorded the highest BRET reduction for each concentration.</p><p id="P30">After evaluating the capacity of identified compounds to induce cell death in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, a group of drugs that decreased BRET by more than 34% and triggered more than 30% of cell death emerged as potential hits capable of killing target cells by disrupting 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs. Interestingly, this BRET reduction aligns with that caused by 112-136F-AA-mCitirine, suggesting that the ability of a compound to completely dissociate the 14-3-3ζ:112-136F complex is indicative of its potential to induce cell death. Another group of drugs also arose from our screens such that they were capable of reducing BRET reduction by more than 34%, but without notable efficacy in inducing cell death in NIH-3T3 cells. A possible explanation for this is that our screening is based on a cell-based assay<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup>, and the complex intracellular environment makes it challenging to determine whether the dissociation of 14-3-3ζ:BAD resulted from a direct inhibitory action on 14-3-3ζ or BAD, or an indirect effect on the upstream signaling pathways that promote 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions. Therefore, other than disrupting 14-3-3:BAD interactions, these compounds may have additional effects, such as up-regulating anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, which promote cell survival<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P31">Although the altered expression of 14-3-3 in CRC has been reported in several studies, the role of 14-3-3ζ:BAD in the survival of CRC cells remains unclear<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]</sup>. Our research provides the first evidence that disruption of 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs can promote CRC cell death. We used two representative CRC cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, to validate our assay<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]</sup>. Terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide were selected as lead compounds after conducting dose-response studies with 13 selected compounds. Additionally, we also collected data on the efficacy of all 101 compounds that were identified from the primary screen in inducing cell death in these two CRC cell types at 20uM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). These data would be invaluable for future research exploring the different capacities of drugs to target CRC cells.</p><p id="P32">To confirm that lead PADs induce apoptotic cell death by disrupting 14-3-3ζ:BAD PPIs, we further tested whether inhibiting caspase activation could mitigate lead PAD-induced cell death and if these lead PADs could promote the mitochondrial translocation of BAD. In most cases, Z-VAD-FMK treatment prevented increases in PI-positive and Annexin-V-positive cells; however, in lomitapide-treated Caco-2 cells, Z-VAD-FMK had no effect on propidium iodide incorporation, despite preventing annexin V incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7M</xref>). This is likely due to the kinetics of lomitapide in Caco-2 cells whereby the early stages of apoptosis, marked by the binding of annexin V to phosphatidylserine, is being observed, without a loss of membrane integrity that is needed for propidium iodide entry into the cell<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]</sup>. As Z-VAD-FMK cannot inhibit necroptosis, a process where cells shift to necrosis when they cannot complete apoptosis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]</sup>, it is possible that other forms of cell death may also be occuring. Nevertheless, confocal imaging showed that all three lead PADs trigger the mitochondria translocation of BAD, confirming apoptotic cell death.</p><p id="P33">With the variability of 14-3-3 protein expression across individuals, a personalized medicine approach could be undertaken to explore the potential of lead PADs to treat CRC by careful evaluation of tissues from people living with CRC<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]</sup>. A significant advantage of our screening strategy is our focus on repurposing drugs from PADs. Therefore, all of our identified hits have been tested for their safety in prior phase 1 clinical trials. Interestingly, penfluridol and lomitapide have been previously suggested to have potential for treating CRC, but their mechanisms were not fully defined<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]</sup>. Our study not only further validates their therapeutic value but also provides insight into the mechanism by which these drugs may ameliorate CRC. Nevertheless, additional in-depth pre-clinical studies in animal models are required. We recognize that PADs may also have effects in other cell types, and improving cell type specificity is clearly warranted<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>. A potential approach could also be to adopt a localized use of PADs to treat colorectal tumors, wherebyregional drug administration might also enhance the specificity of these compounds<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P34">With the use of a novel BRET-based sensor to monitor 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions in living cells, we successfully identified terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide as having the abilities to disrupt 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions and induce apoptosis of CRC cells. Although further research is critical to validate the ability of these compounds to ameliorate CRC in animal models and in humans, these hits represent potential chemical backbones that can be modified and translated into new chemical entities for the treatment of CRC.

Cells were transfected with BRET sensor or control sensors in 10 cm dishes and allowed 48 hours for sensor expression. Subsequently, cells were harvested and re-plated into 384-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to drug screening. Diluted previously-approved drugs (PADs) were added to corresponding wells with final concentrations of 200 μM, 20 μM, 2 μM, and 200 nM, respectively. After a 3-hour incubation, the BRET ratio was measured Each PAD was assessed twice at each concentration, but only the highest value for each concentration was recorded.

(<bold>C</bold>) Subsequent screenings were conducted at 20 μM, And PADs were selected based on the median BRET reduction (26.80%) of those that demonstrated a BRET reduction greater than zero. To include the hits near this threshold, a BRET reduction of 25% was set as the selection criterion for primary screening. This led to the selection of 162 PADs for re-screening in a 96-well plate format. (<bold>D, E</bold>) 101 hits were further selected to assess their capacity to induce cell death in NIH-3T3 cells. Hoechst/propidium iodide incorporation assays were used to examine cell death, calculated as the ratio of propidium iodide-positive cells to Hoechst-positive cells. Cell death data were collected from three independent experiments, each with duplicate measurements. Scatter density plots are used to visualize the relationship between drug-induced BRET reduction and their capacity to induce cell death at 24 hours (D) or 48 hours (E) post-treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192843-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Over-expression of BAD leads to the death of colorectal cancel cells (CRCs)</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) Caco-2 (A) and HT-29 (B) were made to express mCitrine-conjugated BAD (BAD) or BAD mutants harboring S112A and S136A double mutations (BAD-AA).
