Here, we couple a CRISPR-based method for induction of ecDNA with extensive characterization of newly formed ecDNA to examine ecDNA biogenesis. We find that DNA circularization is efficient, irrespective of 3D genome context, with formation of a 1 Mb and 1.8 Mb ecDNA both reaching 15%. We show non-homologous end joining and microhomology mediated end joining both contribute to ecDNA formation, while inhibition of DNA-PKcs and ATM have opposing impacts on ecDNA formation. EcDNA and the corresponding chromosomal excision scar form at significantly different rates and respond differently to DNA-PKcs and ATM inhibition. Taken together, our results support a model of ecDNA formation in which double strand break ends dissociate from their legitimate ligation partners prior to joining of illegitimate ends to form the ecDNA and excision scar.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Significance</title><p id="P3">Our study harnesses a CRISPR-based method to examine ecDNA biogenesis, uncovering efficient circularization between DSBs. ecDNAs and their corresponding chromosomal scars can form via NHEJ or MMEJ, but the ecDNA and scar formation processes are distinct.

Potent oncogenes are frequently encoded on ecDNA and can become massively amplified in copy number and upregulated in gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). ecDNA is circular and acentric, ranging in size from 100 kb to several Mb(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Due to their lack of centromeres, ecDNA are randomly segregated at cell division and drive intratumoral heterogeneity, facilitating rapid genomic changes to adapt to treatment or metabolic stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Despite these advances, the biogenesis of ecDNA remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Multiple mechanisms of ecDNA formation have been proposed, including circularization of DNA segments generated by two or more breaks on the same chromosome arm, which we term “excisional ecDNA formation”, or ligation of multiple segments resulting from chromothripsis. Mechanistic investigations of ecDNA formation have proved challenging, as current studies rely on patient samples, patient-derived cell lines, or cell lines subjected to drug selections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In these studies, the requirement for selection—either within the tumor microenvironment or <italic>in vitro</italic>—of rare cells possessing spontaneously-generated ecDNA obscures the process of ecDNA formation. More recently, ecDNA have been engineered in human cells and mice using Cre-lox, enabling examination of ecDNA without extended selection for ecDNA+ cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, due to the use of Cre-mediated recombination to form ecDNA, this method cannot be used to examine the process of ecDNA formation itself.</p><p id="P6">Mechanistic understanding of excisional ecDNA biogenesis has thus remained elusive. We consider two primary models for how excisional ecDNA formation may occur based on the literature: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) the end-swapping model, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) the dissociation model. In the end-swapping model, the two double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo synapsis, holding each end in close proximity to its legitimate partner. Subsequently, these two synapses come into close physical proximity, the repair foci merge, and the ends are swapped and ligated, generating the ecDNA and chromosomal excision scar. The end-swapping model is analogous to the mechanism of reciprocal translocations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In the dissociation model, a failure to form or maintain the DSB synapses is followed by dissociation of the legitimate DSB end partners away from one another. Approximation and ligation of the ecDNA and excision scar thus proceed as relatively independent processes. These two models yield divergent predictions for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) the impact of chromosome conformation on circularization efficiency, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) the relative rates of ecDNA vs. scar formation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) the similarity of repair signatures on ecDNA and scar junctions, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) whether inhibition of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins would differentially impact ecDNA vs scar formation. To test these predictions and distinguish between these models, there is a need for model systems that enable us to study ecDNA molecules immediately after formation. Further, such models would provide an opportunity to directly identify factors that may enhance ecDNA formation.</p><p id="P7">We recently applied CRISPR-C, a CRISPR-based method for generating circular DNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), to the study of early ecDNA evolutionary dynamics, quantifying the relationship between selection pressure strength and ecDNA abundance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). CRISPR-C offers temporal control and flexibility in loci selection, while also relying on endogenous DNA repair pathways for DNA circularization. Here, we use CRISPR-C to examine the process of ecDNA biogenesis itself. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), fluorescence microscopy, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and targeted deep sequencing of ecDNA and scar junctions, we directly examine the early stages of ecDNA formation following excision from chromosomes. We find that circularization of megabase scale DNA fragments between DSBs is efficient. We show that ligation of the ecDNA and its corresponding chromosomal excision scar can be mediated by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Pharmacologic inhibition of DNA-PK favors ecDNA formation, whereas ATM inhibition limits it. Collectively, these results validate the dissociation model of excisional ecDNA formation, shedding light on some of the molecular processes involved in its formation.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Generation of ecDNA with CRISPR-C</title><p id="P8">CRISPR-Cas9 can be delivered into cells to induce DNA breaks. Two breaks on the same chromosome can be ligated to form a DNA circle and leave behind an excision scar, a method termed CRISPR-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). To validate the utility of CRISPR-C for the study of ecDNA, we investigated whether we could generate ecDNA containing MYC, one of the oncogenes most frequently amplified on ecDNA in human cancers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We designed CRISPR guides to excise a region that encompassed the entire chromosome 8 span of a MYC-containing ecDNA found in COLO320-DM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), with two guides targeting the centromeric end and three guides targeting the telomeric end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-C</xref>). We delivered Cas9 with all pairwise permutations of centromeric and telomeric guide pairs into the near-haploid Hap1 cell line. Circularization was detected for all 6 guide combinations by inverse PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Quantitative analysis by ddPCR revealed mean circularization frequencies ranging from 1.12 to 2.89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>), while no circle junctions were detected when only a single centromeric guide was delivered. We repeated this experiment with 4 different pairs of guides to generate a 1.8 Mb DHFR-containing ecDNA, again detecting ecDNA for all guide pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E-F</xref>).To confirm that CRISPR-C resulted in ecDNA rather than other structural rearrangements, we performed DNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosome spreads and validated the extrachromosomal localization of CRISPR-C excised ecDNA (using DHFR L1 and R2 sgRNAs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>3D chromosome conformation has limited impact on circularization frequency</title><p id="P9">Translocations occur more frequently between spatially proximal loci, being particularly enriched between intrachromosomal sites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In <italic>cis</italic>, translocation frequencies correlate with Hi-C contact probability and decrease with linear distance out to approximately 60 Mb(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Single-segment ecDNA generation is a form of intrachromosomal (cis) translocation, and it may be necessary to consider genome conformation when designing CRISPR-C guide RNAs. The end-swapping model predicts that ecDNA formation should be more efficient for spatially proximal loci, as only limited motion is required to merge the repair foci. Conversely, ecDNA formation would be expected to be less influenced by spatial proximity under the dissociation model, as diffusion of legitimate DSB ends away from one another is a defining feature of the model.</p><p id="P10">EcDNAs range in size from approximately 100 kb to 5 Mb(2), so we focused on the impact of chromosome conformation and Hi-C contact probability on ecDNA generation efficiency between sites separated by ∼1 Mb. We first mapped intrachromosomal interactions in Hap1 cells with Hi-C, identifying an approximately 1Mb loop on chromosome 1 that lacked the conformational complexity of the MYC and DHFR loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S2A-B</xref>). We designed guides targeting the ends of the loop, which exhibit high contact frequency between each other, or approximately 1 Mb outside of the loop, which exhibit minimal contact frequencies with the other guide target sites. We performed CRISPR-C using different combinations of these guides, revealing efficient ecDNA generation for all guide pairs tested. Circularization occurred at modestly higher frequencies for guides targeting the sites with high contact probabilities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 2C</xref>). After normalizing for the activity of the individual guides, however, we found no significant increase in circularization frequency using guides targeting sites with high contact frequencies relative to guides targeting sites with low contact frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S2D</xref>). These data suggest that the 3D conformation of the native chromatin has limited impact on the formation of circular ecDNA using CRISPR-C, providing indirect evidence to support the dissociation model.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ecDNA and excision scar formation exhibit divergent, site-dependent formation rates</title><p id="P11">In some ecDNA+ patient-derived samples and cell lines, a deletion exists in the corresponding native chromosomal locus, which we term the “excision scar” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). While the end-swapping model predicts that the excised circle and the excision scar left behind should form at a 1:1 ratio, we previously observed that excision scar formation was less efficient than circularization when generating DHFR ecDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). To determine if this is a general phenomenon, we quantified the efficiency of excision scar formation for the 6 guide pairs used to generate MYC ecDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). As with the DHFR locus, the circle and scar exhibited unequal formation frequencies. However, for the 6 MYC-ecDNA generating guide pairs, scar formation was more efficient than ecDNA formation. These results indicate ecDNA and scar formation are to some degree independent processes, consistent with the dissociation model of ecDNA formation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ecDNA and excision scar formation involve NHEJ and MMEJ</title><p id="P12">While there is evidence of ecDNAs forming via several avenues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), the mechanisms responsible for ligation to form a covalently closed circle remain unclear. NHEJ is capable of ligating free DSB ends to generate translocations, but its rapidity also opposes translocations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ) can also mediate translocations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), and microhomologies of 1-5 bp have been found in the ecDNA circle junctions of gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To examine the contributions of these pathways to ecDNA generation, we performed targeted deep sequencing of ecDNA circle junctions and the excision scar junctions left on the linear chromosome after CRISPR-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Interestingly, we found that ecDNA circle junctions and the chromosomal excision scar junctions exhibited distinct ligation sequence characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Although deletions were prevalent in both types of junctions, ecDNA circle junction sequences also exhibited frequent perfect direct ligations, where the two DSBs were ligated without any additional or missing bases, while insertions were rare. By contrast, scar junctions were more likely to contain insertions, while perfect direct ligations were comparatively less common. These different ligation sequence characteristics of the circular ecDNA and the linear chromosome scars suggested that distinct DNA repair processes may underlie the respective formation of their junctions, supporting the dissociation model of excisional ecDNA formation.</p><p id="P14">To examine the role of microhomology in circle and scar ligation, we classified ligation outcomes as either containing microhomology (MH)—possessing ≥ 1bp of microhomology—or microhomology-less (MH-less). For the purposes of this analysis, all insertions were classified as MH-less. For MH alleles, we also determined the length of microhomology. We found that circle and scar ligation products (junctions) frequently exhibited microhomology, and the frequency of microhomology was highly guide dependent for both circles and scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Microhomology usage was slightly more prevalent among circle junctions, but this difference was only statistically significant for two guide pairs.</p><p id="P15">We next examined the allele distributions for each guide pair tested(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). For the DHFR ecDNA, the most common circle junction was a 5 bp deletion exhibiting 3bp of microhomology, while perfect direct ligation was the second most common junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). These two alleles accounted for 70.61% ± 0.55 (s.e.m, n = 3) of all circle junctions. For all guides tested, both circle and scar junctions were dominated by only a few alleles. Generally, the majority of circle junctions comprise the direct ligation product as well as 1-5 MMEJ mediated deletions, except for MYC CRISPR-C pairs involving one specific CRISPR guide (sgRNA6), for which 1bp insertions were common (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S3-4</xref>). The DHFR circle junction sequence distributions tended to remain stable over time under neutral selection pressure, while the scar junction showed more variability across timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DNA-PK inhibition promotes ecDNA generation but not excision scar formation</title><p id="P16">We next sought to investigate whether perturbing DSB repair processes could impact circularization efficiency, as well as further distinguish between the end-swapping and dissociation models of excisional ecDNA formation. In human cells, most DSBs are rapidly repaired by NHEJ, and rapid synapse formation suppresses translocations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), whereas DSBs that persist have more time to pair with other DSBs and generate translocations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is rapidly recruited to DSBs by Ku, which leads to its activation and promotion of NHEJ. While DNA-PKcs phosphorylates many substrates, it’s autophosphorylation appears to be essential for short-range synapsis and NHEJ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Pharmacologic inhibition of DNA-PKcs inhibits its autophosphorylation, leads to its retention on DSB ends, increases DSB persistence, and ultimately results in an increase in the frequency of translocations (12,20,25–28). We reasoned that treatment with a DNA-PKcs inhibitor would similarly favor CRISPR-C mediated ecDNA generation, which is a form of intrachromosomal translocation. To test this hypothesis, we treated Hap1 cells with 1 uM of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor AZD7648 following CRISPR-C and found that DNA-PKcs inhibition significantly increased ecDNA generation frequency by 2.2-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>, 15.23 ± 0.73% vs. 6.65 ± 0.47% in DMSO control, s.e.m., n = 3). Pre-incubation of cells with drug for 1 hour prior to electroporation did not further increase circularization efficiency.</p><p id="P17">Next, we examined whether inhibition of other DNA damage response (DDR) proteins would affect circularization efficiency. We confirmed that inhibition of DNA-PKcs promoted the formation of ecDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Of the other inhibitors tested, only treatment with the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 had a significant effect. ATM inhibition decreased ecDNA formation by 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, 4.40 ± 0.24% vs. 11.02 ± 0.51% s.e.m, n = 3, P = 3.0x10<sup>-4</sup>), whereas inhibition of LIG4, ATR, and PARP (by SCR7, Berzosertib, and Talazoparib, respectively), had no appreciable impact on circularization efficiency.</p><p id="P18">In addition to promoting translocations, DNA-PKcs inhibition has been shown to favor MMEJ-mediated repair of CRISPR-induced DSBs over NHEJ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Examination of the DHFR ecDNA circle junction sequences demonstrated that DNA-PKcs inhibition decreased the frequency of perfect direct ligation, with a corresponding increase in the frequency of the 5bp MMEJ-mediated junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>). This shift in pathway usage further validates the involvement of both NHEJ and MMEJ in ecDNA formation, and the ability of these two pathways to compensate for each other in this process. Intriguingly, none of the compounds tested appreciably impacted scar formation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). DNA-PK inhibition resulted in a modest decrease in scar formation relative to DMSO, but this effect did not rise to statistical significance (P = 0.086 two-sided t-test). As further evidence of its differential impact on ecDNA vs excision scar formation, DNA-PK inhibition also had little impact on the scar junction sequences or MH usage, in contrast to its promotion of MMEJ at the circle junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>). The differential impact of both DNA-PK and ATM inhibition on ecDNA and excision scar formation demonstrates they are separate processes, in agreement with the dissociation model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this report, we have harnessed CRISPR-C to examine the formation of ecDNAs in human cells, demonstrating that excisional ecDNA formation occurs via the dissociation model rather than the end-swapping model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F-G</xref>). The end-swapping model predicts that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) circularization of spatially proximal DSBs will be more efficient than between sites with low Hi-C contact frequencies, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) ecDNA and excision scar formation rates will be near-equivalent, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) the repair signatures at circle junctions will be similar, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) that the impact of DDR inhibitors on ecDNA and scar formation would be similar. All four tests proved contrary to these predictions, which positively supports the dissociation model.</p><p id="P20">It is well established that spatial proximity, and Hi-C contact frequency specifically, are associated with higher translocation rates(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, we did not detect significant association of greater Hi-C contact probability with CRISPR-C efficiency, at least for circularizing a 1 Mb chromosomal segment. Previous studies have shown that greater than 90% of intrachromosomal rearrangement breakpoints in breast cancer were within 2 Mb of each other(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), with genome-wide profiling of translocations showing a similar preference for proximal end-joining(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Thus, it appears that within the typical ecDNA size range (0.1-5 Mb), circularization is sufficiently efficient to not be markedly impacted by variations in 3D conformation. Further characterization in other cell types and across more regions of the genome are needed, but these results indicate that CRISPR-C can be used to efficiently induce ecDNA without first conducting expensive and laborious 3D genome conformation profiling. Moreover, there are fewer constraints on which ecDNA breakpoints can be queried.</p><p id="P21">In contrast to spatial proximity, we found that manipulation of the temporal dynamics of DSBs could have a profound effect on ecDNA circularization. Small molecule inhibition of DNA-PKcs—known to increase DSB persistence by decreasing DNA-PKcs turnover on DSB ends—led to a dramatic increase in ecDNA generation rates, consistent with the observation that DNA-PKcs promotes translocations between chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Increased DSB persistence likely promotes ecDNA formation by (i) increasing the temporal overlap of the DSBs; (ii) enabling dissociation of the DSB ends from the their legitimate partners; and (iii) with increasing time, favoring the intramolecular ligation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>). Recent work has suggested that DNA-PKcs inhibition can decrease formation of ecDNA by chromothripsis, or decrease the genomic span of these ecDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These seemingly diametric results may be a consequence of a greater reliance on NHEJ to ligate fragments generated by chromothripsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Alternatively, in the context of chromothripsis, where typically several DNA segments are ligated to form an ecDNA, DNA-PKcs inhibition may favor single or oligo-segment circularization events. These smaller ecDNA may be less likely to provide a fitness advantage and are thus neither maintained nor amplified in the cell population.</p><p id="P22">The DNA damage response has been implicated in ecDNA generation for decades(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), but the processes responsible for ligation of breakpoints to form the circle have not been defined. Both NHEJ and MMEJ have been implicated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), however their relative contributions have been unclear. Our work has revealed that both NHEJ and MMEJ are capable of performing the critical repair and ligation steps of ecDNA generation. The proficiency of each pathway to play this role suggests that the ligation step is robust, with either pathway able to compensate for inhibition or deficiency of the other. Thus, this may be a difficult step to target therapeutically. Indeed, we found that pharmacologic manipulation of several DDR factors had no appreciable impact on ecDNA generation. The lone exception, besides DNA-PKcs, was ATM inhibition, which decreased ecDNA generation efficiency. ATM has been termed the “master regulator” of the DSB response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), phosphorylating hundreds of substrates in the process of orchestrating orchestrating the cellular response to DSBs. ATM inhibition with KU-55933 has been shown to limit DSB mobility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) and abrogate DSB clustering(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Both of these effects of ATM inhibition would be expected to antagonize ecDNA formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Contrary to expectations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), our results demonstrate that the circularization of a chromosomal segment between contemporaneous DSBs can be remarkably efficient, reaching 15% in some cases, or even higher in the context of DNA-PKcs inhibition. Beyond the implications for the use of CRISPR-C as a research tool, this observation suggests that excisional ecDNA formation is likely far more common than previously appreciated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and that circularization of contemporaneous DSBs is likely not the rate limiting step in ecDNA formation. Further work is needed to determine the frequency of contemporaneous DSBs forming through endogenous processes or environmental insults (radiation, chemotherapeutics) within 0.1-5 Mb.</p><p id="P24">In this study, we have demonstrated the power of ecDNA generation with CRISPR-C to yield meaningful insights into ecDNA biogenesis, establishing the dissociation model of excisional ecDNA formation, and revealing mechanistic divergence in the formation of ecDNA and their chromosomal scars. Future therapeutic strategies to forestall the emergence of ecDNAs may target not only the mechanism of ecDNA formation, but the distinct processes governing repair of the linear locus from which they were excised. Here, we used the near-haploid Hap1 cell line, which is an established tool for genetic screens and other studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), but it will be necessary in the future to extend our work to a range of non-haploid cell-types and more genomic sites. Aided by the portability of CRISPR-C, we anticipate this approach will permit distinct and powerful investigations of the entire lifecycle of ecDNAs in various contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P25">Hap1 cells (Horizon Discovery) were maintained in IMDM supplemented with GlutaMAX and 10% FCS (Gibco).
