This improvement was a function of participants’ impulsivity-levels and baseline performance, i.e., impulsive individuals who made more baseline errors improved more after receiving stimulation.

This function however could be compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and depression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and remains difficult to restore with invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation approaches. Though still under debate, it is argued that inhibitory control falls under the broad umbrella of cognitive control[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) is one of the critical structures implicated in this executive function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], with neural activity captured as evoked response potentials(ERP) and rhythms correlating with various aspects of behavior[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Brain stimulation could be used to target specific neural dynamics, untangling the link between behavior and neural activity patterns, and may potentially yield novel approaches that could be leveraged in the future to restore cognitive control.</p><p id="P7">Neural oscillations in the mPFC capture cue-specific behavior at theta[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], beta[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and high-gamma bands[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. A recent study by Xiao et al., compared the variations across neural signatures while performing different cognitive control paradigms (e.g., Stroop and Flanker), and showed that evoked neural oscillations can be task-specific[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Zavala et al. reported an increase in the theta and beta bands during inhibitory trials(No-Go) and highlighted an increase in theta coherence between the subthalamic nucleus and mPFC for trials invoking cognitive control(Conflict and No-Go trials). Critically, this study suggested that the increase in the beta band power in the mPFC captured the difficulty level in a given trial, with the highest increase being observed for No-Go trials, when a complete inhibition of movement was required[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Beyond neural rhythms, Yamanaka et al., showed an increase in inter-trial phase-locking related to negative-positive (N2/P3) ERP components over the F<sub>Z</sub> during No-Go trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Additionally, the P3 has been shown to reflect response inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] in terms of peak and onset latency as measured by stop signal reaction time tasks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Transcranial random noise stimulation(TRNS) uses a wide range of frequencies(0.1-640Hz) to modulate neural activity and behavior. Previous studies demonstrated its impact on various functions: for instance, TRNS has been shown to affect working memory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], visual perception[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and emotion perception, with age dependent effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Moreover, stimulation of specific brain regions has been shown to be crucial for achieving desired behavioral effects: stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(dlPFC) during cognitive control improved participants’ response time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and could induce sustained effects following repetitive stimulation sessions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, stimulation of the inferior frontal gyrus showed no behavioral effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], highlighting the importance of the precise stimulation site.</p><p id="P9">Understanding the mechanism of action of stimulation is essential for optimizing TRNS applications. A study by Chaieb et al. indicated that TRNS increased cortico-excitability, an effect potentially mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA<sub>A</sub>) as evidenced by the suppression of TRNS-induced cortico-excitability following GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist uptake while glutamatergic receptor manipulations did not yield any changes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, how these changes in cortico-excitability reflect in neural activity and behavior across different nodes contributing to cognitive control has remained unclear. A recent computational work by West et al. suggested that changes in excitability levels mediated by lamina-specific interneurons could manifest as an increase in beta power and intermittent beta burst duration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Despite the involvement of the mPFC in cognitive control, its response to TRNS during inhibitory control has been understudied. Building on previous experimental and computational work[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], we hypothesized that TRNS targeting the mPFC would selectively modulate inhibitory control through GABAergic mechanisms reflected as a change in the beta power and intermittent burst characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we delivered TRNS while recording participants’ neural activity using electroencephalogram(EEG) from a cohort of healthy participants as they performed a modified version of the Go/No-Go task that incorporated a conflict component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods | materials"><label>2</label><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S8"><label>2.1</label><title>Participant recruitment</title><p id="P11">We recruited 16 participants from the general population through posters, and mailing lists.

One participant dropped out of the study due to time constraints. All participants had normal or corrected vision and were right-handed. The Central University Research Ethics Committee of the University of Oxford approved the study(CUREC-R77362/RE003). The study was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed written consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.2</label><title>Experiment design</title><p id="P12">The study followed a within-subject single blinded design, during which participants received either active or sham TRNS. In each session, the sequence of events, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, were followed. Participants were prepped for the placement of stimulation and recording electrodes. First, participants completed a short version of the cognitive task(up to 6 minutes; 2.3 Cognitive Paradigm). TRNS was then delivered while the participants completed the longer version of the cognitive paradigm (up to 20 minutes). The participants either received active(approximately 20 minutes with ramp up/down time of 20 seconds) or sham(turned off after 20 seconds with ramp up/down time of 8 seconds) stimulation. The effect of stimulation was tested using the short version of the task(up to 6 minutes) within 5 minutes of delivering stimulation(TRNS or sham). Active and sham recording sessions were separated by at least 4 days to ensure that there were no residual stimulation effects. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics, impulsivity(UPPS measure)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and stimulation perception[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The stimulation perception questionnaire was completed after each recording session.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.3</label><title>Cognitive Paradigm</title><p id="P13">We utilized a modified version of a Go/No-go task(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1B</xref>) which included a conflict component[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Each participant was seated comfortably in a chair and the task was presented on a 28-inch computer monitor(Dell-Corporation) positioned 50cm at eye-level. Each trial started with the presentation of a blank screen for a variable duration of 1.75 – 2seconds. This was followed by a white square (0.5seconds) which indirectly served as an indicator that subsequently a cue would be presented. The cue could represent Go(arrow in blue), Conflict(arrow in red) or No-Go(arrow in blue or red with white outline), presented in a pseudo-randomized order. Response to the presented cue was measured using a joystick held using their right hand. Participants were expected to respond by moving the joystick in the direction(horizontal-movement) of the arrow for Go, the opposite direction for Conflict and not to respond for No-Go trials. Feedback was provided after a response was made, i.e., a green smiley for correct, red for incorrect and yellow for a slow response (&gt;1second) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This feedback was displayed for 0.5 seconds. Arrow direction was counter-balanced across the 3 cues controlling for direction effects. The task was coded using Psychtoolbox in MATLAB(version MATLAB 2018b, Mathworks, USA) and run on a Dell-Precision-5550(16GB, Intel i7) Windows-10 system.</p><p id="P14">The proportion of cues was 3:1:1 for Go, Conflict and No-Go, enabling the paradigm to catch uncommon events(Conflict and No-Go). The shorter version of the task had 100 trials(baseline and after stimulation) and the longer version had 300 trials(during stimulation). All participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible at the beginning of a given session.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.4</label><title>Modulation using stimulation</title><p id="P15">TRNS was delivered using a battery powered stimulator(DC-Stimulator-PLUS, NeuroConn GmbH, Germany) via conductive rubber electrodes positioned over F<sub>Z</sub>(Active- ring-4.8cm outer and 2.4cm inner-diameter) and P<sub>Z</sub> (Return-Rectangular:5x7 cm<sup>2</sup>) respectively(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ring electrodes allowed for measurement of neural activity at F<sub>Z</sub>. Each participant’s F<sub>Z</sub> and P<sub>Z</sub> positions were estimated using the standard 10-20 system. Before placing the stimulation electrodes, the scalp was scrubbed and prepared to improve conductivity. We applied the Ten20-conductive paste(Weaver and Company, USA) on the stimulation electrodes prior to placing them on the designated positions. Impedance was checked before placing the EEG cap(TMS-International, Netherlands) while paying particular attention to prevent bridging between the stimulation electrodes and EEG electrodes. The stimulation amplitude was titrated based on each participant’s feedback on tolerance and comfort whilst keeping the amplitude within the allowed safe limits.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>2.5</label><title>EEG recording</title><p id="P16">EEG recordings were acquired using an EEG cap and a 32 channel TMSi-Porti amplifier (TMS- International, Netherlands). EEG recordings were limited to 16-channels spanning over the frontal, fronto-central, dominant motor cortex, and mastoid electrodes as they cover the brain regions expected to be engaged in this study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The ground electrode was placed on the left forearm and EEG channels were common average referenced. The EEG recordings and the cognitive paradigm were synchronized using a trigger signal generated by an U3-HV-LabJack (LabJack-Corporation, USA) via the Psychtoolbox. Triggers were sent to the amplifier via Power-1401(Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). Distinctive voltage levels(0-2.5V) were used to mark different events(i.e., blank screen/white square/cue). The trigger signal, and displacement of the joystick were recorded simultaneously with monopolar EEGs using the TMSi-Porti amplifier and were all sampled at 2048 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>2.6</label><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p id="P17">Behavioral data was analyzed offline using custom MATLAB scripts(version MATLAB 2018b, Mathworks, USA). Accuracy was determined based on actual and expected joystick movement directions. Reaction time was estimated from the joystick movement: data was epoched such that each segment started 1.5 seconds before and ended 1 second after cue-onset. Reaction time was then estimated as the time point when the joystick position crossed a threshold. The threshold was set at the summation of the mean baseline noise before the cue-onset and 20% of the normalized peak[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Baseline noise was included to account for trial-by-trial fluctuations. Trials with response times less than 100ms (i.e., premature, or accidental responses) were excluded from further analysis. Due to high intra-individual variability, all joystick movements were visually inspected and trials with premature movements and direction reversals were excluded. The reaction time per participant for correct and incorrect trials was calculated by averaging across corresponding trials. The participants with no errors were excluded from the error-trial analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>2.7</label><title>EEG Preprocessing and Analysis</title><sec id="S15"><label>2.7.1</label><title>Preprocessing</title><p id="P18">EEG data was pre-processed offline using custom MATLAB(version:MATLAB-2018b, Mathworks, USA) and EEG LAB(version EEGLAB2021.1-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]) scripts. Raw EEG data was re-referenced to the mastoid and offset corrected for drifts in the signal. The data was first band pass filtered(high-pass at 0.1 Hz and then low-pass at 100 Hz). Line noise in the signal was removed using an open-source plugin-Zapline(version zaplineplus1.1-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]). Filtered EEG data was subjected to temporal independent component analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] as implemented in EEG LAB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Components representing stereotypical artifacts such as eye blinks and saccades were identified by manual inspection in both time and frequency domains and were removed from the data. On average 2.3±0.2 independent components were removed per participant. Remaining components were then back projected to obtain artifact free channel data.

These corrected epochs will be referred to as ‘<italic>ITI-corrected epochs</italic>’ in the subsequent sections. The total length of each epoch was 4 seconds which included 2 seconds before the cue-onset and 2 seconds after.

This spectral power change at mPFC was mediated by an increase in the average burst duration of intermittent beta bursts. Critically, participants with a higher impulsivity score made more errors before stimulation and showed a greater improvement in their inhibitory control after TRNS, as reflected in their decreased error rates.</p><sec id="S36"><label>4.1</label><title>Effect of TRNS on inhibitory control</title><p id="P47">We show for the first time that the TRNS induced improvement in stopping behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) as a function of participants’ baseline impulsivity levels(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), which was absent in the sham condition. We also observed that individuals with higher self-reported impulsivity scores made more errors in withholding their response, similar to that observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. TRNS had a differential effect on inhibitory control, i.e., participants with higher impulsivity improved more(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) after receiving stimulation. This further supports the notion that impact of stimulation on behavior could be a function of baseline performance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], as observed in other stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding how heterogeneity due to factors such as psychological traits, anatomy, and neurochemistry influence neuro-modulatory effects of stimulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P48">We then show that this improvement in stopping behaviors after TRNS is mediated through an increase in the low-beta band power(low-beta up to 20Hz)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) over the mPFC during No-Go trials. This observed increase in spectral power coincides with the approximate reaction time during Go and Conflict trials(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) (i.e., when a movement would be expected). We therefore argue that the observed rise in spectral power after TRNS, specifically in this time window when a movement was observed in Go and Conflict trials, may be a potential counteractive mechanism to improve inhibition during No-Go trials.</p><p id="P49">Beta was one of the two prominent bands that has been observed over the mPFC, with an ascending oscillatory power across Go, Conflict and No-Go trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that TRNS may induce changes in GABA concentration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], which in sensorimotor cortex, has been shown to play a key role in beta rhythms in terms of peak frequency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and amplitude[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. While the precise mechanism through which TRNS modulates beta rhythms remains unknown, taking in to account the findings from previous work, one could argue that this modulatory effect could be driven by GABAA. Another potential explanation is that TRNS modulates task-related activity via repeated sub-threshold perturbations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>].</p><p id="P50">The stop signal task[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] has also been shown to measure response inhibition. Both intracranial and scalp EEG studies showed an increase in the beta activity within few hundred milliseconds after the stop signal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Similarly, recordings from Parkinson’s disease patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery of the subthalamic nucleus showed an increase in right-frontal beta, suggesting a strong association between stopping and beta activity. Schimdt et al argued that the increase in beta activity could correspond to a ‘clear t’ chanis ading t st pping[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. They also suggested that this mechanism was not restricted to motor activity but also could generalize to thoughts and decision making[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Beta rebound after a movement has also been linked to GABAergic activity and proposed as a resetting mechanism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Taking in to account these findings, we argue that mPFC ‘beta’ reflects behaviors linked to inhibition.</p><p id="P51">It has recently been shown that oscillatory activity at beta and gamma bands exist as ‘bursts’, i.e., short transient cycles of activity in sensorimotor cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Here, we observed similar burst profiles over the mPFC: duration of these temporally localized intermittent bursts was increased by TRNS(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Previously, our research group has shown that burst features in the motor cortex could be modulated by the connectivity strength of interneurons (GABAergic): specifically, an increase in the connectivity strength of the interneurons inversely correlated with beta burst duration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. We therefore posit that TRNS may lead to an increase in the overall burst duration and power by modulating the complex excitatory-inhibitory connectivity of the mPFC via interneurons and GABAergic signaling.</p><p id="P52">To understand the communication between the mPFC and motor cortex which potentially contributed to the improvement in No-Go accuracy, we studied phase coherence between the mPFC and motor cortex. While we did not observe a change in phase synchrony before and after stimulation, we did observe an increase in the beta-burst number over the motor cortex which could underlie improved stopping behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><label>4.2</label><title>Effect of TRNS on behaviours involving movement</title><p id="P53">Our cognitive control paradigm included Go, Conflict and No-Go trials, allowing for an evaluation of response time and accuracy during Go and Conflict trials, and accuracy during No-Go trials. As previously reported, participants had higher accuracy(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and were faster(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) for trials corresponding to Go compared to Conflict trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. There was no effect of TRNS on accuracy or reaction time for both Go[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and Conflict conditions. However, there was a practice effect on the performance, particularly for Conflict trials: participants were faster and more accurate after stimulation, regardless of receiving TRNS or sham. It has been shown that the effect of TRNS strongly depended on the site of stimulation with improvements in Go reaction times when the stimulation site was dlpfc[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] versus no effect when stimulation was delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Our findings also showed no improvement in performance during Go and Conflict trials, which could be attributed to either the stimulation site (mPFC) or absence of a DC-offset during stimulation as previously used by Brever-Aeby et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Beyond the brain area, the effect of stimulation on behaviour could be dependent on the type of paradigm, as different oscillatory bands are evoked by different cognitive tasks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. For example, a recent study using TRNS stimulation of the DLPFC during a Stroop Task, showed no effects on reaction time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] unlike the improvement observed in Go/No-Go[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P54">To summarise, we showed that random noise stimulation could improve inhibitory control when the mPFC is the stimulation target. In line with our hypothesis, the improvement in inhibitory control was linked to an increase in the beta power and intermittent burst duration. These results highlight the capability of TRNS to improve impulsive behaviours and could open novel avenues for treating disorders of impulsivity.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><label>4.3</label><title>Limitations and Future work</title><p id="P55">Our study is not without limitations. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that the effect of TRNS on mPFC could be GABA mediated, however this requires further research either using MRS spectroscopy or a paired pulse TMS protocol such as short interval intracortical inhibition which reflects GABAergic tone. To study how stimulation modulated the interaction between medial prefrontal cortex and motor cortex, we calculated the phase spectral index but did not find any differences. This aspect needs to be further studied. Taking into account the intra-individual variability and the effect of non-invasive stimulation, the wider effect of our protocol needs to be studied with higher number of participants and increased number trials across each of the events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Methods and results</label><media xlink:href="EMS190947-supplement-Supplementary_Methods_and_results.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d98aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S39"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank our participants for kindly taking part in this study.
