Swine have many physiological, anatomical, and immunological similarities to humans, and are an excellent model for human influenza. Here, we employed single RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to characterize the major leucocyte subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), twenty-one days after H1N1pdm09 infection or respiratory immunization with an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein with or without IL-1β. Mapping scRNA-seq clusters from BAL onto those previously described in peripheral blood facilitated annotation and highlighted differences between tissue resident and circulating immune cells. ScRNA-seq data and functional assays revealed lasting impacts of immune challenge on BAL populations. First, mucosal administration of IL-1β reduced the number of functionally active Treg. Second, influenza infection upregulated IFI6 in BAL cells, decreasing their susceptibility to virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data provides a reference map of porcine BAL cells and reveals lasting immunological consequences of influenza infection and respiratory immunisation in a highly relevant large animal model for respiratory virus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bronchoalveolar lavage</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>pig</kwd><kwd>H1N1pdm09 influenza virus</kwd><kwd>IL-1 beta</kwd><kwd>Adenoviral expressing haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein</kwd><kwd>Treg cells</kwd><kwd>IFI6</kwd><kwd>lung tissue resident memory cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Respiratory viruses pose significant global health threats, with influenza and coronaviruses responsible for major human epidemics and pandemics. The immune responses to these respiratory pathogens are initiated within the respiratory tract. Alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells continuously survey and sample the respiratory lumen, contributing to the induction of immune responses by secretion of cytokines and chemokines. These inflammatory mediators recruit innate cells including neutrophils and natural killer cells, which possess the ability to kill virus-infected cells. Adaptive immune responses initiated in the local draining lymph nodes are mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells that enter the lung. These cells recognize relatively conserved internal viral proteins and can mediate cross protection against infections with serologically distinct virus strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A proportion of these effector T cells remain in the lung to become tissue resident memory cells (TRM) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). TRM can mount a rapid protective immune response on antigen encounter and have been shown to be critical in heterotypic cross protection against influenza in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In contrast, the best correlate of type specific adaptive immunity is antibody, and multiple lung-resident B cell (BRM) subsets exhibiting spatial and phenotypic diversity have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Understanding how an immune response is induced and maintained in the lung is crucial for the design of more effective vaccines that provide long-lasting immunity. Respiratory immune responses are highly localized, and direct investigation of lung cells and fluids, rather than assessment of correlates in blood, is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Mucosal immune responses following antigen exposure have been extensively characterized in mouse models of infection, helping to define phenotypic, functional and transcriptional features of lung immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, investigating respiratory immune responses in humans is more challenging, although techniques allowing direct sampling of the respiratory tract are constantly improving. One common approach is the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), containing cells and fluid from the airways and alveoli. BAL is enriched with TRM, and it has been shown that the presence of respiratory syncytial virus-specific CD8 TRM in the BAL correlates with reduced symptoms and viral load in human challenge studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). High dimensional phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional profiling of immune responses in paired BAL and blood samples from COVID-19 patients revealed key roles for airway T cells, monocytes and macrophages associated with disease outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Single-cell transcriptome profiling (scRNA-seq) has enabled high resolution mapping of cellular heterogeneity, developmental trajectories, and activation status of BAL cells, revealing how these responses differ across species and between different infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). These studies offer insight for the development of targeted therapies and vaccines.</p><p id="P6">In recent years it has become clear that targeting TRM is a promising vaccine strategy in inducing long term protection against respiratory viruses. Intranasal administration of a live-attenuated influenza vaccine generated long-term virus-specific TRM in the lungs of mice, which mediated cross protective heterotypic immunity in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that for optimal induction of heterotypic immunity, virus infection of the lungs or immunisation of the respiratory tract is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Recent immunization strategies for achieving heterotypic immunity via TRM include pulmonary delivery of influenza vaccine candidates, targeting conserved internal virus proteins such as the nucleoprotein (NP). These strategies prevent infection, limit viral replication or reduce disease severity in the absence of cross-neutralising antibodies in pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Pigs are an important livestock species and serve as a significant biomedical model for studying human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Pigs have a longer life span, and are genetically, immunologically, physiologically, and anatomically more like humans than small laboratory animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Pigs are also an important, natural, large animal host for influenza A viruses and are infected by the same subtypes of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Pigs can also be a source of new viruses potentially capable of initiating pandemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Pigs exhibit similar clinical manifestations and pathogenesis to humans when infected with influenza viruses making them an excellent model to study immunity to influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This similarity extends to the lobar and bronchial anatomy, as well as the histological structure of pig lungs which closely resembles that in humans. Additionally, pigs exhibit a comparable distribution of sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We have established a robust influenza challenge pig model to study immunity to influenza and evaluate the efficacy of novel vaccines and therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). We have further shown that pig immune responses following infection with H1N1pdm09 influenza virus are similar to those induced in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Here we used scRNA-seq to analyse alveolar macrophages, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells from the BAL of inbred Babraham pigs to define cellular states of homeostasis and activation following H1N1pdm09 (pH1N1) infection. We also characterized these cells following respiratory immunization with an adenoviral vector expressing hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein in the presence or absence of IL-1β, which is a potent mucosal adjuvant that significantly increases antibody and T cell responses. This high-resolution analysis of BAL cells provides insights into porcine resident leucocytes in the lung environment and the changes they undergo following infection and immunization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental design and cell sorting of BAL</title><p id="P9">In the present study, we utilized samples from a previous animal experiment described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The experiment involved four groups of inbred Babraham pigs: one group (n=5) was infected intranasally with pH1N1 influenza virus, another group (n=5) received intranasal immunisation with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) Ad-HA/NP, and the third group (n=5) was immunized intranasally with Ad-HA/NP and a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding porcine IL-1β (Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β). Controls (n=3) received PBS intranasally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The animals were culled 21 days post immunization or infection and tissues harvested for immunological and virological analysis. In the previous study, immune responses of these groups were extensively analyzed and showed that IL-1β acts as a potent mucosal adjuvant, increasing antibody responses, proportions of plasma and activated B cells, cytokine production of T cells and NP tetramer-specific CD8 T cells in the Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Given the well-defined nature of these samples we chose to perform scRNA-seq analysis on leukocyte populations sorted from the BAL. We were particularly interested in the BAL as T cells in this niche are inaccessible to intravenous CD3 antibody and have a phenotype characteristic of TRM in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). As the cellular composition of BAL samples is strongly dominated by alveolar macrophages, we applied cell sorting to isolate macrophages, CD4 T, CD8 T and B cells from 3 animals per group and subjected equal proportions of these cells (12,000 cells each) to scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pig BAL scRNA-seq identifies typical immune cell populations</title><p id="P11">Graph-based clustering of the processed transcriptomic dataset identified 21 distinct cell clusters. Of these, three clusters were excluded for being of low quality or under suspicion of containing doublets. Three clusters were additionally split into subclusters to separate CD4 from CD8 T cells or split T cells from non-T cells, creating a final dataset with 22 cell clusters for annotation. To annotate each cluster with conventional cell-type names, marker genes defining each cluster were extracted and each cluster was screened for expression of a list of typical defining marker genes (<bold>Table S1</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). From this information, each cluster was manually annotated with an established cell-type name (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Most clusters were found to be comprised of well-defined cell-types and were easily annotated, such as macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), monocytes, plasma cells, B cells and T cells, though particular subclusters presented more niche and complex phenotypes. These included 18a and 18b, which were annotated as ‘mitotic T cells’ based on their strong expression of E2F1 and E2F2, and subclusters 9a, 9b and 9c, which were found to have varying degrees of expression of CD8 T cell and NK cell related genes, including CD3E, CD8A, CD8B, KLRK1, KLRB1 and KIT. We also identified very small clusters of CD4 and CD8 T cells (20a and 20b, with 18 and 8 cells, respectively) that differed from the major CD4 and CD8 T cell clusters (7 and 6, respectively) by expressing higher levels of genes associated with naïve and/or central memory T cell states (e.g. BACH2, SELL, LEF1) and lower levels of genes encoding cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules (e.g. LGALS1, S100A4, VIM) that were previously found to characterize lung-localized human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Cluster 14 expressed T cell-related genes in an atypical pattern: strong expression of CD28 and CD5, with low expression of CD4, CD8A and CD8B, bifurcated expression of CD3D and CD3E, and very high expression of EOMES. Pending further investigation, cluster 14 has been annotated as ‘T cell like’.</p><p id="P14">Cluster 21 is suspected to be T cell-related, due to adjacent clustering to identified T cell clusters in both UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and TSNE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>) space. However, cluster 21 does not express any of the conventional αβ T cell markers: CD28, CD5, CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD8A, or CD8B. Expressed T cell-related genes include GATA3, IL1RL1, IL7R and KIT, suggesting that these cells may be innate lymphoid cells, but without corroborating evidence, we have currently classified these cells as ‘unknown’.</p><p id="P15">Cluster 19 showed strong expression of ACTG1, GPR37, NAPSA and SFTPA1, typically expressed by mucus producing epithelial cells. Cluster 9 and its subclusters were enriched for genes typically associated with NK cells such as KLRK1, KLRB1, KIT and NCR1. As our cell sorting strategy was not intended to capture NK cells, NK cell-like T cells or epithelial cells, clusters 9 and 19 risked presenting a biased representation of these larger cell populations. We therefore excluded clusters 9 and 19, leaving 18 clusters for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Confirmation of scRNA-seq derived cell types by flow cytometry</title><p id="P16">We aimed to confirm cell types identified by scRNA-seq by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). By using an antibody panel designed for phenotyping of myeloid cells (<bold>Table S2</bold>) and gating on FSC-A<sup>high</sup>SSC-A<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), we identified a prominent population of CD172a<sup>high</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>-/dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which represent scRNA-seq clusters 1, 4 and 8. Within CD163<sup>-</sup> cells, we identified a CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> subset, representing putative monocytes identified in scRNA-seq cluster 15. CD14<sup>-</sup> cells were further analysed for CD172a/CADM1 co-expression which allowed the identification of CD172<sup>dim</sup>CADM1<sup>high</sup> subset and a CD172a<sup>high</sup> CADM1<sup>+</sup> subset, representing cDC1 and cDC2 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and identified in cluster 13 by scRNA-seq. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD172a<sup>+</sup>CADM1<sup>-</sup> pDCs were not identified in BAL by flow cytometry (data not shown) and no pDC phenotype was found by scRNA-seq.</p><p id="P17">The presence of B cells and plasma cells was also confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) using a specifically designed B cell panel (<bold>Table S2</bold>). CD79α<sup>+</sup> cells contained a prominent subset of IRF4<sup>high</sup>Blimp-1<sup>+</sup> plasma cells, which were also Pax-5<sup>-</sup> and thus resembled clusters 2 and 3 of the sc-RNAseq data. CD79α<sup>+</sup>IRF4<sup>dim</sup>Blimp-1<sup>-</sup> cells had variable levels of Pax-5 but overall likely represent B cell clusters 12 and 16 from the scRNA-seq data.</p><p id="P18">CD4 and CD8 T cells were investigated by a dedicated T cell panel (<bold>Table S2</bold>). CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were separated based on Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both CD25<sup>high</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> putative regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD25<sup>dim</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Treg CD4 T cells were largely CD8α<sup>dim</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup>Bcl-6<sup>-</sup>Eomes<sup>-</sup> but expressed low levels of T-bet. With these phenotypes, they resembled scRNA-seq clusters 10 and 7, respectively. We also identified a subset of Ki-67-expressing CD4 T cells, which may represent cluster 18b annotated as “mitotic” CD4 T cells. CD8 T cells were identified by a CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8αβ<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). After exclusion of γδ T cells, the majority of remaining CD8 T cells were CD161<sup>-</sup>NKp46<sup>-</sup> perforin<sup>-</sup>, resembling CD8 T cell cluster 6 identified by scRNA-seq. Within this phenotype, some cells expressed Ki-67, which may represent “mitotic” CD8 T cells found in cluster 18a. Our sorting strategy for scRNA-seq excluded most NK and γδ T cells present in BAL. However, a flow cytometry panel designed for the characterisation of nonconventional T cells (Table S2) indicated the presence of a substantial proportion of γδ T cells, which were largely CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup>NKp46<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Within the CD3<sup>-</sup> population, CD161/CD8α defined putative NK cell subsets, which exhibited substantial phenotypic heterogeneity in terms of CD16, NKp46 and perforin expression. This phenotypic analysis confirmed cell types identified by scRNA-seq and indicated further heterogeneity within NK cells and non-conventional T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Comparison with PBMCs delineates similar and distinct cell-types</title><p id="P19">To validate our cell-type annotations and to further examine features of BAL tissue resident populations, we compared our pig BAL scRNA-seq dataset with a publicly available pig PBMC scRNA-seq dataset, published by Herrera-Uribe et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Both datasets were restricted to shared genes, batch corrected and merged using a mutual nearest neighbors approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). When plotted as a UMAP, several cell types such as monocytes, cDCs, plasma cells (antibody secreting cells, ASCs in the PBMC dataset), B cells and some T cells formed integrated and/or adjacent clusters between BAL and PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A-B</xref>), implying similar patterns of overall gene expression. Cell-types without near neighbors between the datasets, i.e. BAL macrophages, the BAL ‘T cell like’ cluster 14 and PBMC γδ T cells formed distant and distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A-B</xref>). Looking more closely at T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) revealed two clusters that partially merge: BAL conventional T cells with PBMC αβ T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) and BAL mitotic T cells with a separate cluster of PBMC αβ T cells.</p><p id="P20">To further delineate how individual clusters compared between BAL and PBMC, the top 20 marker genes for each cluster in the PBMC dataset were used to generate an index for projecting the annotated BAL cells onto the PBMC clusters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> provides a visual representation of this mapping, identifying the proportion of cells in each BAL cluster that showed gene expression similarity to each PBMC cluster. To examine which genes were driving or inhibiting mapping between clusters, all clusters and all genes used for mapping were plotted as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Subsets of B cells and T cells were separately plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E-F</xref>) using gene clusters identified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref> alongside defining genes from <bold>Table S1;</bold> additional subset heatmaps are also provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-G</xref>. Broadly, cell-types in the BAL mapped to the same or closest equivalent cell types in the PBMC dataset. BAL macrophages and monocytes mapped to PBMC monocytes (there are no macrophages in PBMC), BAL cDCs to PBMC cDCs, BAL plasma cells to PBMC ASCs and BAL T cells to PBMC T cells. In some cases, mapping at the subset level was ambivalent. For example, the BAL macrophage clusters mapped to PBMC monocyte clusters 20 and 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting minimal differences in the patterns of top marker gene expression between these PBMC monocyte clusters. At the same time, this example also demonstrated preferential mapping such that BAL macrophages mapped to PBMC monocyte clusters 20 and 27 but not to monocyte clusters 13, 19 or 25. Such preferential mapping was apparent across most cell types analysed, with only a subset of PBMC clusters identifying as close matches for BAL cells. This implies that the heterogeneity in gene expression that drove the clustering in the PBMC dataset also embodied some of the divergence between BAL and PBMC cell types. Of the 33 PBMC clusters, BAL cells only substantially mapped to 12, suggesting that many of the PBMC cell types/states are distinct from those found in the BAL or relate to cell-types not included in our sorting strategy.</p><p id="P21">There are also exceptions to expected mappings. In the BAL, both clusters 12 and 16 were annotated as B cells, but only cluster 12 mapped to PBMC B cells, while cluster 16 failed to map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref> illustrates the gene expression of these B cell clusters, with BAL cluster 16 uniquely showing reduced expression of numerous ribosomal genes (RPL*, RPS*). Likewise, BAL T cells mapped to PBMC T cells, but there was heterogeneity in mapping of T cell subsets. BAL clusters 18 and 20 were previously subclustered into separate mitotic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> populations. However, BAL mitotic T cells (cluster 18) mapped primarily to PBMC CD8<sup>+</sup> αβ T cell cluster 14, and BAL cluster 20 mapped primarily to PBMC CD4<sup>+</sup> αβ T cell cluster 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). For the largest conventional BAL T cell clusters (6 and 7) the primary mapping was to PBMC CD2<sup>-</sup> γδ T cell cluster 21 and, to a lesser extent, PBMC CD4<sup>+</sup> αβ T cell cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). Furthermore, the ‘unknown’ BAL cluster 21 also mapped strongly to PBMC CD2<sup>-</sup> γδ T cell cluster 21. Conceptually it is unsurprising that a TRM-dominant tissue like the BAL would exhibit distinct gene expression from the circulating T cells that inhabit the peripheral blood.

This analysis identified that pigs immunized with Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL1b have greatly reduced proportions of cells in cluster 10, annotated as Tregs, within the BAL. Among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, Tregs make up an average of 0.02% in Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL1b pigs versus an average of 0.09% in the other conditions (adjusted p=7.67e<sup>-8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This apparent loss of Tregs was not mirrored by any of the other CD4 T cell clusters and was consistent between samples within each condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Based on this significant reduction of Tregs in the BAL of IL-1β treated animals seen by scRNA-seq, we further analysed Treg frequency by flow cytometry in BAL and tracheobronchial lymph nodes from the same pigs, plus two additional pigs from immunized and infected groups. Interestingly, there was a significant reduction of Tregs, defined as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes of the Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β immunized group compared to the other three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the reduction in Tregs that was observed in BAL scRNA-seq data was not replicated by the BAL flow analysis. This is likely because the Treg populations isolated by scRNA-seq and by flow are, whilst overlapping, not the same. In both scRNA-seq and flow, Tregs are defined as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, however in the scRNA-seq analysis, cells are grouped into clusters based on their top 5000 highly variable genes (HVGs) prior to being identified according to their expression of defining genes. Hence scRNA-seq Tregs (cluster 10, 799 cells), represent a population of uniformly CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells that are also phenotypically distinct from the other CD4 T cell clusters (based on 5000 HVGs). FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells also exist within CD4 T cell cluster 7 and the flow analysis would include these FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells alongside cluster 10 as a single Treg population. Hence scRNA-seq Tregs and flow Tregs represent two overlapping but not identical populations. These data therefore imply that the BAL Treg population that is diminished during IL-1β immunization is a phenotypically distinct subset of BAL Treg and that others are not diminished.</p><p id="P24">We previously showed that IL-1β is a potent mucosal adjuvant and that intranasal immunization with Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β increased T cell cytokine production in Babraham pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Based on our observations of altered Treg abundance in this condition, we next investigated whether Tregs modulate cytokine production in the BAL. To this end, sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> Tregs and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> control cells from the BAL of Ad-HA/NP immunized Babraham pigs were co-cultured with BAL cells from Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β immunized animals in the presence of pH1N1. The expression of IFNγ and TNFα was then assayed by intracellular staining. The addition of Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>) to the BAL nearly abolished cytokine production, while a minor effect was detected when CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> control cells were introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together with scRNA-seq and flow cytometry quantification of Treg populations, these data suggest that IL-1β reduces the proportion of functionally active Tregs, contributing to increased cytokine production, in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the suppressive role of porcine Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Differential expression analysis reveals condition- and cell-specific phenotypes</title><p id="P25">To investigate differential gene expression between our experimental conditions we used a NEgative Binomial mixed model Using a Large-sample Approximation (NEBULA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) run discretely on all cells, B cells, CD4 T <bold>c</bold>ells, CD8 T <bold>c</bold>ells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).

GO enrichment for these comparisons returned fewer than 5 DE genes per GO term and is therefore not shown. Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL1β versus PBS identified considerably more DE genes and significant GO terms, with 11 DE genes shared between cell types, 7 of which were shared between CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). DE genes in both CD4 and CD8 T cell populations were enriched for lymphocyte activation and apoptosis-related GO terms, enrichment testing in macrophages returned only broad GO terms, and analyses in B cells returned fewer than 5 DE genes per GO term. The enriched GO terms in T cells implied that Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL1β elicited a strong immunogenic response, potentially overstimulation given the presence of apoptotic terms. Comparing pH1H1 infection with PBS, in addition to numerous distinctly expressed DE genes, NEBULA identified 10 DE genes shared by cell-types <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). IFI6 was particularly notable as being universally upregulated across leukocyte subsets.

To assess if IFI6 expression was associated with the expression of other genes in different cell types, we used the mixed model of NEBULA to perform a separate differential expression analysis with IFI6 expression itself as the dependent variable, asking which genes were associated with IFI6 expression.

We performed our study in inbred Babraham pigs, which have identical MHC (swine leucocyte antigen) and allow for fine-grained immune response analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).

BAL is thus a particularly useful source of information about tissue-resident immune responses as it reflects the site of respiratory infections and is accessible during bronchoscopy in humans. Single-cell RNA-seq studies of BAL have become more common in recent years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the utility of monitoring the immune response at this accessible site of infection.

Leveraging available porcine PBMC single-cell RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) enabled validation of our cell type annotations and highlighted likely phenotypic differences between tissue and circulating immune cell populations, particularly among T and B lymphocytes.</p><p id="P32">Finally, our successful use of frozen BAL samples from a previous immunisation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) corroborates conclusions drawn in a recent equine study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) that frozen BAL is a useful source of single-cell transcriptomic information for large-animal model immune responses, opening the door to further re-use of samples from key respiratory immunology studies.</p><p id="P33">By utilizing samples from influenza infected and immunized animals, we had the opportunity to investigate parameters that change under these circumstances. Our data indicate that IL-1β administration resulted in a significant reduction of Treg in the BAL as determined by scRNA-seq, although there were no changes in Treg frequency in BAL when identified as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD25<sup>high</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> on the protein level by flow cytometry in the same samples. This highlights the power of transcriptomic profiling, allowing higher dimensional clustering of immune cell subsets compared to the limited marker sets used in flow cytometry.</p><p id="P34">Mucosal production of IL-1β has been shown to attract innate and adaptive immune cells by the induction of cytokines and adhesion molecules and to have a direct proliferative effect on CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Intranasal delivery of IL-1β, together with HA- and NP-encoding adenoviral vectors (Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β), significantly increased the immunogenicity and heterotypic protection against the influenza virus in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). However, in pigs although IL-1β increased antibody and T cell immune responses, this did not reduce lung pathology or viral load following H3N2 influenza challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Tregs are responsible for maintaining immune homeostasis by supressing excessive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Of note, effector T cells in the BAL were still susceptible to Treg inhibition when cocultured with Tregs from Ad-HA/NP immunized animals. Hence, reduced numbers of functionally active Tregs can lead to imbalance of cytokine production, and this proinflammatory environment can trigger inflammation and tissue damage. Indeed, outbred pigs immunized with AdHA/NP+Ad-IL-1β showed increased lung pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), confirming that maintaining a balance of Tregs is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system.</p><p id="P35">Another interesting observation from this study is that pH1N1 infection drives upregulation of IFN alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) in most BAL cell subsets. The expression of IFI6 is tightly regulated in response to IFN alpha stimulation and plays a crucial role in restricting viral infections including West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, Yellow Fever, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses through interference with viral RNA synthesis and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). In agreement with these studies, we observed reduced GFP expression in VSVΔG-GFP infected BAL cells from pH1N1 infected pigs compared to control pigs, confirming an inhibitory role of IFI6 following influenza infection. This is in contrast with a recent report showing that IFI6 can positively affect virus infection and that IFI6 overexpression results in increased influenza replication in cell cultures and in the murine model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Irrespective of the mechanism of action and whether this reflects species differences between mice and pigs, or between VSV and influenza infection, the sustained upregulation of IFI6 suggests that the immune system is still actively engaged in combating the virus or resolving inflammation and tissue damage at day 21 post infection. Our results also indicate that although all tissue resident lymphocytes must have a common gene expression programme enabling them to migrate to and survive in tissue sites, local pathogen-related factors can profoundly modify these programs. These modifications are detectable for a surprisingly long time, 21 days, after infection or immunization.</p><p id="P36">In summary our findings provide a comprehensive high dimensional cellular reference for porcine airways in different immunological contexts, paving the way for a deeper understanding of respiratory physiology and immune responses in pigs.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Infection and immunization animal studies</title><p id="P37">Samples obtained from a previous experiment conducted on inbred Babraham pigs were utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).

Data was acquired using Cytek’s Spectro Flo software and later analysed with FlowJo version 10 (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Analysis of Treg function</title><p id="P53">BAL cells from Ad-HA/NP immunized animals were stained with CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5 (<bold>as in Table S2</bold>) and CD25 (K231.3B2, AF488-conjugated, Bio-Rad). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> cells were sorted on a FACSAria UIII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). To determine the effect of Tregs, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells of the sorted cell populations were added to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> BAL cells from animals immunized with Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1β. These cocultures were stimulated with H1N1pdm09 (MOI of 1) or medium control overnight. Intracellular staining (ICS) was performed to analyse IFNγ and TNFα production by CD4 and CD8b T cells. Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug™, BD Biosciences) was added, and 5 h later cells were stained with mAbs against CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (as in Table S2) and CD8β-FITC (clone PPT23, Bio-Rad). The cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were then stained with mAbs against IFNγ (P2G10, AF647-conjugated, BD Biosciences) and TNFα (Mab11, BV421-conjugated, BioLegend). Additionally, Near-Infrared Fixable LIVE/DEAD stain (Invitrogen) was used for identification of live cells.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Virus infectivity assays to determine antiviral state of pig BAL</title><p id="P54">Pig BAL cells from pH1N1 infected or control groups were challenged with infectious recombinant VLPs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-ΔG-GFP) in which the glycoprotein was replaced with GFP which was used as a marker to monitor the replication of VSV-ΔG-GFP.

In humans, cells from lung-washes are used to study immune responses and it was shown that these cells are crucial in protection against respiratory diseases such as influenza and COVID-19. To better understand lung immunity, we compared genes expressed in cells of pig lung-wash to white blood cells, providing an atlas for future studies of immunity in the lung. We also tested a vaccine given to the lung containing IL-1β, a strong immune activator that protects mice against influenza virus infection. However, although IL-1β increased pig immune responses it did not protect pigs against infection. We also showed that the number of immune cells that dampen immune responses (regulatory T cells) is reduced. In addition, we demonstrated increased expression of a protein, IFI6, 21 days after infection showing that while immune cells in the lung have common properties, the invading organisms influence them significantly. Our study elucidates why some vaccines fail despite inducing powerful immune responses, emphasizes the need for caution when applying results from small animals like mice to humans, and indicates the importance of the pig as a model to study disease in humans and livestock.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design and UMAP clustering of BAL immune cells</title><p>(A) Design of pig immunisation/ infection experiment.
