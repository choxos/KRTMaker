In endothelial cells (ECs), the intracellular traffic of α5 integrin is regulated by both neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and neuropilin 2 (NRP2), yet the redundancies in function between these co-receptors remain unclear. Moreover, the endocytic complexes that participate in NRP-directed traffic remain poorly annotated. Using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry of α5 integrin associations in ECs we identify α5 trafficking pathways that depend on NRP1, NRP2, or both NRPs. We identify a trafficking pathway that depends on both NRPs: one that impinges on the GTPase-activating protein p120RasGAP. This pathway promotes the recycling of α5 integrin from early endosomes. Mechanistically, p120RasGAP enables transit of endocytosed α5 integrin-NRP1-NRP2 complexes to Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes, promoting cell polarisation and fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis. Silencing of both NRP receptors, or p120RasGAP, results in the accumulation of α5 integrin in early endosomes, a loss of α5 integrin from surface adhesions, and attenuated EC polarisation. Importantly, endothelial-specific deletion of both NRP1 and NRP2 in the postnatal retina recapitulated our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, severely impairing FN fibrillogenesis and polarised sprouting. Our data assign an essential role for p120RasGAP during integrin traffic in ECs and support a hypothesis that NRP receptors can co-traffic internalised cargoes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Trafficking</kwd><kwd>neuropilins</kwd><kwd>α5 integrin</kwd><kwd>endothelial cell</kwd><kwd>polarisation</kwd><kwd>fibronectin deposition</kwd><kwd>developmental angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>p120RasGAP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dynamic adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is primarily mediated by integrin receptors. Blood vessel expansion during vascular development relies on the interaction between the ECM component fibronectin (FN) and its major integrin receptor α5β1 to establish, and subsequently balance the apico-basal polarity of migrating endothelial cells (ECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. During this process, the endocytosis and recycling of active α5β1 integrin receptors (those bound to a FN ligand), facilitates the turnover and replenishment of newly synthesised matrix. Once the apico-basal axis has been defined, cycles of active α5β1 integrin traffic promote the assembly of a mechano-sensing fibrillar FN network, and therefore preserve a self-sustaining signalling cascade to maintain EC polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Depending on integrin heterodimer composition and ECM ligand attachment, integrin traffic involves the transit through specific RabGTPase<sup>+</sup> compartments. For example, whilst α5β1 integrin and αVβ3 integrin are endocytosed collectively via Rab5 or Rab21 GTPases, they are subsequently recycled via diverging Rab4-dependent (αVβ3 integrin) or Rab11-dependent (α5β1 integrin) routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin 1 (NRP1) was previously reported to selectively promote the endocytosis of FN-bound active α5β1 integrin from disassembling adhesions via its cytosolic interactor GAIP-interacting protein C terminus member 1 (Gipc1) and its associated motor protein myosin 6 in ECs. α5β1 integrin was subsequently shown to recycle in NRP1-associated complexes to stimulate FN fibrillogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. We have since revealed that neuropilin 2 (NRP2), the ortholog of NRP1, also promotes Rab11-associated recycling of the α5 integrin subunit in ECs, and regulates the deposition of cell-secreted FN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Since genetic ablation of either NRP1 or NRP2 has been shown to impair sprouting angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and a simultaneous co-deletion effectively inhibits pathological angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], it has been proposed that a degree of synergy exists between the two receptors. It is unclear however which redundancies exist during NRP1-directed and NRP2-directed α5β1 integrin traffic, and which endocytic complexes participate.</p><p id="P4">p120RasGAP (alias: RASA1) is a ubiquitously expressed endosomal GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that contains canonical phospho-Tyrosine (<italic>p</italic>Tyr)-interacting SH2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. As an important negative regulator of the Ras signalling cascade, p120RasGAP global knockout (KO) mice exhibit major vascular defects that result in embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Owing to its ability to interact with a wide array of SH2-binding proteins, p120RasGAP has, in recent years, also been shown to control the return of endocytosed integrin receptors back to the plasma membrane via interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin α-subunit. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for example, p120RasGAP was demonstrated to competitively displace Rab21 from endocytosed β1 integrin in early endosomes, expediting its recycling via Rab11<sup>+</sup> endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Indeed, integrin traffic is critically dependent upon the ability for Rab proteins to dynamically switch between GTP- and GDP-bound states: mutant GDP-locked or GTP-locked Rab21, Rab5, Rab4 and Rab11 all blocking intracellular transit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Here, we show p120RasGAP promotes ligand-bound α5 integrin subunit recycling via the Rab11 compartment in microvascular ECs. α5 integrin is first endocytosed to early endosomes in complex association with both NRP1 and NRP2 co-receptors, where p120RasGAP facilitates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation-dependent transit to Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes. siRNA silencing of both NRPs, p120RasGAP, Rab11 or inhibition of FAK phosphorylation results in the intracellular accumulation of α5 integrin. Utilising comparative proteomics analyses, we identify an upregulated escape mechanism to divert α5 integrin away from lysosomal degradation, preserving its total and surface level expression. In addition, we isolate both NRP1-dependent and NRP2-dependent α5 integrin interactomes in ECs and where they intersect during intracellular traffic. Using inducible endothelial-specific knockout mouse models, we validate these findings by demonstrating a functional loss of FN in the postnatal retina upon co-deletion of both NRP1 and NRP2, which severely impairs polarised sprouting.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A proteome-scale map of the α5 integrin interactome in unstimulated microvascular ECs</title><p id="P5">Both NRP1 and NRP2 have been independently identified as key regulators of α5 integrin trafficking and fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis in ECs. However, the independent and redundant pathways that exist between NRP1- and NRP2-directed transport of α5 integrin, or indeed their ability to crosstalk during this process, remains unclear. Furthermore, the interacting complexes that participate in NRP-dependent α5 integrin traffic are poorly annotated.</p><p id="P6">To begin addressing this question, we employed label-free quantitative data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (<italic>LFQ</italic>-DIA-MS) to acquire an unbiased insight into the molecular binding partners of α5 integrin. To this aim, proteomic analysis of WT mouse-microvascular EC lysates immunoprecipitated with α5 integrin from a total of 3 independent experiments was performed, alongside Tat-Cre-deleted ECs lacking expression of α5 integrin (α5.<italic>EC<sup>KO</sup></italic>) to isolate non-specific partner binding. The Spectronaut label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm was subsequently used for protein quantification with a p-value cutoff of &lt; 0.01. A total of 3043 proteins were identified as putative interactors of α5 integrin, including fibronectin (Fn1), β1 integrin subunit (Itgb1), NRP1 (Nrp1) and NRP2 (Nrp2), indicating that our immunoprecipitation strategy had been successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of these 3043 proteins revealed a high proportion to be involved in receptor endocytosis and trafficking, including 18 RabGTPase proteins, 18 myosin motor proteins, clathrin heavy chain-1 (Clt) (and its associated AP2 adaptor complex), caveolae-associated protein-1 (Cavn1), early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) and Gipc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Given the previously annotated roles of NRP1 and NRP2 during α5 integrin traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we proceeded to examine their interaction more closely. To this end, we confirmed a robust biochemical interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The stoichiometry of this interaction was also greatly increased following a 10-minute pre-treatment with the recycling inhibitor primaquine (PMQ), which has been demonstrated to preserve endosomal-integrin contacts in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], suggesting that NRP - α5 complexes exist more stably within endosomal punctae rather than at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). Subsequent immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis to determine the subcellular localisation of both NRPs and α5 integrin revealed all three colocalise within endosomal structures, and albeit weakly, within proximity of fibrillar adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), confirming our immunoprecipitation studies.</p><p id="P8">Next, we visualised the spatial segregation between endogenous NRP1 and NRP2 in endocytic compartments where α5 integrin has been reported to reside in, including EEA1<sup>+</sup>/Rab21<sup>+</sup> early endosomes, Rab4<sup>+</sup>/Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes and Rab7<sup>+</sup> late endosomes. Importantly, confocal microscopy in fixed ECs revealed both NRPs to initially colocalise with α5 integrin in clathrin-coated pits positive for both clathrin-heavy chain-1 and dynamin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I-J</xref>). Furthermore, NRP1 and NRP2 were found to share a surprisingly high colocalisation fidelity with each other in EEA1<sup>+</sup>, Rab21<sup>+</sup>, Rab11<sup>+</sup> and Rab7<sup>+</sup> (but not in Rab4<sup>+</sup>) punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K-M</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To corroborate our MS and confocal studies, we silenced expression of NRP1 and NRP2 individually (<italic>si</italic>NRP1, <italic>si</italic>NRP2) or simultaneously (<italic>si</italic>NRP1/2) by RNA interference (RNAi), transfecting mouse-microvascular ECs with either non-targeting (Ctrl) or NRP-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N-O</xref>) before examining α5 integrin colocalisation with endogenous Rab11. Depletion of either NRP1 or NRP2 significantly reduced the number of α5 integrin<sup>+</sup> Rab11 endosomes (Figure P-Q), confirming previous studies, and indicating a reciprocal contribution in the Rab11<sup>+</sup> long-loop recycling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Assembly of α5 integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesions and EDA-FN fibrillogenesis is impaired following NRP1/2 co-depletion in ECs</title><p id="P10">In ECs, both α5 and αV integrins are known to bind the extracellular matrix (ECM) ligand fibronectin (FN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. To begin investigating the contributions of NRP1 and NRP2 during α5 integrin-dependent adhesion to FN, a process that relies on receptor trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], we seeded Ctrl and siRNA-depleted ECs onto FN and assessed their ability to adhere over 3 hours. siRNA-mediated depletion of either NRP1 or NRP2 significantly impaired adhesion to FN over this period as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Co-depleting both NRP1 and NRP2 however, was found to rescue EC adhesion at 90 minutes and significantly ameliorate EC adhesion at 180 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Confocal microscopy imaging to visualise endogenous α5 and αV integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesions, together with the focal adhesion (FA) adaptor protein paxillin in ECs fixed at 180 minutes ± VEGF stimulation subsequently revealed significant reductions in paxillin, α5 and αV integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesion area and number in <italic>si</italic>NRP1 and <italic>si</italic>NRP2 ECs, substantiating results by Ruhrberg <italic>et al</italic>., Alghamdi <italic>et al</italic>., and Benwell <italic>et al</italic>., and our adhesion studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In comparison, <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs assembled large punctate paxillin and αV integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesions, but very few α5 integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). High resolution XZ-ratio confocal imaging subsequently confirmed paxillin<sup>+</sup> adhesions to be largely absent of α5 integrin in ECs depleted for both NRP1 and NRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Photoactivation studies employing a td-Tomato-expressing α5 integrin construct validated these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Surprisingly, no gross changes in total endogenous expression of either integrin or paxillin between our siRNA-depleted groups were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Hypothesising that αV integrin likely compensates for the loss of α5 integrin from adhesions in <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs, as alluded to by Van der Flier <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] we next employed the αVβ3-specific Cilengitide mimetic EMD66203 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] to inhibit αVβ3-specific adhesion to FN. Ctrl siRNA ECs treated with EMD66203 exhibited partially reduced adhesion to FN at 180 minutes as expected and assembled smaller paxillin<sup>+</sup> adhesions. Simultaneous inhibition of αVβ3-specific adhesion via EMD662023, alongside co-depletion of NRP1 and NRP2 resulted in a near total loss of adhesion to FN however, ECs exhibiting severe defects in cell spreading and adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-K</xref>). Taken together, we infer that additional loss of αVβ3-specific adhesion to FN sensitises ECs to the loss of α5 integrin-dependent adhesion exhibited following depletion of both NRP1 and NRP2.</p><p id="P12">Since <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs failed to assemble α5 integrin<sup>+</sup> adhesions, but displayed no reduced total expression, we proceeded to determine the subcellular localisation of α5 integrin following NRP depletion by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Compared to Ctrl ECs, where α5 integrin distributed to both surface FAs and to perinuclear punctae, we observed α5 integrin to preferentially accumulate in EEA1<sup>+</sup> early endosomes upon NRP co-depletion, particularly following VEGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L-M</xref>).</p><p id="P13">As stress-fibre associated FAs become increasingly influenced by actomyosin tension, engaged α5 integrin is translocated centripetally with the actin-binding protein tensin-1 towards the cell body. As a consequence, following 24 - 48 hours adhesion to FN, ECs exhibit a high density of hyperextended fibrillar adhesions enriched for both α5 integrin and tensin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The actomyosin tension accrued by α5 integrin translocation into fibrillar structures is also fundamental for FN dimer unfolding and subsequent FN fibrillogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Since α5 integrin failed to translocate to adhesion punctae by 180 minutes, but instead preferentially distributed to intracellular sorting endosomes in <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs, we asked whether fibrillar adhesion assembly would also be affected. By 24 hours, both <italic>si</italic>NRP1 and <italic>si</italic>NRP2 ECs displayed significantly smaller fibrillar adhesions than Ctrl ECs, whilst ECs co-depleted for both NRP1 and NRP2 failed to assemble α5 integrin<sup>+</sup> or tensin-1<sup>+</sup> fibrillar adhesions entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). This was not found to result from changes in tensin-1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 3A-B</xref>). Subsequent immuno-fluorescent visualisation of endogenous extra domain-A (EDA)-containing cellular FN (EDA-FN) revealed a concomitant loss of fibrillar FN in <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs compared to Ctrl ECs or ECs individually depleted for either NRP1 or NRP2 as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>).

Following Rab21-mediated integrin endocytosis to the early endosome, p120RasGAP, via a direct mutually exclusive interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin α-subunit, competes for integrin binding and displaces Rab21. In the absence of p120RasGAP expression, β1 integrin was found to accumulate in EEA1<sup>+</sup> endosomes, failing its exit to Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. It remains unclear however, whether p120RasGAP-dependent integrin recycling remains conserved in ECs.</p><p id="P16">Whilst our MS failed to detect p120RasGAP as directly associating with α5 integrin, a number of other GTPase interactors previously alluded to regulate endosomal transport were detected (RasGTPase-activating-like protein-1 (Iqgap1), RasGTPase-activating protein-binding protein-1 and −2 (G3bp1, G3bp2), Ras-interacting protein-1 (Rasip1), and RasGTPase-activating protein-like-2 (Rasal2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. STRING analysis was subsequently employed to generate an interaction network of these proteins, which revealed all to have been previously reported as interactors of p120RasGAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

We postulate therefore that any interaction made with α5 integrin, as signposted by Mai <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] exists weakly, and or very transiently via these adaptors.</p><p id="P17">To answer whether p120RasGAP promotes endosomal shuttling of α5 integrin in ECs, we first visualised the subcellular localisation of endogenous p120RasGAP in mouse-microvascular ECs by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and observed a strong colocalisation with α5 integrin, EEA1<sup>+</sup> endosomes and Rab21<sup>+</sup> endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, by means of biochemical immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Compared to Ctrl ECs, where α5 integrin colocalised with tensin-1<sup>+</sup> characteristic hyperextended structures, α5 integrin was lost completely from fibrillar adhesions in ECs depleted for p120RasGAP and accumulated with EDA-FN in EEA1<sup>+</sup> early endosomes, recapitulating the loss of NRP1 and NRP2. Importantly, simultaneous depletion of both Rab21 and p120RasGAP preserved α5 integrin localisation to fibrillar adhesions and restored EDA-FN polymerisation into a fibrillar network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-N</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that p120RasGAP promotes Rab11<sup>+</sup> α5 integrin recycling from early endosomes, and that the plasticity of fibrillar adhesions and EDA-fibrillogenesis depends on a functional association between Rab21 and p120RasGAP to mediate α5 integrin endocytosis and recycling respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FAK phosphorylation mediates p120RasGAP interactions with NRP - α5 integrin complexes</title><p id="P19">Concomitant to its interaction with integrin α-subunit tails, p120RasGAP has also been reported to interact with phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (<italic>p</italic>FAK), which is brought into close proximity following integrin complex endocytosis to the early endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P20">With this in mind, we next determined whether NRP complexes interact with p120RasGAP in ECs during their transit to Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes, and whether this interaction is indeed dependent upon FAK activity.

Only when NRP1 expression was depleted, where previously we observed a significantly greater interaction, did their affinity become dependent upon FAK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Importantly, our proteomics workflow enabled us to segregate a comprehensive set of NRP1-dependent and NRP2-dependent α5 integrin interactions, which we invite readers to explore as a resource for further insight.</p><p id="P35">Previous work has indeed annotated a role for both NRP1 and NRP2 in promoting α5 integrin traffic in ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], yet investigations have continued to pursue their roles in isolation rather than to consider their collective function. We observe their robust colocalisation in endocytic punctae at all stages of intracellular traffic, including clathrin-coated assemblies, early endosomes, Rab11 recycling endosomes and Rab7 late endosomes. Indeed, Rab21, EEA1, Rab11 and Rab7 were all identified as common to both NRP1 and NRP2-dependent interactors by our MS analysis. By extension, it is also possible that both NRP receptors are present during the turnover lifecycle of multiple other cell surface complexes, not only α5 integrin. For example, NRP1 has been shown to promote recycling of VEGFR-2 through Rab11<sup>+</sup> vesicles, and colocalise with VEGFR-2 in Rab7<sup>+</sup> vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Given NRP co-silencing impaired α5 integrin distribution to the Rab11 compartment to a greater extent than silencing either NRP receptor individually, we postulate that both share a mutual contribution in the ‘long-loop’ recycling pathway. For example, only in ECs depleted for both NRP1 and NRP2 did α5 integrin fail to assemble at adhesion sites entirely, and instead accumulate in early and late endosomes.</p><p id="P36">In addition to reaffirming their shared control of the Rab11 recycling pathway, our MS studies also provided great insight into the NRP’s diverging influence on non-canonical α5 integrin traffic in ECs. For example, α5 integrin’s interactions with 6 kinesin-family proteins (Kif22, Kif2c, Kif4, Kif23, Kifc1, Kif2a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], Sorting nexin 18 (Snx18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], and Rab3GAP2, (which acts as a GAP for Rab3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]), were all found to be NRP1-specific.

Whilst these NRP-specific interactions should be explored further, we also urge others to consider and investigate NRP-specific modulation of α5 integrin in other cellular pathways, such as the cell cycle and during cell stress responses, both of which showed an enriched interaction score favouring regulation by NRP1. As such, we propose this α5 integrin interactome dataset as a comprehensive map of candidate associations in ECs.</p><p id="P37">Despite their reciprocal contribution during Rab11-mediated recycling, we do find it interesting that NRP2 only preferentially associated with p120RasGAP on early endosomes when NRP1 expression is silenced.

As p120RasGAP and Rab21 compete for a mutually exclusive interaction with α-integrin tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], we hypothesise that NRP1 and NRP2 also competitively associate with p120RasGAP during their transit to Rab11 recycling endosomes. In fibroblasts, fibronectin-integrin-mediated FAK activation was shown to promote SH2-mediated binding of p120RasGAP to p190RhoGAP. In turn, p190RhoGAP phosphorylation stabilised their complex association at leading edge adhesions to regulate cell polarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. We believe it is likely that internalised integrin-NRP complexes deliver active FAK to p120RasGAP in ECs, thereby promoting polarised integrin recycling and directional migration by facilitating p120-p190 association. For example, <italic>si</italic>p120RasGAP and <italic>si</italic>NRP1/2 ECs failed to assemble polarised adhesions and exhibited impaired directional migratory capacity.
