In mammals and in larval zebrafish, Purkinje neurons can generate tonic firing even when isolated from the network. Here we investigated the ionic basis of tonic firing in Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish using voltage clamp for isolation of membrane currents along with pharmacology. We discovered that these neurons express L-type and P/Q-type high voltage- gated calcium currents, T-type low voltage-gated calcium currents and SK and BK- type calcium dependent potassium currents. Among these, L-type calcium currents and SK-type calcium-dependent potassium currents were indispensable for tonic firing, while blocking T-type, P/Q-type and BK currents had little effect. We observed that action potentials were broadened when either L-type or SK channels were blocked. Based on these results, we propose that calcium entry via L-type calcium channels activates SK potassium channels leading to faster action potential repolarization, in turn aiding the removal of inactivation of sodium channels. This allows larval zebrafish Purkinje neurons to continue to fire tonically for sustained periods. In mammals also, tonic firing in Purkinje neurons is driven by calcium channels coupling to calcium-dependent potassium channels, yet the specific types of channels involved are different. We therefore suggest that coupling of calcium channels and calcium-dependent potassium channels could be a conserved mechanism for sustaining long bouts of high frequency firing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calcium current</kwd><kwd>calcium-dependent potassium current</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>Purkinje neuron</kwd><kwd>voltage clamp</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The cerebellum is one of the most highly conserved regions of the vertebrate brain: the cell types, gene expression patterns and connectivity are highly homologous among all vertebrate classes from fish to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nieuwenhuys, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>). This is particularly true for Purkinje neurons (PNs), which are the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex and have similar molecular markers, dendritic morphology and connectivity across all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Robra and Thirumalai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kidd, 2017</xref>). PNs are critical for cerebellar function and their impairment leads to loss of motor co-ordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Taroni and DiDonato, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chopra and Shakkottai, 2014</xref>).

Investigating the ionic basis of PN activity in non-mammalian vertebrates is important for understanding key properties essential for its functioning.</p><p id="P4">In zebrafish, PNs differentiate by 3 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hamling et al., 2015</xref>) and stable electrical activity patterns can be observed as early as 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>). In addition, calcium imaging and ablation studies report that the PN population participates in natural behaviors of larval zebrafish at these stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Markov et al., 2021</xref>). Given the relative ease of cell identification, single cell recording and pharmacology in larval zebrafish, we chose to investigate the ionic basis of PN activity in this model system.</p><p id="P5"><italic>In vivo</italic> recordings show that like mammalian PNs, larval zebrafish PNs (zPNs) exhibit simple spikes mediated by TTX-sensitive sodium channels and that they can fire spontaneously even when isolated from the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>). Like mammalian PNs, these neurons also have elaborate dendritic arbors in the molecular layer and receive excitatory synaptic inputs from parallel fibers of granule cells and climbing fibers (CF) of the inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sitaraman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">While the cerebellar circuitry and PN physiology are largely conserved across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), there are some differences between the firing properties of PNs in rodents versus zebrafish. Simple spikes are attenuated in the soma and complex spikes are completely absent, unlike mammalian PNs. Also, zPNs exhibit bistability, while this is a subject of debate for mammalian PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Loewenstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schonewille et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Engbers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>). These differences suggest underlying variation in the biophysics of PNs across these two systems. However, the kinds of ionic conductances expressed in zPNs and their contribution to spontaneous activity are largely unknown.</p><p id="P7">Our earlier work showed that zPNs can exist in one of two stable membrane potential states: when in the depolarized state, they fire tonically and when hyperpolarized, they fire in bursts. Tonic firing is an intrinsic property of zPNs that persists even in the absence of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>), similar to mammalian PNs. Here, we investigate the ionic conductances responsible for tonic firing in zPNs. We show that these cells have a large calcium current contributed by L and T-type calcium channels with a minor contribution from P/Q type channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels or SK-type calcium dependent potassium channels had the same effect: a decrease or a complete cessation of tonic firing. Blocking SK channels also leads to a shallower AHP which reduces the pool of available sodium channels to drive tonic activity. Together, our results show that L-type and SK channels are critical for maintaining high-frequency tonic firing in zPNs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Spontaneous activity in Purkinje Neurons</title><p id="P8">We performed whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology from PNs <italic>in vivo</italic> in larval zebrafish at 5-11 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As has been reported previously, zPNs display two distinct firing modes: tonic and bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). We were also able to switch the state of the cell by supplying a constant current. Both the modes show the presence of sodium-mediated simple spikes as well as climbing fiber (CF) EPSPs. The two modes also differ in several key characteristics: membrane potential, firing frequencies of simple spikes, and their dependence on synaptic input. We plotted the distribution of membrane potential at each data point from the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C and D</xref>, after applying a median filter to isolate the low frequency membrane potential changes. While the distribution for the tonic state is unimodal, that for the bursting state is bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The modes of these distributions, referred to as resting membrane potential, are also different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The inter-spike intervals (ISI) of simple spikes are more variable for the bursting mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). This difference in inter-spike interval can also be seen as difference in the bursting index. Bursting index was quantified as the mean of ISIs divided by their median. Consequently, if the neuron is firing at regular intervals, the bursting index will be closer to 1. A higher bursting index indicates more variability in ISI and therefore more bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref> have shown that these cells can maintain tonic firing even in the absence of synaptic inputs. On the other hand, CF inputs can trigger bursts when zPNs are hyperpolarized. Further, zPNs display calcium spikes when they are depolarized above spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, arrow). These results suggest that zPNs have significant high threshold calcium currents. It is also obvious that the tonic firing mode is dependent on the intrinsic properties of zPNs unlike the bursting mode which is activated by synaptic inputs.</p><p id="P10">Therefore, we wished to determine the major ion channels involved in maintaining tonic firing in these neurons. To do this, we measured cellular currents in voltage clamp mode and also compared spontaneous activity of zPNs when specific channel types were blocked with antagonists. We quantified several parameters including resting membrane potential, simple spike amplitudes, rates, shapes, etc., and compared them across the two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Voltage-gated calcium channels regulate tonic firing</title><p id="P11">We wanted to understand how calcium currents shape the spontaneous activity of zPNs <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this, we first performed voltage clamp experiments to measure the total calcium current. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, we delivered voltage command pulses in the presence of TTX and TEA and measured cellular currents before and after application of 10 μM cadmium chloride, a non-specific, high voltage-gated calcium channel blocker. A cadmium-sensitive inward current with peak values at a holding potential of -20mV was observed in all cells we recorded from (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we recorded from zPNs in current clamp mode under bursting and tonic-firing conditions before and after application of 10 μM cadmium chloride. We recorded the state of the cell without current injection and then made it switch states by injecting a constant depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current. After perfusing the antagonist in the bath, we recorded from the same cell again in both states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We found that the cells could still fire in both states even in the presence of cadmium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). 4 out of 11 cells switched states upon the addition of cadmium while the rest continued to fire in the same state. Although the resting membrane potential in both states did not change, tonic firing of simple spikes was affected. Simple spikes became smaller in amplitude and less frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H, I</xref>). ISIs became more irregular, with a higher coefficient of variation (CV of ISI in tonic mode for control: 0.81 ± 0.06; cadmium: 1.73 ± 0.11). 3 of the 11 cells went into depolarization-induced block later in the recording. We did not observe any drastic changes in the bursting behavior and the bursting index remained the same in cadmium compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L, M</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The above results suggest a role for voltage-gated calcium channels in tonic firing. However, application of cadmium in the bath affects voltage-gated channels everywhere, including those that mediate neurotransmission. To rule out network-mediated effects and to test this in a cell specific manner, we next blocked calcium channels intracellularly using the calcium chelator 1,2-bis (o-amino phenoxy) ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetra acetic acid (BAPTA). We recorded from cells using normal patch internal solution or with 20 mM of BAPTA. Cells recorded with BAPTA in internal solution were also able to fire in both states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), with no change in amplitude but a decrease in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J, K</xref>). Bursting index and the spike rate within bursts remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2N, O</xref>), underlining the importance of calcium currents in regulating tonic firing specifically.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Calcium currents in zPNs are primarily driven by L and T-type channels</title><p id="P15">Neurons express many different types of voltage-gated calcium channels, with distinct kinetics and effects on neuronal firing properties. We wanted to determine the classes of voltage-gated calcium channels expressed in zPNs. Takeuchi et al., 2017 analyzed the transcriptome of 12 dpf zPNs. From their dataset, we looked for the expression levels of genes encoding voltage-gated calcium channels and found significant expression of transcripts encoding L-type, P/Q type and T-type channel subunits, with L-type showing highest levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Auxiliary subunits of calcium channels were also strongly expressed.</p><p id="P16">Supported by this dataset, we set out to measure calcium currents in zPNs using voltage clamp protocols and pharmacology. We recorded the current response of cells to a series of voltage pulses in the presence of 1 μM TTX and 1 mM TEA. We recorded the response in normal saline and after application of different calcium channel antagonists and plotted their current-voltage (I-V) relationships. As before, we observed a large inward current active between -50 mV and +20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B and D</xref>). We then quantified the contributions of three subtypes- L and T and P/Q using Nifedipine, mibefradil and ω-agatoxin IVA, respectively. Nifedipine has been shown to have off target effects on T-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shcheglovitov et al., 2005</xref>). To nullify the off-target effect, we first added mibefradil, a T-type specific blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esneu et al., 1998</xref>), followed by nifedipine. We found that the inward current was partially blocked by the T-type channel blocker, Mibefradil. In 100 μM Mibefradil, the peak inward current was reduced to 50% of the control values. Addition of 100 μM of the L-type channel blocker Nifedipine further decreased the peak inward current to 10% of the control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). On the other hand, application of the P/Q type channel blocker, ω-agatoxin IVA (100 nM) reduced the current by only 9 percent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). We also found that the presence of ω-agatoxin IVA had no significant effect on the tonic firing rate in Purkinje neurons (Mean firing rate control: 7.78 ± 1.75 Hz; ω-agatoxin IVA: 6.90 ± 1.68 Hz; N= 6; data not shown).</p><p id="P17">Overall, we found that L and T-type calcium channels are major contributors to voltage-gated calcium current. Wen and group (Wen et. al., 2013) have reported a reduced sensitivity of ω-agatoxin IVA to zebrafish P/Q channels. It is therefore possible that we underestimated the P/Q current in our voltage-clamp studies. However, both voltage-clamp and transcriptome data show a major contribution of L-type calcium channels.</p><p id="P18">We next asked how each of these channel types contributed to the tonic firing in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>L-type, but not T-type channels are required for sustained tonic firing</title><p id="P19">To understand the contribution of T-type calcium channels to tonic firing in zPNs, we recorded their firing pattern before and after application of the T-type channel blocker, Mibefradil. Unlike cadmium and intracellular BAPTA, application of 100 μM Mibefradil failed to alter tonic firing frequency or amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). These data show, that T-type channels are not significant contributors to tonic firing in zPNs.</p><p id="P20">Next, we recorded from zPNs in current clamp mode before and after application of the L-type channel blocker, Nifedipine. The effect on spike rate was similar to that of adding cadmium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, F</xref>). Nifedipine also changed the shape of the spike, as evidenced by increases in spike decay time and width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I-K</xref>). To determine if this was due to overall changes in membrane potential, we looked at the distribution of membrane potentials in control versus presence of nifedipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). We observed an overall shift towards more depolarized membrane potentials across all cells. However, we observed a decrease in the amount of time spent by the cell in the spiking ranges (-40 to -25 mV) indicating that the cells were firing fewer simple spikes overall. These results are consistent with the broadening of the simple spike and the overall reduction in spike rate.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>L-type calcium currents are active during spike repolarization</title><p id="P21">To better understand the effect of nifedipine without the influence of synaptic inputs, we also recorded the response of cells in the presence of synaptic blockers (NBQX and gabazine). We then provided a negative current to hyperpolarize the cell to -70 mV. In this way, the cells were silent unless depolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We observed that the amplitude of AHP decreased while the threshold to spiking increased further confirming the role of L-type channels in repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C-D</xref>). In response to a 2-second-long depolarizing current, there was an increase in the spike adaptation ratio (Frequency of first spike/Frequency of 10th spike) further suggesting that this repolarization maybe important for sustained firing of simple spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Calcium imaging studies from PNs show calcium entry and elevation of cytosolic calcium levels during simple spike firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ramirez and Stell, 2016</xref>, Varma et al., 2024, Knogler et al., 2019), suggesting that voltage-gated calcium channels are activated during simple spike firing. To confirm if L-type channels are indeed active during simple spike firing in zPNs and to explore their possible role in repolarization, we replayed a train of simple spikes as the voltage command. We found that replaying the simple spike waveform as recorded at the soma (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) did not recruit sodium channels. This could be because of attenuation of the somatically recorded spike waveform, making the waveform too weak to activate sodium channels in the axonal spike initiation zone. Scaling up the amplitude of simple spikes led to a significant sodium current (data not shown). We, therefore, decided to use a scaled-up version of the simple spike waveform (~2.5 x of original).</p><p id="P23">To quantify the calcium currents, all experiments were done in the presence of sodium and potassium channel antagonists (TTX and TEA). We found a large, inward current in response to the simple spike waveform. We also saw that this current was slow to activate and achieved maximum amplitude well beyond the peak of a simple spike, corresponding to the repolarization and AHP phases of the simple spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Importantly, this current decreased by 66% in the presence of nifedipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and F</xref>).</p><p id="P24">These experiments show that L-type channels are indeed active when the cell fires simple spikes. The channels achieve maximum activation after the peak of the simple spike, during the repolarization phase.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>BK channels also contribute to membrane repolarization but do not modulate tonic firing frequency</title><p id="P25">We were surprised to find that the L-type calcium channels were active during the repolarization phase and that blocking them increased spike width. Both of these observations could be explained if these effects were mediated by calcium-dependent potassium channels (KCa). If these were true, the effect of blocking KCa channels should mimic the effect of blocking L-type calcium channels. Typically, KCa channels can be of large (BK), intermediate (IK) or small (SK) conductance. Of these BK and SK channels are known to be important for spike repolarization and AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Womack and Khodakhah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We first tested whether BK channels couple with L-type channels and contribute to membrane repolarization. Blocking BK channels with 100 nM iberiotoxin, had no effect on the tonic firing frequency of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, C</xref>). The spike amplitude was also not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, similar to L-type block, we observed a slight broadening of the simple spike and a dip in the AHP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D-G</xref>).</p><p id="P27">We also examined whether zPNs could generate simple spikes in a sustained manner upon depolarization, before and after application of iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). These experiments were performed in the presence of synaptic blockers and the cell was depolarized from a baseline of -70 mV. Presence of iberiotoxin did not change the spike adaptation ratio (Frequency of first spike/ Frequency of 10th spike) or spiking threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I- L</xref>). This suggests that while BK channels may contribute to membrane repolarization, they do not control the firing frequency of simple spikes.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>SK channels couple to L-type channels to sustain tonic firing</title><p id="P28">On the other hand, we observed that blocking small conductance (SK) channels with apamin mimicked the effects of L-type channel block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Simple spikes were smaller and less frequent in the tonic mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 D, E</xref>) despite only a small increase in the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The membrane potential distribution also revealed further similarities between the apamin and nifedipine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similar to experiments with nifedipine, we observed a shift in the membrane potential as compared to control with fewer points in spiking range (-40 to -35 mV). This indicated that while the cells were slightly depolarized in the presence of apamin they did fire simple spikes less frequently. Spikes also became broader and the AHP shallower pointing toward their role in the repolarization of simple spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 F-I</xref>).</p><p id="P29">These data show that L-type calcium channels maintain the tonic firing of simple spikes and contribute to spike repolarization by activating SK channels.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>SK currents sustain high-frequency firing for a long duration by increasing sodium channel availability</title><p id="P30">The input resistance and rheobase of the cells did not change significantly in the presence of either apamin or nifedipine (Mean input resistance control = 1.559 ± 134.753 G ohms apamin = 1.078 ± 154.870; p-value = 0.912.

To test if SK channels contribute to sustained firing, we depolarized zPNs and recorded their firing responses in the absence of synaptic input as described in the previous section. In response to a two-second-long pulse, the cells did not show any spike adaptation across the entire pulse under control conditions. On the other hand, in the presence of apamin, the same cells fired simple spikes for up to 500 ms and then became irregular or silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7J</xref>).

We applied each antagonist in the external milieu of the fish, blocking a class of channels throughout the body. Because of this, when comparing firing patterns, we cannot completely negate the effect of altered synaptic inputs. Nevertheless, our BAPTA experiments show that the effects of calcium channel block on simple spike firing rate are mainly due to intrinsic changes. Further, the effects of nifedipine and apamin on tonic firing persisted even under conditions of synaptic blockade. These results give us confidence that we have successfully isolated ionic mechanisms of tonic firing in zPNs.</p><p id="P35">Still, we cannot rule out any off-target effects of the channel antagonists or that they have reduced affinity for their intended targets in zebrafish. To address the latter, we performed voltage clamp experiments to test if the blockers affected cellular currents in their expected voltage range. For example, the L-type channel blocker Nifedipine blocked cellular currents in the depolarized voltage ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), as expected. These results attest to the specificity of these agents towards their intended target. The relatively minor effects of ω-agatoxin IVA and iberiotoxin could also be due to their limited interactions with zebrafish P/Q-type and BK channels respectively and therefore, these negative results should be interpreted cautiously. This study has also not examined persistent sodium channels, which are known to drive tonic firing in other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agrawal et. al., 2001</xref>; Cho et. al., 2015), including mammalian PNs (Raman and Bean, 1997).</p><p id="P36">In this study, we focused on channels that affected the tonic state. None of the identified channels seemed to affect spiking in the bursting state. Bursting requires synaptic input and when GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs are blocked, zPNs become quiescent upon hyperpolarization. A full investigation of mechanisms driving bursting and those governing switches from one state to another is necessary to fully understand PN dynamics. One challenge is the high variability of bursting within and among cells. A higher sample size (both in the duration of recordings and the number of cells) might allow us to find subtle changes in bursting parameters.</p><p id="P37">Our study captures the contribution of calcium currents in a small developmental window. All of the experiments were done on larvae between the ages of 5-11 dpf. By this stage, the cerebellum is functional and Purkinje neurons display their characteristic firing. However, this is still an early developmental stage and the circuit undergoes further maturation. The cerebellum grows in volume with a concurrent increase in Purkinje neuron numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hamling et al., 2015</xref>). During this time, PNs elaborate dendritic arbors in the molecular layer and make numerous synaptic contacts with parallel and climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sitaraman et al., 2021</xref>). But not much is known about maturation of ion channel distributions in zPNs. In rodents, it is well appreciated that the first two weeks of post-natal life is a period of drastic developmental changes in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">van Welie et al., 2011</xref>) with changes in firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">McKay and Turner, 2005</xref>), ion channel distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Womack and Khodakhah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hosy et al., 2011</xref>), and synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hashimoto and Kano, 2013</xref>). It is likely that zPNs also undergo such developmental transformation during early larval stages and these processes remain to be studied.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Physiology of Purkinje neurons in teleosts and mammals</title><p id="P38">Purkinje neurons in teleosts share many of the properties of mammalian PNs as has been shown in this and in many previous studies. PNs in teleosts and in mammals are arranged in a monolayer and send elaborate dendritic arbors into the molecular layer where they receive numerous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from conserved cell types and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Meek, 1992</xref>). Studies localizing protein markers have been carried out extensively in rodent PNs and in zPNs. Both rodent PNs and zPNs express the dopamine and cAMP regulated phospho protein Darpp32 also known as ppp1r1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ouimet et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Robra and Thirumalai, 2016</xref>). Expression of Glutamate receptor delta 2 is also seen in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Araki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mikami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tam et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, Zebrin II expression shows distinct expression patterns in rodent and zebrafish PNs: in rodents, PNs are organized into alternating Zebrin II -positive and negative stripes whereas in zebrafish, the expression is uniform in all PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Both mammalian PNs and teleost PNs receive excitatory inputs from parallel fibers and climbing fibers and fire simple spikes spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pose-Méndez et al., 2023</xref>). In rodents, PNs seem to exhibit bistable behavior, with an ‘up’ state where they fire action potentials and a ‘down’ state where they are quiescent and may fire bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Womack and Khodakhah, 2002</xref>). Excitatory climbing fiber inputs or inhibitory input from molecular layer interneurons could toggle PNs between these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Loewenstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Oldfield et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Engbers et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, bistability in rodents PNs <italic>in vivo</italic> is contested due to the effect of anesthetics on PN physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schonewille et al., 2006</xref>). We have shown previously that zPNs are bistable and that stimulating climbing fibers triggers bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sengupta and Thirumalai, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Finally, it is noteworthy that zebrafish are poikilotherms and prefer to live at temperatures around 25 to 30°C. Under lab conditions, they are maintained at 28 °C, which is much cooler than the mammalian body temperature of 37 °C. Such differences in temperature might contribute to large differences in channel kinetics. Despite this, activity patterns not only in PNs but also other cell types such as spinal motor neurons are largely similar across zebrafish and mammals. For instance the intracellularly recorded spike width of cat motor neurons is comparable to that of larval zebrafish motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brock et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jha and Thirumalai, 2020</xref>). We speculate that compensatory mechanisms could exist to mitigate the temperature differences. These could occur at two levels: the structure of the channel could be modified such that the gating kinetics remain consistent despite the difference in temperature; or the difference in kinetics of channels may be compensated such that overall output of the neuron remains the same. Indeed, studies have shown that cold-blooded systems are capable of maintaining similar output of neurons or networks over a wide range of temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alonso and Marder, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Calcium and calcium-activated potassium currents in PNs</title><p id="P41">Much of what we know regarding ionic conductances underlying PN activity comes from experiments performed in rodent cerebellar slices acutely, or PNs in dissociated culture. These studies have shown that calcium currents activated by the action potential are mainly carried by P/Q-type and T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Raman and Bean, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Swensen and Bean, 2003</xref>). Calcium entry through these channels activates BK and SK calcium-dependent potassium channels and for this reason, blocking calcium channels or KCa potassium channels produces the same effect on spontaneous firing of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Womack and Khodakhah, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003</xref>). Our experiments on zPNs point to some similarities and differences. Like in mammals, fish PNs also regulate spontaneous tonic firing via calcium channels and calcium-dependent potassium channels. But, in zPNs, calcium enters via the L-type and not the P/Q type calcium channels. While P/Q type channels are coupled to SK channels in rodents, we find that L-type channels are coupled to SK channels in fish. Neuronal firing is regulated by the coupling of calcium channels and calcium-dependent channels in many other neuronal types as well such as in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lancaster et al., 1991</xref>), midbrain dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</xref>), neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Smith et al., 2002</xref>) etc. In each case, the voltage-gated calcium channel through which calcium enters and the type of calcium-dependent potassium channels it is coupled to is different. Together with our results, these studies suggest that coupling of calcium and calcium-dependent potassium channels is a conserved mechanism for regulating neuronal firing properties across vertebrates and across neuronal types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p id="P42">The use of all experimental animals (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (NCBS-IAE-2020/14(R1E)) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (TFR/NCBS/14-IBSC/VT1/2011).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Fish rearing and care</title><p id="P43">Indian wild type zebrafish were used for all experiments.

To estimate resting membrane potential, the traces were first passed through a moving median filter (window size 120 ms) to remove fast membrane potential changes due to spikes. For the tonic state, resting membrane potential was taken as the mode of membrane potential distribution of the filtered trace. In case of the bursting state, the membrane potential had a bimodal distribution and the two modes were considered as the two resting membrane potentials. The unfiltered traces were used to identify the simple spikes and the climbing fibre inputs. An amplitude threshold was used to distinguish the climbing fiber inputs (&gt; 30 mV) from the simple spikes (10-30 mV). The simple spikes were further filtered on the basis of their shape, rise and decay times, and width. The decay time is time required to settle back to 10% of peak amplitude. Action potential width was measured at half amplitude. Threshold was determined to be 4 percent of maximal dv/dt value. AHP values were calculated as the difference between threshold and the most hyperpolarized point immediately following the peak of the actional potential. Bursts were defined as any group of three or more spikes with an interval less than 300 ms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the funding agencies listed below and Mr. P.T.
