CTPS is capable of directly binding to all four nucleotide triphosphates: ATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. Furthermore, CTPS can form cytoophidia in vivo and metabolic filaments in vitro, undergoing regulation at multiple levels. CTPS is considered a potential therapeutic target for combating invasions or infections by virus or prokaryotic pathogens. Utilizing cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CTPS (ecCTPS) filament in complex with CTP, NADH, and the covalent inhibitor DON, achieving a resolution of 2.8Å. We construct a phylogenetic tree based on differences in filament-forming interfaces and design a variant to validate our hypothesis, providing an evolutionary perspective on the CTPS filament formation. Our computational analysis reveals a solvent-accessible ammonia tunnel upon DON binding. By comparative structural analysis, we discern a distinct mode of CTP binding of ecCTPS, differing from eukaryotic counterparts. Combining biochemical assays and structural analysis, we determine and validate the synergistic inhibitory effects of CTP with NADH or adenine on CTPS. Our results expand our comprehension of diverse regulatory aspects of CTPS and lay a foundation for the design of specific inhibitors targeting prokaryotic CTPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CTP synthase</kwd><kwd>cytoophidium</kwd><kwd>metabolic filament</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>species specific inhibition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">CTP synthase (CTPS) plays a critical role in catalyzing the final and rate-limiting step of de novo CTP synthesis. CTPS is composed of a glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) domain and a kinase-like ammonia ligase (AL) domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It converts the substrate UTP into CTP, utilizing ammonia generated from glutamine and ATP as an energy source[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Considering the indispensability of its product CTP in DNA, RNA and phospholipid synthesis, CTPS is meticulously regulated across various layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. While CTP can inhibit its activity, GTP serves as an enzymatic regulator, stimulating the reaction at low concentrations and inhibiting it at higher levels. The redox cofactor NADH has been found to inhibit ecCTPS, holding potential physiological relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In solution, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CTPS (ecCTPS) exists as an inactive dimeric form under dilute conditions. Upon the addition of substrate UTP and ATP, it transitions into an active tetrameric form, which is also observed in eukaryotic CTPS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The presence of product CTP prompts CTPS to shift into an inactive tetrameric state for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that CTP can bind to CTPS at two distinct binding sites for various eukaryotic species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Beyond oligomerization, CTPS demonstrates the capability to further aggregate, forming metabolic filaments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Filaments of CTPS have been confirmed and characterized in multiple species and conditions, where ecCTPS has been shown to form large-scale, inhibitory filaments in the presence of product CTP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Both human hCTPS1 and hCTPS2, along with Drosophila CTPS, can form different filaments under the conditions of ATP, UTP, or CTP, with varying effects on reaction promotion. Ura7 and ura8 from budding yeast also form filaments under substrate and product conditions and respond to changes in pH[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P5">CTPS has been observed to aggregate into micron-scale non-membrane-bound organelles named cytoophidium (plural cytoophidia), due to their snake-like appearance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Cytoophidia are highly conserved across multiple species and all three domains of life, suggesting their special biological roles. In prokaryotes, cytoophidia were initially observed and demonstrated to be crucial for the morphology of bacteria, such as <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> have served as a classic model for studying CTPS cytoophidia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Through experiments involving point mutations and others, CTPS cytoophidia have been found to have close ties to adipose tissue architecture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Despite its complex regulation, the vital biological role of CTPS positions it as a potential drug target for diseases such as cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], bacterial infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], and parasitic infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. As our understanding deepens, the design for targeted regulation of CTPS and species-specific regulation are becoming feasible. Recently, Matthew J. McLeod et al unveiled the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine-5′-triphosphate, a therapeutic agent against solid tumors, on ecCTPS. It exhibited strong binding affinity, approximately 80-fold greater than CTP, providing novel insights into inhibitor development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].

Incorporating phylogenetic analysis and bioengineering, we gain evolutionary insights into CTPS filament formation. Through computational analysis, we reveal a solvent-accessible ammonia tunnel upon DON binding. Our structures capture the interaction between NADH and ecCTPS, and biochemical assays reveal that NADH achieves synergistic inhibition by interacting with the ATP binding pocket through its Adenine moiety. Furthermore, we identify distinct CTP binding and inhibition modes in ecCTPS compared to already resolved eukaryotic CTPS structures due to sequence variations. Our findings potentially lay the groundwork for developing species-specific CTPS inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Result</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure of ecCTPS bound with CTP, NADH and DON</title><p id="P8">Recently, it has been discovered that CTPS possesses the intriguing ability to spontaneously assemble into filaments in vitro under different conditions. Structures of CTPS filament have been solved in various eukaryotic organisms, including human, drosophila, and budding yeast. Previously, researchers have observed and characterized CTPS filaments from the prokaryote in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="P9">In pursuit of establishing a more robust structural foundation for the study of prokaryotic CTPS filaments, we employed a recombinant expression approach to purify and isolate the CTPS protein from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis, we resolved the structure of purified ecCTPS bounded with CTP, NADH and 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (DON), achieving a resolution of 2.8Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>). During the sample preparation process, under conditions with product CTP, we observed a distinct filamentous arrangement of ecCTPS in the cryo samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). The results of 2D classification provided a clear visualization of ecCTPS filament, wherein it assembles into filaments with CTPS tetramers as the helical unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Consistent with findings previously elucidated by Rachael M Barry et al, the interface of the ecCTPS filament comprises two major interaction regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). One of these regions is located at the linker domain of CTPS, where chains A and A’ engage in a symmetric complementary way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Notably, the density of residue F281 appears to participate in a direct touch with the density of F281’. These interactions likely contribute to the stability of the ecCTPS filament. The second interface is situated between helices 330-335 within the GAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The evolution of CTPS filament assembly</title><p id="P11">In comparison to eukaryotic CTPS, the assembly way of ecCTPS filament exhibits significant distinctions. The assembly interface of solved eukaryotic CTPS filaments is primarily centered on helix 12, a sequence that is absent in the E. coli counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). In order to systematically analyze this phenomenon from an evolutionary perspective, we selected CTPS sequences from 112 species for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. This dataset included 50 prokaryotes, 23 eukaryotes, and 39 archaea. The presence or absence of α helix 12 was used as a classification criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The evolutionary analysis reveals that among the selected 112 species, α helix 12 is present in nearly all eukaryotes (&gt;95%), while it is absent in all prokaryotes and the majority of archaea (88%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Based on the presence or absence of α helix 12 for sequence classification, we observed that the majority of organisms possessing helix 12 are eukaryotes, with only a small fraction belonging to archaea. Conversely, among the species lacking α helix 12, prokaryotes and archaea constitute the predominant groups. Notably, within the analyzed dataset, only one eukaryotic organism is devoid of α helix 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Insertion of helix12 allows ecCTPS to form filaments with substrates</title><p id="P13">Based on both previous research and our experimental findings, it is established that the wild-type ecCTPS is capable of forming filaments in the presence of the product CTP. However, filament formation was not observed in the presence of substrates UTP or ATP.</p><p id="P14">In order to elucidate the necessity and role of helix 12 in CTPS filament formation, we engineered, expressed, and purified ecCTPS with an inserted hCTPS helix 12 (referred as ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We employed AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup>. Among the five structures predicted, rank 2 exhibited the best performance across various criteria, leading us to select this model for subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8</xref>). Structural alignment revealed that ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup> possesses a markedly different secondary structure compared to wild type ecCTPS. The insertion of the human CTPS sequence resulted in the extension of the originally shorter loop337-341, forming a complete helix that bears a resemblance to α helix12, responsible for filament assembly in eukaryotic CTPS(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). When we aligned the predicted model with hCTPS1 filament based on the filament assembly interface, we observed a high degree of similarity, with an RMSD of 0.479 angstroms. H346 and W349 exhibited patterns consistent with His355 and Trp358 of hCTPS1, which play vital roles in the filament assembly(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). This implies that ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup> possesses a structural basis for assembling into filaments resembling those in hCTPS1.</p><p id="P16">To further investigate the nature of ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup>, we prepared samples of it in both substrate and product states. Upon analyzing cryo-samples of ecCTPS<sup>helix12+</sup>, we observed that this engineered variant not only formed filaments in the presence of the product CTP but also exhibited filament formation in the presence of substrates UTP and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Intriguingly, the arrangement of the formed filaments exhibited a connected X-shaped pattern, resembling the previously observed helix 12-mediated helical interface in eukaryotic CTPS filaments. This result demonstrates that the insertion of hCTPS helix 12 is sufficient to alter the assembly mode of ecCTPS filaments, suggesting the pivotal role of helix 12 in determining the CTPS filament assembly pattern.</p><p id="P17">Our study establishes a connection between protein sequences and the assembly of CTPS filaments, while also providing an evolutionary perspective on the formation of CTPS filaments.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DON binding and ammonia tunnel formation of ecCTPS</title><p id="P18">CTPS is composed of GAT and AL domains, and during the reaction, the intermediate product ammonia is transferred between the two domains through an internal gas tunnel. DON is an irreversible inhibitor of CTPS, which can covalently bind to CTPS and inhibit its activity.</p><p id="P19">In 1971, A. Levitzki et al. demonstrated that even after DON binding, prokaryotic CTPS can still use NH4+ as a substrate for CTP synthesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In our obtained structure, DON forms a covalent bond with C359, a residue critical for the catalytic function of ecCTPS. Surrounding amino acids, such as F353, contribute to its binding and stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Upon the conjunction of DON, the GAT domain adopts a closed conformation, preventing external NH4+ from accessing the ammonia tunnel through the catalytic pocket of GAT for further utilization by the AL domain.</p><p id="P20">Through computational analysis, we observed the presence of a solvent-accessible channel on the side of F353 close to the AL domain, connecting an internal cavity within the GAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B and C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The minimum diameter of this channel exceeds 1.7 Å allowing the passage of NH4+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). This cavity is also positioned above the ammonia tunnel that connects to the AL domain, where we identified a minimum diameter of the ammonia tunnel above 1.3 Å, allowing the transfer of the intermediate products. The existence of this entrance of ammonia tunnel explains the feasibility of ecCTPS utilizing NH4+ as a substrate when DON bound to the GAT pocket.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Diverse binding modes of CTP in CTPS</title><p id="P22">The product CTP serves as a natural inhibitor of various eukaryotic CTPS and can bind to the substrate binding pockets of UTP or ATP in two distinct inhibitory modes: competitive and non-competitive with substrate UTP.</p><p id="P23">In our structure of ecCTPS, CTP binding was observed in the UTP-binding pocket(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), consistent with previously resolved ecCTPS-CTP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). CTP shares the triphosphate binding site with UTP, and interactions between coenzyme magnesium ions and the triphosphate moiety further stabilize CTP binding. The cytidine head and ribose of CTP are enveloped by three adjacent protomers, stabilized through electronic interactions(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A&amp;B</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Previous research has revealed that the product CTP can bind to CTPS near the substrate ATP binding pocket. This binding mode, initially discovered in dmCTPS in 2021, emerged years after the classical CTP binding site was identified. As a result, this unique CTP binding mode was coined as the ‘non-classical binding of CTP.’ Subsequently, the existence of non-classical CTP binding mode was also confirmed in both hCTPS1 and hCTPS2.</p><p id="P25">In this non-classical binding mode, the triphosphate moiety of CTP shares the same pocket as ATP, while the cytidine head of CTP adopts a distinct binding mode alongside the adenine head of ATP(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). However, in proximity to the ATP-binding pocket, we did not observe the density of CTP in our map. Aligning the structure with those of dmCTPS and hCTPS containing non-canonical CTP binding, we identified a clash between the CTP head of the eukaryotic CTPS model and the solvent-accessible surface of ecCTPS model due to the hindrance by amino acids His75 and Ile20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). This clash impedes CTP from binding to ecCTPS in a non-competitive inhibitory mode similar to that in eukaryotic CTPS, within the ATP pocket.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NADH binds to ecCTPS in the ATP binding pocket</title><p id="P26">In earlier research, C. Habrian et al. discovered that NADH can synergistically inhibit CTPS along with CTP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. However, the molecular basis for this regulation is missing. We observed NADH binding in the ATP-binding pocket in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). At the 1σ counter level, the adenine head of NADH exhibited well-defined density, while the remaining portion lacked stable density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Within the ATP pocket, the adenine moiety of NADH exhibits a mode of interaction similar to that of ADP with the protein. The N1 atom forms a set of hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atom on the V241 backbone, with a distance of 3 angstroms. Additionally, the N6 atom forms another set of stronger hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom on the K239 backbone, with a distance of 2.5 angstroms. Furthermore, adenine is within 3.8 angstroms of the plane of the R211 side chain, forming a strong pi-pi interaction, which, along with surrounding hydrophobic amino acids, stabilizes the binding of adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). According to our model, the adenine moiety of NADH exhibits a stronger interaction with the ATP binding pocket of ecCTPS compared to the adenine moiety of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). This could be attributed to the NADH’s remaining functional group failing to achieve stable binding, thereby providing adenine with ample space for optimization in its binding. This also suggests that NADH’s interaction with ecCTPS may depend on the adenine head.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Synergistic inhibition of ecCTPS by CTP with NADH or Adenine</title><p id="P28">To validate the binding effect of NADH and its regulatory role on ecCTPS, we examined the inhibitory effects of both NADH and adenine in combination with CTP on CTPS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). As control, CTP alone significantly inhibited CTPS activity. The additional presence of NADH further suppressed the reaction, and the combination of adenine and CTP exhibited a similar degree of inhibition. Enzyme activity assays confirmed the synergistic inhibition of CTPS activity by NADH and CTP and indicated that adenine also possesses this capability.</p><p id="P29">Our structure provides a structural foundation for the synergistic inhibition of ecCTPS by NADH and CTP. Furthermore, through enzyme activity assays, we propose that NADH’s inhibition of CTPS is likely dependent on the affinity between the adenine head and the ATP pocket of ecCTPS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">In this study, we have determined the structure of complex formed by ecCTPS with CTP, DON, and NADH, shedding light on the interaction pattern between CTPS and the novel ligand NADH. Moreover, our findings refine our comprehension of the regulation exerted by classical ligands like CTP and DON on CTPS. The near-atomic resolution structures provide robust support and validation for our conclusions.</p><p id="P31">Despite these advances, there are some limitations in our research stemming from experimental constraints. We based our criteria for evolutionary analysis solely on the presence or absence of alpha helix 12. However, it is important to note that there are other differences that could potentially influence filament formation, such as the non-conserved alpha helix 18 at the C-terminal, which appears to have a possible connection to evolutionary relationships. Furthermore, the engineered ecCTPS, successfully assembled into filaments with substrates, displayed certain morphological similarities to eukaryotes. Further investigation is required to determine whether the assembly mode and the regulation pattern for ecCTPS are identical.</p><p id="P32">Nevertheless, our phylogenetic analysis and bioengineering offer valuable insights. Specifically, it raises intriguing questions about how the two typesof filaments, under the product state and substrate state, respectively, evolved. Our findings may imply an asynchronous evolution, prompting us to delve deeper into the significance of these distinct filamentation events in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Info</label><media xlink:href="EMS189958-supplement-Supplemental_Info.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d74aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S11"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>EM data were collected at the ShanghaiTech Cryo-EM Imaging Facility.
