They undergo gastrulation-like processes leading to the self-organization into highly reproducible biological objects. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this remarkable property. We report that self-organization competence is associated with a cell-specific coordination of a Cadherin switch. We find that N-Cadherin hinders gastruloids morphogenetic competence, for its inactivation leads to the formation of trunk-like structures in absence of extra-cellular matrix analogues. In contrast, <italic>E-Cadherin</italic> repression by <italic>Snai1</italic> is critical for self-organization: <italic>Snai1</italic> establishes a cell-specific repressive pace by triggering the repression of a pluripotency-associated transcription program and its chromatin landscape, thus allowing a proper transition from E- to N-Cadherin to occur. Altogether, this work establishes a molecular mechanism that integrates the exit from pluripotency and the pace of cell differentiation, leading to the observed self-organizing potential of gastruloids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Self-organization</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>Pluripotency</kwd><kwd>Gastruloids</kwd><kwd>Snai1</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Somitogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Early vertebrate embryos can display a wide range of morphologies and organisations, depending on environmental conditions. Species-specific adaptations develop on top of a conserved vertebrate archetype. Indeed, at late gastrulation, the various embryonic body plans show remarkable consistencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This rather generic developmental stage is pivotal for the embryo and relies on a combination of coordinated cell movements, morphogenesis and cell fate specification to organize the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) along the emerging embryonic axes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This process relies on signalling and mechanical cues arising from the extra-embryonic tissues, which instruct where gastrulation initiates. At the primitive streak, a region defining the posterior epiblast will undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), in response to BMP, WNT and Nodal signalling emanating from extra-embryonic ectoderm, thus leading to cell ingression and the formation of the future mesodermal layer. In contrast, the anterior epiblast will respond to antagonist BMP, Nodal and WNT signalling from the anterior visceral endoderm preventing streak formation, which will maintain an epiblast identity and form the embryonic ectoderm. These interactions between the extra-embryonic and embryonic compartments are thought to be essential for proper patterning of the embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The recent development of various <italic>in vitro</italic> stem cell-derived models of embryos can provide insight into these complex mechanisms. To some extent, these paradigms can recapitulate the development either of blastocysts and advanced pre-implantation embryos by combining trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) with embryonic stem cells (ESCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, or of post-implantation embryos by also including extra-embryonic endoderm cells (XEN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Amongst other properties, these models represent a useful minimal system to investigate the communication between embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue. However, the aggregation of mouse ESCs alone can also be induced to generate distinct embryonic-like structures referred to as gastruloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. They can organize polarities and elongate an anterior-posterior axis in the absence of any extra-embryonic tissue and in a highly reproducible manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, which in many respects mimics tail bud elongation, thus revealing the previously under-appreciated ability of embryonic cells to form complex embryonic-like structures with minimal pre-existing positional cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. This ability which we refer to as self-organisation can be triggered by various phenomenon; for example a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> identified an early radial symmetry breaking determining a binary response to WNT. Indeed, since gastruloids are initiated as a sphere, cells from the outer portion could have different mechanical, signalling, nutrient, aerobic status than cell deeper in the sphere. Alternatively, this radial symmetry breaking may be a consequence of a pre-existing heterogeneity in cellular state which then self-organize into their outer-inner portions. Finally, self-organisation may also arise from a cell-sorting mechanism of a disordered initial structure. For example, differential cell adhesion properties between endodermal cells and the remaining of gastruloid lineages was recently proposed to participate in the spatial organisation of endoderm in gastruloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Altogether, an integrated view of the molecular, cellular and tissue scale of self-organisation is nevertheless still lacking.</p><p id="P4">While complex spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression are observed in gastruloids, they lack the associated morphologies such as for example segmented somites surrounding a neural tube. However, by providing extra-cellular matrix (ECM) components (Matrigel), they can form these missing structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, illustrating the value of this model to investigate the minimal requirement for some embryonic processes to occur. Furthermore, gastruloids can also be generated either from human pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or from dissociated zebrafish embryo explants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> with a similar absence of defined morphologies and the same ability to self-organize and elongate an axis, suggesting that the latter property relies upon a vertebrate ancestral program. While the symmetry-breaking and self-organizing processes are being intensely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the nature of the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to dissect the chain of events allowing gastruloid self-organization to integrate the molecular, cellular and tissue level scale. We identified an integrated process taking gastruloids through this robust phase of self-organization, as well as its association with cell fate transitions. This is achieved by Snai1, which induces the cell-specific repression of a pluripotency program including E-Cadherin, setting the pace of the differentiation and triggering appropriate lineage segregation. In contrast, the inactivation of N-Cadherin is sufficient to increase the self-organizing potential and generate highly reproducible structures with evidence of somite patterning surrounding a neural tube, overcoming the requirement for ECM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Gastruloid self-organization is resilient to intrinsic and extrinsic variations</title><p id="P5">Gastruloids develop axially organised structures composed of cells derived from all three germ layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Following a pulse of exogeneous WNT activation (Chiron, CHIR99021), they break symmetry and elongate an antero-posterior axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> without the influence of extra-embryonic tissue or from the implantation into the uterine wall. This self-organization capacity may involve distinct cell signalling, mechanical constraints between inner and outer cells, or a differential accessibility to Chiron, as well as heterogeneity in the starting cellular state. To limit this latter point, gastruloids were generated from ESCs grown in a medium containing GSK3i and MAPKi (referred to as 2i) where ESCs cultures is more homogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">First, we sought to disrupt cell positional information during gastruloid development, to evaluate whether it is required for gastruloid self-organisation. We performed single-cell dissociation of gastruloids at different developmental stages and re-aggregated them. When dissociated either at 48h, or at 72h and re-aggregated, gastruloids developed as control specimens, yet with a smaller size caused by some cells being lost along the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary movie 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary note 1</xref>). This suggests that at these early stages, there are no critical positional information and that outer and inner cells can be reshuffled without impacting the final structure. In contrast, when the already asymmetric 96h gastruloids were dissociated and re-aggregated, proper elongation and patterning were not observed, suggesting that the self-organization capacity is lost between 72h and 96h.</p><p id="P7">We then assessed the link between self-organisation competence and cell identity. We documented the emergence and extent of cell diversification by conducting single cell RNA sequencing analysis of 52’000 gastruloids cells spanning from 48h to 168h, with a 24h resolution, also including the starting ESCs population as the 0h time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). At 48h, all cells exhibited an epiblast identity and no transcriptional diversity was detected. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C, D</xref>). This suggests that the ability to self-organize does not rely on a pre-existing heterogeneity of cellular states. Then, at 72h, a global response to WNT signalling was visible with primitive streak (PS)-like cells expressing <italic>Brachyury</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D, E</xref>). In addition, cellular diversification was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, B</xref>) and an anterior primitive streak (APS) program was expressed in 15% of gastruloid cells. At that stage, gastruloids were still fully able to self-organise even following dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) which means that cell fate diversification precedes the loss of self-organization competence. These APS expressing cells showed a salt and pepper distribution, with a variable number of positive cells from one gastruloid to the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). When comparing gene expression between single gastruloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, APS-program genes correlated well with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>), as was also observed in the single cell transcriptome dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>). This supported a stochastic activation of this transcriptional program as a whole, rather than gene-specific stochastic transcriptional noise. Since the known regulators of this gene network, <italic>Mixl1</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, were the most extensively expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref>), they likely trigger the activation of this program.</p><p id="P8">Advanced gastruloids (from 96h), contain derivatives from all three germ layers, with mesodermal, neuronal, endodermal, endothelium and PGC/Pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D, E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Despite the variable nature of the earliest cell diversification event at 72h, the spatial organisation of elongated gastruloids at 120h was highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>). NMPs marker genes (<italic>Cyp26a1</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>, <italic>Hoxb9</italic>) were expressed at the posterior aspect of gastruloids, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Also, anterior progression to more differentiated status was observed for both neuronal and somitic lineages. Of note, few tested posterior markers showed inconsistent patterns such as the pre-somitic mesoderm marker <italic>Tbx6</italic>, the EMT regulator <italic>Snai1</italic> or the floor plate marker <italic>Shh</italic>. In these latter cases, however, expression was never scored in anterior gastruloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H</xref>).</p><p id="P9">From this analysis, we concluded that gastruloids ability to self-organize is constrained in time and that the critical positional information required for the late gastruloid pattern is only established at ca. 96h. The gastruloids ability to form robust patterns of gene expression, despite an intrinsic early variability is thus consistent with a cell-sorting mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell specific coordination of a Cadherin switch</title><p id="P10">Amongst important mediators of cellular sorting and segregation are Cadherins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Also, during gastrulation, part of the epiblast undergoes an EMT, which is characterised by a switch from E to N-Cadherin expression. Since gastruloids cells at 48h globally resemble epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>), we assessed whether a comparable E-to-N Cadherin switch was observed during gastruloid development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). At both 48h and 72h, gastruloid cells expressed E-Cadherin (<italic>Cdh1</italic>), whereas N-Cadherin (<italic>Cdh2</italic>) was expressed in most cells from 96h to 168h, except in the PGC/pluripotent population. Of note, the initiation of <italic>Cdh2</italic> expression occurred at 72h within the APS population, in cells still expressing <italic>Cdh1</italic>. We characterised the transcriptional dynamic of this transition using RNA velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and the activation of <italic>Cdh2</italic> occurred in a large proportion of 72h gastruloids cells. In contrast, a smaller percentage of APS cells had started to switch off <italic>Cdh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These same cells also showed the activation of <italic>Snai1</italic>, a EMT regulator known to repress E-Cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). This suggests that N-Cadherin activation precedes E-Cadherin repression during gastruloid development.</p><p id="P11">To precisely establish the temporal sequence of the E- to N-Cadherin switch, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome time-series between 48h to 96h, with a 6h resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). At 72h, gastruloid cells first switch on <italic>Cdh2</italic> expression, with a maximum already reached at 84h. Instead, <italic>Cdh1</italic> repression was only detected at 84h and expression decreased until 96h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We next assessed the spatio-temporal dynamics of E- and N-Cadherin proteins using immuno-fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) and quantified their membrane level of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). At 78h, virtually all cells contained E-Cadherin, while N-Cadherin was not detected, suggesting a delay between the transcripts and protein dynamics. By contrast, widespread expression of N-Cadherin was scored at 120h while E-Cadherin was detected scarcely, in some posterior cells. At 90h, most cells contained N-Cadherin at various levels, whereas E-Cadherin repression was visible only in a small region. At 96h and 102h, a restricted cellular domain only retained high expression of E-Cadherin. These results suggest that a stepwise process underlies this transition, with an initial widespread activation of N-Cadherin, followed by a progressive and region-specific repression of E-Cadherin, the latter repression being the rate limiting factor of this transition.</p><p id="P12">We evaluated whether this ordered EMT was associated with the acquisition of specific cellular identity by using either SOX2 or TBX6 to identify NMP or mesodermal cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B, C</xref>). While TBX6 was not detected at 78h, SOX2 was transcribed at various levels, with a salt-and-pepper distribution. At 90h, TBX6 and SOX2 expression domains were poorly organised; TBX6-positive cells were often, though not always at the periphery, and most of them displayed high N-Cadherin levels. Instead, SOX2 was frequently excluded from the periphery and showed inconsistent expression at the centre. At 96h and 102h, however, this somewhat unclear situation was resolved and the expression domain were well established with mesodermal cells showing low levels of E-Cadherin expression and high N-Cadherin content. Cells with high E-Cadherin levels also expressed SOX2. Finally, at 114h and 120h, the E-Cadherin level was low throughout, including the mesodermal and neuronal/NMP cells. These results support self-organization as largely arising from a cell-sorting mechanism provided by the stepwise, cell type specific timing of a E- to N-Cadherin switch occurring in both mesodermal and neuronal lineages, yet at a distinct time. our analysis suggests that a difference in the timing of E-Cadherin repression between the NMP population and the mesodermal cells may be involved in the antero-posterior axis formation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Timing of cell fate transition</title><p id="P13">To accurately document the timing of cell fate transitions at the transcriptional level, we combined the single cell RNA-seq datasets with our comprehensive transcriptome time-series. We assessed the dynamic expression of the top ten markers extracted from each cellular cluster, between 48h and 96h, with a 6h resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). Gastruloid cells generally clustered according to their developmental timing, with a major cluster including the 48h up to 84h early time-points, and another cluster comprising late samples (from 72h to 96h). For some time-points, cells were present in both clusters, indicating that the temporal resolution adequately documents the major transitions. This also indicated that, after Chiron treatment, gastruloids are not always perfectly synchronised, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">This analysis revealed that neuronal and somitic identities are initiated at the transcriptional level between 78h and 84h. In contrast, repression of the pluripotency program (ESCs, epiblast and pluripotent clusters) started at 72h and was completed by 84h. Finally, transitional states (primitive streak, anterior primitive streak) are initiated as early as 60h and peak at 72h. Therefore, the initiation of the primitive streak identity occurred before the repression of the pluripotency program, reminiscent of the global N-Cadherin expression prior to E-Cadherin repression. These results suggest that the initiation of a new transcription program precedes the termination of the program implemented before.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Effects of N-Cadherin inactivation</title><p id="P15">Since these results identified a link between a coordinated cadherin switch and cell specification during gastruloids development, we set out to assess the role of this cadherin transition. First, we inactivated N-Cadherin by deleting the <italic>Cdh2</italic> promoter sequences as well as the first exon and produced mutant gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The elongation of <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids was unexpectedly enhanced, along a single axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), with high reproducibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Posterior markers like <italic>Hoxb9</italic>, T/BRA or TBX6 were properly polarised in these mutant specimens supporting a largely normal organization of the posterior domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). Unlike in control gastruloids, alternating high <italic>versus</italic> low intensity segmental expression of <italic>Meox1</italic> was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). In addition, FOXC1 was detected in numerous segments surrounding a FOXC1 negative tubular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), reminiscent of patterned embryonic somites surrounding a neural tube, a situation never observed in native gastruloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we compared the transcriptome of 120h <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids to those of their <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>-/+</sup> and <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> controls and, in marked contrast with the strong mutant phenotype, few if any differences in transcripts were scored <italic>Cdh2</italic> expression being the only significant change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>). Patterned somites surrounding a neural tube were only observed when gastruloids were embedded into Matrigel at 96h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, whereas non-embedded counterparts never displayed any somite-like structure. Therefore, we propose that trunk-like morphogenesis observed in ECM-driven gastruloids arises from the observed segregation of N-Cadherin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The absence of alterations in the mutant <italic>Cdh2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> transcriptome illustrates well the decoupling that may exist between morphogenetic events, on the one hand, and the genetic control of those cells, on the other hand. In this view, we can exclude a role for <italic>Cdh2</italic> in establishing the antero-posterior axis through a cell sorting mechanism. Instead, <italic>Cdh2</italic> inactivation uncovered a self-organizing potential leading to a higher resemblance with embryonic structure.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Snai1 and the robustness of self-organization</title><p id="P17">During gastrulation, <italic>Snai1</italic> is essential to allow proper mesodermal cell migration by inducing an EMT in the primitive streak and repressing E-Cadherin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

Some <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids remain round or ovoid (42%), others were composed of multiple buds emanating from a central portion (38%) and 20% formed structures with a single elongating axis.

In contrast, the timing of E-Cadherin repression was severely affected: while control gastruloids showed a regionalised loss of E-Cadherin as early as 90h and consistently at 96h, <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> specimen expressed high levels of E-Cadherin at both 96h and 102h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Instead, NMPs and neuronal cells undergo a slower E-Cadherin loss until around 120h. In the absence of <italic>Snai1</italic>, neuronal and mesodermal cells behave more synchronously, undergoing slow and progressive decrease in E-Cadherin expression. In addition, SOX2 expression, which is normally restricted to a posterior NMP portion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>), was also impacted by <italic>Snai1</italic> and was maintained throughout a large portion of the gastruloid until 102h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). At both 114h and 120h, when <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids formed protrusions, SOX2 became restricted to the central body, suggesting that such cells may either correspond to uncommitted NMPs or, alternatively, that they may have kept features of pluripotency.</p><p id="P20">To identify the early-responding targets of <italic>Snail1</italic>, we analysed <italic>Snail1</italic> mutant transcriptomes at 96h, i.e., when the abnormal phenotype starts to be observed.

Instead, the expression of genes normally down-regulated and associated with pluripotency (<italic>Utf1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>) was maintained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8G</xref>). At 120h, <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids contained properly specified cells, yet in altered proportions and stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8D</xref>).

Therefore, in addition to failing to form organised structures, gastruloids derived from <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells lack the proper temporal control of cell fate progression.

At 96h, i.e., when the pluripotency-associated transcriptional program was incorrectly maintained in mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8G</xref>), we selected sites with decreased accessibility between 72h and 96h control gastruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Out of 10’148 such sites identified, 7’887 (ca. 80%) were already opened at 48h, suggesting they were part of an early pluripotency-associated program. In <italic>Snai1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gastruloids, this transition from open to closed sites at 96h was severely impaired, an abnormal situation not even fully resolved at 120h. This was best exemplified by the E-Cadherin (<italic>Cdh1</italic>) and the pluripotency factors <italic>Oct4</italic> (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>) loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>). In contrast, chromatin sites becoming open at 96h in control gastruloids remained unimpacted by the absence of <italic>Snai1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9B</xref>) despite a failure to activate the corresponding transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We interpret this as a decoupling between the opening of a chromatin landscape, on the one hand, and its following transcriptional activation, on the other hand. It is possible that the repression of a previously deployed program is required to progress to more advanced differentiation states. This would be consistent with the observed delay in the transcriptional onset of both the neuronal and somitic programs in <italic>Snai1</italic> mutant gastruloids, which occurred only in cells where pluripotency was repressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8F-I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P22">In this work, we used a multi-scale approach to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the outstanding capacity of gastruloids to self-organizing during the first five days of their development. We identified a mechanism leading to the specific sorting out of various cellular population based on the coordination, at the cellular level, of an E- to N-Cadherin switch. We report that N-Cadherin is largely dispensable for self-organization and that its inactivation leads to an improvement to an embryonic-like morphology resembling trunk-like structures. We interpret this as the capacity of N-Cadherin to prevent a further step in self-organization to occur in control gastruloids (i.e., a somitic-like segmentation), an effect that can be overcome by some compounds delivered by the Matrigel. The Cadherin switch is associated with an exit from pluripotency, as evaluated by transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility. This is orchestrated by the transcriptional repressor <italic>Snai1</italic>, which sets the tempo of both this repression and the cell fate transitions, leading to the observed decrease in chromatin accessibility around genes associated with a pluripotency program. We suggest that this chain of events is an integral part of the self-organizing mechanism, which is likely well conserved between genuine embryos and stem cell based <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Similar to normal embryos, this process seems to be very robust and hence it may explain the high reproducibility observed during the production of gastruloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>mESCs and gastruloids culture</title><p id="P23">mESCs (129/svev, EmbryoMax© CMTI-1) were cultivated in an humidified incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C), between Passage 15 and 35 in 6-well plates (Corning, 354652) using a 2i<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, LIF DMEM medium composed of DMEM + GlutaMAX (Gibco, 10566-024) supplemented with 10% ES certified FBS (Gibco, 16141079), non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 16141-079), sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360-039), beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 31350-010), penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122), 100 ng ml−1 of mouse LIF (custom made by the EPFL Protein Production and Structure Core Facility), 3 μM of GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021, FBM-10- 1279-5MG) and 1 μM of MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD0325901, Selleckchem, S1036)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.

For standard 10x samples, we aimed for a recovery of ca. 6000 cells per sample while for multiplexed single cell RNA-seq we aimed for a recovery of maximum 24 000 cells as more doublet can be resolved with this method. cDNA preparations were performed according to 10x Genomics recommendations, amplified for 10–12 cycles and verified on fragment analyser. Both cell multiplexing oligo, and gene expression libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (ref 15065681 v03) or a Novaseq (Illumina protocol #1000000106351 v03) with the cbot2 chemistry.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis</title><p id="P36">Gene expression libraries were analysed similarly for standard 10x and CellPlex samples to generate the cell-gene expression matrices.

Cell multiplexing oligo (CMO) libraries which identify the sample of origin in multiplexed experiments were quantified using CITE-seq-Count v1.4.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> --cell_barcode_first_base 1 -- cell_barcode_last_base 16 --umi_first_base 17 -- umi_last_base 28 --bc_collapsing_dist 1 --umi_collapsing_dist 2 --expected_cells 24000 --whitelist ‘3M-february-2018.txt’ --max-error 2. Individual 10x gene expression libraries, were analysed using Seurat v4.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. We first filtered out barcodes with less than 200 identified gene and genes identified in less than three cells. For CMO libraries, the demultiplexing by barcode was done in R using counts from CITE-seq-Counts. Cell barcodes with less than 5 CMO UMI and absent in the Seurat object were discarded. Then sample attribution was performed using demuxmix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> using the total number of UMI per cell. Cells which were not classified by demuxmix as singlet (negative, unsure, doublet) were excluded from the analysis. Low quality cells and potential doublets were removed by computing the mean UMI content and the percentage of mitochondrial genes and filtering out barcodes with less than 0.4 times the mean UMI or more than 2.5 times the mean UMI. Only barcodes between 0.05 and 8 percent of mitochondrial UMI were kept. Matrices were normalised and the cell cycle score (using the 2019 updated gene list from Seurat) from these filtered libraries were computed. Then we merged the different samples using the merge command by Seurat. The combined Seurat object was then normalised, 2000 variable features were identified and the data was scaled and regressed by cell cycle score, and percentage of mitochondrial reads. Principal component were then computed using variable genes falling within the 5<sup>th</sup> and 80<sup>th</sup> percentile of expression to limit batch effect as performed here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. UMAP and k-nearest neighbours were then computed using 30 principal components. The resolution to cluster the data was chosen by ensuring that no cluster was missed, and that no duplicated clusters were found. Cluster annotation was performed manually. Marker identification was done using a maximum of 400 cells per identity to limit the impact of widely variable cluster sizes in the ability to identify markers, these also required a difference of 20% in the proportion of expressing cells and a logFC &gt;0.5. For RNA velocity analysis, Velocyto v0.17.17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> was used with the run10x command on the BAM files generated by STARsolo. Then, velocyto.R v0.6 was used to identify the velocity using the RunVelocity function with the settings: spliced.average = 0.2, unspliced.average = 0.02, deltaT = 1, kCells = 20, fit.quantile = 0.02. RNA velocity was then displayed on the UMAP embedding with the show.velocity.on.embedding.cor function with the setting: n = 300, scale=‘sqrt’, cell.colors = ac(subset.seurat$FateColor, alpha=0.5), cex=0.8, arrow.scale = 5, show.grid.flow=TRUE, min.grid.cell.mass = 0.5, grid.n=40, arrow.lwd = 1, do.par = F, cell.border.alpha = 0. In order to study the correlation between <italic>Mesp1</italic> and <italic>Lhx1</italic> genes with other markers, cells were classified in four different categories.

Gastruloids were collected, pooled in a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube and washed twice in 1 ml of PBS. They were then dissociated in 100 μl of Accutase (Stempro) for 5 min at 37°C. Full dissociation was completed by mechanical dissociation and verified to ensure proper dissociation. Dissociated cells were then washed in 500 μl of PBS (centrifugation 5 min at 4°C, at a speed of 400g) and resuspended in 200 μl of resuspension buffer RSB (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2). 50 000 cells were extracted, pelleted (centrifugation 5 min at 4°C, at a speed of 400g) and incubated 3 minutes on ice in cold lysis buffer (RSB, 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% Digitonin). Nuclei were then washed in 1 ml of lysis washout buffer (RSB, 0.1% Tween-20) and pelleted at 500g for 10 minutes at 4°C.

Each reaction was purified using the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit. The reaction was then amplified by PCR using the NEBNext Master Mix and Nextera primers.

Mapping was performed on filtered reads on the mouse genome mm10 with Bowtie2 v2.5.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> (--very-sensitive 2). Resulting Bam files were sorted using samtools. Unconcordant reads or reads mapping to the mitochondrial chromosome were discarded with bamFilter v2.5.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Duplicates were removed with Picard MarkDuplicates v2.18.2. BAM was converted to BED with BEDTools v2.30.0 in order to use both mates to call peaks. Peaks were called using macs2_callpeak v2.2.7.1. with the options (--gsize ‘1870000000’ --call-summits -- keep-dup ‘all’ --nomodel --extsize ‘200’ --shift ‘-100’ -- bdg). Coverages were converted to bigwig and normalised to the number of million reads mapped less than 500bp from a peak summit.

In order to build a comprehensive and confident list of peaks from the wild-type time-course, at each time-point the following strategy was adopted. The BED with the largest number of reads was down sampled to match the number of reads of the other replicate. Peaks were called using a merged of equally sized BED. Only peaks whose summit was overlapping a peak in each of both replicates were kept. The four lists of confident peaks (one per time-point) were concatenated and merged with BEDTools v2.30.0. The number of reads falling into this comprehensive confident list were quantified with deeptools multiBamSummary v3.5.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. DESeq2 was used to compare the wild-type duplicates of 72h with the wild-type duplicates of 96h to determine the loci with a significant change in accessibility (abs(log2FC) &gt; 1 an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). These loci were sorted by average normalised coverage in 72h for the loci with decreased accessibility at 96h and in 96h for loci with increased accessibility at 96h. The status at 48h and 120h was determined as overlapping a confident peak at this time-point. The heatmap was computed with computeMatrix and plotHeatmap from deepTools v3.5.1 on a 5 kb region surrounding the peaks centre.
