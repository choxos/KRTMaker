This reciprocal relationship is also essential for tissue organogenesis during early life. The skin harbors a relatively large population of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) that accumulate within the first two weeks after birth. A functional role for early skin seeding Tregs (ETregs) during the first week of life is currently unexplored. Here, we show that skin Tregs are detected early as postnatal day 3 (P3) where they localize to hair follicle (HF) structures and enter a dynamic flux of activation marker expression. Punctual ETreg depletion from P6-P8, but not later, results in defective HF melanocyte SC (MeSC) mediated skin pigmentation in juvenile life. Transcriptomic analysis of the whole skin on P9 exhibited immediate and pronounced changes in MeSC markers and perturbation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) target genes in the HF. Accordingly, punctual ETreg depletion combined with short-term PPARγ agonization restored skin pigmentation. Single cell profiling of P9 skin revealed that PPARγ signalling activity is preferentially diminished in the HF epithelium upon loss of ETregs. Finally, we explored changes in the single cell transcriptome of the human tissue disorder, vitiligo, characterized by a lack of melanin and consequent skin depigmentation. These analyses showed that the HF cells from lesional vitiligo skin exhibited a significant downregulation in PPARγ pathway activation, relative to heathy controls. Overall, ETregs in neonatal skin are critical for sustaining HF PPARγ signaling, which is vital for facilitating MeSC mediated skin pigmentation during postnatal development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tissue organogenesis during neonatal life is facilitated by temporarily and spatially coordinated crosstalk between immune cells and stem cells (SCs) in the tissue microenvironment. Barrier sites such as the skin harbor relatively large proportions of the CD4 lineage of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that reside proximal to distinct adnexal structures, such as hair follicle (HFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The HFs represent an important immune cell niche in skin, but also accommodate distinct populations of SCs. These include HFSCs and melanocyte SCs (MeSCs), governing hair shaft production and skin pigmentation, respectively.</p><p id="P3">An intimate association between skin Tregs and the HF epithelia has been well established in recent years. During development, Treg seed the skin during the first week of life in conjunction with HF morphogenesis, peaking on postnatal day 13 (P13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Tregs resident in P8-15 skin are essential for establishing both tolerance to commensal bacterial antigens and suppression of type 2 helper T cell mediated fibrous pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In adult skin, Tregs expressing the Notch ligand Jagged-1, are required for hair regeneration via promotion of HFSC differentiation. This SC regulatory function of Tregs is orchestrated largely independently of canonical immunosuppressive pathways. Conversely, during subacute skin injury, Treg control of inflammatory Th17 responses facilitates HFSC mediated barrier regeneration. While these studies have ascribed distinct and specialised roles for adult Tregs and neonatal Tregs during the second week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), a functional role for the foremost afferent population of skin seeding Tregs during the first week of life has not been explored. Specifically, the existence of a neonatal Treg-SC axis during this specific window of time and its relevance to the homeostatic development and function of the skin remains unknown.</p><p id="P4">Here, we demonstrate that neonatal Tregs in P6-P8 skin are highly activated and preferentially reside in close association with MeSCs. Transient loss of Tregs during this time window, but not later, results in defective melanocyte function <italic>in vivo</italic>, as evidenced by disrupted skin pigmentation in later life. Notably, the transcriptomic changes in melanocytes precede the inflammatory responses induced by Treg depletion, suggesting Tregs may regulate MeSCs independently of secondary mediators such as CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>-</sup> effector T cells (Teffs) or CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, we observed an immediate dysregulation of transcripts associated with the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway. Additionally, we identify changes in PPARγ signalling activity throughout developmental stages of human skin and in the pigment-deficient disease state of vitiligo. We define neonatal Treg regulation of the PPARγ pathway as a mechanistic link between early skin development and functional MeSC melanogenic activity for establishing pigmentation of skin. Taken together, our findings reveal that neonatal Tregs during the first week of life are essential for the establishment of SC function during postnatal development of the skin.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Skin Tregs are highly activated on Postnatal day 6</title><p id="P5">The accumulation of Tregs in skin peaks on postnatal day 13 (P13) of life, likely derived from lymphocytic seeding from lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). At this time-point Tregs display a highly proliferative and activated profile. We sought to perform immune profiling at earlier timepoints, prior to P13, upon first entry of Tregs in skin. We first characterized Treg abundance and phenotypic marker expression in steady-state C57BL/6 neonatal skin and skin-draining lymph node (SDLNs) on P6, P9, P12, and later P28 (juvenile) and P49 (adult) timepoints.</p><p id="P6">Flow cytometric profiling revealed the presence of Tregs at detectable but low numbers on P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>; full gating strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>). The abundance and proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs steadily increased and peaked during the second week after birth, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This wave of Treg accumulation in P12 skin was unique to Tregs as our global analysis of other major skin-resident T cell subsets during this time frame did not display a similar pattern, namely Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T effector cells (Teffs) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2A-F</xref>). Of note, Treg percentages on P8 and P12 were comparable to that found in adult skin on P49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), corroborating a recent study reporting similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). By contrast, the percentage of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in SDLNs was less variable and remained steady throughout the analysis period. The proliferative index of Teffs, CD8+ T cells, and Tregs was the highest in P6 skin but similar amongst all T cell subsets in the three time-points assessed, as evidenced by equivalent levels of Ki67 expression. However, in P9 SDLNs, Tregs were more proliferative relative to other T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2C, 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Given the rapid influx of Tregs in skin during the early neonatal period of P6-P12, we assessed the expression of the activation-associated markers CD25, CD27, CTLA4, and ICOS. Between P6 to P9, the median flourescence intensity (MFI) values of all markers, except CD27, were significantly higher in P9 skin Tregs relative to their SDLN counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the MFI of all markers were upregulated by at least 2-fold between P6 and P9 skin Tregs, but not in SDLN Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The proportions of Treg activation marker expression largely resembled the fluctuations observed in MFI values for both skin and SDLN compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, later skin seeding Tregs (LTregs) in P12 skin expressed lower levels of CD25, CD27, and CTLA4 relative to P9. Taken together, these data suggest P3-P12 is an important interval where Tregs accumulate in skin and identifies P6-P9 as a specific time window where early skin seeding Tregs (ETregs) become highly, but transiently, activated in the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neonatal Tregs suppress inflammation and skin pigmentation in later life</title><p id="P8">Given that Treg activation and proliferation is highly dynamic in P6-P12 skin, we hypothesized that Tregs in this time window may play an important role in regulating either inflammatory responses or postnatal skin development, or both. To test this, we utilized <italic>Foxp3-DTR</italic> transgenic mice where the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is expressed ahead of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Following administration of DT, these mice permit highly robust Treg depletion in both SDLNs and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). To ablate Tregs from P6-P12, we administered DT on P6, P8, P10 and P12 (hereafter referred to as the “ΔTreg” group). We chose P28 as the timepoint for analysis as the major hallmarks of stem cell (SC) mediated skin development are manifested at this age, namely hair follicle SC (HFSC) activity and melanocyte SC (MeSC) mediated skin pigmentation.</p><p id="P9">While Treg sufficient controls on P28 developed normal appearing dorsal skin with black pigmentation, this was markedly impacted in ΔTreg animals, where the skin failed to pigment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3A-B</xref>). This phenotype was confirmed histologically using Fontana &amp; Masson (F&amp;M) staining that detected melanin granules produced by MeSCs in Treg sufficient controls but not in ΔTreg skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3C</xref>). To ascertain whether stem cell regulation is impacted upon Treg depletion, we profiled CD34<sup>+</sup> Itga6<sup>+</sup> HFSCs and CD117<sup>+</sup> MeSCs by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3D-E</xref>). Both the proliferation and abundance of HFSCs were unaffected in ΔTreg skin relative to controls on P28. However, MeSC proliferation was markedly reduced in ΔTreg skin. These findings suggest the melanogenic function of MeSCs in the HFs is under Treg control during the P6-P12 time frame, whereas HFSCs are not impacted.</p><p id="P10">To determine if loss of neonatal Tregs results in systemic inflammation in later life we firstly monitored body weight gain. Depletion of Tregs during this six-day window resulted in weight reduction by P28. This was despite of a repopulating Treg presence that was significantly higher than Treg-sufficient controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3F</xref>). In addition, immune profiling of all major skin-resident T cell subsets revealed an increased abundance and activation status of Teffs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on P13 – only 1 day after the Treg depletion regimen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3G-H</xref>). This inflammatory phenotype persisted even at the later timepoint of P28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3I-K</xref>). In particular, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were highly proliferative and outnumbered Tregs, as evidenced by an increased CD8:Treg ratio in ΔTreg mice relative to controls. These data suggest there is an immediate inflammatory response following the six-day Treg depletion regime that may persist until later life. Indeed, the same Treg depletion regimen in adult mice does not cause overt skin inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), supporting the idea that neonatal and adult Tregs are functionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Overall, the loss of neonatal Tregs from P6-P12 leads to defective MeSC mediated melanogenesis and a consequent defect in skin pigmentation, that may be associated with a systemic inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Early skin seeding Tregs (ETregs) are required for skin pigmentation</title><p id="P11">In our initial experiments, we chose a 4-dose DT administration to deplete Tregs from P6-P12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). While this resulted in a defective skin pigmentation phenotype, it was also accompanied by reduced weight gain and an immediate inflammatory response that persisted until P28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3F-K</xref>). Thus, we set out to determine whether defective MeSC function was a result of prolonged systemic inflammation and to also define a precise ‘window’ of time for Treg requirement. Given ETregs acquire a highly activated profile between P6 to P9, and the less activated profile of LTregs in P12 skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), we sought to address how transient loss of Tregs at these two timepoints would impact both skin development and local inflammation. To do so, we implemented a 2-dose DT regimen by administering DT on P6 and P8 to deplete ETregs (hereafter referred to as the “ΔETreg” group), and on P10 and P12 to deplete LTregs (hereafter referred to as the “ΔLTreg” group). Efficient Treg depletion in the skin was confirmed one day after the last DT injection on P9 (for the ETreg group) and P13 (for LTreg group) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 4A-B</xref>). Notably, transient depletion of Tregs in the ETreg group recapitulated the attenuation of dorsal skin pigmentation on P28 observed in the 4-dose DT-treated ΔTreg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-E</xref>). In contrast, the skin of ΔLTreg animals was not affected relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-E</xref>). Histologic F&amp;M examination showed a significant reduction in melanin production in ΔETreg, but not in ΔLTreg animals, as quantified using a skin pigmentation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). Importantly, Treg ablation during the P6 to P8 window in ΔETreg animals had no significant effect on weight gain relative to Treg sufficient control groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate an early 2-dose depletion regimen targeting ETregs, but not LTregs, impairs skin pigmentation without compromising animal fitness in later life.</p><p id="P12">Next, we performed flow cytometry to test the hypothesis that defective skin pigmentation is linked to a disruption of SC maintenance and/or activation. Profiling of MeSCs and HFSCs showed that both the abundance and proportion of Ki67 expression remains comparable between control and ΔETreg groups on P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-G</xref>). Therefore, SC maintenance is unaffected in the absence of ETregs.</p><p id="P13">Given the important role of T cells in disorders of skin pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we assessed whether T cell numbers are impacted in ΔETreg skin on P28. Indeed, the skin T cell pool expands, but maintain homeostatic levels of proliferation, Teff:Treg ratios, and CD8:Treg cell ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-K</xref>). We also assessed for the hallmark indicator of global tissue inflammation by quantifying epidermal hyperproliferation of the skin. Histological quantification of epidermal thickness showed no difference between ΔETreg and control skin on P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Additionally, Teff numbers decreased in ΔETreg skin on P9, whilst the abundance and proliferation of other T cell subsets were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L-M</xref>). Nonetheless, we observed an increased IFNγ production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the skin on P9 following ETreg depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5A-E</xref>), and elevated levels of IFNγ and TNFα in SDLNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5F-I</xref>). To determine if CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a functional role in ETreg-mediated skin pigmentation, we co-depleted Tregs with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to determine if MeSC function could be rescued in the absence of Tregs. Under these conditions, skin pigmentation was not restored, suggesting that suppression of CD8-mediated inflammation is not a major mechanism by which ETregs promote MeSC function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, we are unable to detect any overt T cell-mediated inflammation in ΔETreg mice, either immediately on P9 or in later life on P28, that contributes to the defective skin pigmentation phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Melanocytes and PPARγ pathway are under the control of ETregs</title><p id="P14">We next set out to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ETreg-mediated control over MeSC function. We were intrigued by the requirement of Tregs during a very short 3-day window from P6-8, and the lack of fulminant inflammation in ΔETreg mice. Supporting our findings are previous studies showing that adult tissue-resident Tregs facilitate tissue homeostasis largely independently of suppressing conventional inflammatory responses; namely Jagged-1 expressing skin Tregs that promote hair regeneration and Areg-producing Tregs that support lung repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that ETregs regulate either i) the recruitment of specific immune cell subsets we have not assessed in our immune profiling, or ii) specific cellular pathways in non-immune cells, thereby enabling MeSCs to effectively synthesize melanin and maintain postnatal skin homeostasis.</p><p id="P15">To test this hypothesis, we took a discovery-based approach and reasoned that defining the immediate transcriptomic changes under ETreg control would be key to elucidating the pathways contributing to defective skin pigmentation. We therefore performed bulk RNA-sequencing of whole skin taken from Treg-sufficient controls, ΔETreg, ΔLTreg, and ΔTreg groups 24 hours after the last DT treatment – P9 for ΔETreg or P13 for ΔLTreg and ΔTreg groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We conducted pathway enrichment analysis using differentially expressed genes (p&lt;0.05) between P9 and P13 skin with ShinyGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Interestingly, terms such as melanin biosynthesis, melanin metabolic processes, and melanocyte differentiation showed greater than 15-fold enrichment in P9 controls relative to ΔETreg skin. Additionally, transcriptomic defects in interferon-β responses were evident in the ΔETreg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In comparison, ΔLTreg skin displayed changes primarily associated with cell development and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations suggest that melanocytes are the major cell lineage impacted upon depletion of ETregs, but not LTregs. This notion is further substantiated by the downregulation of key melanocyte transcripts <italic>(Tyr, Tyrp1, Dct, Slc45a2, Oca2, Slc24a5)</italic> specifically in the ΔETreg and ΔTreg groups, but not in the ΔLTreg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> quantification of HF MeSCs using the specific lineage marker CD117 revealed no change in the overall abundance in P9 control or ΔETreg skin, suggesting the transcriptomic changes were not attributed to a quantitative reduction in MeSC numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E-F</xref>). Rather, it suggests MeSC function is impacted in ΔETreg animals likely due to downregulation of transcripts associated with melanin synthesis, including <italic>Tyr</italic> and <italic>Oca2.</italic> Overall, we found that melanocytes are key targets of ETregs and that the absence of ETregs lead to disruption of the melanocyte transcriptome. This conclusion is further supported by our histological quantification of MeSC-Treg distance, Teff-Treg and CD8-Treg distances. During early life, Tregs reside in close proximity to MeSCs in the HF region of skin, but not their canonical targets Teffs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 7A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To identify the signaling pathways responsible for pigmentation downstream of neonatal Tregs, we employed specific inclusion criteria based on the observation that pigmentation fails to develop in the ΔETreg and ΔTreg groups. We selected genes that met the following criteria: 1) Not differentially expressed between the ΔETreg and ΔTreg groups, 2) Differentially expressed between the ΔLTreg and ΔTreg groups, and 3) Differentially expressed between the control and ΔTreg groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). We identified 195 genes that fulfilled these criteria. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation of transcripts under the control of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Amongst the three PPAR isoforms – PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ – only PPARγ transitions from high expression to low expression from neonatal to adult skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). We therefore focused on validation of PPARγ target genes. To validate the immediate decrease in PPARγ target genes, we performed RNAscope analysis of neonatal P9 control and ΔETreg skin to quantify the <italic>in situ</italic> expression of the PPARγ target genes, <italic>Fabp7</italic> and <italic>Adipoq.</italic> The expression of both transcripts specifically in the HFs were significantly attenuated in ΔETreg skin relative to Treg sufficient controls. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I-L</xref>). Overall, our findings convincingly demonstrate that MeSC function in skin is under the tight control of ETregs during neonatal development. We identify a transient window for establishing a Treg-MeSC axis, during which loss of ETregs leads to significant disruption of the PPARγ signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PPARγ pathway is necessary and sufficient for pigmentation</title><p id="P17">We next sought to determine if the signalling pathways identified in our transcriptomic analysis are responsible for the pigmentation defect downstream of Tregs. In ΔETreg skin, the two main pathways impacted were associated with Type-I interferon response and PPAR signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>). These candidate pathways have previously been associated with adult melanocyte function <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), but whether they play a role during postnatal skin development <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been assessed. To determine if regulation of the interferon pathway is a major mechanism by which ETregs facilitate MeSC function, we neutralized interferon alpha-receptor (IFNAR) function in ETreg depleted mice using an anti-IFNAR monoclonal antibody. Neutralization of IFNAR was unable to reinstate skin pigmentation in ΔETreg mice, ruling out the interferon-β response as a functional candidate in this process. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The next set of experiments addressed if modulation of the PPAR pathway plays a functional role during steady state neonatal skin development. Amongst three isoforms of PPAR (α, β and γ), PPARγ is expressed at higher levels in neonatal skin relative to adult skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Therefore, we utilised small molecule modulators targeting the γ isoform. Administration of the highly specific antagonist T0070907 to C57BL/6J mice on P6 and P8 significantly impaired skin pigmentation on P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-E</xref>). Defective pigmentation was accompanied by a reduction in the number, but not proliferation, of MeSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-G</xref>). Importantly, these results indicate global PPARγ signalling during neonatal life is required for MeSC-mediated skin pigmentation.</p><p id="P19">Next, to validate whether PPARγ functions downstream of Tregs, we administered a highly specific PPARγ agonist, GW1929, to ΔETreg animals on P6 and P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). PPARγ agonization restored skin pigmentation in ETreg-depleted mice to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-L</xref>). However, MeSC numbers and proliferation were unaffected by PPARγ agonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M-N</xref>), suggesting that either qualitative changes in MeSC function, or the presence of an intermediate PPARγ responsive non-immune cell type, may play a role in promoting melanogenesis. Lastly, the observed PPARγ-dependent changes in pigmentation were not associated with significant alterations in skin-resident T cell abundance or proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 8A-H</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that Treg-PPARγ axis functions independently of T cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that a dominant function of ETregs during postnatal development is to regulate the PPARγ signalling axis to establish MeSC-mediated skin pigmentation in later life.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Epithelial-intrinsic PPARγ signalling activity relies on the presence of ETregs</title><p id="P20">To begin to understand the diverse cell states in the skin microenvironment, and to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying the ETreg-PPARγ axis, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45+ and CD45- cells in the presence and absence of Tregs. We reasoned that since Tregs reside proximal to both HFs and the interfollicular epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), early compensatory responses of epithelial resident cell types to ETreg depletion likely precede effects on skin pigmentation in later life. Furthermore, because the expansion of activated self-reactive T cells is observed 3-4 days after Treg ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) we sought to avoid these confounding variables by analyzing skin-resident cells 1 day after the last DT treatment, on P9. Also, given skin pigmentation requires the presence of P6-8 ETregs, but not P10-12 LTregs, P9 was a rational timepoint to analyze early transcriptional mechanisms that govern pigmentation downstream of ETregs.</p><p id="P21">Firstly, we quantified CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cell subsets to assess the accumulation of the major inflammatory lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages in skin. In support of our flow cytometric profiling on P9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure 5A-E</xref>), pronounced local immune cell activation and inflammation were not observed following ETreg depletion, even though NK cells were moderately increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). We also analyzed CD45<sup>-</sup> immune cells and identified melanocytes (Mel), epithelial cells (Epithelia), hair follicle cells (HF), and other structural cells such as fibroblasts (Fib) and vascular endothelial cells (Vasc). While the overall abundance of these cells was also minimally affected, the proportions of both Mel and Vasc cell populations appear to expand in ΔETreg skin. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Next, we performed a pseudo-bulk differential gene expression analysis to ascertain the magnitude of transcriptomic changes induced across all cell populations in ΔETreg and control mice. The most pronounced changes were identified in the HF and Epithelia clusters encompassing all epidermal keratinocytes of skin. When combined, these two cell types account for almost 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (P<sub>adj</sub>&lt;0.05) in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Among the hematopoietic CD45<sup>+</sup> fraction, the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) cluster was most impacted with 200 DEGs imparted by ETreg depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). T cell numbers changed minimally, despite being considered the main targets of Treg-mediated suppression. Collectively, these results indicate that the major cellular targets under the control of ETregs in neonatal skin are epithelial and HF cells.Whole skin bulk RNA-seq and functional <italic>in vivo</italic> skin pigmentation rescue experiments strongly implicate the PPARγ-pigmentation axis as a major mechanism under Treg control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I-K</xref>). Therefore, we next assessed changes in PPARγ activity across the captured cell types in the presence and absence of ETregs. We selected a set of experimentally validated PPARγ target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and constructed an activity score using the “AddModuleScore” function built into Seurat package. Increasing scores on this scale indicate increased expression of PPARγ target genes. Within the CD45<sup>+</sup> fraction, neutrophils and macrophages displayed the highest activity levels which is in line with the known role for PPARγ in these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, PPARγ scores in these cell types were largely unaffected by ETreg depletion. Instead, amongst the CD45<sup>-</sup> cells, the most pronounced downregulation of the PPARγ activity score was observed in HF keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). This result is in agreement with reduced expression of PPARγ target genes, such as <italic>Fabp7</italic> and <italic>Adipoq</italic> in the HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I-L</xref>). This is perhaps an unsurprising result given the HF cluster demonstrated the highest levels of transcriptomic perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), and the spatial proximity of HF cells to MeSCs in skin. Further analysis of the HF subset showed that 49 of 363 DEGS (~14%) between the control and ETreg depleted groups were known transcriptional targets of PPARγ (p= 2.25×10<sup>-9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>). Further visualisation of the top 56 DEGs in HF cells highlight five direct PPARγ targets, two of which are <italic>Cxcr6</italic> and <italic>F13a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>). These transcripts have previously been associated with asymmetric self-renewal capacity of stem cell populations and facilitation of skin wound healing responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). These results indicate that in the absence of ETregs in murine skin, tissue remodelling processes acting via PPARγ signaling is significantly altered in HF cells.</p><p id="P23">Collectively, scRNA-seq analysis indicates ETreg depletion markedly impacts the abundancies of several non-immune cell subsets in the skin microenvironment while minimally impacting the adaptive lymphoid compartment. Most notably, our results reveal that both the transcriptome and PPARγ activity of HF cells are preferentially modulated by ETregs. As such, neonatal ETregs in skin likely facilitate MeSC function by sustaining PPARγ signalling in HF keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The PPAR pathway is implicated in Vitiligo and during human skin development</title><p id="P24">Numerous disorders of skin pigmentation have been described in humans. The most prominent of which is the autoimmune skin disease, vitiligo, in which depigmented skin results from melanocyte destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Genome wide association studies have highlighted vitiligo susceptibility loci in genes that support Treg function, including IKZF4 and CTLA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), Additionally, Tregs are important for restraining skin depigmentation severity in lesional vitiligo skin, further suggesting a functional role for Tregs in disease pathogenesis. Given these associations, we sought to address whether PPARγ signalling is active in this setting. To test this, we analyzed scRNA-seq data of human skin samples from 5 healthy donors and 10 vitiligo patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The final processed datasets yielded 8 main cell types. Consistent with our murine skin single cell data, we identified two major clusters of keratinocytes in healthy and vitiligo skin; ‘HF’ characterized by high expression of hair follicle--associated markers <italic>KRT14</italic> and <italic>KRT15</italic>, and ‘Epithelia’ that expressed the interfollicular epidermal transcript <italic>KRT5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). We next applied the PPARγ scoring module to assess the level of activity across the captured cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). These analyses revealed that only the HF cell type from vitiligo skin exhibited a significant downregulation in PPARγ pathway activation, relative to heathy controls. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This result aligns closely to our murine single cell data where dysregulation of PPARγ signalling was identified in HF cells upon loss of ETregs in neonatal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We next set out to address if the PPARγ pathway is involved in human neonatal melanocyte development. <italic>In utero</italic>, Tregs seed the skin early as gestational week (GW) 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This timeframe aligns closely with murine skin development during the first week of life when ETregs begin to accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, this period of Treg infiltration coincides with human HF development, which involves the migration of melanoblasts to the HF to complete the melanocyte maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Given these associations, we analyzed scRNA-Seq data of melanocytes isolated from fetal (9.5-18 GW), neonatal (0 years), and adult (24-81 years) tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We identified 6 distinct clusters across the dataset. Chi-squared analysis revealed a marked enrichment of adult and neonatal melanocytes for cluster 0, while fetal melanocytes were enriched for cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). This observation suggests that melanocyte maturation involves the expansion of cluster 0. Indeed, cluster 0 expresses high levels of mature melanocyte markers such as <italic>DCT, PMEL, TYR.</italic> Cluster 2 expresses high level of proliferation-associated transcripts such as <italic>MKI67, TOP2A and CCNB1</italic>, therefore representing actively dividing melanocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 4</xref>). Further analysis identified elevated expression of multiple PPARγ target genes in cluster 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), including <italic>CAV1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), which regulates melanogenesis and <italic>SCARB1</italic>, which is involved in fatty acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Overall, an increased PPARγ activity is associated with melanocyte maturation. The transition frow low PPARγ activity to high PPARγ activity temporally coincides with Treg seeding. As such, our findings suggest the possibility that human Tregs may modulate PPARγ activity during human skin development.</p><p id="P26">Collectively, our analysis of human transcriptomic data suggests that the PPARγ pathway is active during melanocyte development and is preferentially disrupted in HF cells from the pigment-deficient disease state Vitiligo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Conventionally, Tregs are defined by their robust capacity to dampen tissue inflammatory responses. More recently, there is an increasing realization of the important non-conventional role of adult Tregs in supporting normal tissue maintenance and repair that is either independent of, or mutually codependent with, control of local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In neonates, Tregs are instrumental in establishing mechanisms of peripheral tolerance to both tissue-specific and commensal bacterial antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), as well as regulation of the skin stromal cell niche during the second week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Furthermore, adult Tregs support the bone marrow and skin stem cell (SC) niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), but whether a Treg-SC axis exists in neonatal tissue has not been established.</p><p id="P28">Here, we show that early skin seeding Tregs (ETregs) in the first week of life play a crucial role in establishing tissue homeostatic processes that manifest in later life. We observed fluctuations of the critical Treg effector molecules CD25 and CTLA4 between postnatal day 6 (P6), P9, and P12 skin, suggesting a temporal dynamic in Treg function during early neonatal stages. Indeed, transient depletion of P6-P8 ETregs, but not P10-P12 late skin seeding Tregs (LTregs), led to impaired melanocyte stem cell (MeSC) mediated skin pigmentation on P28. Under these conditions, whole skin transcriptomic analysis identified melanocyte dysfunction and modulation of the PPARγ pathway as under ETreg control. These changes occurred immediately, within 24 hours, following ETreg depletion before any signs of a fulminant skin inflammatory response. Restoration of neonatal PPARγ signalling re-instated skin pigmentation, suggesting that this pathway plays a major role downstream of ETregs. By contrast, LTreg depletion leads to transcriptomic changes in genes associated with tissue morphogenesis, suggesting that LTregs may regulate the structural integrity of the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In line with this observation, depletion of late-seeding Tregs on P8 and P15 leads to the absence of dermal white adipose tissue in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We observe similar loss of adipose tissues upon a 4-dose depletion of neonatal Tregs on P6, P8, P10 and P12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these observations strongly support temporal dynamic in Treg function. Our flow cytometric profiling of Treg activation markers, such as CD25 and CTLA4, suggest that an intrinsic functional difference between early and late neonatal Tregs are responsible for distinct phenotypes produced by temporal variation in depletion regimen. Another plausible explanation for the phenotypic differences is that the rapidly developing postnatal skin is only dependent on ETregs for melanogenic activity.</p><p id="P29">In addition to its immunomodulatory functions, the PPARγ pathway plays a key role in the accumulation and adaptation of Tregs within adipose tissue microenvironments, such as the dermal white adipose underlying the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). However, skin T cell numbers were unaffected by transient antagonization of the PPARγ pathway in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 8B</xref>). This suggests that the Treg-melanocyte axis may operate independently of skin-resident adaptive immune cells. Moreover, skin pigmentation was not restored in ΔETreg mice upon depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or blockade of the interferon-β response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 6A-B</xref>). Whether the promotion of melanocyte function is mediated by a subset of skin-resident ETregs or the bulk ETreg population, and whether Treg expression of a tissue specific factor(s) is a major mechanism that ETregs utilize remains to be determined. Together, these observations support the idea that suppression of inflammation is not the major mechanism by which ETregs promote melanocyte mediated skin pigmentation.</p><p id="P30">Finally, our whole tissue single cell analysis suggests that Tregs preferentially regulate PPARγ activity within the HF epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). Globally, the transcriptome of HFs was impacted most significantly relative to other cell types in skin immediately upon depletion of ETregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar findings were reported in a recent study assessing the transient loss of Tregs in the contexts of lung cancer and injury induced inflammation. Within 2 days of Treg ablation there were pronounced transcriptional responses in stromal cells, but not adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The authors demonstrate that this Treg ‘connectivity’ to non-haematopoietic cell types in lung is facilitated by <italic>in situ</italic> proximity to these first responding cell types. Our finding that ETregs reside in markedly closer proximity to MeSCs within the HF regions than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs supports the notion that Tregs are highly connected to HFs in skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 7A-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We also demonstrate the relevance of this connection in the human skin pigmentation disorder, vitiligo, where Tregs have been implicated in restraining clinical severity. Our analysis uncovers preferential disruption of PPARγ signaling within the HF epithelium in diseased skin relative to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, in developing human skin we show that melanocytes are enriched for this pathway at gestational week 9.5-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-E</xref>). Interestingly, this time-frame coincides almost precisely with Treg seeding of fetal human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that Tregs during very early life are functionally and spatially poised to modulate PPARγ responses in the HF epithelium and that modulation of this pathway is also impacted in human diseased skin where Tregs play a functional role.</p><p id="P31">A major limitation of our study is the use of PPARγ modulators, instead of transgenic mice. Melanocyte abundance is reduced in wild-type mice following neonatal administration of the antagonist T0070907, but not in ΔETreg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that distinct mechanisms lead to pigmentation defects in these two contexts. This discrepancy may be explained by our observation that melanocytes are most dependent on PPARγ signalling activity in developing mouse skin, and therefore most vulnerable to PPARγ antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Overall, our study provides new insights into the function of the foremost skin-seeding Tregs during neonatal life. Immune profiling during the first 12 days indicates a temporal dynamic in Treg function, whereby early skin seeding Tregs, but not later seeding Tregs, potentiate PPARγ signalling to facilitate melanocyte behaviour. Pertinently, GWAS studies have implicated Treg malfunction in the human melanocyte-associated disease, vitiligo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Future studies assessing human neonatal skin Treg frequency, phenotype and perhaps most critically, comprehensive single cell-to-cell spatial co-localization with stem cell populations in the HF epithelia may uncover previously unrecognized Treg modalities during early life that may contribute to disease pathogenesis in later life.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mouse studies</title><p id="P33">All animal experiments were subject to local ethical approval and performed under the terms of a UK government Home Office licence (PP6051479).
