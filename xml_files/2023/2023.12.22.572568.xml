studied as regeneration model species. The assembly and functional analysis of planarian genomes has proven challenging due its high A/T content (70% A/T), repetitive nature, and limited transferability of routine laboratory protocols due to their divergent biochemistry. Only few and often fragmented genome assemblies are currently available, and open challenges include the provision of well-annotated chromosome-scale reference assemblies of the model species and other planarians for a comparative genome evolution perspective. Here we report a haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly and high-quality gene annotations of the sexual S2 strain of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and provide putative regulatory region annotations via optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols. To additionally leverage sequence conservation for regulatory element annotations, we generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies and chromatin accessibility data for the three closest relatives of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>: <italic>S. polychroa</italic>, <italic>S. nova</italic>, and <italic>S. lugubris</italic>. We find substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions, yet reveal remarkable conservation in ChIP-mark bearing open chromatin regions identified as promoters and enhancers in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. The resulting high-confidence set of evolutionary conserved enhancers and promoters provides a valuable resource for the analysis of gene regulatory circuits and their evolution within the taxon. In addition, our four chromosome-scale genome assemblies provide a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to a degradation of synteny across the genus. Interestingly, we further find independent and near-complete losses of the ancestral metazoan synteny across <italic>Schmidtea</italic> and two other flatworm groups, indicating that platyhelminth genomes largely evolve without syntenic constraints. Our work provides valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and sets a foundation for the comparative genomics of planarians. We reveal a contrast between the fast structural evolution of planarian genomes and the conservation of their regulatory elements, suggesting a unique genome evolution in flatworms where gene positioning may not be essential.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Evolution acts on genomic changes to bring about the diversity of life. For example, single nucleotide changes in coding gene sequences duplicate the goldfish tail fin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> or cause nose loss in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>; changes in gene regulatory regions are associated with profound evolutionary body plan changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, e.g. limb loss in snakes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and gene loss is emerging as important mechanism in trait evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the rapidly increasing number of sequenced genomes indicates that genome structure may also be evolutionarily constrained.</p><p id="P3">Synteny (the association of genes on a chromosome or linkage group) is deeply conserved across animals, with Metazoan Ancestral Linkage Groups (MALG) being conserved between Sponges, Cnidaria, and Bilateria and thus in numerous animal phyla <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, some groups like Nematodes and Drosophilids have lost this ancestral synteny, but intriguingly, as ancestral synteny disappears, new linkage groups emerged in these species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The finding that the arrangement of genes in the genome at the mega-base scale is important for gene regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> provides a rationale for the evolutionary conservation of synteny. Indeed, studies mostly in vertebrates have shown that gene regulation is influenced by hierarchical levels of chromatin organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and that the modulation of chromatin organization can give rise to genetic diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or even the origin of evolutionary novelties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, not all taxa exhibit consistent genomic organization features or their significance remains ambiguous <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, the current observations indicate that certain taxonomic groups may display specific patterns of genome evolution and that currently under-sampled clades may reveal additional patterns.</p><p id="P4">Planarians are one example of a large and so far, scarcely sequenced group of animals. As an order (Tricladida) within the diverse and species-rich phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), planarians are studied for their astonishing regenerative abilities and their abundant adult pluripotent stem cells (neoblasts) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As the only division-competent cell outside the reproductive system, neoblast proliferation and differentiation drive homeostatic tissue maintenance and give rise to the germ cell lineages of the hermaphroditic reproductive system of planarians <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, planarian reproductive strategies are highly diverse at the taxon level and range from sexual reproduction to various forms of parthenogenesis and asexual propagation by fission and regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The formation of germ cells from somatic neoblasts and the “inheritance” of many parental neoblasts by a fission fragment raises profound questions regarding genome evolution, including the maintenance of “genetic self” within the pluripotent stem cell population of an individual <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Given these profound questions regarding genome evolution and the rapid growth of the planarian research community in general, high-quality genomic resources are highly desirable.</p><p id="P5">Although the planarian model species <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> was amongst the early cohort of Sanger-sequenced genomes, the resulting assembly was highly fragmented <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Only the advent of long-read sequencing achieved significant assembly contiguity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, which recent Hi-C scaffolding extended to a chromosome-scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The strong compositional bias (&gt; 70% A/T), abundant repeats inclusive of giant &gt; 30 kb Burro retroelements and inbreeding-resistant heterozygosity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> associated with a large chromosomal inversion on Chromosome1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> are some of the reasons of why the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome remains an assembly challenge. The extent by which these peculiarities are species-specific or general features of planarian genomes remains unknown, as the only other currently available planarian genome assembly is a highly fragmented assembly of <italic>Dugesia japonica</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Additional planarian genome assemblies are therefore essential for gaining a comparative perspective and also as an entry point for probing the genetic basis of the rich phenotypic biodiversity within the group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Parallel efforts have initiated the functional annotation and analysis of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genomic features utilizing ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. These efforts have provided first insights into the epigenetic state of planarian genes, the function of epigenetic regulators and gene regulatory elements in individual cell types. However, the systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements across the genome remains a challenge. In addition, the ferocious nuclease activity in planarian cell extracts and abundant contaminants in nucleic acid preparations still leave room for further optimizations of the functional genomics protocols within the community.</p><p id="P6">Here, we present four high-quality genome assemblies of the planarian model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and its three closest known relatives, <italic>S. polychroa</italic>, <italic>S. nova,</italic> and <italic>S. lugubris.</italic> For the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> research community, the haplotype-phased genome assembly and substantially improved gene annotations constitute important model system resources. Using improved ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols, we further identify and annotate regulatory elements that are conserved across the genus and present attractive targets for functional investigations. In contrast, we find that the genome structure is poorly conserved within the genus and that <italic>Schmidtea</italic>, parasitic flatworms and the free-living early-branching flatworm <italic>Macrostomum hystrix</italic> have independently lost the Metazoan Ancestral Linkage Groups. Altogether, our study provides a first comparative perspective on the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mediterranea</italic> genome and indicates that synteny may not constrain the structural evolution of planarian genomes and those of other flatworms.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> genome</title><p id="P7">The current <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> reference genome (dd_Smes_g4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) is a haploid consensus assembly containing 481 contigs. Recently, a scaffolding of this genome (referred to here as schMedS2) has revealed substantial differences between the haplotypes, especially on Chromosome 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This makes a haplotype-phased assembly desirable. Towards this goal and to close the remaining sequencing gaps, we re-sequenced the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome with Pacific Biosciences’ high-fidelity Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS, also known as HiFi) reads and used Hi-C for scaffolding. The new assembly, designated S3, consists of two pseudo-haplotypes: S3h1 and S3h2, and a merged version of the two, referred to as S3BH for “S3 both haplotypes”. The total assembly sizes of both S3h1 and S3h2 are slightly larger than the previous dd_Smes_g4 assembly, with 840Mb and 820Mb compared to 774Mb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.1</xref>). The N50 values of 270Mb and 269Mb indicate high contiguity with 95% and 96% of the total assembly contained in the four largest scaffolds that closely match the known karyology in size and number (1n = 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The Hi-C contact maps indicate high contiguity in both phases, thus justifying the designation as a “chromosome-scale” assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, not all scaffolds are capped by telomere repeats and unincorporated contigs remain (S3h1 and S3h2 contain 662 and 432 contigs, respectively). The largest fraction of unincorporated contigs is comprised of various repeat sequences (satellite DNA, telomere repeats, rRNA clusters) that could not be placed during the assembly process. However, others contain annotated genes (S3h1: 505 genes on 216 contigs, S3h2: 509 genes on 197 contigs), pointing towards remaining localized assembly ambiguities.</p><p id="P8">To quantitatively evaluate the quality of the S3 assemblies compared to previous assemblies, we first assessed base-pair accuracy and assembly completeness via a Merqury analysis of four independent short-read gDNA datasets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> shows that the two individual haplotype assemblies have similar completeness as the previous dd_Smes_g4 assembly (with S3h1 being slightly better than S3h2), yet both display a base-pair accuracy that is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of dd_Smes_g4. Naturally, S3BH showed similar high accuracy but also substantial improvement in completeness, now representing ∼ 98% of the short-read datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Genome completeness assessment using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) showed that both S3h1 and S3h2 have higher completeness than dd_Smes_g4 and schMedS2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.1</xref>). S3h1 again performed slightly better than S3h2, which is why we chose S3h1 as our focal assembly in all following analyses. In contrast, for analyses depending more on reference completeness (e.g., RNA-seq read mapping), we recommend the use of S3BH instead.</p><p id="P9">To independently assess the long-range contiguity of our assembly, we performed whole genome alignment between our phased assemblies and schMedS2. The result demonstrated a high degree of structural agreement between the two independent scaffolding efforts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.2</xref>). Additionally, the S3 assembly successfully captured prominent repeat regions on all chromosomes that were absent in previous assemblies, and that likely contributed to the slightly larger size. These repeat regions often reach a length of &gt; 1 Mb as exemplified by our visualization of these regions on Chromosome 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Closer analyses of the sequence blocks revealed that they are comprised of nested tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and their successful reconstruction in the S3 assembly is likely a result of the much-increased base-pair accuracy of HiFi reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Comparisons between the two S3 pseudohaplotypes further indicated major structural variations between them. Besides the three inversions on Chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) that were already described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we detected one inversion on Chromosome 2 and one inversion on Chromosome 4. Heterozygosity was found to be largely restricted to Chromosome 1, again aligning with prior findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and on Chromosome 2 partially associated with the inversion but also extending to other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). The mapping of the Hi-C data onto the diploid assembly (S3BH) revealed an abundance of uniquely mapping reads to regions with high heterozygosity (inverted region of Chromosome 1 and Chromosome 2), and the central regions of Chromosome 4 that harbor the inversion. The current assembly phasing is therefore likely an accurate representation of the haplotype divergence in these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.3</xref>). By contrast, the much lower density of haplotype differences in other parts of Chromosome 2 and almost the entire Chromosome 3 is likely due to the extensive inbreeding of our genome strain (&gt; 18 generations) and more frequent recombination events in non-inverted regions of the genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">The distribution of genes across the chromosomes was largely uniform with no typical reduction in gene density toward the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). A notable exception to this is Chromosome 4 where we found a marked increase in transposon density and a concurrent decrease in gene density at the metacentric chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Overall, the S3 phased genome assembly represents significant improvements over previous assemblies in terms of accuracy, completeness, and assembly contiguity and thus a strategic community resource for the analysis of gene function in the model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> genome annotation</title><p id="P11">We further sought to complement the new genome assembly with high quality gene annotations. Encountering increasingly diminishing returns on investment with our previous <italic>de novo</italic> gene prediction approaches (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>; data not shown), we instead developed a new hybrid approach that merges Oxford Nanopore long-reads (ONT), Illumina short-reads, and 3P-seq of transcription termination sites (TTS) data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> with genome-guided transcript assembly and thus leverages the benefits of direct gene isoform evidence with the base pair accuracy of our genome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). We generated separate annotation sets for both haplotypes, S3h1 and S3h2, as well as a combined annotation that contains the transcripts from both haplotypes (S3BH). Further, we subsetted each annotation for high-confidence transcripts/coding genes on basis of Open Reading Frame (ORF) length thresholds and a minimum coverage filter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). High confidence transcripts/genes are designated by a ‘hconf’ label to facilitate high specificity applications (e.g., promoter analyses), while the unfiltered annotation sets are recommended for applications requiring maximal mappability (e.g., RNA-seq mapping analyses). With a total of 58,739 and 58,551 gene loci and 21,401 and 21,310 high-confidence gene loci in S3h1 and S3h2, respectively, our new annotation sets are broadly in range with the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> gene number estimates from previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">To analyze the overall quality of the new annotations, we carried out systematic benchmarking comparisons against previous transcriptomes or <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> gene model predictions. As a measure for annotation efficiency (i.e. sensitivity), we first assessed BUSCO representation and completeness. S3BH had the highest number of complete BUSCOs (789) and the fewest missing BUSCOs (134) of all the annotations tested. Interestingly, the transcriptome or gene model-based BUSCO scores were consistently better than genome-mode BUSCO assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.1</xref>), indicating that the detection method used by BUSCO is sub-optimal for planarian genomes. Moreover, the comparatively high number of “missing” BUSCOs reflects a high proportion of genuine gene losses in planarians (see below) and highlights the need for a group-specific BUSCO set. As a further completeness measure, we analyzed the representation of 1075 <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genes available from NCBI Genbank. S3BH again demonstrated the highest completeness with 1056 genes represented compared to 1004 in the current community reference, the dd_v6 transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). In addition, 3 of the 19 transcripts “missing” in the S3BH annotations were false positives (e.g. mitochondrial transcripts, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.4</xref>), thus yielding an overall annotation completeness better than 98 %. Similarly, when quantifying the mappability of published RNA-seq data sets as a global measure of gene annotation completeness, S3BH also outperformed the existing <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> gene annotations, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) inclusive of a recent expanded gene annotation sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">To assess the specificity of our gene annotations, we manually inspected and compared the representation of 96 genes amongst the different annotations. The test set consisted of often lowly expressed signaling pathway components and 50% randomly chosen genes to provide an unbiased representation of planarian genes. Each gene in the dataset was scored for the presence or absence in the particular annotation and for commonly encountered gene model mistakes, including truncated, fragmented, frame-shifted, or chimeric transcript predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Collectively, the S3 annotations scored the highest fraction of error-free gene models, with the annotations containing gene models of all test genes and predicted transcripts with intact ORF representations of 93 out of 91 test genes. The identical scores of the “all” versus “high confidence” S3 annotations reflects the inclusion of all 96 test genes in the “high confidence” category and thus provides an important verification of this annotation subset (see above). Although the S3 predictions still harbor a low proportion of chimeric, truncated, or frame-shifted transcripts (see Discussion and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.5</xref>), they nevertheless represent a significant specificity improvement over the current annotations, e.g. the dd_v6 transcriptome with only 78/96 error-free transcript representations and a significantly higher proportion of fragmented transcripts.</p><p id="P14">Overall, the S3 annotations therefore represent the most complete and accurate gene annotations of the model species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mediterranea</italic> to date. On the basis of our results, we recommend using S3h1 for gene loci analyses and the diploid assembly as a mapping reference. The annotations are scheduled for inclusion in ENSEMBL Metazoa and will be incorporated in a future PlanMine update.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Promoter and enhancers annotation in the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome</title><p id="P15">The annotation of the cis-regulatory elements is a further critical element in understanding the biology of an organism. To explore and annotate regulatory elements in the S3 genome assembly, we sought to first identify accessible chromatin regions using ATAC-seq. With the high nuclease activity and abundant polysaccharides (mucus components) in planarian tissue extracts as persistent experimental challenges <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we modified an existing Omni ATAC-seq protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> to minimize clumping of nuclei and to deplete free and mitochondrial DNA contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 2.1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> section). To annotate regions of accessible chromatin, we applied our protocol to whole intact (wt) or x-irradiated individuals (x-ray) of the broadly studied asexual strain of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and generated a high-confidence ATAC-seq peak set, only incorporating peaks present in at least three biological replicates of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The distribution of nucleosome-free fragments and progressively fewer mono-, di- and trinucleosomal fragments in our ATAC-seq libraries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, top), the typical transcription start site (TSS) enrichment profiles of nucleosomal-free and mono-nucleosomal fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, middle) and the size distribution of the ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, bottom) collectively indicate the high quality of our ATAC-seq data, as well as TSS annotations of the S3 gene models.

In line with the conserved functions of the examined histone marks, we designated the 13,759 ATAC-seq peaks with associated H3K27ac and H3K4me3 as ‘putative promoters’ and the 10,645 ATAC-seq peaks with only H3K27ac signal as ‘putative enhancers’. The remaining 30,481ATAC-seq peaks without H3K27ac or H3K4me3 signal and 700 ATAC-seq peaks with only H3K4me3 signal were designated ‘uncharacterized accessible chromatin’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Tables S1</xref> for details on the classification of each called ATAC-seq peak).

Besides sequence conservation alone, we opted to also assess the conservation of chromatin accessibility as a proxy for functional conservation in the different species. We therefore collected ATAC-seq data sets in <italic>S. polychroa</italic>, <italic>S. lugubris</italic> and <italic>S. nova</italic> under the same biological conditions as previously employed for <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (wt and x-ray, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for further detail). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, the quality control analysis of all ATAC-seq data in the other <italic>Schmidtea</italic> species confirmed the robust and species-independence of our revised protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). Merging of the replicates and biological conditions resulted in 36,729, 60,352, and 77,926 ATAC-seq peaks for <italic>S. polychroa</italic>, <italic>S. nova</italic>, and <italic>S. lugubris</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S7-9</xref>). To assess the conservation of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> ATAC-seq peaks relative to these data, we assessed sequence conservation under each peak through whole genome alignment liftover, and chromatin state conservation by overlapping the whole genome alignment liftover with ATAC-seq data in the receiving species. Peaks from <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> with only sequence conservation in the receiving species were designated as conserved regions. In contrast, conserved regions that additionally overlapped with an ATAC-seq peak in the receiving species were designated as conserved peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). This allowed us to categorize each <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> peak according to its conservation status across the genus with the most informative categories being ‘not conserved’, ‘partial conservation’ (all categories except not conserved) and ‘high conservation’ (3 peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S1</xref>), indicating peaks that showed conservation in all three recipient species. Across all 55,585 ATAC-seq peaks annotated in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, 13.6% were highly conserved, 40.2% partially conserved and 46.2% were not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Interestingly, 87.3% of the highly conserved ATAC-seq peaks also had additional ChIP-seq support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Furthermore, when considering all ATAC-seq peaks with additional ChIP-seq support, we found that 79.4% of the putative promoters and 78.4 % of the putative enhancers displayed at least partial conservation, thus confirming that these peak sets are indeed likely to be enriched for functionally relevant regions under purifying selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 3</xref>). As expected, the 30,197 “uncharacterized” ATAC-seq peaks were collectively much less conserved, with only 3.1% of high conservation and 34.1% of partial conservation (Chi-squared = 9745.1, df = 4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16, all post-hoc tests p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 3</xref>). Although the partially conserved sub-set might, therefore, indeed include functionally relevant sequences, the nature and functional significance of the majority of <italic>Schmidtea</italic>-specific ATAC-only peaks remains unclear. In line with the considerable sequence divergence between the four <italic>Schmidtea</italic> species, the ∼20% ATAC-seq peaks that are <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> specific but ChIP-annotated further highlight a significant degree of regulatory divergence within the genus.</p><p id="P22">Owing to the comparatively recent advent of functional genomics in the field, only two gene-enhancer sequences have been partially characterized so far <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. To gauge the practical utility of our regulatory element analysis, we first examined the putative enhancers of <italic>S. mediterranea Wnt1</italic> identified by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, we also identify two ATAC-seq peaks in the first intron, which we categorize as putative intronic enhancers due to their overlap with the H3K27Ac signal. In addition, our conservation analysis identifies one region as “highly conserved”, with prominent ATAC-seq peaks in all species, and one region as having a conserved peak in <italic>S. polychroa</italic> and <italic>S. lugubris</italic>, but only a conserved region in <italic>S. nova</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Interestingly, the prominence of the ATAC-seq peaks in all four species and the H3K27ac peak in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> contrast with low H3K4me3 signals at the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, top). While the latter is consistent with the highly specific expression of <italic>Wnt1</italic> in very few cells at the tail tip of intact animals, the former might indicate that the regulatory regions of <italic>Wnt1</italic> are constitutively “poised” in a much broader range of cells in order to allow its dramatic upregulation at any <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> wound site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.

While this might well reflect the limitation of our current whole animal data sets with respect to detecting regulatory regions that are only active in a small number of cells, our comparative genomics approach adds a valuable layer of information to the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S1</xref>).

As noted before, <italic>S. lugubris</italic> and <italic>S. nova</italic> had substantially larger genomes than <italic>S. polychroa</italic> and <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Transposable element annotations revealed that a large proportion of the increase in genome size can be attributed to an expansion of transposable elements, in particular, DNA and LTR/Gypsy elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>S. lugubris</italic> and <italic>S. nova</italic>, the total gene span was 54% and 28% larger compared to <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. This increase was primarily due to the increased length of protein-coding genes and, specifically, the expansion of introns, at least in parts due to transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S4</xref>). Therefore, the larger assembly sizes of <italic>S. lugubris</italic> and <italic>S. nova</italic> reflect genuine expansions of genome size due to transposable element expansions. The elucidation of the specific transposon families that mediated the expansions will be an interesting topic for future investigations.</p><p id="P24">Next, we assessed the synteny between the four genomes using GENESPACE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. The visualization of the syntenic blocks revealed a large number of rearrangements between the genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Already between the two pseudo-haplotypes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mediterranea</italic>, the previously noted large inversion on Chromosome 1 and the smaller inversion on Chromosome 2 stand out as prominent structural rearrangements (indicated with red bars and dark shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Comparisons with the other genomes revealed a striking history of frequent structural rearrangements encompassing inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations. For instance, the gene content of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>’s Chromosome 1 equates to <italic>S. polychroa</italic>’s chromosomes 3 and 4, and <italic>S. polychroa</italic>’s Chromosome 2 is equivalent to <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>’s chromosomes 3 and 4, suggesting splits or fusions between all the involved chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, the chromosomal reduction in <italic>S. nova</italic> from 4 to 3 implies a complex fusion event between multiple chromosomes. The rapidly decreasing size and increasing number of syntenic blocks in the assembly comparisons quantitatively confirmed the chromosomal fragmentation apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.1</xref> for more details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S14</xref> for the inferred syntenic blocks). Interestingly, we found that 10kb windows flanking the synteny breakpoints in our species panel were significantly enriched in LTR/Gypsy retrotransposons in all assemblies except for <italic>S. nova</italic>, and enriched in LINE/R2 retrotransposons in all assemblies except <italic>S. nova</italic> and <italic>S. lugubris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), thus providing a first indication that transposable elements may play a role in the frequent structural rearrangements as is the case for LINE elements in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S15</xref>). Overall, our synteny analysis therefore revealed a surprising amount of structural genome rearrangements within the taxon <italic>Schmidtea</italic>, including frequent inter-chromosomal translocations and the consequent erosion of gene order within chromosomes.</p><p id="P25">Intrigued by these findings, we next asked whether this feature is unique to <italic>Schmidtea</italic> or if synteny is generally poorly conserved amongst flatworms. To address this, we selected chromosome-scale genome assemblies of four parasitic flatworms (Neodermata; comprising the two Trematoda species <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and two Cestoda species <italic>Taenia multiceps</italic> and <italic>Hymenolepis microstoma</italic>) that we collectively refer to as “parasites” in the following. Additionally, we included a highly contiguous – but not chromosome-scale – genome assembly of <italic>Macrostomum hystrix</italic> in some of the following analyses, as a representative of the early branching flatworm group Macrostomorpha. As expected on basis of the large evolutionary distances involved, the protein-sequence divergence of the parasite genomes was much higher than the divergence within the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> taxon (top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). To obtain an overview of synteny conservation across such evolutionary distances, we first compared the chromosome-scale assemblies using the location of single-copy genes on basis of <italic>de novo</italic> BUSCO annotations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, large genomic blocks of BUSCOs (color blocks; parallel lines) were clearly conserved across the parasites, despite several large-scale genomic rearrangements. Intriguingly, between the parasites and the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> genomes (red arrows), the relative positions of the same BUSCO genes appeared largely randomized. Of note, the loss of synteny also includes the BUSCO content of the parasite sex chromosome, which was previously hypothesized to be predominantly homologous to Chromosome 1 of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We quantitatively confirmed this finding using a 9-fold expanded gene set using Orthofinder and Chi-squared test analyses, again finding the maintenance of measurable synteny within the <italic>Schmidteas</italic> and the parasites, but the near-total degradation of synteny between the two groups (e.g., small residual effect sizes with all &lt;0.09, and with the Chi-square test not even reaching the significance threshold for the schMedS3h1-hymMic and schMan-schNov1 combinations; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 5.3</xref>).

Overall, this analysis therefore confirmed a profound loss of synteny and chromosomal gene content between the genus <italic>Schmidtea</italic>, parasitic flatworms and the early branching flatworm <italic>Macrostomum hystrix</italic>.</p><p id="P26">This result also raised the question which of the flatworm groups better conformed to the 28 ancestral metazoan linkage groups identified by Simakov et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, which we here refer to as Metazoan Ancestral Linkage Groups (MALG). We, therefore, identified orthologs of the MALG using the ODP tool to determine if they were associated with particular chromosomes of our test genomes. Half of the 28 MALGs were statistically significantly enriched in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> on specific chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.5</xref>). However, all linkage groups were either split between several chromosomes and/or fused and mixed with other linkage groups (See our detailed description of these mixing events in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.5</xref>). A similar pattern emerged in the other parasites with 12, 6, and 12 MALGs partially conserved in <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic>, <italic>Hymenolepis microstoma</italic>, and <italic>Taenia multiceps</italic>, respectively. Notably, despite the conservation of synteny between the parasites, the statistical tests did not find conservation of the same MALGs in each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.5</xref>). This suggests that the parasites retain detectable traces of the MALG, even though they have been largely obscured by a history of pervasive chromosomal rearrangements.

Remaining challenges include missing telomeres on some chromosome arms of the S3 assembly and ∼400 unincorporated contigs containing repeats, telomere fragments, and about 500 annotated genes. Like the assembly, the S3 gene annotations still require refinement. One persistent error category are so-called proximity chimeras, e.g., fusions between closely spaced genes. One such example is the erroneous fusion between the Activin inhibitor <italic>follistatin</italic> to the gene immediately upstream (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 1.5</xref>), which is likely caused by &lt;500 bp distance between the stop codon of the upstream gene and the TSS of <italic>follistatin</italic> and frequently overlapping transcripts of both genes (not shown). Similarly, the isoforms in the current annotations are uncurated and should be interpreted as indicators of splicing diversity only. Further improvements of the genome assembly and the gene annotations will increasingly depend on manual curation efforts. Further improvements of the genome assembly and gene annotations, as well as, the integration of the increasing number of regulatory element annotations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> will increasingly depend on manual curation efforts.

Consistent with previous transcriptome-based analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> the four genomes emphasize the extent of sequence divergence within planarians. Even though we sequenced the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> sister species <italic>S. polychroa</italic> and its two closest known relatives, the genome assemblies revealed third base divergences equivalent to ∼30 Mio years (<italic>S. mediterranea</italic> vs. <italic>S. polychroa</italic>) or ∼70 Mio years (<italic>S. mediterranea</italic> vs. <italic>S. nova</italic>) of vertebrate genome evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. The calibration of sequence divergence rates remains challenging due to the extremely poor planarian fossil record <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> and we, therefore, cannot distinguish between ancient divergence or much increased rates of molecular evolution in planarians as the explanation of the sequence divergence between the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> species. However, as discussed below, our analyses collectively favor the latter interpretation.</p><p id="P31">The numerous inversions, translocations and chromosome fusion and fission events that our genome comparisons revealed provide striking examples of the structural divergence between the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> genomes. Already apparent between the two haplotypes of the S3 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), large-scale structural rearrangements also dominate the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> species genome comparisons. In fact, the unbalanced chromosomal translocation between the sexual and asexual biotypes of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> and previous taxonomic classification of <italic>Schmidtea</italic> into biotypes based on karyotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> have already hinted at frequent structural rearrangements in <italic>Schmidtea</italic> species. Our chromosome-scale assemblies confirm the hypothesis of Benazzi and Puccinelli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, that Chromosome 1 of <italic>S. nova</italic> resulted from a fusion of chromosomes 1 and 3 of <italic>S. lugubris</italic>, but we additionally show that <italic>S. lugubris</italic> Chromosome 1 also shares synteny with Chromosome 3 of <italic>S. nova</italic> and that the gene complement of <italic>Schmidtea</italic> chromosomes is generally unstable. These multiple ‘hidden’ rearrangements are similar to what has recently been uncovered in some holocentric lineages, i.e., Lepidoptera and beaksedges <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. However, unlike in the Lepidoptera, we discovered an enrichment of the abundant LTR/Gypsy elements and LINE/R2 elements near the synteny breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 5.2</xref>). This finding is consistent with recent results in plant genomes (beaksedges <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>) and may hint at the underlying mechanisms for the rearrangements (see below). The consequence of the large scale and high frequency of structural rearrangements in the genomes is a striking degradation of synteny across the <italic>Schmidtea</italic> genomes. For example, we find that synteny between <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and <italic>S. lugubris</italic> is fragmented into 272 identified syntenic blocks with a median size of 1.5 Mb and covering only 48.7% of the assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 4.1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Additional File 2: Table S14</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate a substantial loss of synteny within the taxon.</p><p id="P32">This result also raises the question of whether the structural genome instability is specific to <italic>Schmidtea</italic> versus a general feature of flatworm genome evolution. The striking qualitative randomization of BUSCO genomic positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and the quantitative analysis approach of Metazoan ancestral linkage groups (MALG; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H-J</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>) demonstrates the near-complete absence of genomic synteny between <italic>Schmidtea</italic>, the analyzed parasite genomes and even the genome of the early-branching flatworm <italic>Macrostomum hystrix</italic>. These results imply that the genome architectures of the sampled flatworm clades have evolved largely independently, which also raises concerns_regarding the presumptive synteny between the parasite sex chromosomes and chromosome 1 of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, our finding that MALGs have been lost independently in <italic>Schmidtea</italic> and <italic>M. hystrix</italic>, but weakly retained in the parasites (also see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>) is remarkable for several reasons. The remnants of MALGs only in the parasitic flatworms is unexpected, given that they are often assumed to represent the most derived taxonomic group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> on basis of their phylogenetic position <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, compacted genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and obligate parasitic life cycles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. A broader taxon sampling of flatworm genomes will therefore be required to place the evolution of parasitism within the evolutionary history of the phylum. In addition, the loss of MALGs <italic>per se</italic> is uncommon, given that MALGs are defined on basis of their conservation across metazoan genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> and some are even conserved in unicellular relatives of animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Although, MALG losses have already been noted in other taxonomic groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, the obliteration of ancestral linkage groups at the base of these lineages appears to have been followed by the establishment and retention of new clade-specific linkage groups (e.g. Nigon elements in Nematodes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, Muller elements in Drosophilids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, ALGs in Bryozoa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>). Interestingly, the group-specific linkage groups remain even in clades that contain species with drastic genome/karyotype rearrangements, suggesting selection for the maintenance of linkage groups rather than mechanistic constraints on inter-chromosomal rearrangements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, our results indicate that the dispersal of MALGs in flatworms was not accompanied by the emergence of clade-specific linkage groups and that gene order has been and continues to evolve independently within the different taxa. Altogether, this amounts to the provocative proposition that synteny may not matter in flatworms.</p><p id="P33">The importance of topological constraints on gene expression in many systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> might imply that planarians and other flatworms achieve gene expression specificity by different means. Consistently, topologically associated domains (TADs) are not apparent in our initial Hi-C analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the finding that 80% of our enhancer annotations in the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome are located in introns, exons, or within 1 kb of the closest gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 2.3</xref>), may reflect a particularly tight association of regulatory elements with their target genes (a genome architecture similar to a tunicate species complex with rapid chromosome-arm restricted gene shuffling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>). However, cell or tissue type-specific Hi-C data sets and quantitative comparisons of enhancer distributions with well-annotated genomes will be required to understand the extend by which these observation reflect technical artefacts versus genuine mechanistic differences in the control of gene expression in planarians.</p><p id="P34">A further interesting question raised by our study are the mechanistic causes of the frequent genome rearrangements in <italic>Schmidtea</italic>. Both free-living and parasitic flatworms survive gamma-irradiation doses well beyond lethal levels in vertebrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, which implies the existence of efficient double-strand break repair pathways that are also known to mediate Robertsonian translocations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>. The above-mentioned enrichment of LTR/Gypsy and LINE/R2 elements near the synteny breakpoints that we discovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1: Section 5.2</xref>), might indicate a role of these abundant retrotransposons as templates for strand invasion during the repair of double-strand breaks. Whether double-strand break repair pathways mediate the frequent chromosomal rearrangements and ultimately drive the likely rapid structural evolution of planarian genomes is therefore a further interesting topic for future analysis. Finally, the possibility that parallel somatic evolution and selection phenomena amongst the many thousand pluripotent somatic stem cells of a single planarian might contribute to the extraordinary rates of sequence divergence raises profound questions regarding the maintenance of genetic “self” and the evolution of multicellularity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.

We visualized the distribution of orthologs using a dotplot and conducted chi-squared tests against the null hypothesis that orthologs are randomly distributed across the chromosomes. A significant p-value indicates that there is a clustering of orthologs based on the chromosome combination (i.e. preservation of synteny). Given potential violations of chi-square test assumptions by our genomic data, we not only conducted a conventional significance test based on the chi-square distribution but also employed a permutation test with 100,000 permutations to assess significance. We calculated the effect size ‘Cramer’s V’ to determine the amount of clustering. Cramer’s V is 0 for a random distribution and 1 for a perfect correlation between chromosomes.
