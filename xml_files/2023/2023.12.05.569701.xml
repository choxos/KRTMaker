There was some support for group stability at individual feeders also impacting individual social network metrics: increase in flock size was more pronounced in the stable than the unstable group. Most of the differences in sociality were maintained when the food distribution returned to the dispersed pattern, and this was caused primarily by the change in resource distribution rather than the social manipulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P5">Our results show that perturbations in the access to resources and social group stability can change sociality at a surprisingly fine spatial scale. These small-scale changes could arise through a variety of mechanisms, including assortative positioning within groups due to, for instance, similarity among individuals in their preferences for different resource patches. Our results suggest that small-scale effects could lead to social processes at larger scales and yet are typically overlooked in social groups.</p></list-item></list>

These include effects on disease transmission, mating partner choice, access to shared information, the spread of innovations, and patterns of selection among many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cantor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cheney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ellis et al., 2019</xref>). Resource distribution is a major driver of social network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Foster et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, more clustered food resources can increase recurring aggregation and may be linked to stronger social bonds between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>). Increasingly social network analyses are being used to understand social interactions, often revealing important effects that would otherwise go undetected in studies of individual behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Godfrey et al., 2009</xref>). Social networks and individual social connections are often stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Farine &amp; Sheldon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fisher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shizuka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stanley et al., 2018</xref>) and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Firth &amp; Sheldon, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lehmann &amp; Ross, 2011</xref>). Inevitably, individual sociality and social networks are also highly plastic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Proops et al., 2021</xref>), especially in fission-fusion systems. Most evidence for the stability or plasticity of social interactions comes from observational studies or from large scale manipulations (e.g. over kilometres, between groups) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al., 2022</xref>). However, individual social interactions can take place at fine spatial scales within the broader social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>), but less is known about how these scale up to affect broader patterns of social interaction. Likewise, broad effects on social group structure can feed back on individual social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Firth et al., 2016</xref>). Here we conduct experimental manipulations, in a natural population, of i) resource distribution at a fine spatial scale (within a group) and ii) social group stability, and examine their effects on individual sociality.</p><p id="P7">Food patch distribution is a large cause of variation in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Foster et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>). Dispersed food patches can increase the opportunity to interact with individuals from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>), but may also require individuals to invest more time in finding food, reducing the opportunity for social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Foster et al., 2012</xref>). Resource distribution is highly variable over time, which affects individual sociality and social network stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cantor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">He et al., 2019</xref>). All of these effects are likely scale-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Levin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wiens, 1989</xref>), and although they have been investigated from centimetres in captivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tanner &amp; Jackson, 2011</xref>) to hundreds of kilometres in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cortés-Avizanda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Foster et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>), generally little is known about how small-scale variation in resource distribution affects individual sociality dynamics under natural conditions.</p><p id="P8">Group membership is clearly the main driver of sociality. It follows that changes in group membership are likely to lead to changes in individual social network metrics and social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shizuka &amp; Johnson, 2020</xref>). These changes can have long-lasting effects on individual social metrics - for instance, in macaques, the absence of policing after the loss of key male individuals led the remaining members of the group to have smaller, less diverse and less integrated networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Flack et al., 2006</xref>) - and can also impact functional behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carter &amp; Wilkinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ebensperger et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gazda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maldonado-Chaparro et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, individual social network positions can remain remarkably stable across years even with population turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Aplin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Farine &amp; Sheldon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shizuka et al., 2014</xref>) and when individuals lose close associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boucherie et al., 2017</xref>; Firth et al., 2017).</p><p id="P9">In all of these group membership studies, however, changes in individual sociality in the group are perhaps inevitable, since typically individuals were removed or added to social groups in the experimental manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boucherie et al., 2017</xref>; Firth et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maldonado-Chaparro et al., 2018</xref>). Behavioural changes within groups of constant membership could also lead to changes in who individuals interact with. For example, an individual that develops a new innovative behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kulahci &amp; Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wascher et al., 2018</xref>) can become more central in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kulahci et al., 2018</xref>). The development of persistent assortative interactions among individuals within groups - due to, for instance, similarity among individuals in their preferences for different resource patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Caillaud &amp; Via, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Crook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Martin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Snowberg &amp; Bolnick, 2008</xref>), or in their preferred positions within groups linked to predation risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Heathcote et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lambert et al., 2021</xref>) - could similarly feed back onto individual social network metrics and social structure generally. However, to date this latter possibility has not been tested experimentally.</p><p id="P10">In this study we manipulated fine-scale resource distribution and social stability in great tits (<italic>Parus major</italic>). Great tits form fission-fusion flocks during the non-breeding season in woodland habitat and readily come to feeders where their behaviour can be automatically detected using passive integrated transponders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aplin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cauchoix et al., 2022</xref>; Cooke, 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Reichert et al., 2020</xref>). We estimated flock sizes and individual social centrality - among the most important descriptors of network positioning. First, we describe patterns of visitation over time and use repeatability analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stoffel et al., 2017</xref>) to test whether our social centrality measures captured consistent behaviour, i.e., intrinsic differences among individuals in their sociability. We then explore our four main hypotheses. First, we tested whether fine-scale variation in resource distribution affects individual social network metrics (SNM). We expected that by moving feeders closer together from an initially dispersed to a clustered treatment, flock sizes and individual social connectedness should increase. Second, we tested whether forcing groups of individuals to use specific feeders in the clustered 5-feeder array, mimicking, for example, assortative patch use or assortative positioning within flocks, modified individual sociality. We predicted that forcing individuals to forage at a specific feeder might disrupt the connections previously formed, and as such their flock sizes and individual social connectedness would decrease. Third, we tested whether individual social network metrics were affected by social stability, where groups of individuals were allocated to one of the five feeders for two additional phases, either with the same individuals in each group across each phase (stable treatment), or with a random selection of new individuals (unstable). We predicted that, at the end of the treatment, individuals in the stable treatment would have stronger ties with fewer individuals, because they had more opportunities to interact repeatedly with the same individuals, compared to those who shared feeders with different individuals across each of the three phases and therefore more individuals over the three phases cumulatively. Finally, we tested whether the effects of our manipulations collectively were transient or if they would persist in a different context by returning the feeders to the original dispersed distribution. On the one hand, because great tits live in a fission-fusion society and are adapted to regular small-scale changes in their (physical and social) environment, any effects observed during the manipulations might be expected to be transient, in which case we expected that individuals would associate with the same individuals at the start and the end of the experiment, and individual social network metrics would revert back to their initial value. On the other hand, if prolonged associations between individuals have longer term carry-over effects, we predicted that the manipulations observed would be persistent, and especially so in the stable treatment, where individuals had more opportunity to interact with the same individuals and create stronger bonds.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study site and species</title><p id="P11">The study took place in Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK. Great tits and blue tits (<italic>Cyanistes caeruleus</italic>) were fitted with PIT tags following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Reichert et al. (2020)</xref>. During the winter, these birds form fission-fusion foraging flocks and move around the woodland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Farine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Firth &amp; Sheldon, 2016</xref>). Data collection took place during the winter season from November 2017 to February 2018. Four sites were used early in the season (November-December 2017), and four different sites were used later in the season (January-February 2018). Only data from great tits were used in this study because a very high proportion of the population is tagged: an estimated ~80-90% of great tits were tagged at this time based on previous studies with similar trapping effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aplin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Matechou et al., 2015</xref>) and 258 individuals used our feeders (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> for age and sex profiles following the STRANGE recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Webster &amp; Rutz, 2020</xref>)).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Treatments</title><p id="P12">Feeders containing sunflower seeds and equipped with an RFID antenna were active each day during daylight hours from 0700 to 1630, and PIT tagged birds had ad libitum access to food, at some or all of these feeders, during those times (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Reichert et al., 2020</xref> for details). At each of the eight sites, feeders were arranged according to four main treatments: the initial dispersed, the open clustered, the assortative clustered, and the final dispersed treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.A</xref>). Note that we use the word “assortative” in the sense that restricting individual access to individual feeders in effect placed them into groups of individuals that shared a feeder, even if they had not been grouped based on any a priori shared characteristic. The initial and final dispersed treatments consisted of one feeder at each of two locations that were 50m apart, during which all birds could feed from either feeder. The two clustered treatments were sandwiched in time between the two dispersed treatments, and consisted of five feeders 1m apart at one location. We acknowledge that the availability of food could also have been higher in the clustered treatment, and therefore the treatment may reflect a combination of resource distribution and food availability. However, we think the distribution was the dominant effect because i) the number of individuals that visited the feeders was lower in the clustered treatment than in the previous initial dispersed treatment (see below); ii) food availability was likely not a limiting factor because seeds were always available from all allocated feeders and delivery of the single seed reward was effectively instantaneous, notwithstanding any queuing that took place around the feeders.</p><p id="P13">In the open clustered treatment, birds could obtain food from any of the 5 feeders. In the assortative clustered treatment, birds could only access one feeder, to which they were randomly allocated. If birds landed on their assigned feeder, the feeder would open and they had access to the food. If they landed on any of the 4 other feeders, the feeder would remain closed, and the bird would not have access to the food, but its visit would still be recorded feeding into the social network metrics. Great tits quickly learned which feeder they were allocated to, usually within the first day and usually after less than 30 visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Reichert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The assortative clustered treatment further consisted of 3 phases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.B</xref>). After eight to ten days (eight days in 2017 and ten days owing to operational differences in 2018) of the initial feeder assignment in the assortative clustered treatment, we manipulated social stability by randomly allocating birds to a different feeder, either with the same individuals as in their original feeder assignment (the stable assortative clustered treatment; run at four sites) or with a random selection of predominantly different individuals (the unstable assortative clustered treatment; run at the remaining four sites). After another eight to ten days we then repeated the feeder reassignment procedure; birds in the stable treatment were again reassigned along with the same individuals from their original feeder assignment and birds in the unstable treatment were again reassigned with a new randomly selected group of individuals.</p><p id="P15">The raw dataset consisted of rows containing the date, time and PIT tag for each detected visit at each feeder. We considered consecutive detections of the same bird to the same feeder within 2s of each other to be a single visit (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Reichert et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Individual network metrics</title><p id="P16">Using the spatio-temporal data of visits to feeders, “flocks” (or ‘flocking events’) were identified at each location using a machine learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Psorakis et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2015</xref>). A Gaussian mixture model assigned each individual visit from each bird to the flocking event for which it had the highest probability of belonging, without imposing assumptions about the temporal boundaries of flocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Psorakis et al., 2012</xref>).

For each possible pair of individuals, we then counted the number of flocking events in which both individuals were present. We used these data to quantify the association strength for each dyad as a “simple ratio index”: the number of times both individuals were seen in the same flocking events ÷ (the number of times individual A was seen in a flocking event without B + the number of times individual B was seen in a flocking event without A + the number of times individuals A and B were both seen in the same flocking event) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cairns &amp; Schwager, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Whitehead, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P18">For each individual, we also calculated two commonly used social network centrality metrics: 1) weighted degree - the sum of all the focal individual’s weighted associations (i.e. the number of times each association between two individuals was observed) with all other individuals (also known as node ‘strength’); and 2) weighted eigenvector centrality - a measure of the total amount of social associations of an individual’s associates (i.e. the centrality of their flockmates); for instance, an individual that associates with highly sociable individuals would have high eigenvector centrality whilst an individual that associates with peripheral individuals would have low eigenvector centrality.

However, we found that at a small scale, changes in both food distribution and social stability influenced individual level social network metrics. Some of these effects lasted even when food distribution and social groupings were reverted back to their original structure.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Resource distribution and individual sociality (H1 &amp; H2)</title><p id="P37">Manipulating resource distribution from two feeders 50m apart (dispersed) to a clustered array of five feeders only 1m apart led to an immediate increase in individual sociality for all metrics, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tanner &amp; Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zahavi, 1971</xref>). This is unsurprising simply because the total numbers of birds at the site only declined by about 20% and yet suddenly the remaining birds were feeding on additional food resources at one location instead of two. The response observed, therefore, reflects the fact that when birds have to find new foraging patches they ultimately converge on similar feeding locations, likely through a variety of mechanisms linked to shared information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Ward &amp; Webster, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Our more novel finding was that sociality changed considerably when individuals were then restricted to separate single group locations on a fine-spatial scale, even though the spatial scale and location of the food resources remained unchanged. Flock sizes increased, which was likely caused by reduced feeder access, forcing individuals to spend more time at the location to get the food (presumably being forced to queue for longer, and/or learning which feeder provides food) and being registered in the same flocks. As predicted, the same manipulation reduced both the strength of connections, as indicated by declines in weighted degree, and individuals’ overall social connectedness, as indicated by a reduction in weighted eigenvector centrality. Individuals occurred in larger but less well-connected flocks. This decrease in social connectedness could imply a strong trade-off between ensuring access to resources (without being able to rely on social information) - which may have required individuals to stay at feeders to attempt to get food and in the process overlapping with many more individuals but having less reliable connections to specific individuals - and maintaining strong connections. To our knowledge this is the first experimental demonstration that restricting where individuals feed at a spatial scale smaller than that encompassed by a single social ostensible group, can change the sociality of individuals, demonstrating the importance of scale in understanding the effects of resource use on social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cortés-Avizanda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Constraints on where individuals feed within group foraging locations can arise through a variety of mechanisms, for example because of competitive ability when patch quality varies, risk taking behaviour when risk varies and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quinn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Webster &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>). Our experimental manipulation supports the hypothesis that these constraints can have implications for individual sociality even on a very fine scale.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>The effect of social group stability treatment on flock size and social network centrality (H3)</title><p id="P40">We expected individuals in the stable treatment to have stronger ties with fewer individuals at the end of the assortative treatment because they had more opportunities to interact repeatedly with the same individuals compared to individuals who shared feeders with different individuals across each of the three phases. Flock size increased in both the stable and unstable social group treatments, which is to be expected since restricting access to a single feeder led to queuing, or individuals being around the feeders for longer as they determined which feeder they could access. However, against our prediction, the increase in flock size was larger in the stable treatment. We suggest that one possible mechanism for this finding is that there may have been greater synchrony in arrival times among birds in flocks in the stable treatment because, for example, social information should be more reliable, i.e., individuals in stable flocks knew which flock mates to rely on for information in the context of shared vigilance or finding the correct feeder. Other systems have shown how individuals differ in their reliability with respect to sharing information about predators and how this is linked to their network positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Croft et al., 2009</xref>) and how learning about a food resource shapes the social network, where individuals who reliably have information become more central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kulahci et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We had also predicted that individuals in the stable social group would have higher strength of connections (weighted degree and weighted eigenvector centrality) because they had more opportunity to create bonds with the same individuals, and the information about feeder choice from those individuals would be more reliable, compared to those who shared feeders with different individuals across each of the three phases. Although the presence of more individuals in the stable treatment (larger increase in flock size) may have been helpful to find the appropriate feeder (e.g. through stimulus enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Heyes, 1994</xref>)), the strength of connections (weighted degree) changed in a similar way in the stable and unstable treatment. Against our prediction, there was weak evidence that the overall connectedness (weighted eigenvector centrality) decreased more for the stable than the unstable group, but in support of our hypothesis, the relationship between the dyadic associations in the two phases during the manipulation was stronger in the stable group than the unstable group. This is suggestive of a trade-off between forming stable social relationships and having larger social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Heathcote et al., 2017</xref>). We predicted that if the environment was too unpredictable, and led to too many changes in who individuals are feeding with (i.e., in the unstable social group treatment), this could have increased the costs of retaining previous associations. Yet, we found that despite these regular changes at the feeder level, individuals were still able to maintain their weighted degree in a similar way to birds from the stable treatment, and they maintained their previous associations as measured by dyadic interaction strength, demonstrating that fine-scale changes in resource access do not always affect social ties at a larger scale of the feeding patch. Previous studies found that, in contrast, fine-scale social disturbances weakened associations between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Formica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Maldonado-Chaparro et al., 2018</xref>). However, those studies involved disturbances that included visually separating individuals for several days. In our study, there was no manipulation of which individuals could be a member of the social group, but we did manipulate the fine-scale access to food within the larger feeder array. This difference in methodologies may explain the difference between our results and those of previous studies: physically separating individuals for several days had stronger negative effects on social bonds between individuals than did our manipulation that merely forced individuals to forage at different micro-sites but otherwise allowed them to remain in the same social group.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Persistence of effects (H4)</title><p id="P42">We also aimed to understand how perturbations carried over into time periods following the perturbations. Some effects of our food distribution and sociality manipulations persisted over time, even across subsequent changes in food distribution. We found that at the end of the experiment – during the final dispersed phase – individuals came to the feeders in larger flocks, had stronger associations with other individuals, and had more central associates, compared to the same dispersed configuration at the beginning of the experiment. This persistence observed in our experiment may have both spatial and temporal explanations. First, the clustered treatment had a high density of feeders, forcing individuals to interact at close range. This may have increased opportunities for social bond formation, and indeed we observed an increase in social connectedness. Once these social associations had been formed, they may have carried over into new contexts. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Firth and Sheldon (2015)</xref> found that controlling access to feeders changed the social network in a foraging context not only at those feeders, but also at unrestricted feeders, and even while prospecting for nests in the context of breeding. Second, the clustered phase of the experiment was relatively long duration compared to the other phases. This would have again given individuals increased opportunities to interact and form stable relationships. Once solidified, these were then likely to continue for some time after the distribution of resources changed. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al. (2022)</xref>, who used a similar timeline as our experiment, found that no significant assortment persisted beyond the initial manipulation. Time spent together does not necessarily influence the strength of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boucherie et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Proops et al., 2021</xref>), as relationships are dynamic and change overtime. However, a threshold of time spent together may be necessary to create bonds, which then take a certain time to change. This raises important questions for the study of social networks: over what time scale are social bonds formed, and how does this interact with the duration of continued social ties following an environmental disturbance?</p><p id="P43">Given the temporal set up of our experiment, it is difficult to determine which specific treatment led to those persistent effects. Flock size increased through both the physical and social manipulations throughout the experiment, suggesting that the higher flock size observed at the end is due to either additive or non-additive effects that carried over from the different manipulations to affect sociality in the final dispersed phase. Weighted degree and weighted eigenvector centrality showed increases or decreases throughout our experiment, depending on the treatment applied. It is therefore difficult to disentangle the effect of each manipulation. However, effect sizes were larger for the dispersed to clustered manipulation (H1), compared to the manipulation restricting access to feeders (H2), and the manipulation of social stability (H3). The direction and size of the effect during H1 are similar to those comparing the final to the initial dispersed phase (H4), suggesting that this initial manipulation of food distribution may have had the strongest effect of any of our manipulations in the long term. Along the same line, by the end of the experiment, we did not find any significant effects of social stability treatment on our social network metrics, except for group size, but such differences could be explained entirely by the fact that groups that were later assigned to the unstable social treatment had smaller flock sizes at the start of the experiment. This suggests that our social manipulation mostly influenced changes in social network while the manipulation occurred, but had little long-lasting effects. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al. (2022)</xref> - unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Firth and Sheldon (2015)</xref> - found that after assorting individuals at food patches, in a similar manner to our social stability treatment, the assortment did not persist into a new feeding context.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Dyadic associations</title><p id="P44">We also show that dyadic associations between individuals were maintained over time. Despite the fine scale of the manipulation, and its persistent impact on social network metrics, we found evidence of consistent social ties across periods. Great tits appear to be highly consistent in their social associations: spring breeding territorial distributions reflected winter foraging network positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Firth &amp; Sheldon 2016</xref>), and individuals temporarily removed from the flock resumed their prior social associations upon reintroduction (Firth et al. 2017). However, such consistency is not found in all species. For instance, work in gannets (<italic>Morus serrator</italic>) found that the identity of associates was not consistent across different foraging contexts (Jones et al., 2020), and an experimental manipulation showed that chickadees (<italic>Poecile gambeli</italic>) restructure their network by assorting mostly with birds assigned to the same resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinen et al., 2022</xref>). To determine the true cause of variation across species in social network stability in the face of disturbance, additional experiments in other species like the ones presented here (manipulating habitat-based and social factors) would be very valuable.</p><p id="P45">Here we show that despite both physical and social experimental changes in their environment, the social bonds individual great tits formed with conspecifics were preserved. Living in fission-fusion flocks might have selected for strategies that allow some buffering against perturbation and allow for individuals to consistently associate with the same conspecifics. This raises the question of how individuals buffer such environmental changes in their network, and whether this has consequences for their fitness and life history strategies. For instance, while associations are maintained even when individuals are assorted at different feeders, scrounging might increase as individuals still use feeders where they don’t have access to food in order to maintain previously established relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Regan et al., 2022</xref>). Data outside of the feeding context might also prove useful in understanding how individuals adjust their behaviour to stay with their associates despite changes in their foraging environment. Further work to better understand the underlying mechanisms from which such social stability emerges and is maintained will be important in understanding the evolutionary forces acting on social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Farine &amp; Sheldon, 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P46">We show that even in the face of direct fine-scale manipulations of the physical and social environment, individual differences in social behaviour (flock size and social network centralities) are maintained in a wild population of birds. We also found that dyadic social associations remained consistent under these perturbations, as individuals consistently associated with the same individuals. Such consistency is in line with previous work, and suggests personality differences in social behaviour during foraging, and some resilience of social associations to environmental change. But the environment also drives plasticity in social network metrics. We found that manipulating a combination of habitat-based and social factors can have persistent effects (i.e. beyond the initial manipulation) on social network structure. Even fine scale-changes in food distribution and interactions at a feeder can have effects on network metrics, showing that social traits are dynamic. Our results provide a novel insight into how fine scale manipulations of socio-environmental factors have persistent effects on group structure and stability, and that relative social differences among individuals may be robust to these perturbations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables 1-12, Supplementary Figures 1-3</label><media xlink:href="EMS192611-supplement-Supplementary_Tables_1_12__Supplementary_Figures_1_3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d196aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Keith McMahon for assisting with fieldwork and bird ringing; Karen Cogan for assisting with equipment sourcing and purchasing; Martin Whitaker for helping design the selective feeders; Ella Cole for logistical advice at Whytham; Ipek Kulahci, James Savage and Iván de la Hera for helping with their constructions.
