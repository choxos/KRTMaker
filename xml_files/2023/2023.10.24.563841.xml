Vaccine efficacy has been impacted by emerging variants of concern that accumulate most of the sequence modifications in the immunodominant S1 subunit. S2, in contrast, is the most evolutionarily conserved region of the spike and can elicit broadly neutralizing and protective antibodies. Yet, S2’s usage as an alternative vaccine strategy is hampered by its general instability. Here, we use a simulation-driven approach to design highly <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">stable S2</xref>-only antigens retaining a closed prefusion conformation. Weighted ensemble simulations provide mechanistic characterization of the S2 trimer’s opening, informing the design of tryptophan substitutions that impart kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization. Alchemical free energy perturbation calculations and a corroborating set of experiments confirm that V991W and T998W in the central helices of S2 stabilize the trimer in the closed prefusion conformation, producing an antigen with increased protein expression, superior thermostability, and preserved immunogenicity against sarbecoviruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>I</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses featuring a positive-strand RNA genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Several human CoVs (HCoVs) belonging to the α (229E and NL63) and β (OC43 and HKU1) genera endemically circulate every year, causing upper respiratory illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Over the first two decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, outbreaks of other β-CoVs, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV viruses, led to severe cases of respiratory illnesses characterized by a high mortality rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> More recently, COVID-19—the disease resulting from infection with another β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2—has caused at least 770 million cases and 6.9 million deaths worldwide since the virus was first identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Vaccines have provided protection against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, and mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> but their efficacy has been challenged by the continual emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, multiple Omicron sublineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5, and the currently dominant EG.5, FL.1.5.1, and XBB.1.16.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Therefore, while bivalent boosters may help recover some degree of efficacy, a more direct approach of designing pan-coronavirus vaccines is required for combating the relentless evolution of this pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">The primary antigen used in most of the COVID-19 vaccines is an engineered version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), a homotrimeric class I fusion glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Prominently extending from the virus surface and responsible for cell entry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> the spike serves as the principal target of the host’s humoral immune response. The spike is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The former initiates viral entry by engaging host cell receptors, and the latter mediates fusion between viral and host membranes upon cleavage at the S1/S2 furin site, shedding of S1, further proteolytic cleavage at the S2’ site, and refolding from a prefusion to postfusion conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> On one hand, S1 is immunodominant as it encompasses the two domains eliciting the majority of anti-CoV neutralizing antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). On the other hand, due to selective immune pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> most of the mutations across different CoV strains and SARS-CoV-2 VOCs occur in S1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> As a result, the acquired humoral immunity gained from S1-directed antibodies is often closely related to the specific CoV strain or SARS-CoV-2 VOC responsible for the infection. Conversely, the S2 subunit is highly conserved and less prone to accumulate sequence modifications, offering the opportunity for the design of S2-based immunogens that provide broader protection against different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and, possibly, CoV strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Several studies have characterized cross-reactive antibodies targeting the S2 subunit’s stem helix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> fusion peptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and the usually occluded “hinge” region at the trimer apex spanning residues 980-1006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Although immunogenically appealing, prefusion S2 is metastable as it irreversibly transitions to a stable, postfusion conformation when S1 is removed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> The S2 trimer adopts an elongated baseball-bat-like conformation, where the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and central helices (CHs) refold at the hinge region, transitioning from a bent hairpin into a continuous, extended coiled-coil helical bundle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> This structure is framed by the HR2 motif at the helix-helix interfaces, yielding a rigid six-helix bundle in the regions where HR2 maintains its helical fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Introduction of two consecutive prolines within the HR1/CH hinge point (K986P and V987P) in the S2 subunit of the engineered SARS-CoV-2 ‘S-2P’ spike proved a successful strategy to prevent progression to the postfusion state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> Further stabilization of the prefusion conformation, along with improved cellular expression, has more recently been accomplished upon the incorporation of four additional prolines in the S2 subunit (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P), resulting in the SARS-CoV-2 ‘HexaPro’ spike.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> In this construct, the three S1 subunits sit atop and seal together the HexaPro S2 subunits nestled underneath. Interestingly, previous HDX-MS experiments showed that the SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike can also sample an open conformation where the S2 trimer interfaces become solvent accessible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> This may suggest that, in the absence of S1, the Hexapro S2-only trimer would most likely dissociate into individual monomers. To stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro S2-only antigen, McLellan and coworkers introduced an interprotomer disulfide bond via two cysteine substitutions (S704C and K790C) and an interprotomer salt bridge with R765 upon Q957E substitution. We note that at the time of writing, the aforementioned work by McLellan and coworkers is under review for publication. The resulting S2-only construct, renamed HexaPro-SS-Δstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), adopted a prefusion conformation where trimer dissociation was prevented. Although stabilized in the prefusion conformation, the HexaPro-SS-Δstalk apex was shown to splay apart, adopting semi-open and open conformations. This suggests the potential to further enhance its stability by shifting the equilibrium towards a closed conformation.</p><p id="P6">Opening of the trimer, or “breathing,” is a motion observed in several class I fusion glycoproteins, including influenza hemagglutinin (HA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> HIV-1 Env,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> as well as the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Silva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> showed that accessibility of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike’s hinge epitope necessitates both RBD transitioning to the ‘up’ conformation and S2 subunits ‘breathing.’ This aligns with HDX-MS experiments showing the existence of an open conformation of the full-length spike where the S2 apex is solvent-exposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> However, S2 apex epitopes elicit non-neutralizing antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> which are dominant in the B cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and can interfere with binding of neutralizing antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> This is also the case for other trimer interface epitopes in influenza HA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Hence, preventing the S2 trimer’s apex opening may offer the foundations for the design of improved S2-based immunogens that may also afford binding and elicitation of quaternary epitope-specific antibodies.</p><p id="P7">Here we use a simulation-driven approach to characterize the opening mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 trimer and design an S2-based immunogen that is stable in the closed prefusion conformation.

These substitutions also provide enhanced thermostability and cellular expression, allowing complete structural characterization via cryo-EM. Subsequent neutralization assays showed that sera from mice immunized with the newly designed S2 antigen significantly neutralizes recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) bearing spikes from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-1 and Omicron BA.1. Overall, by integrating cutting-edge computational methodologies and a comprehensive array of experiments, our work offers a thorough understanding of the mechanistic, structural, dynamical, and immunogenic aspects of novel, aptly engineered S2-only antigens.

A model of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk in the closed conformation was built from the S2 domain of the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike (PDB ID: 6XKL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>) integrated with the fusion peptide’s residue coordinates grafted from the SARS-CoV-2 3Q-2P spike cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 7JJI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>). The distinctive substitutions engineered in HexaPro-SS-Δstalk (i.e., S704C, K790C, Q957E) were then incorporated using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and S2’s N-linked glycans were added as described by Casalino et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> The final system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), comprising∼274,000 atoms with explicit water molecules and ions, was subjected to four, ∼600 ns-long MD simulation replicates. In these simulations, we observed one protomer’s apex transiently swinging away from the other two protomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>); however, the trimer did not adopt an open conformation where the three protomers are splayed apart. Notably, the slight detachment of one protomer from the others was observed only once throughout a combined sampling of 2.6 µs, suggesting that trimer opening is a rare (or infrequent) event when investigated by means of conventional MD. Thus, to elucidate the complete transition of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk from a closed conformation to an open conformation, an enhanced sampling method was necessary.</p><p id="P9">Exploration of a system’s conformational space, such as the one conducted with conventional MD, is limited by high free energy barriers that separate distinct minima in which a system may remain trapped. As large conformational transitions occurring in the millisecond-to-second timescale are computationally prohibitive via conventional MD, enhanced sampling methods may be employed instead.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> Therefore, we first attempted to inquire into the conformational transition of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk from the closed to the open conformation using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD). GaMD is a method that applies a harmonic boost potential to smooth energy barriers on the potential energy surface, expanding the accessibility of long-timescale dynamic motions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> However, we found that the applied boost potential at the highest acceleration level was insufficient to induce sampling of open conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Hence, supported by our previous success in studying SARS-CoV-2 spike’s RBD down-to-up transition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> we opted to investigate the opening of the HexaPro-SS-Δstalk S2 trimer using the WE path-sampling method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> By running many short (0.1 ns) stochastic MD simulations in parallel, and iteratively replicating trajectories that have explored new regions of configurational space defined by appropriately binned progress coordinates, the WE strategy facilitates atomically detailed sampling of large conformational changes without alteration of the system’s free energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup></p><p id="P10">To enhance sampling of open conformations of the initially closed HexaPro-SS-Δstalk construct, we defined two progress coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>): i) the area of the triangle formed by the Cα atoms of the three P987 residues (one for each protomer) residing at the apex of the CHs, and ii) the RMSD of the CHs with respect to the CHs as in the open conformation. We remark that, at the time of writing, the crystal structure of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk in the open conformation, resolved by McLellan and coworkers and made available beforehand for this study, is currently under review. WE simulations of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk were performed with WESTPA 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and Amber20,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> generating 180 continuous opening pathways across 45 µs of aggregate sampling time (for a complete description of WE simulations see Materials and Methods in the SI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The wealth of atomic-level information provided by these simulations allowed us to characterize the mechanism by which the HexaPro-SS-Δstalk S2-only immunogen adopts a splayed open conformation (Video S1). Starting from a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the initial detachment of chain-A forms an asymmetric, partially open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) until chain-B and chain-C separate to form the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S1</xref>). Notably, asymmetric breathing was also recently reported for influenza HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> In the open conformation, the distances between the P987 residues increase from values close to ∼20 Å (as in the closed conformation) to values in the range of ∼35 to ∼40 Å. Interestingly, we also observed further open conformations where at least one of the trimer’s protomers kept moving further away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The opening pathways were used for analyzing the contacts at the interfacial helices in the closed, partially open, and open conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4-S6</xref>). Using PyContact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, we examined interprotomer residue-residue interactions involving the CHs (residues 978-1030), upper helices (UHs, residues 738-783), and HR1 helices (residues 945-977). S2 trimer opening occurs upon a progressive breakage of interprotomer residue-residue interactions within the CHs from apex to base, following a trend from hydrophilic to hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). A salt bridge between R995 and D994 breaks before the hydrogen bond network consisting of Q1002, Q1005, T1006, and T1009 is broken until the loss of the hydrophobic interactions between L1012 and I1013 leads to the separation of chain-A. As expected, the helices in chain-A did not form strong interactions in the partially open conformations, and interactions throughout the trimer were almost null in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4-S6</xref>). The partially open conformations are characterized by CH<sub>Chain-B</sub> forming an extensive interaction interface with the polar residues along UH<sub>Chain-C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Interestingly, residues V991 and T998 in the CHs did not contribute to stabilizing interprotomer contacts in either the closed or partially open conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). On the contrary, residues D994, R995, and Q1002, which are one or two helical turns away from V991 and T998, form stabilizing interprotomer interactions in both the closed and partially open conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The opening mechanism of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk underscored two residues located in the proximity of the CH apex, V991 and T998, as best candidates for cavity-filling substitutions aimed at improving the stability of the closed conformation.

In a similar way to the base construct, we performed WE simulations of the three HexaPro-SS-Δstalk tryptophan variants to interrogate their stability and, possibly, opening mechanism. Interestingly, each engineered S2 trimer swung away from the initial closed conformation to sample partially open and open conformations. We collected 149, 187 and 195 opening pathways across 35, 47, and 56 µs of aggregate sampling for Hexapro-SS-V991W, Hexapro-SS-T998W, and Hexapro-SS-2W, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Although opening occurred, it is important to note that WE is a path-sampling approach used to enhance the sampling efficiency of conformational transitions that are rarely observed by means of conventional MD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> That is, sampling an open conformation does not itself imply that the closed conformation is unstable; rather, the WE method allowed us to observe a slow dynamic behavior that is physically accessible to the protein.</p><p id="P14">Our WE simulations indicate that trimer opening is impacted by the introduction of the V991W and T998W substitutions. There are differences in the aggregate sampling time to observe the first opening event during WE simulations (i.e., including the time spent in the closed state) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11a</xref>), with Hexapro-SS-T998W and Hexapro-SS-2W requiring an additional ∼6.3 µs and ∼4.9 µs of sampling, respectively, and a corresponding shift toward overall longer molecular times to opening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11b</xref>). This may also suggest more time spent in the closed state. In contrast, Hexapro-SS-V991W necessitates less sampling to open for the first time, approximately ∼1.5 µs less than the base construct. Analysis of opening event durations as a measure of the molecular time required by the system to transition from the closed state to the open state (i.e., excluding the time spent within the closed state), shows a distribution slightly shifted toward longer durations for the three tryptophan variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>), with Hexapro-SS-T998W exhibiting the longer mean duration followed by Hexapro-SS-2W (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). In this regard, no significant differences are observed for Hexapro-SS-V991W with respect to the base construct, suggesting that V991W might not affect the opening kinetics. One advantage of WE simulations is the possibility of estimating kinetics quantities such as rate constants underlying the investigated transition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> In our case, by iteratively reweighting the WE trajectories using the WE Equilibrium Dynamics (WEED)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> protocol within WESTPA 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> to facilitate the convergence of WE simulations toward equilibrium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

We estimated that the opening of the HexaPro-SS-Δstalk S2 trimer occurs on the order of fractions of milliseconds [<italic>k<sub>opening</sub></italic> = (4.5 ± 1.5) × 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>]. Although the rate constant does not significantly change for Hexapro-SS-V991W [<italic>k<sub>opening</sub></italic> = (1.1 ± 0.5) × 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>], it becomes smaller for Hexapro-SS-2W [<italic>k<sub>opening</sub></italic> = (7.0 ± 2.3) × 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>] and Hexapro-SS-T998W [<italic>k<sub>opening</sub></italic> = (3.4 ± 0.1) × 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>], indicating that T998W induces a roughly 10-fold slower trimer opening. V991W alone does not appear to affect opening kinetics. Although we acknowledge that these estimations might be affected by sampling limitations, the calculated values align well with each other and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies reporting similar domain movements of class I fusion glycoproteins occurring in the millisecond-to-second time scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">As previously performed for the base construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), we looked at the interprotomer residue-residue interactions for the tryptophan variants to gain a mechanistic understanding of the impact of V991W and T998W on the opening pathways. As highlighted from the contact heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4-S6</xref>, both V991W and T998W substitutions boost interprotomer interactions in the closed and partially open conformations with respect to the base construct. These interactions promote engagement at the respective substituted positions and the nearby residues located a few helical turns away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The increased interhelix interplay observed in the partially open conformations may underlie the longer opening durations observed in Hexapro-SS-T998W and Hexapro-SS-2W. Interestingly, when only position 991 is substituted to tryptophan (i.e., in Hexapro-SS-V991W), it does not induce slower opening kinetics despite furthering interprotomer engagement. This could be ascribed to the apical position of W991, which is more solvent-exposed than W998 and, in the absence of a partner hydrophobic residue underneath (i.e., W998 in Hexapro-SS-2W), is less kinetically stabilizing than W998.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>V991W and T998W substitutions stabilize S2 in a closed prefusion conformation</title><p id="P16">Beyond characterizing the trimer opening kinetics for the tryptophan variants, we sought to investigate whether V991W and T998W substitutions energetically stabilize HexaPro-SS-Δstalk in the prefusion, closed conformation. Computationally, this can be probed through “alchemical” FEP calculations where an amino acid (i.e., V or T) is gradually morphed into another one (i.e., W) in a set of non-equilibrium MD simulations, both in the context of the folded and unfolded protein (see Material and Methods in the SI for a complete description).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> Relying on the notion that the free energy of a system is a state variable, it is possible to calculate the difference in the free energy of folding (<italic>ΔΔG<sub>mutation-folding</sub></italic>) between the investigated variant and the base construct (HexaPro-SS-Δstalk), as illustrated in the thermodynamic cycle in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>. Here, starting from an equilibrated closed conformation of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk, we performed alchemical FEP calculations to predict the energetic contribution of V991W and/or T998W in the three engineered tryptophan variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>). As a result, in all three cases, the introduced substitutions are stabilizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In ascending order (i.e., from the least to the most stabilizing), calculated <italic>ΔΔG<sub>mutation-folding</sub></italic> for Hexapro-SS-V991W, Hexapro-SS-T998W, and Hexapro-SS-2W, are −2.76 ± 0.11, −8.91 ± 0.26, and −12.18 ± 0.34 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Hence, these independent simulations predicted the double substitution variant, Hexapro-SS-2W, to be the most stable in the closed prefusion conformation.</p><p id="P17">For each system, we extracted all the closed conformations that were sampled during the respective WE simulation, including those that did not result in an opening event. Using this multi-microsecond-long conformational ensemble of closed conformations, we then analyzed interprotomer contacts involving CHs, UHs, and HR1 helices to decipher, at the molecular level, the stabilizing effect imparted by the tryptophan substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S17-S19</xref>). Introducing V991W and T998W into HexaPro-SS-Δstalk directly contributes to novel stabilizing contacts, enhancing electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4b-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S17-S19</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). The tryptophan side chains at positions 991 and 998 self-associate to form π–π hydrophobic clusters at the S2 apex surrounding R995 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). Notably, alongside forming a salt bridge with D994 from the adjacent protomer, the side chain of R995 can also adopt an inward-oriented conformation, where it engages in a π–cation–π stack with W991 and W998 from both the same and neighboring protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S17</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). W998 is sometimes observed to swivel slightly outward, interacting with Y756 and F759 of the same chain and F970 from the adjacent chain. Interestingly, an extensive network of interactions is also preserved in the partially open conformations obtained from the WE simulation, where the presence of intra-protomer π–π and cation–π interactions modulate the orientation of the tryptophans’ sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Most importantly, the extensive network of π–π and cation–π interactions at the S2 apex is absent in the HexaPro-SS-Δstalk base construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S17</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S18</xref>). As these interactions in the closed state are not chain-specific, this suggests that the synergistic residue coordination in the S2 interior can dynamically exchange interactions to stabilize a closed conformation.</p><p id="P18">To experimentally probe the computational predictions, all three tryptophan variants were assessed relative to HexaPro-SS-Δstalk for expression yield in FreeStyle 293F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>) and thermostability through differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In line with the FEP-predicted free energy trend, expression of HexaPro-SS-2W and, to a lesser extent, HexaPro-SS-T998W, led to higher yields than the parent. In addition, the slightly right-shifted peaks of their size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles hint to more compact structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). V991W alone does not significantly improve the expression yield of HexaPro-SS-V991W relative to the base construct. A similar trend is observed from the thermostability profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), where HexaPro-SS-2W exhibits the highest melting temperature relative to the control systems (∼ +6 °C shift), followed by HexaPro-SS-T998W, and HexaPro-SS-V991W.</p><p id="P19">Based on the SEC data that indicated a ∼2-fold increase in purified protein, we attempted to characterize the 3D structures of both HexaPro-SS-T998W (Δstalk) and HexaPro-SS-2W (Δstalk) using cryo-EM. For the former, we did not obtain a high-resolution cryo-EM structure; indeed, the low-resolution 3D ab-initio map shows twisted S2 single protomers (data not shown). On the other hand, for HexaPro-SS-2W we successfully generated a high-resolution cryo-EM map from 1,622 exposures collected on a 200 kV Talos Glacios. The cryo-EM map of the HexaPro-SS-2W was processed with C3 symmetry and DeepEMhancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> sharpening. 2D classes, especially the top-down views, indicate that the closed prefusion conformation is predominant in HexaPro-SS-2W (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>). This result is consistent with FEP calculations and DSF experiments. The structure highlights key residue interactions also observed in the WE simulation, showing a densely packed cluster of hydrophobic residues at the S2 trimer’s apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5e-g</xref>). In this region, an extended network of π–π interactions encompassing W991, W998, Y756, F759, and F970 surrounds an ordered salt bridge (D994–R995) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S21</xref>). Examining the cryo-EM density of each mutation, V991W at the very apex of the S2 trimer shows clear π–π interactions with R995 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). T998W shows clear cryo-EM density of the side chain, filling the cavity in between the CHs of the S2 trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). By stabilizing the S2 trimer’s apex with V991W and T998W, we were also able to resolve the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR, residues 835-857). This region had been challenging to characterize in the full-length spike or HexaPro-SS due to its inherent flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Sera of mice immunized with closed prefusion-stabilized S2-only antigen neutralize rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants</title><p id="P20">The impact of tryptophan substitutions on S2-only antigen immunogenicity was investigated. We immunized mice with the HexaPro-SS and HexaPro-SS-2W antigens (including the stalk region) and assayed the sera for neutralization against recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) bearing the coronavirus spikes of either SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-1 or Omicron BA.1 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S22</xref>).

In contrast, only mice immunized with HexaPro-SS-2W demonstrated a significant increase in the neutralization of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 compared to PBS-immunized sera.

An antibody targeting the RBD of S1 was used as a control (N3-1, manuscript under review). BLI shows that the binding affinity of antibodies that target the stem helix or fusion peptide is not affected in HexaPro-SS-2W when compared to HexaPro-SS. However, binding affinity of the non-neutralizing antibody B3-1 targeting the apex of the S2 trimer as in HexaPro-SS-2W was reduced by half with respect to HexaPro-SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). This indicates that the opening of the S2 apex is important for B3-1 binding. Interestingly, B3-1 binding is not fully abrogated, suggesting that Hexapro-SS-2W may infrequently undergo opening motions as shown from WE simulations. Reducing the binding affinity of the non-neutralizing antibodies targeting S2 may further indicate that closing the S2 trimer with 2W can bias immunization responses towards neutralizing epitopes such as stem helix and fusion peptide as opposed to non-neutralizing epitopes such as the apex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><label>III</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P22">In this work, we present the simulation-driven design of SARS-CoV-2 S2-only antigens stabilized in the closed prefusion conformation. We first used WE path-sampling MD simulations to investigate the conformational plasticity of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk, a prefusion-stabilized S2 construct that exhibits flexibility at the apex, leading to splayed open conformations. We discovered that the prefusion-stabilized S2 trimer transitions from a closed to open conformation through an asymmetric protomer-protomer separation. Contact map analysis of the interfacial helices (CHs, UHs, and HR1) reveals key residue-residue interactions taking place in the opening pathway. To improve interprotomer stabilization, we identified two residues located in the CH apex, V991 and T998, as candidates for cavity-filling substitutions with tryptophan. We next designed three variants of HexaPro-SS-Δstalk incorporating V991W, T998W, and V991W+T998W substitutions, namely HexaPro-SS-V991, HexaPro-SS-T998, and HexaPro-SS-2W. Additional WE simulations of the three newly engineered S2 variants showed that T998W and V991W+T998W provide kinetic stabilization by slowing down the S2 trimer opening. Subsequent FEP calculations revealed a negative <italic>ΔΔG<sub>mutation-folding</sub></italic> imparted by the tryptophan substitutions, evincing increased stability of the closed prefusion conformation for all three S2-engineered variants, with HexaPro-SS-2W exhibiting superior stability. Strikingly, cellular expression and thermostability characterization of the newly stabilized S2 constructs confirmed the computational predictions, showing higher expression yields and melting temperatures for the three tryptophan variants, with HexaPro-SS-2W surpassing all the other constructs. The improved stability of HexaPro-SS-2W allowed the high-resolution characterization of its closed prefusion structure via cryo-EM. The resolved cryo-EM structure highlights key residue interactions also observed in our WE simulations. Importantly, immunogenicity assays on sera from mice immunized with HexaPro-SS-2W demonstrated that this stabilized S2-only antigen can neutralize different rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants. Protection data will further illuminate the potential of the HexaPro-SS-2W antigen as a vaccine candidate.</p><p id="P23">These studies underscore the advantage of using dynamic information from molecular simulations to inform immunogen design. Static-structure methods depend on energetic calculations of protein structures in cryogenic conditions or rely on the structural homology of proteins with minor conformational variance. In contrast, our simulations capture dynamic information from an ensemble of conformations at reproduced physiological conditions. In addition, mechanistic insights from protein dynamics could drive vaccine design efforts to neutralize challenging and elusive clinical targets. The computational approach used here enabled the design of novel, highly stable SARS-CoV-2 S2-only immunogens that could serve as the structural basis for future pan-coronavirus vaccine development efforts and may be generally applicable to structure-based vaccine design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190208-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d138aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190208-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d138aAdDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S8" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P24">Trajectories of S2 trimer opening pathways, WE configuration files, and representative closed prefusion conformations of HexaPro-SS-2W are included in the article as supplementary information data.
