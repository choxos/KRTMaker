<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is an enteric pathogen that is a prominent cause of diarrheal disease. Control of this infection requires CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, though the processes that lead to T cell-mediated resistance have been difficult to assess. Here, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites that express MHCII-restricted model antigens were generated to dissect the early events that influence CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and effector function. These studies highlight that parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are primed in the draining mesenteric lymph node (mesLN) and differentiate into Th1 cells in the gut, where they mediate IFN-γ-dependent control of the infection. Although type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) were not required for initial priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, cDC1s were required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion and gut homing. cDC1s were also a major source of IL-12 that was not required for priming but promoted full differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and local production of IFN-γ. Together, these studies reveal distinct roles for cDC1s in shaping CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to enteric infection: first to drive early expansion in the mesLN and second to drive effector responses in the gut.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) located in peripheral and lymphatic tissues that serve as an intermediary between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Relevant DC functions include the ability to detect microbial ligands and danger signals, which can lead to cDC production of cytokines, up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, and MHC-restricted presentation of peptide antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). cDCs can be defined based on developmental origin as either type 1 (cDC1) or type 2 (cDC2), where cDC1s rely on the transcription factors BATF3 and IRF8 for development and are specialized to cross-present antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast cDC2s rely on the transcription factor IRF4 and prime CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This division of labor is based in part on early studies where cDC2s were shown to be superior at MHCII presentation of soluble ovalbumin (OVA) or OVA complexed to antibodies targeting DC surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, there are examples that do not easily fit this paradigm that include the presentation of cell-associated antigens derived from tumors or intracellular infections that drive Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Thus, studies have reported poorer MHCII antigen presentation by cDC2s when compared to cDC1s in these contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Indeed, cDC1s express MHCII and are also known to produce cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-27 that can promote Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The rules that govern this division of labor and how they relate to different infections with tropisms for diverse host cell populations is not well defined.</p><p id="P3">In the gut, cDC1s and cDC2s have been shown to have distinct roles in the regulation of inflammatory and tolerogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> responses. For example, cDC1s can cross-present epithelial-derived antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, provide signals necessary for maintenance of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and maintain homeostatic Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Conversely, cDC2s are necessary for induction of anti-helminth Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and Th17 responses during homeostasis and against fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Additionally, unique populations of APCs exist in the gut associated with the development of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), whose role in infection-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> responses remains poorly understood. The presence of these diverse APC subsets and their distinct functions likely reflects the need for the intestine to regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell functions to respond to diverse microbial challenges while being able to maintain tolerance. It is therefore critical to understand how responses to enteric pathogens are regulated in order to respond to the infectious challenge appropriately.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species are important causes of diarrheal illness globally and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Fecal-oral transmission of these parasites causes self-limited disease in immunocompetent individuals, which can be life-threatening in the immunocompromised host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> displays a strict tropism for intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), however unlike several model intestinal pathogens (such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>, and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>), <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> does not breach the epithelial barrier and completes its entire lifecycle within the small intestine of a single host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). It is well-established that mice deficient in IL-12p40 or IFN-γ are highly susceptible to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, in part because these cytokines can drive innate lymphoid cell (ILC) production of IFN-γ to promote early resistance to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). However, long-term control of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is dependent on T cells, and mice and humans with primary and acquired defects in T cell function can fail to clear the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Thus, multiple studies have highlighted that CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 responses are important for resistance to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Recent work has shown that type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are a source of IL-12 that promotes Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> responses to mediate resistance to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). However, the ability to define the processes that promote CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses relevant to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has been hampered by a paucity of reagents to distinguish T cell responses to the pathogen from those activated T cells that exist in the gut at homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In order to understand the development of parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and how these promote control of <italic>Cryptosporidium,</italic> transgenic parasites were engineered to express different peptide MHCII-restricted model antigens. The use of these parasite strains revealed that while <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are primed in the mesenteric lymph node (mesLN), they only acquire full Th1 features such as T-bet and IFN-γ expression after trafficking to the gut. While cDC1s were a major source of IL-12 that is important for the generation of Th1 responses and were required for expansion and gut-homing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, IL-12p40 only drove local IFN-γ production and retention of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the gut but not early processes. These studies indicate that cDC1s provide IL-12p40-independent functions in the mesLN and -dependent functions in the gut to promote local protective CD4+ T cell responses against an enteric pathogen. Together, these studies reveal distinct roles for cDC1s in shaping CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to enteric infection: first to drive early expansion in the mesLN and second to drive effector responses in the gut.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Engineering <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> to express MHCII-restricted model antigens</title><p id="P6">We have recently engineered transgenic <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> to express the MHCI-restricted epitope SIINFEKL at the C-terminus of the parasite effector MEDLE2 (which is secreted into the host cell cytoplasm during the intracellular stages of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>)) to track parasite-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (43 Preprint). A similar approach was adopted to analyze CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses by engineering transgenic <italic>C. parvum</italic> (<italic>Cp</italic>) to express a neomycin resistance marker and nanoluciferase (nluc) to measure fecal oocyst shedding, as well as the fluorescent protein mNeon in the parasite cytoplasm. These parasites were also modified to express either the 2W1S or the LCMV-gp<sub>61-80</sub> (gp61) MHCII-restricted epitopes in combination with hemagglutinin (HA) as small peptide tags attached to the C-terminus of MEDLE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 1a</xref>). B6 mice possess a high precursor frequency of 2W1S-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), while the gp61 peptide is the target of TCR-transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from SMARTA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). To assess localization of the transgenic <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> proteins, HCT8 cells were infected with either <italic>Cp</italic>-2W1S or <italic>Cp</italic>-gp61 and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to detect the HA epitope. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>, for both constructs, the expression of mNeon (arrowed, green) provided the ability to distinguish infected from uninfected cells, while staining for HA (red) revealed that secretion of the transgenic proteins was restricted to the cytosol of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To determine if these different parasite strains could stimulate endogenous 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses or adoptively-transferred CD45.1<sup>+</sup> SMARTA T cells, initial studies were performed in <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to permit robust <italic>Cp</italic> replication. In uninfected <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> and SMARTA T cells (20,000 transferred) were not detected in the draining mesenteric lymph node (mesLN), the small intestine lamina propria (SILP), or the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment (IEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c-d</xref>). In contrast, at 10 days post infection (dpi) <italic>Cp-</italic>2W1S was associated with the emergence of 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells but did not result in bystander activation of the SMARTA T cells. In contrast, infection with <italic>Cp-</italic>gp61 led to expansion of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> SMARTA T cells but not the 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c-d</xref>). These datasets establish that these parasite-derived MHCII-restricted model antigens lead to the antigen-specific activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Cryptosporidium-</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IFN-γ locally in the gut to control infection</title><p id="P8">Since T cell-mediated resistance to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is associated with the production of IFN-γ, studies were performed to determine whether the response to these model antigens reflected the natural response to this pathogen. Therefore, mice in which the gene for the surface-expressed protein CD90.1 is under the control of the <italic>Ifng</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) were infected with <italic>Cp-</italic>2W1S. In WT mice infected with <italic>Cp</italic>-2W1S, it was difficult to reliably detect 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, reflecting the inability of <italic>Cp</italic> to robustly infect immune competent WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a-b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Blockade of IFN-γ during infection allowed for increased parasite burden and more reliable detection of 2W1S-tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells at 10 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a-b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In the absence of infection or without anti-IFN-γ treatment, few CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the mesLN, SILP, or IEL expressed IFN-γ (CD90.1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 2a</xref>). In infected mice, when IFN-γ was blocked few (&lt;5%) cells in the mesLN were CD90.1<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 2a</xref>). In the SILP, there was minimal production of IFN-γ by the polyclonal populations, but ∼25-50% of tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells were CD90.1<sup>+</sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c-d</xref>). In contrast, in the IEL, ∼50-75% of tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells were CD90.1<sup>+</sup>, with similar percentages in polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> IELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Likewise, SMARTA T cells were isolated from the mesLN and SILP of WT mice infected with gp61-expressing parasites, stimulated with gp61 peptide <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and subjected to intracellular staining for IFN-γ. A cohort of mice was treated with anti-IFN-γ during infection to increase parasite burden. Regardless of anti-IFN-γ treatment, few SMARTA T cells in the mesLN produced IFN-γ after peptide restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 2b</xref>). Among SILP SMARTA T cells from untreated mice, &lt;5% of cells produced IFN-γ, whereas 20-30% of SMARTAs from anti-IFN-γ-treated IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>). IFN-γ production could also be detected in IFN-γ reporter SILP but not mesLN SMARTA T cells that expressed CD90.1 under the control of the <italic>Ifng</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). These data collectively indicate that the ability of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce IFN-γ (even during restimulation with exogenous peptide) is restricted to the SILP and IEL and does not occur in the mesLN.</p><p id="P10">In order to determine whether SMARTA CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived IFN-γ is protective, <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were infected with <italic>Cp-</italic>gp61. One day prior to infection, a cohort received 10<sup>6</sup> IFN-γ-sufficient at CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T cells. In <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice that did not receive T cells, infection peaked at ∼d9 and oocyst shedding subsequently decreased though mice remained chronically infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). In mice that received IFN-γ-sufficient SMARTA T cells, infection also peaked at ∼d9, but oocyst shedding dropped faster and fell below the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). This protective effect of the SMARTA T cells was abolished in mice treated with anti-IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). These datasets highlight the utility of this transgenic system and reveal a protective effect for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived IFN-γ whose production is limited to the gut.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells express distinct activation states associated with Th1 responses and mucosal tissue residency</title><p id="P11">Next, WT mice were utilized to study CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in an immune-competent setting. Because conventional <italic>Cp</italic> does not readily infect WT mice, a mouse-adapted strain of mCherry-expressing <italic>C. parvum</italic> (ma<italic>Cp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) was engineered to express model antigens. As the ma<italic>Cp</italic> strain was previously engineered with neomycin resistance to drive mCherry and nluc expression, a second marker was introduced to confer resistance to the recently-described bicyclic azetidine BRD7929 that targets <italic>Cp</italic> phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (pheRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Hence, the <italic>Cp</italic> pheRS locus was modified to alter leucine at position 482 to valine, conferring resistance to BRD7929 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Model-antigen-tagged MEDLE2 was introduced under the <italic>Cp</italic>-<italic>enolase</italic> promotor immediately following the transgenic pheRS<sup>R</sup>, such that BRD7929-resistant parasites (ma<italic>Cp</italic>-ova-gp61) would express ectopic MEDLE2-SIINFEKL-gp61 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3a-b</xref>). Infection of WT mice with ma<italic>Cp</italic>-ova-gp61 combined with adoptive transfer of SMARTA T cells and high-parameter flow cytometry provided the opportunity to compare polyclonal and parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in WT mice. This comparison allowed for assessment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expression of transcription factors (TFs) for Th lineages (T-bet for Th1, RORγΤ for Th17, and Foxp3 for Treg) and surface markers associated with Th1 cells (CXCR3, SLAM, IL-18Ra), antigen-experience/activation (CD44, CD69, CD40L, Ly6A/E), and mucosal association (LPAM-1, CD103). UMAP projection of aggregated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from all tissues (SMARTAs and non-SMARTAs from the mesLN, SILP, and IEL) and conditions (uninfected and infected) was performed. A comparison of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by tissue highlighted that mesLN and IEL CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells occupied distinct regions in UMAP space while those in the SILP resembled both the mesLN and IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). When X-Shift unbiased clustering analysis of the aggregated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was performed, 11 clusters were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3c</xref>). Cluster 1 consisted mainly of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the mesLN that were LPAM-1-hi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3e</xref>). Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could be identified by high T-bet expression in clusters 2-7, while Th17 associated with RORγT expression was limited to cluster 8, and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs could be found in clusters 9-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3e</xref>). Further analysis of the T-bet<sup>+</sup> clusters showed that the majority of clusters 3-6 was composed of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the SILP and IEL of infected mice that increased in frequency during <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Because SMARTA T cells were only detected in these tissues during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b-c</xref>), this provided an opportunity to compare the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-induced SMARTA CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to polyclonal responses. In UMAP space, SMARTA T cells fell into a CD44-hi region near highly activated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3f-h</xref>). However, the majority of SMARTA T cells were present in T-bet<sup>+</sup> clusters and were most represented in clusters 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref>). Cluster 4 was CD103<sup>+</sup> while cluster 5 was associated with high levels of IL-18Ra, SLAM, and the activation marker Ly6A/E. Across all T-bet<sup>+</sup> clusters, CD103 and Ly6A/E were inversely correlated and cells occupied different regions in UMAP space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b, f</xref>).</p><p id="P13">This analysis indicates that the infection-induced activation of the SMARTA T cells mirrors the processes associated with the endogenous polyclonal responses. Therefore, this system described above was used to understand how SMARTA T cell expression of lineage-defining transcription factors (TFs; T-bet, GATA3, RORγΤ, Foxp3) and Tfh markers (Bcl-6, PD-1, CXCR5) varied across tissues. In the mesLN of uninfected mice the majority (&gt;80%) of (non-SMARTA) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed no lineage-defining TFs (T-bet<sup>-</sup>GATA3<sup>-</sup>RORγΤ<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>; henceforth referred to as TF<sup>-</sup>), and therefore appeared uncommitted to any one Th subset. At 10 dpi, despite an increased number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the mesLN, the majority (∼80%) of polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in this tissue remained TF<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 4a-b</xref>). However, all SMARTA T cells in the mesLN of infected mice were antigen experienced (∼100% CD44<sup>+</sup>) and ∼30-40% were T-bet<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In the SILP of uninfected mice, distinct Treg (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>), Th17 (RORγT<sup>+</sup>), and Th1 (T-bet<sup>+</sup>) populations could be identified, although 60% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells here were TF<sup>-</sup> and no Th2 cells (GATA3<sup>+</sup>) could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 4a-b</xref>). While infection did not lead to a significant change in the percentage of SILP polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were TF<sup>-</sup>, ∼40% of SMARTA T cells were T-bet<sup>+</sup> compared to ∼20% of the polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>). In the IEL of uninfected mice, 60% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were TF<sup>-</sup> (similar to the mesLN and SILP) but, after infection the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were TF<sup>-</sup> in the IEL decreased to &lt;20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the number and relative percentage of T-bet<sup>+</sup> Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 4a</xref>). Similarly, &gt;75% of SMARTA T cells in the IEL expressed T-bet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>) and also expressed IL-18Ra, SLAM, CXCR3, Ly6A/E and CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig 4d-e</xref>).

Mice were sacrificed at 10 dpi and expression of CD90.1 and IL-18Ra on SMARTA T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. In control mice roughly ∼40% of SMARTA T cells in the SILP and ∼60% of SMARTA T cells in the IEL were CD90.1<sup>+</sup>, and treatment with anti-IL-18 did not alter these responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7h-i</xref>).

These data suggest that IL-12p40 is not required for initial priming, expansion and gut-homing of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but is required for their accumulation in the gut and local expression of T-bet, IL-18Ra, and production of IFN-γ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Although it has been accepted for several decades that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for clearance of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), there are many fundamental questions about how these protective lymphocytes are generated and mediate resistance to this common enteric infection. The absence of well characterized endogenous MHCII-restricted <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> antigens has made it a challenge to distinguish parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from the many T cells in the gut that possess an “activated but resting” phenotype at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). To overcome these obstacles, we took advantage of the recent development of parasite transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) to engineer <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> to express MHCII-restricted model antigens. When combined with MHCII-tetramers and SMARTA TCR transgenic T cells these parasites allowed for the identification of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have responded to <italic>Cryptosporidum</italic>-derived antigens. In accord with current models, these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> were dominated by the production of IFN-γ in the gut that was sufficient to mediate parasite clearance. This tool set also allowed us to study the initial priming of these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and unexpectedly highlighted that recently activated SMARTA T cells in the mesLN were unable to make IFN-γ and only acquired the ability to produce IFN-γ in the SILP and IEL, which was associated with expression of T-bet. While cDC1s were not required for initial priming of the SMARTA CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, these accessory cells did have a dual role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses: first in the mesLN to drive early expansion and gut homing, and later, at the site of infection where cDC1 production of IL-12p40 stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell IFN-γ production, T-bet expression, and tissue retention. Thus, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are primed in the mesLN but require signals within the gut—including IL-12p40—to achieve full effector capacity.</p><p id="P19">In other systems, early IL-12 has been shown to be important in the initial development of Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), but whether it is needed at later time points for Th1 effector responses depends on the experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). One possible explanation that might influence the degree of Th1 commitment in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after priming is whether the pathogen is restricted to a barrier site like the gut, skin, or lungs, or is one that disseminates more widely. For systemic pathogens like <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, parasite dissemination leads to the early presence of parasites in lymphoid tissues and local production of IL-12 that results in the rapid commitment to the Th1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). When this occurs following oral infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, these heightened CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses can result in an IFN-γ-mediated lethal ileitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). For <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, there is no evidence of immunopathology mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and perhaps a lack of commitment to a Th1 effector program during priming ensures that parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide highly localized production of IFN-γ and thereby mitigate IFN-γ-mediated immunopathology. This is similar to the concept that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell plasticity allows them to respond to contextual signals to tailor their function to the different infection. Indicative of this plasticity, influenza-specific Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> Trm in the lung exposed to Th2-inducing signals will down-regulate T-bet and IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), while the ability of conventional Th1 cells to become cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during primary infection in the lung requires local antigen presentation and exposure to IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Since the original description of cDC1 and the availability of mice that lack this subset, they have been prominently linked to cross presentation and the production of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). The studies presented here indicate that while cDC1 are not required for the initial priming of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells they provide secondary signals required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, gut homing, and expression of Th1 factors like T-bet and IFN-γ. Similarly, a recent report highlighted that <italic>Irf8+32<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice infected with <italic>Cryptosporidium tyzzeri</italic> develop parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses but these are T-bet deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). However, unlike the present study, these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations can access the SILP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This different requirement of cDC1 for homing and retention may reflect species differences (<italic>C. parvum</italic> is adapted to humans and cattle and <italic>C. tyzzeri</italic> causes persistent infection in mice) but for both species, cDC1s have a profound influence on the process that generate protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the gut. Given the importance of cDC1-derived IL-12 in the development of Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>), it was an initial surprise that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the absence of IL-12p40 did not phenocopy those from <italic>Irf8+32<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. This difference underscores IL-12-independent functions for cDC1s to support CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the gut. One plausible mechanism is the ability of gut-associated CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1s to produce retinoic acid that promotes expression of the gut homing integrins that drive T cell recruitment to the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In addition, the CD40-CD40L interaction is an important pathway for the control of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), which has a prominent role in DC licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) and in the mesLN can promote cDC1 IL-27 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). The observation that IL-27 is required shortly after weaning for the priming of Th1 cells and their accumulation in the SILP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) suggest that this factor may also be relevant to the ability of cDC1 to promote Th1 responses to a mucosal pathogen.</p><p id="P21">Because <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is restricted to IECs and does not infect professional APCs, there are basic questions about how parasite-derived antigens gain access to the mLN and whether APCs at the site of infection can acquire parasite antigens and support local CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Interestingly, IECs can express MHCII, and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8αα IELs within the gut requires MHCII expression on IECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). During <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection, IFN-γ signaling on IECs leads to higher MHCII and CIITA expression (32,73 Preprint), which may facilitate the ability of IECs to engage effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the IEL. Alternatively, during murine adenovirus (AdV) infection, viral specific effector Ly6A<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells acquire “innate-like” functions in the gut and can produce IFN-γ after exposure to IL-12 plus IL-18 without TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).

Rather, IL-12 appears to be a dominant signal three required for these protective responses, but whether this depends on local TCR signals remains to be determined.</p><p id="P22">While the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is characterized by a dominant Th1 phenotype, there is also the presence of a small population of Th17 cells, that is perhaps most apparent in the <italic>Irf8+32<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice infected with <italic>C. tyzzeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Likewise, in the studies presented here a small percentage of SMARTA T cells were RORγT<sup>+</sup> but there is little appreciation of the role of Th17 associated cytokines (IL-17, IL-22, GM-CSF) in resistance to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>).
