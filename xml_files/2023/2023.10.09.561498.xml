To date, no method exists that is able to identify proteins that interact with specific regions within endogenous RNAs in live cells. Here, we develop SHIFTR (<underline>S</underline>elective RNase <underline>H</underline>-mediated <underline>i</underline>nteractome <underline>f</underline>raming for <underline>t</underline>arget RNA <underline>r</underline>egions), an efficient and scalable approach to identify proteins bound to selected regions within endogenous RNAs using mass spectrometry. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, SHIFTR is superior in accuracy, captures close to zero background interactions and requires orders of magnitude lower input material. We establish SHIFTR workflows for targeting RNA classes of different length and abundance, including short and long non-coding RNAs, as well as mRNAs and demonstrate that SHIFTR is compatible with sequentially mapping interactomes for multiple target RNAs in a single experiment. Using SHIFTR, we comprehensively identify interactions of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements located at the 5′ and 3′-terminal regions of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected cells and accurately recover known and novel interactions linked to the function of these viral RNA elements. SHIFTR enables the systematic mapping of region-resolved RNA interactomes for any RNA in any cell type and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of transcriptomes and their regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">RNA carries out a plethora of functions in the cell, ranging from encoding genetic information and serving as a template for protein synthesis to dynamically regulating gene expression and controlling cellular pathways and programs. Virtually all RNA-based processes in a cell rely on interactions with specific proteins or protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), therefore the identification of proteins that are directly bound to a target RNA can provide valuable insights into RNA function and regulation. Biochemical strategies to identify and map interactions between protein and RNA in intact cells can be divided into protein and RNA-centric approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Among protein-centric approaches, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) combined with next-generation sequencing is the most widely used technique to globally map interaction sites of a single protein of interest across the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). CLIP utilizes UV-crosslinking to stabilize interactions occurring in intact cells prior to cell lysis. Since UV-crosslinking creates covalent bonds between RNA and protein, denaturing purification strategies can be employed to minimize background interactions occurring in cells or after cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). UV-crosslinking selectively links protein and RNA that are in direct contact, but does not efficiently crosslink indirect interactors or other biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This is an advantage compared to more efficient chemical crosslinking strategies that have broad reactivities and covalently link DNA, protein and RNA, which results in the stabilization of indirect interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). While CLIP is a powerful technique for characterizing the binding preferences of individual proteins, this approach cannot reveal the collection of proteins or protein complexes that interact with a specific endogenous RNA in intact cells. To overcome this limitation, RNA-centric interactome capture techniques were developed. Unlike protein-centric approaches that rely on the purification of individual proteins, RNA-centric methods utilize immobilized oligonucleotides that hybridize to target RNAs and enable the capture and identification of bound proteins by mass spectrometry. The first implementation of RNA interactome capture employed oligo(dT) beads to purify all polyadenylated cellular RNAs and identify proteins directly bound to mRNAs and other polyadenylated RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). More recently, organic phase separation strategies have been developed to globally capture RNA-protein complexes independent of shared sequence features, such as the poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). These methods rely on the denaturation of proteins and macromolecular complexes by guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol, followed by organic phase separation, which leads to the accumulation of RNA in the aqueous phase, while proteins accumulate in the organic phase. Unlike free RNA and free protein that separate according to their physicochemical properties during organic phase separation, covalently linked RNA-protein complexes formed as a result of UV-irradiation prior to cell lysis, cannot partition to either phase and instead accumulate in the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Extraction of RNA-bound proteins from UV-crosslinked interfaces after organic phase separation, followed by their identification by mass spectrometry has substantially expanded the number of known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">While the aforementioned methods are powerful tools for identifying proteins bound to all cellular RNAs, they do not reveal which proteins are bound to a specific RNA. To this end, various methods that use sequence-specific oligonucleotides designed to hybridize and capture a single endogenous target RNA species have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Despite being technically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), these approaches have been successfully used to characterize the RNA interactomes of several abundantly expressed short and long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), yielding important insights into their biological function. In particular, RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) proved to be an effective tool for revealing interactomes of several different RNA types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). With the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RAP-MS and similar methods have also been adapted to capture and identify the proteome of host and virus that interacts with viral RNA in cells undergoing live infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P4">A key limitation of virtually all methods aimed at isolating individual endogenous RNAs and their directly bound proteins is the need to generate large amounts of input material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). This is due to limited crosslinking efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), incomplete RNA capture and the fact that the median mRNA copy number (∼17 per mammalian cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)) is orders of magnitude below the median protein copy number (∼50.000 per mammalian cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)), which drastically limits the amount of protein that can be purified from each cell with RNA-based capture strategies. For these reasons only highly abundant cellular RNAs have been amenable to RNA-centric interactome capture methods. Furthermore, a large number of background proteins are usually detected with RNA capture methods that target individual RNAs, impeding the selection of candidate proteins for follow-up studies. Finally, an important limitation inherent to all RNA capture approaches available to date is that proteins bound to a specific region within a larger endogenous RNA molecule cannot be identified. While capture probes can be designed to isolate a specific RNA molecule under endogenous conditions, unwanted RNA regions within this RNA molecule cannot be removed prior to protein identification without genetic engineering. Hence, the binding pattern of proteins identified with RNA capture-based strategies need to be investigated with protein-centric approaches, such as CLIP, on a one-by-one basis in follow-up studies. This is particularly limiting when <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions within an RNA molecule, such as 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) in mRNAs and their dynamic regulation by <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are investigated. Beyond host-encoded RNAs, the genomes of RNA viruses are particularly rich in regulatory RNA elements, such as 5′ UTRs or leader sequences, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), frameshifting elements, pseudoknots, or 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). To date, there is no method available that allows the comprehensive and unbiased mapping of region-resolved interactions between defined <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in endogenous RNAs and the cellular proteome.</p><p id="P5">To overcome these limitations, we developed SHIFTR (<underline>S</underline>elective RNase <underline>H</underline>-mediated <underline>i</underline>nteractome <underline>f</underline>raming for <underline>t</underline>arget RNA <underline>r</underline>egions), a scalable and easy to implement low-cost approach to comprehensively identify the protein interactomes of individual endogenous RNAs or RNA elements in an unbiased fashion. SHIFTR takes advantage of recent technological breakthroughs that employ organic phase separation to globally isolate crosslinked RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Harnessing this principle, we extract UV-crosslinked RNA-protein complexes from interfaces after organic phase separation and use sequence-specific DNA probes together with RNase H to digest individual target RNAs. This results in a shift of proteins that were crosslinked to the target RNA to the organic phase. Combining SHIFTR with tandem mass tagging (TMT)-based quantitative mass spectrometry, we demonstrate the accurate and near comprehensive capture of the U1 and 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Comparing SHIFTR to RAP-MS for both snRNP complexes, we find that SHIFTR is superior in accurately capturing known RNP components, delivers vastly reduced background levels and requires orders of magnitude lower starting material. We establish SHIFTR workflows for targeting RNA classes of different length and abundance, including mRNAs and lncRNAs and demonstrate that SHIFTR is compatible with sequentially capturing interactomes for multiple endogenous target RNAs in a single experiment. Finally, we use SHIFTR to capture the RNA interactomes of functionally important sequence regions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected human cells. We comprehensively map direct interactions between the proteome of the host cell and the authentic SARS-CoV-2 5′ leader as well as the viral 3′ UTR in cells undergoing live infection. Moreover, we complement these data with interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome (ORF1ab), as well as its subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) and compare the performance of SHIFTR to RAP-MS for these sequence regions. Using SHIFTR, we observe both known and novel interactions linked to the function of each targeted sequence region in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. We validate interactions observed with SHIFTR at nucleotide resolution using eCLIP and find that SHIFTR uncovers binding preferences for host and viral proteins that are instructive for decoding regulatory mechanisms. Our results establish SHIFTR as a powerful new platform for region-specific RNA interactome discovery that is highly scalable, easy to implement, cost effective and yields superior near comprehensive interactome data at minimal background levels.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An organic phase separation-based strategy to define interactomes of individual RNAs</title><p id="P6">To overcome limitations of current RNA interactome capture methods, we aimed to combine the highly effective and sequence-independent isolation of RNA-protein complexes by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (AGPC) extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) with a strategy to identify proteins bound to specific RNAs or RNA regions of interest. During AGPC-based organic phase extraction of UV-crosslinked cells, covalently linked RNA-protein complexes accumulate in the interface since their physiochemical properties are incompatible with partitioning to the aqueous or organic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Hence, the interface accumulation of covalently linked protein-RNA complexes depends on the presence of both an RNA and a protein component. We reasoned that the selective degradation of the RNA component would release bound proteins and lead to their shift to the organic phase in a subsequent phase separation step. Proteins shifted to the organic phase upon RNA degradation can readily be extracted and identified by state-of-the-art quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Suitable strategies to deplete RNAs or RNA regions of interest in a sequence-dependent manner include the use of specific DNA probes that hybridize to a target RNA and form RNA-DNA hybrids amenable to degradation by RNase H. We refer to this experimental strategy as SHIFTR (<underline>S</underline>elective RNase <underline>H</underline>-mediated <underline>i</underline>nteractome <underline>f</underline>raming for <underline>t</underline>arget RNA <underline>r</underline>egions).</p><p id="P7">The first step to performing SHIFTR for an RNA of interest, is the design of a specific set of DNA probes for RNase H-mediated target RNA degradation. To facilitate the design of a large number of DNA probes, we developed Probe-SHIFTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AlexGa/ProbeSHIFTR">https://github.com/AlexGa/ProbeSHIFTR</ext-link>), a highly versatile computational tool to design, filter and select an optimized probe set for SHIFTR experiments in any species of interest. In brief, Probe-SHIFTR extracts each possible k-mer for a given target RNA and filters sequences containing stretches of polybases, repeat regions, or low complexity regions. The remaining k-mers are filtered based on sequence homology to regions in the target genome or transcriptome using BLAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). All filtering parameters are fully customizable. Using a greedy algorithm, Probe-SHIFTR creates multiple non-overlapping k-mer designs with minimal intra-target distances between probes. To evaluate the different probe designs, Probe-SHIFTR generates summary graphics providing information about the coverage of the target RNA region, gaps between probes, and mismatch analyses for each probe set.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Optimization of RNase H-mediated target RNA degradation</title><p id="P8">To establish suitable conditions for the sequence-specific cleavage of target RNA-DNA hybrids by RNase H digestion, we <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed the U1 RNA and synthesized a set of DNA oligonucleotides designed with Probe-SHIFTR to target different regions of U1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S1A</xref>). We used probes of 25 nucleotides in length to allow for the targeting of short sequence regions, while maintaining specificity and duplex stability. Degradation of U1 was dependent on the addition of both U1-targeting DNA probes and the RNase H enzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S1A</xref>). When using individual probes, we observed RNA cleavage patterns consistent with the specific degradation of only the sequence regions targeted directly by the indicated DNA probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1A</xref>). Complete degradation of the U1 RNA was achieved when using a non-overlapping probe set tiling the entire U1 RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1A</xref>). Since RNA extracted from UV-crosslinked cells may be less accessible for probe hybridization due to the co-purification of directly or indirectly bound proteins, we evaluated the impact of various ionic and non-ionic detergents as well as chaotropic agents that can disrupt non-covalent protein interactions on the efficiency of RNase H cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S1B, C</xref>). Detergents that did not impair RNase H activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, were subsequently tested with interfaces extracted from UV-crosslinked Huh-7 cells after organic phase separation. We observed improved depletion of the U1 RNA when adding a combination of 3 non-ionic detergents, while ionic detergents and chaotropic agents reduced the efficiency of U1 depletion, as estimated by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1D</xref>). Hence, we selected the non-ionic detergent-supplemented buffer system to help improve the solubility and accessibility of extracted cellular RNA-protein complexes and achieve optimal protein release. To further maximize the efficiency of target RNA digestion, we used different concentrations of DNA probes and evaluated the efficiency of U1 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1E</xref>). We observed the highest U1 depletion with a concentration of 5 μM, with no considerable unspecific degradation of other RNA targets, such as 7SK.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pre-treatment of UV-crosslinked cells enhances RNA interactome capture by SHIFTR</title><p id="P9">Next, we optimized the purification of UV-crosslinked RNA-protein complexes from living cells by AGPC extraction. While the clean purification of interfaces is a crucial step in this workflow, prior work already indicated that the co-purification of DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), as well as membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and glycosylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) by organic phase extraction can result in the enrichment of irrelevant proteins. Additionally, the high complexity of UV-crosslinked cell pellets directly subjected to organic phase extraction may interfere with the clean partitioning of RNA-protein complexes in interfaces and hinder efficient RNA digestion as well as protein release. We speculated that an additional clearance and purification procedure may enhance the sequence-specific release of proteins bound by target RNA sequences from interfaces after organic phase extraction. We subjected cells to detergent-based lysis followed by a DNase treatment to remove contaminating DNA and a centrifugation step to remove membranes and cell debris (Methods). We selected the well-characterized small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) U1 and 7SK for proof-of-principle experiments and compared the effective capture of known protein components with and without subjecting UV-crosslinked cells to the described pre-clearance and DNase treatment. We first confirmed the specific depletion of target RNAs after interface extraction and RNase H cleavage by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1F</xref>). Next, we performed western blot analysis and observed specific enrichment of known components of the U1 and 7SK complexes in the respective SHIFTR experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1G</xref>). To minimize the isolation of background proteins, we extracted UV-crosslinked interfaces and performed up to four consecutive organic phase separations while monitoring the isolation of background as well as U1 target proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1H</xref>, little free background protein was detected in the organic phase after 3-4 phase separations. At the same time the specific release of the U1 interacting protein SNRNP70 was not negatively impacted by multiple successive organic phase extractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1I</xref>). To confirm the effective solubilization of intact total RNA and assess whether the pre-clearance and DNase step has any impact on RNA quality, we released crosslinked RNA from interfaces by proteinase K treatment and analyzed RNA integrity by capillary electrophoresis. We noted that in the absence of UV crosslinking interfaces from pre-cleared cell pellets contained less contaminating RNA. In UV-crosslinked samples, the 28S rRNA peak appeared slightly more degraded when pre-clearing was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1K</xref>). In contrast, the 18S rRNA peak did not show any sign of enhanced degradation with pre-clearing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1K</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To quantitatively compare the specific enrichment of known U1 and 7SK components in SHIFTR experiments with or without the described pre-clearance and DNase treatment, we performed quantitative TMT-based mass spectrometry analyses. We used 10 million UV-crosslinked Huh-7 cells for each SHIFTR experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-C</xref>, the combined pre-clearing and DNase treatment substantially improved the recovery of known U1 and 7SK proteins with 4 components of the U1 snRNP complex (SNRNP70, SNRPG, SNRPA, SNRPD2) and 3 known 7SK components (LARP7, MEPCE, CDK9) displaying a statistically significant enrichment. Beyond the known components of the U1 snRNP, we found only one other protein among significantly enriched candidates in U1 SHIFTR experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Importantly, this protein (SF3A1) was previously shown to directly bind the stem-loop 4 (SL4) of U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and likely represents a true U1 complex member. In the absence of pre-clearing and DNase treatment, we found only one known U1 component (SNRNP70) and no known 7SK components that met our statistical significance cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Hence, the pre-clearance and DNase treatment substantially improves the recovery of known RNA-protein complexes and appears particularly effective for RNAs less abundant than U1, including the 7SK snRNA, for which no known interactors were found in the absence of pre-clearing.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Thermostable RNase H displays superior specificity and effective on-target protein release in SHIFTR experiments</title><p id="P11">Next, we evaluated the specificity and efficacy of different commercially available RNase H enzymes for releasing RNA-bound proteins in SHIFTR experiments. We focused on RNase H preparations that do not contain bovine serum albumin (BSA) or other protein additives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1J</xref>) and compared thermostable RNase H with standard RNase H from two different vendors. Using standard RNase H, we observed an unexpectedly large number of enriched proteins when targeting the U1 or 7SK snRNAs with specific DNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1L-M</xref>). The majority of these proteins were RBPs unrelated to the U1 or 7SK snRNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), suggesting unspecific and probe-independent RNA degradation with this enzyme preparation. In contrast, thermostable RNase displayed high specificity and selectivity for the targeted RNA-protein complexes, as indicated by the effective release of known U1 and 7SK components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1L-M</xref>). We next performed RNA-sequencing to compare control samples to U1 SHIFTR samples treated with thermostable RNase H and observed multiple U1 gene copies as the only differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1N</xref>). Hence, we used thermostable RNase H for all subsequent experiments. We also tested whether treating RNase H-digested samples with the exoribonuclease Xrn1 to remove residual RNA fragments crosslinked to the released proteins would enhance the shift of known U1 or 7SK complex members to the organic phase, but observed no detectable change by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RNase H-mediated protein release from crosslinked interfaces is superior to RNA antisense purification</title><p id="P12">We next evaluated if the degradation of target RNA sequences by RNase H, which leads to a shift of the released proteins to the organic phase, is more effective than a direct capture of target RNAs from interface extracts using biotinylated DNA antisense probes. To this end, we extracted interfaces from 10 million UV-crosslinked cells and either followed the SHIFTR workflow as described above, or solubilized interfaces in RAP-MS hybridization buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We added pools of biotinylated antisense probes designed to hybridize to the U1 or 7SK snRNAs to the fully solubilized interfaces and followed the previously described RAP-MS protocol for antisense capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We monitored the effective enrichment or depletion of target RNAs by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1P</xref>) and quantitatively analyzed the U1 and 7SK RNA interactomes obtained from interfaces subjected to RAP-MS or SHIFTR workflows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F-G</xref>). While we were able to readily identify known U1 and 7SK complex members using the SHIFTR approach, RNA antisense-mediated purification of U1 and 7SK bound proteins from UV-crosslinked interfaces yielded only a single known complex member (SNRNP70) in the case of U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref>). For the 7SK snRNA, the RNA antisense purification approach did not yield any known complex members among significantly enriched proteins in quantitative mass spectrometry experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Hence, with the scale and experimental setup used, SHIFTR is superior to the combined organic phase separation and RNA antisense purification strategy described above.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>An optimized MS strategy for comprehensive recovery of U1 and 7SK RNA interactomes</title><p id="P13">Following the detailed optimization of the SHIFTR workflow, we set out to improve the comprehensive identification of RNA-bound proteins released from UV-crosslinked interfaces. To this end, we included an offline high pH reverse phase fractionation step prior to sample injection into the mass spectrometer to reduce sample complexity and improve the resolution of obtained mass spectra. As expected, this increased the number of identified proteins from 1642 proteins across all samples without fractionation to 3695 proteins with offline fractionation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). With this modification, we recovered one additional U1 snRNP core protein and two additional 7SK binding proteins in the same SHIFTR samples described above. We also noted an increase in the number of peptides detected for each identified protein, thus increasing confidence in our measurements. In total, we identified 7 out of 10 core interactors of the U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H</xref> (left), I) and 5 out of 6 core interactors of the 7SK snRNP in Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I</xref>, S1Q (left)). Our experimental conditions were readily compatible with an alternative cell model (here, A549 cells) where we identified 9 out of 10 known interactors of the U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H</xref> (right), I) and 5 out of 6 core interactors of the 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1Q</xref> (right)) without any modifications to the protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). Remarkably, SHIFTR is not only compatible with the near comprehensive capture of known snRNP components across different cell types, but also displays superb specificity for the targeted snRNP, as indicated by the selective enrichment of U1-specific snRNP components, while proteins specific for the closely related U2, U4, U5 and U6 complexes, were not enriched in either cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>SHIFTR is superior to RAP-MS in a systematic side-by-side comparison</title><p id="P14">Having established an optimized SHIFTR protocol, we systematically compared the performance of SHIFTR to RAP-MS as the state-of-the-art method for RNA interactome capture for individual cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We performed RAP-MS for the U1 and 7SK snRNP complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S2A-B</xref>) using 400 million UV-crosslinked cells, which is in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). A direct comparison of significantly enriched proteins in SHIFTR and RAP-MS experiments revealed that both methods successfully identified a comparable number of known U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>) and 7SK components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). Strikingly however, many proteins not directly linked to known 7SK functions were significantly enriched in RAP-MS experiments, while SHIFTR experiments were virtually free of background interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). Leveraging our detailed knowledge about the composition of both the U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) and 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) snRNPs, we evaluated the accuracy of both methods for capturing the respective RNP complexes using the F1-score, which combines precision and recall in a single metric. SHIFTR yielded much higher F1-scores for both RNP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, SHIFTR consistently outperforms RAP-MS for both the U1 and 7SK complexes at all significance levels when comparing precision and recall statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S2C</xref>). In line with these results, we also found that the fraction of true positive U1 and 7SK complex members among significantly enriched proteins was much higher for SHIFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S2D</xref>). Together, our experiments show that SHIFTR yields superior signal to noise ratios compared to RAP-MS and delivers more accurate RNA interactomes from a fraction of the input material, which dramatically expands the scalability and applicability of RNA interactome capture methods.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Sequential release of multiple target RNA interactomes with a streamlined SHIFTR workflow</title><p id="P15">To unlock the full potential of SHIFTR, we proceeded with targeting coding and non-coding cellular RNAs that differ in length and abundance from the previously interrogated snRNAs. We initially used the same amount of input material that was sufficient to comprehensively capture the U1 and 7SK snRNP complexes and targeted the nuclear lncRNA MALAT1, as well as the actin beta (ACTB) mRNA. These initial experiments yielded few enriched proteins (data not shown), suggesting that the amount of input material was likely insufficient for the detection of proteins crosslinked to these less abundant RNAs by mass spectrometry. Since scaling up the SHIFTR workflow requires increasing the volumes of organic solvents beyond the scale of what can be readily handled using standard microfuge tubes and benchtop instruments, we decided to combine SHIFTR with a widely used poly(A)-based RNA interactome capture procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This approach concentrates crosslinked RNAs in a small volume and avoids introducing technical variation by extensive partitioning of samples into multiple microfuge tubes, which would also be incompatible with processing many samples in parallel, thus limiting scalability. We used 150 million UV-crosslinked A549 cells and replaced the pre-clearance and DNase treatment described above with a simplified poly(A)-based RNA interactome capture step (Methods). This modification has multiple important advantages. First, as demonstrated above, a pre-clearance or sample purification step prior to organic phase extraction enhances the specific release of RNA bound proteins in SHIFTR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-C</xref>). Second, reaction volumes are reduced such that a single microfuge tube is sufficient for subsequent manipulation steps, ensuring scalability of the approach. Third, with an initial poly(A)-based RNA interactome capture step, the scale of SHIFTR experiments can be adjusted such that multiple sequential RNase H digestions can be performed using the same interface extract to release the proteins bound to different RNA targets in a sequential fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To demonstrate this, we performed organic phase extraction after poly(A)-based RNA interactome capture and digested the ACTB mRNA using sequence-specific DNA probes together with RNase H. As expected, we observed specific depletion of ACTB only when sequence-specific DNA probes were added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3A</xref>). After completing the SHIFTR workflow for ACTB, we used the same interface after organic phase separation to digest the nuclear lncRNA MALAT1 with sequence-specific DNA probes and RNase H, which resulted in a strong reduction of MALAT1 RNA levels only when specific DNA probes were added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3B</xref>). We completed the SHIFTR workflow for these two cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3C</xref>) and subjected resulting samples to quantitative TMT-based LC-MS/MS analysis. Since the identification of direct RNA-protein interactomes is particularly challenging for individual mRNAs due to their limited cellular copy number, we conducted an additional proof-of-principle experiment targeting the GAPDH mRNA using SHIFTR. In each case, we observed many annotated RBPs among significantly enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>), validating our approach. To our knowledge, these data represent the first global RNA-protein interactomes of individual mRNAs collected in unmodified cells under endogenous conditions. To further benchmark the performance of SHIFTR, we generated an additional MALAT1 RNA interactome using RAP-MS as a reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3D</xref>). Comparing MALAT1 SHIFTR and RAP-MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E-F</xref>), we found 11 overlapping proteins, including HNRNPC, a functionally supported MALAT1 interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), which was among the most significantly enriched proteins using both methods. Assuming that proteins independently identified with both methods likely represent true direct interactors, our complementary experimental strategy defines a core high-confidence RNA-protein interactome of MALAT1 that may be harnessed for future functional or mechanistic experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>SHIFTR defines the interactomes of genomic and subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in infected cells</title><p id="P16">Due to their limited size, the genomes of RNA viruses are particularly rich in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory RNA elements that recruit <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors of virus and host to facilitate RNA replication and virus propagation. Despite the functional importance of these <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements, the identification of proteins that bind to specific sequence regions in authentic viral RNAs has not been possible with available technologies. Hence, we selected SARS-CoV-2 as a model virus to demonstrate the power of SHIFTR for revealing sequence region-resolved RNA-protein interactions. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Upon infection of a host cell, the virus deploys its 5′-capped and 3′-polyadenylated RNA genome to express a set of viral proteins crucial for replication and virus propagation using the protein synthesis machinery of the host. During infection, SARS-CoV-2 also generates a nested set of 5′ and 3′ co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs that encode structural and accessory viral proteins. Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains non-coding regulatory RNA elements at the 5′ and 3′-end of all viral RNAs that are important for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). To identify proteins that directly bind specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including the regulatory RNA elements at the 5′ and 3′-ends, we infected A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) with SARS-CoV-2 and performed SHIFTR experiments at 24 hours post infection (hpi). We first targeted the ORF1ab region in SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which is uniquely present in viral RNA genomes, but not in sgmRNAs. In separate experiments we designed a probe set overlapping all sgmRNAs (S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4A</xref>, we observed a strong depletion of the targeted viral RNA regions. Of note, the ORF1ab targeting probe set contained probes designed to deplete the 5′ leader sequence, which was readily observed in our experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4A</xref>). Similarly, probe sets used for depleting subgenomic mRNAs contained probes that target both the 5′ leader and the viral 3′ UTR, which are both present in all sgmRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4A</xref>).

Since the ORF1ab region is only present in the RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2, we compared ORF1ab SHIFTR data to RAP-MS data that we generated for the same sequence region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). For RAP-MS we used 160 million SARS-CoV-2 infected and UV-crosslinked A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells (24 hpi), while SHIFTR was performed with 10 million cells. Among significantly enriched factors, 15 proteins were identified with both methods, representing high-confidence ORF1ab RNA interactors. Focusing on specific candidates, we noticed the nucleoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). Compared to other viral RNA regions analyzed in this work, N is most strongly enriched when targeting the ORF1ab region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). Importantly, N is known to densely cover the viral RNA genome and is required for genome packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Hence, the binding pattern observed in SHIFTR experiments is consistent with the known function of N in the viral replication cycle. Similarly, we found the host antiviral protein ZAP (ZC3HAV1) strongly enriched among ORF1ab-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). Prior work showed that ZAP interacts with the frameshift element (FSE) in ORF1ab <italic>in vitro</italic> and regulates the SARS-CoV-2 –1 frameshifting efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), which is in line with the enrichment of ZAP in ORF1ab SHIFTR experiments observed here.</p><p id="P18">We next analyzed proteins identified in sgmRNA SHIFTR experiments and found that ∼80 % of the 133 significantly enriched proteins were annotated as RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>).

These results are in line with our previous observations that SHIFTR yields comparable RNA interactome data from a fraction of the input material needed for RAP-MS. Consistent with our RAP-MS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), we found several proteins of the La-related protein (LARP) family, including LARP1 and LARP4 among the strongest sgmRNA interactors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). We previously demonstrated that LARP1 plays an important role in restricting SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication, likely by repressing the translation of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).

The protein interaction profile of the SARS-CoV-2 3′ UTR for instance, appears overall well represented in the RNA interactome of sgmRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).

A GO enrichment analysis confirmed the overrepresentation of proteins linked to translational initiation among 5′ leader interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Beyond these host proteins, we observed several viral proteins including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NSP12, as well as the viral RNA-binding protein NSP9 among significantly enriched 5′ leader interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). These interactions are consistent with key roles of the 5′ leader in viral RNA biogenesis.

SHIFTR overcomes several roadblocks that previously limited the systematic characterization of RNA-protein interactions. First, SHIFTR reduces the amount of input material needed for the comprehensive characterization of RNA-protein interactomes by several orders of magnitude, which allows application of this technique to a large number of endogenously expressed RNAs in a systematic fashion and potentially using advanced model systems, such as primary cells or organoids. Second, the superior signal to noise ratio observed in SHIFTR experiments when compared to state-of-the-art RNA antisense purification-based technologies facilitates data interpretation and the selection of candidates for follow-up studies. Third, prior to the development of SHIFTR, it was not possible to identify interactomes for specific RNA regions within endogenous RNAs. Outside the context of an intact cell, <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches that combine synthetic RNA fragments with cell lysates in test tubes are commonly used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). However, such approaches may not recapitulate interactions occurring in cells due to difficulties in controlling unspecific interactions and biases towards detecting highly abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Hence, <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches are generally considered less well suited for interactome discovery. To investigate region-resolved RNA–protein interactions in the cellular environment, different technologies were developed to ectopically express RNA sequences of interest. In such an assay, the target RNA is frequently fused to an RNA aptamer sequence that can be harnessed to enrich the target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>) or detect interactions with tagged RBPs using reporter-based overexpression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Alternative approaches, such as proximity-dependent protein labeling, rely on enzyme-catalyzed biotin labeling to identify proteins in proximity to target RNAs or RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). These approaches however require the establishment of genetically engineered cell systems and frequently do not differentiate direct from indirect interactors, which complicates the goal of identifying RNA region-specific interactions. SHIFTR overcomes these limitations and enables the region-resolved mapping of RNA-protein interactions for any endogenous RNA in any cell system without the need for genetic manipulation. Moreover, SHIFTR is a low-cost and easy to execute approach that requires no specialized equipment for the capture of direct RNA protein interactions. We provide streamlined workflows for targeting different RNA species that are heterogeneous in length and abundance, such as small non-coding RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, as well as mRNAs of virus and host. We show that SHIFTR is readily compatible with the sequential release of proteins bound to different RNAs of interest, thus enabling multiplexed RNA interactome capture in a single experiment. To facilitate the dissemination and application of SHIFTR, we provide Probe-SHIFTR, a computational tool for the design of optimized SHIFTR probe sets for any RNA type and sequence of interest, which includes species-specific filtering of probe sets in a fully customizable manner. Finally, we validate interactions and binding patterns observed with SHIFTR by eCLIP and observe large agreement in the recovered binding patterns, demonstrating the power of SHIFTR for revealing region-resolved RNA-protein interactions under endogenous conditions. In particular, we demonstrate that SHIFTR is ideally suited to investigate regulatory RNA elements in the genomes of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Here, SHIFTR reveals distinct RNA binding preferences for known interactors in addition to uncovering previously unrecognized binding partners for specific sequence regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that are supported by functional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) and may point to novel host dependency mechanisms that could inspire the development of rationally designed therapeutic strategies. Among previously unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactors discovered with SHIFTR is the regulatory subunit of the mRNA-capping methyltransferase RNMT:RAMAC complex. RAMAC is required for generating the 7-methylguanosine triphosphate (m<sup>7</sup>Gppp) moiety of the 5′-cap of host mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). RAMAC has been proposed to be involved in cytoplasmic recapping of mRNAs that have lost their 5′-cap and are translationally inactive and subject to decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). Since the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle crucially depends on the effective translation of both the RNA genome (ORF1ab) as well as the viral sgmRNAs, direct binding of RAMAC to both of these RNA species, as indicated by SHIFTR, may hint at the possibility of cytoplasmic recapping of viral mRNAs, which would maintain their translatability and impact viral gene expression. Beyond host proteins that bind SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, we also discovered viral proteins with intriguing binding patterns. First, SHIFTR accurately recovers binding of NSP9 to the 5′-end of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which is consistent with the emerging function of NSP9 in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs at the priming or capping stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). Second, ORF9b, a viral protein that is expressed from an alternative open reading frame (ORF) within the N gene, was significantly enriched in SHIFTR experiments targeting the sgmRNA and ORF1ab region. While ORF9b suppresses the host interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>), recent work suggests that ORF9b has a previously unrecognized RNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Using SHIFTR, we uncover that the preferential binding of ORF9b to the ORF1ab and sgmRNA regions appears to mirror the binding pattern observed for N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which may suggest that two RNA-binding proteins with a similar preference for binding viral RNA are expressed from the N gene.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, with SHIFTR it is now possible to systematically and globally map interactions between the cellular proteome and any <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory RNA element from a diverse array of species. We envision that SHIFTR will revolutionize our understanding of site-specific RNA-protein interactions and regulatory events in complex transcriptomes, including pathogens and their hosts.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S18"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P27">Huh-7 cells (a generous gift from the Virology Diagnostics Unit at the Institute of Virology and Immunobiology, University of Würzburg), TMPRSS2-Vero-E6 cells (a generous gift from S.

For SARS-CoV-2 SHIFTR experiments we designed 50-mer oligonucleotides and synthesized probe sets targeting the ORF1ab and sgmRNA regions as oligo pools. For all other RNA targets, we designed 25-mer oligonucleotides. All probe sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>. Probe-SHIFTR is a java workflow which creates all possible k-mers for a given RNA target sequence. Each k-mer is evaluated with respect to sequence features such as containing poly nucleotide chains, sequence complexity, repetitive sequences, and containing masked repeat regions. After filtering each k-mer based on these features, a similarity search is performed by BLAT to remove k-mers showing high similarity to genomic or transcriptomic regions of a provided reference specie. After performing these filtering steps each k-mer should represent a unique sequence of the target RNA region. Using a greedy algorithm, the resulting k-mers are arranged in sets of non-overlapping sequences providing maximal coverage over the target region while maintaining the unique sequence feature of this region. Probe-SHIFTR provides several sets of non-overlapping nucleotide sequences for different parameter settings as well as analysis plots helping to decide which set of oligonucleotides should be used.

For experiment P2664 (SARS-CoV-2 SHIFTR) also the SARS-CoV-2 database was used (UP000464024, February 2023,31 entries). The following modifications were included into the search parameters: Carbamidomethyl on Cysteine and TMT6/10/16 on lysine as fixed modifications, protein N-term acetylation, oxidation on methionine and TMT6/10/16 on N-termini as variable modifications. For precursor ions a mass error tolerance of 10 ppm (IsobarQuant) or 20 ppm (MSFragger) was used and for fragment ions 0.02 Da (IsobarQuant) or 20 ppm (MSFragger) was set. Trypsin was set as protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages. The minimum peptide length was set to seven amino acids. At least two unique peptides were required for a protein identification. The false discovery rate on peptide and protein level was set to 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Statistical data analysis</title><p id="P49">The raw output files of IsobarQuant (protein.txt – files) were processed using the R programming language. Only proteins that were quantified with at least two unique peptides were considered for the analysis. Raw TMT reporter ion signals (signal_sum columns) were first cleaned for batch effects using limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and further normalized using vsn (variance stabilization normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Proteins were tested for differential expression using the empirical Bayes statistics (eBayes) from the limma package while removing batch effects by incorporating replicate information. For correcting against multiple testing, the local false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated by fdrtool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Comparisons showing a local FDR value below 0.05, were considered as statistically significant. As described in Strimmer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), the local FDR determines an upper bound for tail-based FDR values provided by fdrtool. To facilitate the identification of additional candidates in experiments for MALAT1, GAPDH, and ACTB, the tail-based FDR value (qvalue) was considered for differentiating between statistically significant and non-significant comparisons.</p><p id="P50">Comparing the performance of SHIFTR and RAP-MS for U1 and 7SK, both approaches were regarded as binary classifiers distinguishing target proteins (positives) by having low FDR values and background noise (negatives) having high FDR values. Based on the detailed knowledge about the composition of both snRNPs, the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) could be calculated (see table below). Based on this definition, we calculated precision as TP/(TP + FP), recall as TP/(TP + FN), and the F1-score as the harmonic mean of both measures as 2 × (precision × recall)/(precision + recall). Additionally, using the negative logarithm of FDR values as classification scores, the calculations for precision-recall curves could be performed by using the R package PRROC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). These curves serve as an indication how precisely each method is able to distinguish target proteins from background noise.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" style="border: 1px solid #000000"/><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000">Target protein</th><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000">Background</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: 1px solid #000000;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-left: 1px solid #000000">Below FDR threshold</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000">TP</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000">FP</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: 1px solid #000000;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-left: 1px solid #000000">Above FDR threshold</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000">FN</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;border-right: 1px solid #000000">TN</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="S39"><title>RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS)</title><p id="P51">RAP-MS, including mass spectrometry sample preparation was performed as described in Munschauer <italic>et al</italic>., (2018) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP)</title><p id="P52">We performed eCLIP for selected RNA-binding proteins (LARP4, ZAP, NSP9) in SARS-CoV-2 infected A549<sup>ACE2</sup> cells as described previously in Schmidt et al., (2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).
