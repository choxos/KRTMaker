Here, we demonstrate the rational design of pure RNA condensates from star-shaped RNA motifs. We generate condensates using two different RNA nanostar architectures: multi-stranded nanostars whose binding interactions are programmed via single-stranded overhangs, and single-stranded nanostars whose interactions are programmed via kissing loops. Through rational design of the nanostar interaction sequences, we demonstrate that both architectures can produce orthogonal (distinct and immiscible) condensates, which can be individually tracked via fluorogenic aptamers. We also show that aptamers make it possible to recruit peptides and proteins to the condensates with high specificity. Successful cotranscriptional formation of condensates from single-stranded nanostars suggests that they may be genetically encoded and produced in living cells. We provide a library of orthogonal RNA condensates that can be modularly customized and offer a route toward creating systems of functional artificial organelles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The discovery of membraneless organelles is transforming our understanding of cellular biology and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These organelles, also known as biomolecular condensates, arise when mixtures of nucleic acids and proteins segregate into spatially separated phases due to specific and non-specific (electrostatic and hydrophobic) molecular interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Condensation broadly describes the formation of viscoelastic aggregates, and in biology it is typically associated with a phase transition of mixtures of both RNA and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> that is driven by the interaction of intrinsically disordered domains (IDRs) of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, protein-RNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> or RNA-RNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Distinct, immiscible condensates — here termed “orthogonal condensates” — arise through variations of the chemical identity and interactions of the protein and RNA components from which the condensates are composed. The prevailing model is that orthogonal condensates enable the spatial and temporal control of chemical components and biochemical reactions. In general, the greater the number of orthogonal condensates that can be created, the greater the number of distinct biochemical functions that can be performed. In cells there are dozens of functionally distinct condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, that are involved in diverse gene regulation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, cellular stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The development of libraries of synthetic, orthogonal condensates would allow for the engineering of coordinated systems of controllable microcompartments with distinct functions matching the complexity of living systems.</p><p id="P3">As sequence-programmable biopolymers, proteins and RNA have all shown promise as building blocks of artificial condensates. A fundamental design principle used in these investigations has been to introduce weak, non-specific, homotypic interactions that are thought to be essential for phase separation. This was made possible by engineering proteins to include IDRs present in naturally condensing proteins like FUS and SUMO proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Similarly, artificial RNA condensates have been demonstrated using long molecules featuring expanded repeats of short sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which are found in nuclear foci associated with neurological diseases. While IDRs and short repeats introduce multivalency, they also introduce promiscuous molecular interactions, thereby limiting the possibility of building coexisting yet immiscible condensates with distinct identities and tunable properties. An alternative approach has been pioneered through nanostructured DNA motifs that form condensates thanks to localized interactions whose specificity is achieved by rationally designed base-pairing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. DNA nanostars have successfully been used to build coexisting but immiscible orthogonal condensates with programmable phase transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Taking inspiration from the success of DNA nanostar condensates, and using techniques from RNA nanotechnology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> we have designed and synthesized both multi-stranded and single-stranded RNA motifs that phase separate into orthogonal condensates. With the aid of computational models predicting RNA-RNA interactions, we demonstrate a suite of star-shaped RNA motifs, or nanostars, that generate RNA-dense droplets thanks to designed base-pairing domains, either linear sticky-ends or kissing loops, at the tip of their arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). As shown in DNA nanostar analogues, this strategy makes it possible to obtain phase transitions by controlling nanostar affinity (determined by sequence and length of the base-pairing domains) and valency (determined by the number of arms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We adapt RNA nanostars to include an array of RNA domains that bind to small molecules and peptides, producing an expandable library of modular motifs that produce condensates with the capacity to recruit and segregate client molecules. Finally, we show that single-stranded RNA nanostars fold and produce condensates cotranscriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and could serve as genetically encoded building blocks to make RNA organelles with desired biophysical features and with the capacity to concentrate molecular targets. This feature is immediately applicable to building organelles in synthetic cells, as demonstrated in Fabrini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Condensates emerge from rationally designed multi-stranded RNA motifs interacting via sticky-ends</title><p id="P4">We begin by demonstrating RNA nanostars assembled from multiple RNA strands, taking inspiration from DNA nanostars that interact via linear sticky-ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In our designs, arm sequences are distinct, but each arm presents the same palindromic sticky-end that controls nanostar affinity. We built several four-arm variants, labeled 4m1, 4m2, etc., where “m” denotes the multi-stranded nature of the constructs, “4” is the number of arms, and the final number denotes the sticky-end variant. The sequences of 15-nucleotide (nt) arms and their sticky-ends were optimized using NUPACK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> to prevent repeats and unwanted interactions. To improve flexibility, we included unpaired adenines at the nanostar core and at the base of the sticky-ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. RNA strands were suspended in an assembly buffer (40 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 500 mM NaCl), thermally treated by a “melt and hold” protocol consisting of a quick 70°C melt followed by a 12h-long hold at 50°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), and stained with 1X SYBR gold for microscopy. We will refer to this buffer and thermal treatment as our standard experimental conditions. Additional hold temperatures and buffer conditions were screened in the Supplementary Information file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1-S3</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We found that 4-6 nt long sticky-ends yield condensates of varying morphology, including round droplets, aggregates of slowly fusing droplets, and “cloudy” aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, no condensates formed in the absence of sticky-ends or with 2 nt long sticky-ends unless excess salt was added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). We observed the presence of gel-like aggregates in sticky-ends with high UA content. We tracked condensation of variant 4m6 during the temperature hold, finding large condensates after 3-6 hours of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The average size of condensates increases during the hold step, as shown via chord length distribution (CLD) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, right, and SI Methods 1.4), and their spherical shape is indicative of a liquid-like state. We tested the influence of the hold temperature on variant 4m5, finding that lower hold temperatures (40-45°C) yield aggregates, while temperatures in the range of 46-65°C produce spherical liquid-like assemblies; a 70°C hold eliminates condensation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Condensates persist at high KCl concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), and the addition of MgCl<sub>2</sub> alters their melting temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We finally verified that a three-arm nanostar variant (adapted from variant 4m6) also yields condensates in our standard conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), consistent with previous work showing that three arms are sufficient to promote condensation of DNA nanostars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Loop-loop interactions enable condensation of single-stranded RNA motifs</title><p id="P6">A requirement for potentially producing RNA nanostars in living cells is that they form at constant temperature, as they are being transcribed. To achieve this, we developed RNA nanostars comprising a single strand rather than several distinct molecules. In these designs, sticky-ends are replaced by kissing loop (KL) domains placed at the end of consecutive stems that serve as nanostar arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Like in the multi-stranded designs, the arm sequences are distinct to minimize misfolding but all KLs on a particular nanostar are identical. Given our goal of cotranscriptional formation, we decided to minimize transcript length and include only three consecutive arms, the lowest valency for condensation. Stem sequences were adapted from design 4m6, eliminating one of the arms. We started by testing the palindromic wild-type HIV KL sequence (GCGCGC, variant termed 3sWT, where “s” denotes the single-stranded nature of the design and “3” the number of arms), and we also developed variants with non-palindromic sticky-ends (3sα-ζ), each including 2 distinct nanostars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Before attempting cotranscriptional folding, we characterized the condensation of our designs using purified RNA treated with our melt and hold annealing protocol, using assembly conditions consistent with those used for the multi-stranded constructs.</p><p id="P7">We found that condensate formation occurs robustly across designs, although it is influenced by KL and stem sequences. The 3sWT nanostars yield abundant condensates that continue to grow throughout the hold step of the annealing protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). We verified that interacting KLs are essential for condensation: replacing only one of the three WT KLs with a poly-A sequence suppresses droplet formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). We then tested 5 variants of the WT KL (dubbed 3sv1-v5) with mismatches or wobble pairs that modulate the probability of KL dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and therefore change the nanostar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S10</xref>). Condensates are observed with the WT, v1, and v3 variants, yielding similar chord length distributions, but not with variants v2, v4, and v5, consistently with previous dimerization tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. While KL v2 is expected to dimerize, it did not yield condensates under these assembly conditions, likely due to the high hold temperature and the lack of divalent cations in our assembly buffer. Next, we examined the influence of nanostar stems on condensate formation. We built nanostars with a 16-nt “stem 2” variant whose sequence is adapted from a well-known design for three-arm DNA nanostars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and a 20-nt “stem 3” variant designed using NUPACK. We obtain condensates with both new stem variants with the WT KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), and longer arms correlate with larger condensate size, an effect also observed with DNA nanostars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E (i)</xref>). When combining stem 2 with different KL variants, we find that variants v4 and v5 yield condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E (ii)</xref>) pointing to the fact that the stem-mediated interactions may play a role in condensation under the melt and hold protocol. This role cannot be simply explained thermodynamically, given the similar free energy (ΔG) of stem 1 and stem 2 formation (NUPACK estimates ΔG =-67.45 kcal/mol for stem 1 and ΔG =-68.53 kcal/mol for stem 2 at 50°C, with comparable GC content flanking the KL).</p><p id="P8">The choice of hold temperature significantly influences condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Across KL variants, a 40°C hold facilitates condensation for stem 1 when compared to a 50°C hold. This is evidenced by droplets appearing at 40°C while remaining dispersed at 50°C (variants 3sv2 and 3sv5) or by an increase in droplet size (variants 3sWT and 3sv1), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F(i)</xref> (example microscopy images are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). All stem 2 variants, except 3sv2, yield condensates under a 50°C hold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E(ii)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Strikingly, variant 3sWT-stem2 forms condensates even with a 70°C hold, likely due to interactions enabled by partial stem melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F(i)</xref>). The round shape of these condensates suggests a liquid state, at least during the hold phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F(ii)</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The addition of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to the assembly buffer alters the observed phase transitions. In this case, also 3sWT-stem1 nanostars yield condensates under a 70°C hold, and variant 3sv2-stem1 also produces condensates under a 50°C hold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Other variants produce more non-spherical condensates when compared with the standard assembly buffer including monovalent cations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). This behavior is consistent with the fact that divalent cations like MgCl<sub>2</sub> generally stabilize nucleic acid assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and may increase the affinity of KL nanostars that otherwise do not condense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. At the same time, MgCl<sub>2</sub> can promote aggregation and kinetic trapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, and in this case, it can compromise the mobility of nanostars in the dense phase resulting in the formation of gelatinous or solid assemblies. This is an important consideration because MgCl<sub>2</sub> is typically required for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, and is a ubiquitous component in protocols for DNA or RNA self-assembly.</p><p id="P10">Finally, we tested 6 more RNA nanostar variants (3sα-ζ) each comprising 2 distinct nanostars (e.g., 3sα1, 3sα2) with non-palindromic KL designed to be complementary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). By adopting non-palindromic sequences, we can expand by 64-fold the theoretical sequence design space of a 6 nucleotide KL domain. With the melt and hold protocol and our assembly buffer, we found that all two-nanostar variants generated condensates with variable size and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Individual nanostars produced no condensate, except for variant 3sε1 because of partial self-complementarity of the KL domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that KL with more than 4 base pairs have a high likelihood of yielding condensation. If 4 base pairs form, the outcome depends on the overall strength of the interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Orthogonal RNA condensates can be programmed to recruit guest molecules</title><p id="P11">We next demonstrate the potential of RNA nanostars to capture client molecules and recruit them to the RNA dense phase. We focus on condensates produced through the melt and hold protocol using purified RNA.</p><p id="P12">We began by appending client recruitment domains (aptamers) at the tip of one of the arms of variants 4m3, 4m5, and 4m6 (upstream of the 5’ end of the sticky-end). We first validated this idea through fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs) known as Red Broccoli (appended to variant 4m6 and to a three-arm variant 3m1, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), Corn (4m5), and Orange Broccoli (4m3), which all bind to fluorophore DFHO but each results in a distinct emission spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). (For ease of visualization, we depict FLAPs using the secondary structure predicted by NUPACK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, which does not capture their complex 3D tertiary structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.) Because these variants were designed to maximize orthogonality, we expected each nanostar to form distinct condensates that do not mix with the others. Through microscopy we first verified that these nanostars yield condensates when assembled in isolation in the presence of DFHO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>), and then that they do not mix when assembled simultaneously. To quantitatively assess the degree of condensate mixing we plotted a histogram of the arctangent of the pixel intensity ratio FITC/Cy3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, bottom right, bottom right, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>). The histogram peaks of control samples (individually assembled nanostars) are consistent with those of samples including mixed nanostars, indicating that the aptamers are not colocalized. These histograms highlight that although our nanostars are sequence-designed to remain de-mixed, the excitation and emission spectra of the FLAPs have some overlap (Orange Broccoli 513/562 nm, Red Broccoli 518/582 nm, and Corn 505/545 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Further, Orange Broccoli and Red Broccoli have a high degree of sequence similarity, where mutation at nucleotide position 71 is hypothesized to be the key cause of the difference in fluorescence emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Finally, differences in fluorescence intensity are likely due to the difference in the K<sub>D</sub> of DFHO (Orange Broccoli ∼230 nM, Red Broccoli ∼206 nM, and Corn ∼70 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we show that our RNA condensates can recruit client peptides to the dense phase. For this purpose, we replaced FLAPs with peptide and protein binding domains: we considered a streptavidin binding aptamer (appended to nanostar variant 4m3), boxB RNA that binds P22 N peptide (appended to nanostar variant 4m5), and TAR RNA that binds TAT peptide (appended to nanostar variant 4m6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>. We selected these peptides for their versatility: the streptavidin-biotin pair is widely used for purification and localization assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>; the P22 bacteriophage N peptide is a strong binder for its aptamer boxB, and has been useful for RNA colocalization studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>; finally, Tat bound to its aptamer is a strong transcriptional regulator involved in HIV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Strands including aptamers were doped into the mixture of unmodified strands at a ratio of 1:4 to prevent steric hindrance of sticky-end hybridization. We verified that each peptide binding nanostar yields condensates when assembled individually, and it successfully recruits its client; after peptide recruitment, condensates become on average larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, bottom). Undesired cross-binding of targets to their non-cognate aptamer occurs only for TAT, due to its positively charged amino acid residues that causes non-specific binding to negatively charged RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Overall, our orthogonal RNA nanostars partition the fluorescently labeled peptides into distinct compartments that do not mix.</p><p id="P14">Finally, we confirmed that also single-stranded RNA nanostars can recruit client molecules. We selected orthogonal two-nanostar variants 3sβ and 3sγ and we modified them to include FLAPs binding DFHO (Red Broccoli and Corn, respectively) as an additional arm. We observed the formation of condensates of distinct colors upon annealing nanostars together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>). We verified that these condensates do not mix through our quantitative image analysis (computation of the arctangent of FITC/Cy3 intensity ratio for each pixel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>), which shows aligned histogram peaks when purified nanostars are annealed separately or together.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cotranscriptional formation of RNA condensates</title><p id="P15">We finally demonstrate that single-stranded RNA nanostars produce condensates cotranscriptionally at 37°C, in the absence of thermal annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Tandem stem-loops fold based on local RNA interactions, so they are expected to form stable structures as they are being transcribed under isothermal conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

The average condensate size doubles within the first 3 hours as confirmed by the mean-chord length (μ<sub>CLD</sub>) bar plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>); larger aggregates can be obtained by increasing the DNA template concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S16</xref>). The number of condensates only slightly decreases over time, which suggests that our reaction conditions promote condensate growth primarily by monomer addition, rather than fusion, while nanostars are being transcribed. We also tested the cotranscriptional assembly of variant 3sβ, which similarly produces aggregates that grow rapidly into a slowly fusing network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-D</xref>). We found that the amount of monovalent and divalent cations (NaCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub>) in the transcription buffer has significant effects on cotranscriptional formation, as shown in control experiments involving the two-nanostar variant 3sβ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>); buffers included in commercial kits may fail to yield condensates if they do not include sufficient cation levels. We expect that cotranscriptional condensates can be obtained using other nanostar variants that produce condensates from purified RNA with the melt and 40°C hold protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Cotranscriptionally produced RNA condensates could be useful as membraneless organelles that can spontaneously recruit proteins. To demonstrate that this is immediately feasible in cell-free systems, we verified that nanostar 3sv2-stem1 could produce condensates when transcribed using PURExpress®, a commercial kit for cell-free protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The production of large condensates appears slow in PURExpress® when compared to a high-yield transcription kit, as evidenced by example images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> and by the μ<sub>CLD</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>. Condensate growth rate may be increased by using larger amounts of DNA template or of RNA polymerase. Finally, we modified 3sv2-stem1 to recruit p22 N and TAT peptides using their corresponding aptamers (boxB and TAR, respectively) and demonstrated that these peptides are recruited to the condensates cotranscriptionally. After incubating DNA templates for 2 hours in a high-yield transcription buffer, we added peptides to our samples, verifying the correct, specific recruitment of peptides to the dense phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">We have demonstrated the design and synthesis of modular RNA nanostars for phase separation. We showed that both multi-stranded and single-stranded nanostars robustly form condensates in standard buffers commonly adopted in nanotechnology applications, in the absence of binding partners. We focused on two protocols, (1) transcribing and purifying RNA strands, then performing a temperature treatment consisting of a denaturing step and a long temperature hold, or (2) cotranscriptional assembly. We examined how condensation is influenced by various nanostar design features and extrinsic factors such as ionic conditions and temperature. Further, we have programmed orthogonal condensates to recruit and organize small molecules and peptides, thus mimicking the ability of biological condensates to recruit clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Our strategy is modular, and may lead to the development of libraries of orthogonal condensates recruiting diverse clients. Multi-stranded and single-stranded RNA nanostars offer different advantages depending on the downstream application or purpose. Owing to the ease in designing linear sticky-ends and hybridizing domains, the affinity and valency of multi-stranded nanostars can be easily tuned, making it possible to build RNA condensates with a broad range of biophysical properties that should be comparable to those demonstrated for similar DNA condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Further, this design allows for modular introduction of RNA or DNA strands with distinct functionalities, including client recruitment and adaptation to chemical or physical inputs that are relevant for developing therapeutic, multifunctional biomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Single-stranded nanostars produce condensates isothermally under physiological conditions, making them immediately useful as RNA organelles that can be produced in artificial cells, as demonstrated in a parallel study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We are evaluating whether these constructs can be genetically encoded in living cells.</p><p id="P18">A distinguishing feature of our RNA condensates is that they are formed through compact, nanostructured motifs designed using short sequences that are optimized to fold as desired. While RNA coacervates can emerge from unstructured RNA homopolymers, their formation requires the presence of polymeric cations that are not necessary in our system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Previously, RNA strands assembling into pure RNA hydrogels have been identified via SELEX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, however, this approach does not offer a clear design strategy to modularly adapt the condensing motifs as easily as with RNA nanostars. Recent work demonstrated that liquid RNA droplets can be produced inside cells through long RNA molecules featuring short sequence repeats (CAG/CUG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. By fusing the CAG-repeats to recruitment domains, it was possible to demonstrate compositional control of RNA droplets both in bacteria and in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Unlike RNA nanostars, these long repeats are expected to form tangled complexes that require annealing to form gels <italic>in vitro</italic>, and rely on energy-dissipating cellular machinery to remain in a liquid state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Intracellular RNA condensates were also obtained via homodimerization of two different RNA aptamer repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, which remain demixed forming up to two types of orthogonal compartments inside cells. In these exciting achievements, sequence repeats are an expedient strategy to introduce multivalency; however, it is not clear whether these methods can be used to build a scalable number of orthogonal condensates.</p><p id="P19">A simplified working model of RNA nanostars is that we can determine their affinity, valency, and size by changing the nanostar sticky-ends/kissing loops, number of arms, and arm length. However, we still lack a clear picture of how different combinations of these parameters affect phase transitions and condensation kinetics. Further, some of these parameters mutually couple in ways that are difficult to predict; for example, changes in the stem sequence can have an impact on the nanostar affinity if they affect the folding of the interaction domains, and these effects are sensitive to temperature and ionic conditions. The influence of combinations of design changes could be predicted by coarse-grained models that capture the interactions among nanostars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, and should be validated against systematic experiments characterizing phase diagrams and growth rates of nanostar condensates. These models could accelerate the design of customized RNA condensates while minimizing experimental burden. Finally, while we have demonstrated modular recruitment of small molecules and peptides, we expect limitations in which classes of molecules of proteins are recruitable by RNA nanostars with specificity. RNA aptamers can be promiscuous, for example TAR RNA is known to bind positively charged arginine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Further, arbitrary RNA domains may non-specifically recruit amino acid sequences; for example, positively charged peptides naturally tend to bind to the negatively charged backbone of RNA, regardless of sequence specificity (like we observed with TAT protein). We expect that, in complex biological samples, various RNA-binding proteins could bind non-specifically to our artificial condensates and possibly compromise their formation. Another challenge is that some recruitment motifs could introduce misfolding or remodeling of the secondary structure of contranscriptionally produced single stranded nanostars. Design methods developed for RNA origami may provide valuable lessons toward enhancing the robustness and the functionalities of RNA nanostars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Orthogonal, customizable micron-sized compartments made with RNA may find clinical and industrial applications for purification, diagnostics, and therapeutic treatments. RNA condensates with the capacity to selectively sequester binding targets may be useful for separating crude mixtures of molecules or low-volume clinical samples. The incorporation of stimuli-responsive domains in RNA nanostars could make it possible to develop sensors and diagnostic tools, and further engineering may allow this platform to serve as a smart drug delivery system capable of encapsulating and releasing therapeutic molecules. Lastly, we envision that single-stranded RNA nanostars may be used to produce functional RNA organelles in living cells and potentially control cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P21">Sequences, detailed methods, and additional experiments are included in the Supplementary Table and Supplementary Information file.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Sequence design</title><p id="P22">The RNA strands for the multi-stranded motifs (4m) were designed and optimized using the NUPACK design tool using scripts reported in SI Section 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

When annealed in one pot they produce distinct RNA condensates that do not mix. Condensates were imaged in both FITC and Cy3 channels; each pixel’s FITC/Cy3 ratio was mapped to an angle θ and histogrammed. Histogram peaks for individually-annealed nanostars (single-color) align with those of simultaneously-annealed nanostars (multi-color). (B) Top: Nanostars including aptamer domains that recruit streptavidin, P22 N peptide, and TAT peptide guests. Middle: Example images and violin plots of the chord length distribution for condensates before and after recruitment of peptides. Black line indicates the mean. Bottom: Nanostars were designed to be sequence-orthogonal, thus their one-pot assembly with fluorescently labeled clients shows their recruitment and compartmentalized into specific condensates (red, blue, and yellow). (C) Sequence-orthogonal single-stranded RNA motifs pairs (two nanostar systems, 3sβ and 3sγ), modified to include Corn and Red Broccoli fluorogenic aptamers. To reduce steric hindrance, 25% of 3sβ1 or 3sγ1 were modified to include FLAPs, while the other 75% and all 3sβ2 or 3sγ2 remained unmodified. The peaks of the FITC/Cy3 angle histogram for individually annealed condensates (single-color) align with the peaks of the one-pot assembly (multi-color). Experiments were done in triplicates; images provide representative examples. Violin plots and histograms pool data from all replicates.
