This study aimed to investigate the existence of distinct subtypes of breast cancer within the Asian population, by analysing the transcriptomic profiles of 934 breast cancer patients from a Malaysian cohort. Our findings reveal that the HR+/HER2- breast cancer samples display a distinct clustering pattern based on immune phenotypes, rather than conforming to the conventional luminal A-luminal B paradigm previously reported in breast cancers from women of European descent. This suggests that the activation of the immune system may play a more important role in Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer than has been previously recognized. Analysis of somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing showed that counter-intuitively, the cluster of HR+/HER2- samples exhibiting higher immune scores was associated with lower tumour mutational burden, lower homologous recombination deficiency scores, and fewer copy number aberrations, implicating the involvement of non-canonical tumour immune pathways. Further investigations are warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms of these pathways, with the potential to develop innovative immunotherapeutic approaches tailored to this specific patient population.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, characterized by diverse subtypes that have important implications in guiding treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These distinct subtypes encompass variations in clinical presentation, molecular profiles, and response to treatment, highlighting the complex nature of breast cancer. The classification of breast cancer subtypes has provided valuable insights into disease prognosis and treatment selection, enabling more personalized and targeted therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="P3">Currently, there are two generally accepted methodologies to classify breast cancer subtypes: PAM50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and Integrative Clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Under the PAM50 classification scheme, breast cancer is classified into four main subtypes according to gene expression-based clusters: luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched, and basal-like, as well as an additional small group usually labelled as “normal-like”. These categories roughly correspond to the biomarker- and treatment-based clinical subtypes of HR+/HER2-, HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The Integrative Cluster classification scheme, on the other hand, integrates both transcriptomic and copy number data to classify breast cancer into 11 subtypes with different driver mutations. These subtypes include the HER2+-associated IntClust 5, the TNBC-associated IntClust 10, as well as subtypes with low copy number variation (IntClust 4+ and 4-).</p><p id="P4">However, it is important to recognize that the existing subtypes were predominantly derived from studies conducted in populations of European descent. Given the clinical utility of molecular subtyping, there is a growing need to investigate breast cancer subtypes in different ethnic populations to account for potential variations in genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. For example, the various breast cancer subtypes are known to have different associations with reproductive risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and these lifestyle risk factors are likely to differ substantially between different populations. Additionally, different breast cancer subtypes are associated with different breast cancer risk genetic loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which are also distributed differently in different populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, previous studies have found differences in the prevalence of certain subtypes in non-European populations, with the African population having higher numbers of TNBC-associated samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and the Asian population having a higher prevalence of Her2-enriched<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or luminal B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> samples.</p><p id="P5">The heterogeneity in clinicopathological features across different populations suggests the possibility that intrinsic molecular subtypes differ across different populations as well. For example, breast cancers from the Nigerian population have a high prevalence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, and structural variation indicative of a more aggressive biology compared to tumours from Western populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. It has also been identified previously that Asian breast cancers exhibit higher immune scores compared to the Western population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. These findings suggest potential differences in the underlying biology of breast cancer in different ethnic groups and highlight the importance of population-specific studies across diverse populations.</p><p id="P6">Investigating breast cancer subtypes in Asians holds significant promise for improving our understanding of the disease and optimizing treatment strategies for this specific population. Additionally, it may provide insights into the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis, allowing for the development of more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions. Existing studies which investigated the molecular subtypes underlying breast cancer in Asian populations have reported that molecular subtypes are largely conserved between Asian and Western populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the cohort sizes in these studies are relatively small, and some are only focused on a subpopulation, such as young breast cancer, and may not be representative of the entire Asian population. In this study, we explored the possibility of unique subtypes of breast cancer within the Asian population by examining the transcriptomic profiles of breast cancer patients from a relatively large cohort. Our analyses found the HR+/HER2- breast cancer samples in our cohort display a distinct clustering pattern based on immune phenotypes instead of the luminal A-luminal B paradigm. This suggests that the activation of the immune system may play a more important role in Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer than has been previously recognized, which may have important clinical implications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study cohort</title><p id="P7">Our study cohort consists of 934 Malaysian women with breast cancer.

Using k-means clustering, we iteratively analysed the clustering of these samples across a range of <italic>k</italic> values and number of features (number of genes included – see Methods). The optimum <italic>k</italic> value and feature set was selected by comparing our clustering results with the PAM50 clustering.

However, our clustering results were very different compared to previous clustering methods for the subtypes of HR+ samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), suggesting that the grouping of HR+ samples in our cohort may be driven by a different phenotypic paradigm relative to other populations.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Comparison of pathway expression across MyBrCa Clusters</title><p id="P25">Next, to investigate the differences between our clusters, we conducted differential gene expression and pathway analyses. We compared each cluster to the other clusters with similar clinical subtypes, with a particular focus on the HR+ clusters. Using GSEA, we found that the HR+ clusters 2, 4, 5, and 7 differed from each other primarily in immune-related pathways such as the complement, inflammatory response, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Pathway enrichment analyses returned similar results, with an over-representation of genes involved in immune-related pathways when comparing between the four HR+ clusters.

We found that there was a marked difference for many of these scores between our HR+ clusters, consistent with the notion that the clustering of HR+ samples in our cohort is driven by differences in immune-related phenotypes. We identified a group of clusters with consistently low or intermediate immune scores (Group 2), comprising of Clusters 2, 4 and 5, while Cluster 7 (Group 1) has consistently high immune scores.</p><p id="P26">We also investigated several KEGG pathways known to mediate IFN-γ, including cGAS-STING, T-cell receptor signalling, antigen processing and presentation, and TGF-β signalling pathways.

We first confirmed that there was a significant difference between the two groups by comparing several general immune score markers and found that Group 1 indeed had significantly higher scores for the combined Bindea gene set, Ayers expanded IFN-gamma gene set, IMPRES score, as well as scores for cytotoxic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Following that, we used CIBERSORT transcriptomic deconvolution to measure the relative abundances of 22 different immune cell types in the tumour microenvironment and compared the abundance of each cell type between the two groups. We found significant differences between the two groups across all 22 immune cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Interestingly, immune cell types associated with the adaptive immune system such as CD4+ memory T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells had a higher relative abundance in Group 1, whereas Group 2 had a higher relative abundance of cells typically associated with the innate immune system, such as M2 macrophages and mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Moreover, Group 1 samples were found to have higher abundance of lymphoid lineage cells, including B cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, whereas immune cells which were more abundant in Group 2 were mostly from the myeloid lineage, such as neutrophils and mast cells. There was also a notable difference in the prevalence of macrophage phenotypes between Group 1 and Group 2. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages were found to be more abundant in Group 1, while non-activated M0 macrophages and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages are more abundant in Group 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Survival Analyses of MyBrCa Clusters</title><p id="P30">Following that, we looked for prognostic differences between our clusters by conducting survival analyses. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models for overall survival, adjusting for tumour stage and grade. In general, HR+ clusters, (Clusters 2, 4, 5 and 7) appeared to have better survival than the rest of the cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). As expected, clusters comprising of mainly TNBC subtypes, namely Clusters 1, 8 and 11, were associated with the worst survival, followed by Cluster 3 which comprises of a mix of clinical subtypes which are mainly HER2+ or TNBCs.</p><p id="P31">We also asked if survival differs between the HR+/HER2- clusters with distinct immune phenotypes (Group 1 versus Group 2). Group 1 was associated with a slightly poorer survival than Group 2, but the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). Relative to Cluster 7 (Group 1), both Clusters 2 and 5 (Group 2) had better survival, although the difference was insignificant, while Cluster 4 (Group 2) had similar survival as Cluster 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">The aim of this study was to look for novel subtypes of breast cancer from cluster analyses using transcriptomic data from a large Malaysian cohort of 934 breast tumours. Our classifier grouped these samples into 12 clusters which were highly associated with clinical subtypes. Comparisons of our clustering results to the PAM50 and IntClust classification schemes in the MyBrCa cohort suggest that intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer are largely conserved between Asian and Western cohorts for HER2+ and TNBC subtypes. Survival analyses of our k-means clusters were also consistent with what might be expected based on the clinical subtypes which each cluster comprise of and also consistent with previous findings. On the other hand, our results from both k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering demonstrated a unique clustering pattern of Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer samples. Instead of conforming to the conventional luminal A-luminal B paradigm, differences in immune-related pathways, immune scores as well as immune profiles suggest that clustering of these samples were driven by immune phenotypes.</p><p id="P33">This observation suggests that in Asian populations with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, the activation of the immune system may play a more crucial role compared to other populations. These findings are consistent with previous studies which reported a more immune-active tumour microenvironment in the Asian population, supporting the notion that immune responses could potentially have a heightened importance in Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. These findings are also consistent with previous studies reporting that luminal breast cancers in Asians can be further stratified based on immune profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Additionally, comparison of the clustering results of our study to Integrative Clusters suggests that the majority of our HR+/HER2- immune high group (Group 1) also classified as IntClust 4, which was previously identified as having strong immune signatures in the METABRIC cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, further supporting our findings.</p><p id="P34">Previous studies have suggested that the immune activity in HR+/HER2- breast tumours is associated with different outcomes compared to other breast cancer subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. For example, the abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is associated with worse outcomes in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, whereas it is associated with better outcomes in other subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. This difference may be due to a different balance of immune cell subsets within the tumour microenvironment – such a higher abundance of FOXP3+ T-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, or due to differences in the tumour immune microenvironment such as CTLA-4 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In addition to an association with poorer prognosis, the presence of TILs in HR+/HER2- breast cancer is also thought to be an independent predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">The underlying factors driving the increased activation of the immune system in Asian breast cancer remains to be elucidated, however we suggest that this may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variants that lower the threshold for immune activation during breast cancer may be more common in Asian populations – for example, germline deletion of the <italic>APOBEC3B</italic> gene, a cytidine deaminase that has roles in both cancer mutagenesis and innate immunity, is much more common in Asian and Oceanic populations than in Western populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as parity and BMI are known to influence cancer immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> as well as risk for developing specific breast cancer subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and these lifestyle factors also differ between Asian and Western populations, with Asian populations generally having higher (albeit decreasing) parity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and lower BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> compared to their Western counterparts. Additionally, immunity generally declines with increasing age, and Asian breast cancer studies so far have indicated that the average age at diagnosis is lower than in Western populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, although this may be due to a birth cohort effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. As a whole, these studies suggest plausible mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms by which the immune system in Asian breast cancer is more active.</p><p id="P36">Our study also revealed associations between the cluster of Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancers exhibiting high immune scores and several molecular characteristics. Specifically, we observed a higher prevalence of <italic>TP53</italic> somatic mutations within this cluster, suggesting that reduced functionality of this well-known tumour suppressor gene may contribute to immune activation in Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Interestingly, despite the strong immune activation, these Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancers demonstrated lower overall numbers of somatic SNVs and indels, as well as fewer CNAs and lower HRD scores. This is opposite to what we might expect given the current paradigm for immune activation in cancer, where high tumour mutational burden generates a high neoantigen load, leading to immune activation via tumour antigen presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, suggesting that immune activation in this specific subset of Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancers may be governed by non-canonical mechanisms.</p><p id="P37">In our study, the cluster of Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancers characterized by high immune scores also displayed a notable association with specific immune cell types linked to adaptive immunity. This cluster exhibited a higher prevalence of immune cell populations associated with antigenic presentation and recognition pathways, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune activation in these tumours. Furthermore, we observed a lower number of immuno-suppressive M2 macrophages within this cluster, further supporting the notion of an immunologically active tumour microenvironment. These findings are consistent with the involvement of adaptive immune responses in promoting antitumor immunity in Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer.</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, our classifier subtyped Asian breast cancer into biologically distinct clusters which revealed that the clustering of Asian HR+/HER2- breast cancer is driven by immune phenotypes. These findings may be important because HR+ breast cancer is traditionally associated with a less immune active tumour microenvironment and thus less responsive to immunotherapy, but the findings from this study support other recent studies suggesting that a subset of HR+/HER2- breast cancer may be more likely to respond to immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1 to 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS192642-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1_to_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><caption><title>Differential expression analysis of MyBrCa Cluster 4 vs Cluster 7</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS192642-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAdEcC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><caption><title>Differential expression analysis of Hierarchical Cluster 1 vs Cluster 2</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS192642-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAdEdC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Cancer Research Malaysia receives charitable funding from the Scientex Foundation, Estée Lauder Companies, Vistage Malaysia, Yayasan PETRONAS, and Yayasan Sime Darby which contributed to the funding of this study.
