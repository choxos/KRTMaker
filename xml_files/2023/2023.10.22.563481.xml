Neutralisation capacity was weaker against Omicron versus WT both in Rituximab-treated patients and in healthy individuals.

By contrast, healthy individuals with hybrid immunity produced a broader antibody response, a subset of which recognised Omicron with higher affinity than antibodies in Rituximab-treated patients (median [range] K<sub>D</sub>: 1.05 [0.45-1.84] nM vs 20.25 [13.2-38.8] nM, p=0.0002), underpinning the stronger serum neutralisation capacity against Omicron in the former group. Rituximab-treated patients had similar anti-WT antibody levels and neutralisation titres to unvaccinated convalescent individuals, despite two more exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen.

Patients with autoimmune/inflammatory conditions on immunosuppressive therapy, particularly those on anti-CD20 therapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), are vulnerable to poorer clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including hospitalisation and death(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Given this, and the suboptimal humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination observed in those receiving anti-CD20 therapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), subsequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses i.e., “boosters”, have been recommended for these patient groups in several jurisdictions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), including those with primary systemic vasculitis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Humoral immune responses after primary vaccination using vaccines targeted against the original (ancestral, wild-type) strain of SARS-CoV-2 e.g., the mRNA vaccines Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or the adenovirus-vector based vaccines Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZ) or Ad26.COV2-S (Johnson&amp;Johnson), are often suboptimal among patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies. Specifically, titres of antibodies directed against the spike protein subunit (anti-spike IgG) and/or receptor binding domain (anti-RBD IgG) of SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of patients on anti-CD20 therapy who seroconvert following primary vaccination are lower compared to those not on such therapy and healthy controls(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Furthermore, of patients on anti-CD20 therapies who seroconvert after primary vaccination, many have lower neutralisation titres compared to those on other immunosuppressants and healthy controls(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Although neutralising antibody titres and, to a lesser extent, anti-spike IgG and anti-RBD IgG titres, derived from primary vaccination with vaccines targeting the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 correlate with protection against symptomatic infection from the ancestral virus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), significant reductions in the neutralisation capacity of these antibodies have been observed against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, such the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and the B.1.1.529 variant and its sublineages (Omicron)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), which harbour mutations in the spike protein that modify the critical domain for virus-neutralising antibodies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses following vaccination, which may be protective against severe infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), appear largely preserved among anti-CD20 treated patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) although the clinical significance of these responses in such patients remains unclear. Consequently, primary systemic vasculitis patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies may still be vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they develop antibodies following primary vaccination, particularly given the emergence of variants with humoral immune escape properties.</p><p id="P7">We have recently developed a novel immunoassay, microfluidic antibody affinity profiling (MAAP), for in solution quantification of the fundamental parameters of the antibody response, namely affinity and concentration, directly in serum(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and used it to characterise antibody profiles against wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent sera(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and to study the role of cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory reactivation after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). MAAP can distinguish samples containing low levels of high-affinity antibodies from samples with high levels of low-affinity antibodies, which would otherwise exhibit the same EC<sub>50</sub> (half-maximal effective concentration) using an ELISA-based technique(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Thus, MAAP may allow for a more granular assessment of antibody responses following antigen exposure and provide insights into the potency of the humoral response against emerging variants of concern. Nevertheless, a recent study exploring antibody profiles in pre-Omicron sera from largely immunocompetent patients with a variety of antigenic exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (including after one or more doses of WT vaccine or after infection or both) showed similar antibody affinities against Omicron versus WT or Delta Spike antigens, albeit the timing of serum sampling for antibody assessment in this study was widely variable(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Several recently published studies have assessed humoral responses following booster vaccination(s) among cohorts of patients with autoimmune/inflammatory conditions on anti-CD20 therapies, which have included vasculitis patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), although few have examined primary systemic vasculitis patients specifically(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The primary aim of this study was to perform in depth serological characterisation of antibody responses at pre-specified time points after repeated vaccination (specifically after second and third doses) against SARS-CoV-2 in pre-Omicron sera from Rituximab treated patients with primary systemic vasculitis. Along with serological profiling using solid-phase and neutralisation assays, we capitalised on our recently described microfluidics-based immunoassay to quantify antibody affinity and concentration against wild-type (WT) versus Omicron strains of SARS-CoV-2. We subsequently performed antibody profiling at equivalent time points in a cohort of healthy individuals after similar, repeated antigenic exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we compared the serological response to repeated vaccination in Rituximab treated patients to that in unvaccinated, convalescent patients after a single exposure to WT SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found suboptimal humoral immunity even after repeated vaccination in Rituximab treated patients and highlight the role of quantitative assessment of serum antibody affinity and concentration in monitoring anti-viral immunity, viral escape, and the evolution of the humoral response.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Cohort Description</title><p id="P9">Patients with primary systemic vasculitides were recruited from a prospective observational cohort study investigating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses among renal populations at the Department of Nephrology at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) (ethics reference: 20/EM/0180), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).

In brief, 100μg SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was re-suspended in H<sub>2</sub>O and mixed with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.3) buffer to a final concentration of 100mM. DMSO-reconstituted AlexaFluor™ 647 N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (ThermoFisher) was added at a 3-fold molar excess and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1h.

The patient demographics are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>. The majority of patients (79%) had Rituximab within 12 months prior to first vaccine dose and 64% had additional Rituximab between vaccine doses. Serological responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD, as assessed by an accredited Luminex immunoassay 4-6 weeks after each vaccine dose, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Overall, 57% of the cohort showed a positive anti-Spike response (median [range] MFI: 3,958 [59-22,509]) and 14% a positive anti-RBD response (median [range] MFI: 115 [46-2,437]) after the first vaccine dose. Seroconversion and Luminex MFI values increased significantly after the second vaccine dose, both against Spike (100% positive; median [range] MFI: 27,713 [9,047-32,716]; p&lt;0.0001 Mann-Whitney test) and RBD (71% positive; median [range] MFI: 5,301 [33-31,509]; p=0.0384 Mann-Whitney test), and remained stable after the third vaccine dose (100% anti-Spike positive; median [range] MFI: 27,356 [2,398-32,662]; p=0.5007 and 64% anti-RBD positive; median [range] MFI: 19,741 [127-32,331]; p=0.2915 between second and third vaccine doses; Mann-Whitney test). Notably, four patients showed consistently negative anti-RBD responses, and 42% of sera with significant anti-Spike antibody reactivity (n=33) were negative against SARS-CoV-2 RBD (n=14). Patients who received additional Rituximab between second and third vaccine doses (n=6) did not have significantly different antibody responses compared to those who did not (median [range] MFI after third vaccine: anti-Spike; 32,552 [9,047-32,716] versus 27,356 [13984-32,662], p=0.5368, anti-RBD; 19,176 [33-31,501.8] versus 26,931 [136-32,331], p=0.4286, Mann-Whitney tests).</p><p id="P18">Neutralising antibodies against WT were detectable in 50% of patients both after the second and third vaccine doses with, overall, similar 50% neutralising dose titres (ND<sub>50</sub>) between the two time points (median [range] ND<sub>50</sub> of 207 [20-2,254] versus 240 [20-7,468], p=0.5890 Mann-Whitney test). Nevertheless, individual patient responses after vaccination were variable with neutralising titres increasing in six patients, decreasing in three patients, whereas a further five patients did not develop neutralising antibodies after three vaccine doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To provide a more in depth analysis of serological responses in these patients, we further characterised anti-RBD antibodies by MAAP. Consistent with Luminex, MAAP showed that the affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) and concentration ([Ab]) of antibodies against WT RBD did not change significantly between the second and third vaccine doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). All neutralising sera were quantifiable by MAAP whereas non-neutralising sera could not be quantified either due to undetectable/low anti-RBD antibody levels (n=10, RBD MFI 33-3,440) or the inability to effectively constrain MAAP parameters (n=3, RBD MFI 5,301-19,741; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; one non-neutralising serum had a missing MFI and showed minimal binding on MAAP). Overall, the affinity of quantifiable anti-WT RBD antibodies ranged widely from 2.3 nM to 44.8 nM and in patients with increasing neutralisation titres after the third vaccine dose, this was driven predominantly by an increase in antibody concentration rather than improvement in affinity.</p><p id="P19">Analysis of serum antibody reactivity against the Omicron variant showed that only 3/14 (21%) and 4/14 (29%) patients developed neutralising antibodies after the second and third vaccine doses, respectively. Similar to WT, individual patient responses varied although more patients had measurable Omicron anti-RBD antibodies after the third vaccine dose (seven patients had an improved and three patients a worse response to Omicron RBD), as determined by MAAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Overall, the affinity of anti-Omicron RBD antibodies varied from 9.7-38.8 nM and their concentration from 56.5-1,080 nM with no significant difference in either parameter between the two time points.</p><p id="P20">Importantly, there was decreased neutralisation capacity against Omicron compared to WT both after the second and third vaccine doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). MAAP analysis showed that this difference was driven by significantly weaker antibody affinity to the Omicron versus WT RBD (median [range] K<sub>D</sub>: 21.6 [9.7-38.8] nM vs 4.6 [2.3-44.8] nM respectively, p=0.0004 Wilcoxon paired ranked test) rather than by differences in antibody concentration (median [range] [Ab]: 171 [56.5-1,080] nM vs 177 [43.7-952] nM respectively, p=0.2412, Wilcoxon paired ranked test), and this was consistent at both time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Overall, 14 (50%) samples had no neutralisation against either variant, whereas five patients did not develop neutralising antibodies at either timepoint. Taken together, the above results demonstrate that Rituximab treated patients developed widely variable antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 after repeated vaccination which, when quantifiable by MAAP, varied by 20-fold in affinity. Overall, neutralising antibody responses were often absent even after three vaccine doses; when present, neutralisation capacity was significantly weaker against Omicron versus WT SARS-CoV-2 strains and this difference was driven by the weaker affinity of vaccine induced antibodies against the Omicron strain.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling in healthy individuals versus Rituximab treated patients</title><p id="P21">We next hypothesised that the quality of the antibody response would vary significantly in healthy individuals compared to Rituximab treated patients following antigenic exposure to SARS-CoV-2. To investigate this, we profiled antibody responses in health care workers (HCW) recruited at Cambridge University Hospital who, similar to the vasculitis cohort, had three exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen, consisting of an asymptomatic infection to SARS-CoV-2 prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant and two subsequent vaccine doses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). Antibody profiling was performed at 4 weeks after the third exposure (second vaccine dose). Luminex analyses showed significantly higher antibody reactivity to WT Spike and RBD in HCW versus Rituximab treated patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Similar to Rituximab treated patients, neutralisation titres in HCW were significantly higher against the WT versus the Omicron variant. Further profiling by MAAP suggested this difference was driven by the fact only a fraction of high affinity serum antibodies recognised the Omicron RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Compared to Rituximab treated patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), MAAP quantifiable antibodies to WT SARS-CoV-2 in the HCW cohort were of higher concentration (median [range] [Ab] of 236.5 [49.5-952] nM vs 646 [233-2,110] nM, respectively, p=0.0018 Mann-Whitney test) but of similar affinity (median [range] K<sub>D</sub> of 4.6 [2.3-44.8] nM vs 4.7 [1.2-19.0] nM, respectively, p=0.5825 Mann-Whitney test) underpinning the higher neutralisation titres in the HCW cohort (median [range] ND<sub>50</sub> of 49 [20-7,468]) versus 2,522 [864-7,297], p=0.0004 Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Neutralisation titres against the Omicron strain were also higher in HCW versus Rituximab treated patients (median [range] ND<sub>50</sub> of 221.5 [24.63-1,225] versus 20 [20-648.7], respectively, p=0.003 Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) but this was driven by higher affinity anti-Omicron RBD antibodies in the HCW cohort (median [range] K<sub>D</sub>: 1.05 [0.45-1.84] nM vs 20.25 [13.2-38.8] nM, p=0.0002 Mann-Whitney test). Taken together, our results confirm the previously reported impaired antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Rituximab treated, immunosuppressed patients compared to healthy individuals and, through MAAP analysis, highlight the significance of the fundamental parameters of the antibody response, namely antibody affinity and concentration, to anti-viral immunity and virus escape.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Evolution of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 after infection and vaccination</title><p id="P22">In the microfluidic-based antibody profiling of the Rituximab patient cohort described above, we could not detect evidence of affinity maturation in peripheral blood samples collected after the second compared to third vaccine doses, despite a median of 185 days (range 141-224 days) between the two time points. To investigate whether this observation was specific to the Rituximab treated patients, we next examined the quality of the humoral response after WT SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic using samples collected at one and three months post infection (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">methods</xref>). The demographic characteristics of this cohort (n=30) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, we observed wide variation in affinity (K<sub>D</sub> range 2.07-34.0 nM) and concentration (range 7.1-1,120 nM) of the antibody responses to WT RBD at both time points. As expected, there was a significant decrease in antibody concentration over time (median [range]: 55.6 [7.1-269] nM at 3 months vs 169 [13-1,120] nM at 1 month post-infection, p=0.0034, Wilcoxon paired ranked test) and an associated decrease in neutralisation capacity (median [range] ND<sub>50</sub> of 131 [20-7,983] versus 280 [20-14,580], respectively, p=0.0296, Wilcoxon paired ranked test). Nevertheless, we were able to detect evidence of affinity maturation over the same time period, as demonstrated by a decrease in anti-RBD dissociation constant in the majority of patients (median [range] K<sub>D</sub>: 6.6 [2.1-14.6] nM at 3 months vs 9.4 [2.1-34] nM at 1 month post-infection, p=0.0244, Wilcoxon paired ranked test). Luminex analysis of antibody reactivity to WT Spike and RBD showed significantly higher responses at one month after infection in the convalescent cohort compared to one month after the first vaccine dose in the Rituximab cohort; these antibodies in Rituximab treated patients reached similar levels to those in the convalescent cohort after the second and third vaccine doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 4D-E</xref>). Comparison of the convalescent cohort at one month post-infection with the Rituximab treated patient cohort at equivalent time points after the second and third vaccine dose showed similar neutralisation titres against WT SARS-CoV-2 despite exposure to only a single sensitisation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Corroborating these findings, quantification of WT anti-RBD responses by MAAP showed similar antibody affinity and concentration after the second and third vaccine dose in Rituximab treated patients compared to those in post-infection convalescent patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Multidimensional assessment of antibody fingerprints (concentration and affinity) with clinical parameters at the individual patient level</title><p id="P23">To provide a global perspective of antibody affinity/concentration profiles against WT and Omicron variants, we created integrated 2D-density contour plots incorporating MAAP data obtained from the above three patient groups (Rituximab treated vasculitis patients ~1 month after the third vaccine dose vs health care workers ~1 month after the third sensitisation event vs COVID-19 convalescent patients ~1 month post-infection). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, HCW clustered separately (high affinity and high [Ab] profiles), whereas the density representations for Rituximab treated and convalescent patients were wider and largely overlapping. As discussed above, a left shift of antibody profiles to the Omicron variant was apparent in Rituximab patients with significantly lower affinity compared to anti-Omicron profiles in the HCW cohort. The relationship of antibody fingerprints with clinically relevant parameters showed that the K<sub>D</sub> x [Ab] product was similar between female and male patients, whereas a weak negative correlation was noted with increasing age for anti-WT antibody profiles (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ=-0.67, p=0.0012; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>). For convalescent patients, the K<sub>D</sub> x [Ab] product tended to be higher in patients with more severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We next incorporated serological parameters (MAAP affinity/concentration, Luminex MFI, ND<sub>50</sub>) with relevant immunological and demographic variables (SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccine dose, patient cohort, age, sex and ethnic background) to provide a comprehensive multidimensional assessment at the single-individual level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>), which highlighted the strength of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response (higher ND<sub>50</sub>, [Ab], Luminex anti-Spike and anti-RBD MFI) in healthy individuals, compared to Rituximab treated and convalescent patients. We also related antibody WT SARS-CoV-2 serological read-outs obtained from neutralisation, MAAP and Luminex assays, which showed a strong correlation between ND<sub>50</sub> and antibody concentration or ND<sub>50</sub> and Luminex RBD MFI (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ=0.74, p=8.1x10<sup>-12</sup> and ρ=0.81, p=5.5x10<sup>-24</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B-C</xref>) but no relationship between ND<sub>50</sub> or Luminex RBD MFI with antibody affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 5</xref>). These observations suggest that neutralisation and solid-phase Luminex assays primarily reflect antibody concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 5C</xref>) rather than affinities for MAAP quantifiable samples analysed here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">In this study, primary systemic vasculitis patients treated with Rituximab had significantly impaired humoral immune responses compared to healthy individuals after three exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, demonstrated by lower anti-Spike and -RBD antibody levels and lower neutralisation titres against both wildtype and Omicron variants. Despite an incremental increase in antibody levels after the second vaccine dose, no further enhancement of the response was noted after a third dose. Correspondingly, after a third vaccine dose, approximately half and two thirds of Rituximab patients had no detectable neutralising antibodies against WT and Omicron, respectively. Relative to unvaccinated convalescent individuals, Rituximab treated patients had similar anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibody levels and similar (albeit numerically lower) neutralisation titres to WT SARS-CoV-2, despite two more exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Antibodies produced by Rituximab treated patients varied by 20-fold of magnitude in affinity, and the difference in neutralisation capacity between Omicron and WT SARS-CoV-2 was driven by the weaker affinity of vaccine induced antibodies against the Omicron variant. By contrast, healthy individuals with hybrid immunity in the form of previous infection and two vaccinations produced a broader, high concentration antibody response as profiled using MAAP, a subset of which recognised Omicron RBD with higher affinity than antibodies in Rituximab treated patients, likely underpinning the more effective neutralisation capacity against Omicron in this group compared to Rituximab treated patients. Finally, we demonstrate that MAAP can assess the evolution of humoral immune responses by direct measurement of polyclonal antibody affinity in serum, without the need for antigen-specific B cell isolation and antibody sequencing or measurement of antibody dissociation kinetics in solid-phase assays that can be perturbed by avidity-driven interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Accordingly, we detected evidence of affinity maturation within three months from primary infection in convalescent patient sera despite a relative decrease in anti-RBD antibody concentration. This was not evident in Rituximab treated patients even after a third vaccine dose.</p><p id="P26">Our findings of impaired humoral immune responses after a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in our primary systemic vasculitis patient cohort receiving anti-CD20 therapies are in agreement with the recently published literature, although we are unaware of any other groups who have quantified these using a combination of neutralisation assays and MAAP. A recently published study of 21 patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis (AAV) showed that none of their 8 Rituximab-treated patients had detectable neutralising antibodies to B.1.617.2 (Delta) following a third dose of BNT162b(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). By contrast, in a small cohort of 15 AAV patients on Rituximab who received a third vaccine dose, 7/15 (46.7%) developed measurable IgG antibodies to the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, although the neutralisation capacity of these antibodies was not assessed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Humoral immune responses following a third vaccine dose among patients on anti-CD20 therapies with other autoimmune/inflammatory conditions are also impaired compared to similar patients on other immunosuppressive agents and healthy controls(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Additionally, among patients on anti-CD20 therapies who had not seroconverted following primary vaccination, a third dose led to seroconversion rates of approximately 15-60%(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Another small study demonstrated an inverse correlation between Rituximab dose and seroconversion and that antibody levels persisted after a subsequent dose of Rituximab among those who had already seroconverted(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). A fall in antibody levels following a dose of Rituximab between a second and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was recently reported, although neutralisation capacity was preserved in seroconverted patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). In an open-label study of a fourth dose of mRNA vaccine among Rituximab treated patients, predominantly those with rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue diseases, a moderate improvement in seroconversion from 33% to 58% was demonstrated after the fourth dose(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Among the patients in our cohort with detectable anti-Spike antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the impact of Rituximab on B cell populations, particularly memory B cells, may be of relevance to their impaired neutralising ability and affinity maturation compared to healthy controls. Memory B cells, in addition to enabling anamnestic antibody responses, also allow for the development of reactive humoral responses in the event of exposure to variant pathogens(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). After vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells have been shown to persist for several months, even after antibody titres have declined(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Furthermore, a third dose of mRNA vaccine has been shown to increase the breadth and potency of memory B cells and their antibody responses, including against Omicron(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Following Rituximab treatment, memory B cells are often the last to reconstitute among peripheral blood B cell populations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), a process that can take up to several years(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Additionally, Rituximab treatment has also been associated with delays in the acquisition of somatic hypermutations among repopulated memory B cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Recent data suggest that the presence of detectable peripheral circulating B cells is critical for seroconversion following vaccination among Rituximab treated patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), with SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cell and plasmablast populations positively correlating with antibody titres and neutralisation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Furthermore, a preponderance of naïve and transitional B cells among Rituximab-treated patients prior to vaccination, indicative of early B cell reconstitution, was found to be associated with adequate humoral immune responses following vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). In support of this, improved serological responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been associated with increasing time since the last Rituximab dose, particularly if this interval is more than six months(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Notably in our cohort, 36% of patients received Rituximab within 6 months from the first vaccine dose and 64% received an additional Rituximab dose between first and third vaccine dose potentially accounting for the lack of improvement in the humoral response and the absence of affinity maturation between second and third vaccine doses.</p><p id="P28">A strength of our study is that we prospectively evaluated antibody responses at specific time points in a relatively understudied cohort of primary systemic vasculitis patients who are particularly vulnerable to both poorer clinical outcomes from COVID-19 and impaired humoral immune responses after vaccination. Importantly, by quantifying antibody affinity and concentration directly in serum, together with data from solid-phase Luminex and neutralisation assays, we were able to provide additional insights into the quality of the immune response against WT and Omicron variants after vaccination in Rituximab treated patients. Additionally, we provide a comparative assessment with the humoral response at equivalent time points in non-immunocompromised cohorts after infection/vaccination and after infection only. In this regard, this is the largest study to date using a novel microfluidic assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibody affinity and concentration in serum samples. The limitations of our investigations reside in the relatively small number of Rituximab treated patients included in the study and the lack of a pre-Omicron control group of previously uninfected healthy individuals with three vaccinations. It would have also been informative to incorporate analysis on antigen-specific T cell and B cell mediated cellular immunity and how this may relate to the observed serological response. Finally, the limits of sensitivity of the MAAP assay should be noted. These reflect the lower limit of labelled antigen concentration that can be employed owing to intrinsic background serum fluorescence and the fact that antibody affinity and concentration cannot be constrained in samples with low concentration and/or low affinity antibodies (e.g. where [Ab] &lt; K<sub>D</sub>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In conclusion, our results confirm and enrich the previously reported observations of impaired humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, in Rituximab treated, immunosuppressed patients compared to healthy individuals. Through the addition of MAAP analysis, we highlight the significance of the fundamental parameters of the antibody response, namely antibody affinity and concentration, to anti-viral immunity and viral escape. Consequently, should our results be replicated, we would caution against interpreting the presence of solid-phase assay detected anti-Spike antibodies following vaccination as providing evidence of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly among patients on anti-CD20 therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS190128-supplement-Supplementary.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d22aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded in part by the University of Cambridge’s Wellcome COVID-19 Rapid Response DCF (RG93172 to VK).
