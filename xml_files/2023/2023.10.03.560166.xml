It comprises medial temporal (MT), core, and fronto-temporal (FT) subsystems, but its functional organisation is unclear: the requirement for perceptual coupling versus decoupling, input modality (visual/verbal), type of information (social/spatial) and control demands all potentially affect its recruitment. We examined the effect of these factors on activation and deactivation of DMN subsystems during semantic cognition, across four task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, and localised these responses in whole-brain state space defined by gradients of intrinsic connectivity. FT showed activation consistent with a central role across domains, tasks and modalities, although it was most responsive to abstract, verbal tasks; this subsystem uniquely showed more ‘tuned’ states characterised by increases in both activation and deactivation when semantic retrieval demands were higher. MT also activated to both perceptually-coupled (scenes) and decoupled (autobiographical memory) tasks, and showed stronger responses to picture associations, consistent with a role in scene construction. Core DMN consistently showed deactivation, especially to externally-oriented tasks. These diverse contributions of DMN subsystems to semantic cognition were related to their location on intrinsic connectivity gradients: activation was closer to sensory-motor cortex than deactivation, particularly for FT and MT, while activation for core DMN was distant from both visual cortex and cognitive control. These results reveal distinctive yet complementary DMN responses: MT and FT support different memory-based representations that are accessed externally and internally, while deactivation in core DMN is associated with demanding, external semantic tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Default mode network</kwd><kwd>Semantics</kwd><kwd>Activation and deactivation</kwd><kwd>Functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Default mode network (DMN) – with distributed components across medial and lateral frontal, parietal and temporal cortex – was initially characterized as task negative: it deactivates in attention-demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>) and shows anti-correlated intrinsic connectivity with dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). However, DMN can couple with visual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) and it supports both perceptually-decoupled states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Christoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Konu et al., 2020</xref>) and aspects of externally-oriented cognition, including semantic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2016</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Spreng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Vatansever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A contemporary topographical perspective suggests these diverse functions might reflect DMN’s maximal distance from unimodal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). This view emerges from whole-brain decompositions of intrinsic connectivity, termed ‘gradients’, which capture key features of cortical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">McKeown et al., 2020</xref>). The principal gradient, explaining the most variance, captures the separation of heteromodal DMN from sensory-motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) and correlates with physical distance from sensory-motor landmarks on the cortical surface. The second gradient relates to the distinction between visual and motor cortex, while the third gradient reflects the division within heteromodal cortex between controlled and less controlled responses. DMN’s position on the principal gradient far from sensory-motor cortex might support perceptually decoupled states. However, DMN’s position at the end of multiple processing streams might also facilitate the coordination and abstraction of higher-order representations.</p><p id="P4">DMN also contains subsystems associated with different cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>): (i) Medial temporal (MT) DMN is linked to episodic memory and scene construction; (ii) core DMN with self-referential and perceptually-decoupled cognition; while (iii) fronto-temporal (FT) DMN is thought to support abstract, semantic and social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021</xref>). These subnetworks suggest a complex functional organisation, the principles of which are still not fully understood. While tasks eliciting FT activation are often semantic and tasks eliciting MT and core activation often involve episodic retrieval, there are multiple confounds in this contrast: semantic cognition is typically more perceptually coupled (involving access to meaning from visual inputs), abstract (involving verbal or categorical representations, as opposed to reconstructions of places and events) and controlled (involving more ambiguous decisions about information in the absence of recent exposure, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vatansever et al., 2021</xref>). These dimensions might affect activation and deactivation in DMN subsystems in distinct ways, with all three subnetworks supporting semantic cognition if task demands are configured appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Humphreys et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vatansever et al., 2021</xref>). Functional differences between the DMN subnetworks might also reflect the location of activating and deactivating voxels in gradient space, as the gradients relate to these frequently confounded cognitive dimensions, including abstraction (principal gradient), the balance of sensory-motor inputs (second gradient) and control demands (gradient three). Moreover, the existence of a core DMN network remains controversial since MT and FT subsystems show interdigitated connectivity in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Braga &amp; Buckner, 2017</xref>): core DMN may reflect inadequate spatial resolution and/or the integration of informational states across the other subsystems.</p><p id="P5">This study delineates the role of DMN subsystems in semantic cognition, examining effects of perceptual coupling versus decoupling (in a comparison of reading and autobiographical memory retrieval), modality (words/pictures), abstractness, feature type (valance/spatial) and control demands. We characterise local activation and deactivation, since both are relevant to cognition: connectivity with control regions can increase in demanding semantic decisions even as DMN deactivates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2016</xref>) and multivariate analysis reveals semantic goals are represented in “task-negative” regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Deactivation may benefit cognition by suppressing inputs that are irrelevant to the task or context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amedi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Azulay et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we examine activating and deactivating voxels within each subsystem for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P6">The present study investigated DMN activity in 5 independent published fMRI datasets.

Testing occurred across two consecutive days (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> for task design). On Day 1, participants generated their own personal memories from cue words (i.e., Party) outside the scanner. They were asked to identify specific events that they were personally involved in and to provide as much detail about these events as they could, including when and where the event took place, who was involved, what happened, and the duration. They typed these details into a spreadsheet to ensure comparable information was recorded for the different cue words.</p><p id="P9">On the following day, participants were asked to read sentences for comprehension, or to recall their generated personal memories inside the scanner. In reading trials, sentences were presented word by word, after either (1) an autobiographical memory cue word (e.g., Party), creating conflict between reading and personal memory retrieval, or (2) a letter string (e.g., XXX) allowing reading to take place in the absence of conflict from autobiographical memory. We controlled the duration of the sentences by presenting the words on 15 successive slides, combining short words or articles and conjunctions together with nouns on a single slide. In memory recall trials, participants were asked to recall autobiographical memories during the presentation of either (1) meaningful yet unrelated sentences, creating conflict from task-irrelevant patterns of semantic retrieval or (2) letter strings (XXX) allowing autobiographical memory to take place without distracting semantic input. A baseline condition involved presenting meaningless letter strings (i.e., xxxxx) in the absence of a task.</p><p id="P10">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, each trial started with a fixation cross (1-3s) in the centre of the screen. Then either an autobiographical memory cue word or a letter string appeared for 2s. During the presentation of the cue word, participants were asked to recall their personal memories related to this item. Next, the task instruction (i.e., READING or MEMORY RECALL) was presented for 1s. Following that, words from sentences or letter strings were presented, with each one lasting 600ms. On memory recall trials, participants were asked to keep thinking about their autobiographical memory, in as much detail as possible, until the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Study 2: Word/picture semantic judgement task</title><p id="P11">The second study compared DMN recruitment across semantic tasks involving words and pictures and manipulated the difficulty of these decisions by contrasting strong and weak associations. A three alternative forced choice (3AFC) format was used for all conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> for example stimuli and task design). The verbal task involved auditory presentation of a probe word, and response options presented as written words. The picture task used photographs of the probes, targets and distracters.</p><p id="P12">Participants made easy and hard associative judgements: they were presented with a spoken word or picture probe, together with three word/picture response options on the screen and instructed to select the item most strongly related to the probe. The probes and targets either shared a strong association (for easy trials), or a weak association (for more difficult trials). For example, an easy association might involve the probe “duck”, and three answer choices such as lake–cigar–door. A harder trial would require participants to link “duck” with gun – an association that is less frequently encountered. Strong associations are thought to be retrieved relatively automatically, since the probe establishes a context that strongly anticipates the target; in contrast, for weak associations, control processes are needed to focus retrieval on non-dominant semantic features that are relevant to the linking context (e.g., a duck can be hunted; a gun is used for hunting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P13">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, each trial started with a fixation screen for a jittered interval (500–2000 ms) followed by the trial (probe and options). Participants were required to make a response, which triggered the next trial; if no response was given after 5 s, the experiment moved onto the next trial.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Study 3: Abstract/concrete word synonym judgement task</title><p id="P14">The third study examined DMN responses to abstract and concrete concepts in a synonym judgement task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> for task design, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref> for example stimuli). This study consisted of 200 trials (100 concrete and 100 abstract words); imageability was significantly higher for concrete than abstract words (t = 82, p &lt;.001). On each trial, participants were presented with a written probe word with three choices below it (a semantically related target and two unrelated foils), and the probe word, target word and two distractors had similar imageability ratings (i.e., abstractness) within each trial. They were asked to select the word that was most similar in meaning to the probe. Prior to each decision, participants were presented with a written cue consisting of two short sentences. On half of the trials, the cue ended with the probe word and placed it in a meaningful context (contextual cue condition). On the remaining trials, the cue did not contain the probe and was not related in meaning to the subsequent judgement (irrelevant cue condition). Participants were unaware when reading the cue whether it would be helpful for their next decision.</p><p id="P15">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, each trial began with a fixation cross presented in the centre of the screen for 500 ms, followed by the cue. Participants were instructed to read the cue carefully and to press a button on the response box when they had finished reading. The cue remained on screen for 5 s. The judgement probe and three choices were then presented and participants responded by pressing one of three buttons on a response box held in their right hand. The stimuli remained on screen for 4 s, at which point the next trial began. Stimuli were presented in blocks of two trials (total duration = 19 s) with the two trials in each block being taken from the same experimental condition. There were 150 blocks in total and blocks from different conditions were presented in a pseudo-random order. A fixation block of 19 s, in which no stimuli were presented, occurred after every five blocks of task.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Study 4: Emotional/spatial cues task</title><p id="P16">The fourth study examined semantic judgements about ambiguous words preceded by portrayals of facial emotions and spatial locations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> for task design and example stimuli). English homonyms with more than one meaning were selected as stimuli; they had different interpretations associated with different facial expressions (e.g. JAM with TRAFFIC is associated with frustration while JAM with STRAWBERRY is associated with pleasure) but also different locations (e.g. MOTORWAY for TRAFFIC JAM and SUPERMARKET for STRAWBERRY JAM). Four target words were generated for each probe, two for each interpretation. For instance, the probe jam appeared in four trials, twice paired with a target referring to traffic (jam-horn or jam-delay) and twice paired with a target referring to the alternative interpretation (jam-spoon or jam-bread).</p><p id="P17">Pictures of facial emotional expressions and spatial locations were used to prime the relevant meaning of the homonym. Each picture was used only once across the experiment, so that participants could not predict the subsequent probe word from the cue. Images of facial expressions were chosen from the Radboud Faces Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Langner et al., 2010</xref>) and included eight basic emotions: happy, angry, sad, disgusted, contemptuous, surprised, neutral, fearful. Pictures of spatial contexts were downloaded from Google images.</p><p id="P18">The experiment included 2-cue (emotion <italic>and</italic> location), 1-cue (either emotion <italic>or</italic> location) and no-cue (scrambled images) trials. The emotion and location cues were presented simultaneously in the 2-cue condition, while for the 1-cue conditions, images were paired with a meaningless scrambled image. The position of the emotion and location cues on the screen (on the left or right-hand side) was counterbalanced within each run. In the no-cue condition, two scrambled images were presented. We used this study to clarify the effect of emotion in driving DMN function; as such, only the 1-cue condition was relevant because each trial contained either an emotion <italic>or</italic> location cue, whereas the 2-cue condition contained both an emotion <italic>and</italic> a location cue for each trial (therefore, the 2-cue condition does not separate the two dimensions).</p><p id="P19">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, each trial began with a fixation cross (1500–3000 ms) followed by cue images for 1000 ms, and then a blank screen (1500–3000 ms). Following this, a probe word was presented above a target word and two unrelated distracters, triggering the onset of the decision-making period. The probe and choices remained visible for a fixed interval of 4000 ms. The assignment of the emotion-related and location-related distractors to the different conditions was counterbalanced within participants, such that each probe appeared twice with an emotion-related distractor and twice with a location-related distractor.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Study 5: Resting-state scan</title><p id="P20">Participants took part in a 9-minute resting-state fMRI scan. They were instructed to focus on a fixation cross with their eyes open, and not to think about anything in particular. A structural scan was also obtained in the same session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Analysis of the percentage of activated/deactivated voxels</title><p id="P21">To understand the role of subdivisions of DMN in semantic tasks, we extracted numbers of activating and deactivating voxels, relative to the implicit baseline, for each participant within three DMN subsystems – medial temporal (MT), core (Core) and fronto-temporal (FT) – across the four fMRI datasets described above, which contrasted internally-oriented (recall) and externally-oriented (reading) states (Study 1), input modalities (picture/verbal; Study 2), the concreteness of words (abstract/concrete; Study 3) and the nature of cues in semantic decisions (emotion/location; Study 4). The implicit baseline consisted of periods of unmodelled time, for example, between blocks of trials, in which participants were not instructed to do anything. Although “resting periods” are not an ideal baseline for semantic activation (and deactivation), given that semantic cognition will continue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Binder et al., 1999</xref>), here this approach provided an opportunity to compare responses across studies to relatively common baseline. The networks of interest were defined using the Yeo et al. 17-network parcellation of 1000 resting-state fMRI datasets projected into individual space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P22">In the analysis presented in the main body, individual activation maps were thresholded at z=1.96 and activating/deactivating voxels were represented as a percentage of voxels in each subsystem. Confirmatory analyses using different thresholds (z=2.3; z=2.6) are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref> and showed similar effects. The advantage of this method is that it can reveal brain areas in which voxels both activate and deactivate in response to task demands; this pattern might correspond to a more specific response or connection pattern during a task which cannot be identified if activation levels are averaged across all the voxels within a region. The more standard univariate approach, averaging across voxels, is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for comparison.</p><p id="P23">Repeated-measures ANOVAs examined interactions of task by network for activated and deactivated voxels separately. These were followed by analyses of each network separately. When necessary, we also report <italic>post-hoc</italic> Bonferroni-corrected t-tests to characterise task interactions within networks. We also identified the typical location of activating and deactivating voxels by adding together the individual-level maps of all conditions across four studies and thresholding these combined maps at 20% percent of all datasets.

For the group-level analysis, we extracted seed-to-voxel functional connectivity at rest for 176 participants and performed contrasts between the functional connectivity maps from activating and deactivating seeds across the different subsystems (i.e., MT versus Core, FT versus Core, MT versus FT). Group-level analyses in CONN used a voxel threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and were cluster-size FWE corrected at p &lt;.05 (two-sided tests, Bonferroni corrected to p &lt;.017 to account for the three contrasts).

Gradient 1 (the principal gradient, explaining the most variance) differentiates the connectivity patterns of heteromodal DMN (with positive values) and sensory-motor regions (with negative values).

Left angular gyrus was the site that most reliably showed both activating and deactivating voxels, which might relate to response ‘tuning’, as specific task-irrelevant representations or connectivity patterns are suppressed (see Studies 2 and 3). In this way, we replicated and extended previous observations that left anterior temporal cortex shows activation in semantic tasks, while angular gyrus deactivates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Humphreys et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Functional connectivity of the commonly activated and deactivated DMN regions</title><p id="P51">To understand how areas of activation and deactivation in each DMN subnetwork are functionally connected with the whole brain, we examined functional connectivity at rest.

This might reflect the key importance of visual codes in the MT subsystem, and perceptual decoupling in Core DMN. Finally, activating voxels in the MT subsystem were closer to the controlled end of Gradient 3 than deactivating voxels, while the reverse was found for Core DMN (again, no difference for FT).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P57">By applying a novel method that examines both activating and deactivating voxels, our study reveals the contribution of DMN subsystems to semantic cognition, and how this is influenced by perceptual decoupling, input modality, abstractness, and spatial versus emotional features. None of the DMN variants were exclusively task negative. Instead, the recruitment of DMN subsystems varied according to the need to maintain information in memory that differs from inputs in the external world, and the requirement to represent visuospatial and abstract conceptual information. Although DMN can be characterized as a unitary whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), the three subsystems played distinct and complementary roles in semantic cognition which were related to their different locations on a multidimensional space defined by whole-brain gradients of connectivity. Core DMN showed both activating and deactivating voxels during autobiographical memory and when semantic retrieval followed the presentation of earlier information maintained in working memory. It showed almost exclusive voxel deactivation when new trials were presented in the absence of a meaning-based context; this subsystem was also relatively far from unimodal, visual and control regions in gradient space. MT was recruited in internally-oriented tasks involving visual-spatial imagery (autobiographical memory) and by pictorial semantic tasks; it was closer than core DMN to visual and control regions. FT showed more voxel activation for abstract verbal semantic processing and overlapping regions of task activation and deactivation; both activating and deactivating voxels were more numerous during more demanding semantic tasks, suggesting that semantic responses or patterns of cortical connectivity in this subsystem are “tuned” in the face of higher semantic control demands.</p><p id="P58">Our results align well with a recent topographic account suggesting that the diverse roles of the DMN relate to its spatial location on the cortical mantle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). In general, this network is distant from sensory-motor cortex on the principal gradient, and this position is suited to cognition that is perceptually-decoupled from the changing external environment or that builds on previously-presented information (for example, when decisions follow sentence cues): we observed this type of response in core DMN. However, this position on the principal gradient also places the DMN at the end of a processing stream (or streams) that allows the integration of features, giving rise to heteromodal representations that support cognition that is both guided by memory and driven by new sensory inputs: we observed this type of response in FT and MT DMN.</p><p id="P59">The responses we observed for core DMN are broadly in line with a ‘perceptual decoupling’ view of the DMN and not with a ‘task-negative’ view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Although core DMN showed more deactivation than the MT and FT subsystems across multiple semantic tasks, demonstrating that this subnetwork decouples from visual and attentional states (even during long-term memory retrieval in some circumstances), the numbers of activating and deactivating voxels were more similar when the task involved sustaining meaningful information over time. The ability of core DMN to support conceptual information that is distinct from the unfolding sensory environment might be supported by its greater distance from unimodal and visual ends of the gradients compared with other subnetworks. The functional importance of this distance from visual cortex is also supported by our finding that activating voxels in core DMN were on average more distant from visual cortex than deactivating voxels. Moreover, the observation that core DMN voxels can activate over baseline during the maintenance of contextual information as well as during autobiographical memory retrieval is corroborated by recent studies showing core DMN responds when decisions are guided by working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">2019</xref>), as well as showing stronger responses during autobiographical memory when participants report being more focussed on the task and not distracted by concurrent visual input (Zhang et al., 2021). These findings taken together indicate that core DMN is not task-negative, but supports states in which attention is directed towards internally-maintained information.</p><p id="P60">The MT subsystem showed stronger activation for autobiographical memory, pictorial semantic judgements, and semantic decisions following scene cues. These findings are consistent with the view that this subsystem is recruited when integrating visual-spatial information, and contributes to scene construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews-Hanna and Grilli, 2021</xref>). The MT subsystem reliably showed activation in bilateral medial temporal regions, consistent with previous studies showing these regions are important for thinking about events that happened in a specific place and time during episodic retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hassabis &amp; Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hassabis, Kumaran, and Maguire, 2007</xref>). Moreover, intrinsic connectivity of activated regions within MT revealed stronger coupling with the visual end of the second gradient than other DMN subsystems. The role of MT in visual-spatial tasks might be enhanced by this subsystem’s relative proximity to unimodal and visual ends of the gradients, given that activating voxels were closer to visual cortex than deactivating voxels, in a reversal of the pattern for core DMN. Therefore, although core and MT subsystems are both implicated in episodic, internal states such as autobiographical memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Andrews-Hanna, 2012</xref>), task activation in these subnetworks has opposite relationships with visual coupling.The FT subsystem showed stronger activation for words than pictures and for abstract than concrete words, yet equivalent responses for reading and autobiographical memory, and for semantic decisions following location and emotion cues, suggesting a role in abstract conceptual processing, irrespective of semantic content or whether tasks are internally- or externally-oriented. Activating voxels in FT were situated between MT and Core on the heteromodal-to-unimodal gradient, in line with this subsystem’s recruitment in both externally-driven abstract semantic tasks and internal tasks such as autobiographical memory. Task-induced increases in activation and deactivation were also stronger for more demanding semantic judgements, suggesting that semantic representations are maintained in a “tuned” state when task demands are higher, and suggesting that deactivation is not task-irrelevant; instead, deactivation could suppress irrelevant features, input modalities and patterns of connectivity (Gouws et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>); or improve the processing efficiency and/or reduce the physiological cost of task responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Szinte and Knapen, 2020</xref>). Left AG within the FT subsystem showed the most reliable activation and deactivation overlap across tasks, indicating the sensitivity of this site to changing task demands: this region may support diverse tasks by flexibly gating its connections, consistent with previous evidence showing it contains ‘echoes’ of many other networks and dynamically modulates its response to suit the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Spreng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Vatansever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dixon et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P61">Interestingly, we observed that the presentation of irrelevant information (effects of conflict in Study 1 and irrelevant cues in Study 3) did not modulate the response of the DMN subsystems, while the difficulty of semantic retrieval (effects of association strength in Study 2 and abstractness in Study 3) generated both increases <italic>and</italic> decreases in activation in FT. This corroborates the growing view that DMN deactivation cannot be distilled down to difficulty, but is more likely to reflect selective integration of relevant semantic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>), which is needed to identify a specific linking context for weak associations or the precise meaning of an abstract word.</p><p id="P62">There are of course some important limitations of this research. First, we used a restricted range of tasks that focussed on semantic cognition; future research is needed to establish if the pattern observed here is replicated in other domains, such as episodic memory and social cognition. Given that we found involvement of all three subsystems in semantic cognition, with variation across them reflecting representational and input processing demands, we might expect parallel findings in any domain in which these cognitive dimensions can be manipulated, in line with our observation that MT supports picture and scene-based semantic processing as well as episodic memory, while FT supports both reading and autobiographical memory. Another limitation is that different participants were tested on each task; therefore, we cannot explore the extent to which different patterns of recruitment reflect task effects as opposed to individual differences. Studies probing DMN recruitment within the same subjects would be able to establish if there are spatially-correlated patterns of activation and deactivation related to perceptual decoupling, visuo-spatial memory and abstract cognition across tasks: for example, do patterns in FT linked to verbal versus picture-based semantic retrieval also predict the differences between abstract and concrete words? Despite these limitations, our study provides important constraints on theories of DMN functioning.</p><p id="P63">In conclusion, we show that DMN subsystems play complementary roles in semantic cognition that are related to their distinctive connectivity patterns, captured by their location within a multi-dimensional space defined by spatially-overlapping cortical gradients. None of these DMN variants was task negative; instead, their recruitment varied according to the need to allocate attention to external inputs in service of a task, and to represent visuospatial and abstract conceptual information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures and tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS189153-supplement-Supplemental_figures_and_tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d141aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the European Research Council (Project ID: 771863 – FLEXSEM to EJ).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P64"><bold>Conflict of interest statement</bold></p><p id="P65">The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="R1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amedi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Malach</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fau -

Statement</title></caption><p>We delineate the functional organisation of DMN in semantic cognition, examining effects of perceptual coupling versus decoupling, input modality (visual/verbal), domain (social/spatial) and control demands across DMN subsystems in four fMRI datasets. These subsystems played complementary roles in semantic cognition related to their locations on gradients of intrinsic connectivity. Medial temporal and frontotemporal subsystems supported visuospatial and abstract conceptual information respectively, across both internally and externally-focussed tasks, while deactivation in core DMN was associated with focussed and externally-oriented semantic states. We conclude that both content and process are relevant to the functional architecture of DMN in semantic cognition.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Panel A</bold> shows the example of task procedures of reading or autobiographical memory (recall) tasks (Study 1). <bold>Panel B</bold> shows the percentage of activating or deactivating voxels in reading or autobiographical memory (recall) tasks.
