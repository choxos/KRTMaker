To gain new insights into functions of the ULK1 holo-complex in autophagy regulation, we generated a deep ULK1 complex interactome by combining affinity purification- and proximity labelling-mass spectrometry of all four ULK1 complex members: ULK1, ATG13, ATG101 and RB1CC1/FIP200. Under starvation conditions, the ULK1 complex interacts with several protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases implying the formation of a signalosome. Interestingly, also several selective autophagy receptors interact with ULK1 indicating the activation of selective autophagy pathways by nutrient starvation. One effector of the ULK1 complex is the HSC/HSP70 co-chaperone BAG2, which regulates the subcellular localization of the VPS34 lipid kinase complex member AMBRA1. Depending on the nutritional status, BAG2 has opposing roles. In growth promoting conditions, the unphosphorylated form of BAG2 sequesters AMBRA1, attenuating autophagy induction. In starvation conditions, ULK1 phosphorylates BAG2 on Ser31, supporting its recruitment to the ER membrane and positively affecting autophagy flux.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionary-conserved lysosomal degradation pathway critical for cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Yamamoto et al., 2023</xref>). Autophagy is a constitutive process as well as a stress response which mainly fulfils cytoprotective functions. Its dysregulation is often observed in diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Klionsky et al., 2021</xref>). A hallmark of autophagy is the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of double membrane vesicles, autophagosomes, which enwrap cytoplasm destined for degradation. Autophagosome biogenesis can be classified by five phases: initiation, membrane nucleation, expansion, pore closure/maturation, and fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hu and Reggiori, 2022</xref>). Each phase is characterized by the involvement of specific genes and respective proteins which are regulated on transcriptional, translational, as well as posttranslational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Delorme-Axford and Klionsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Licheva et al., 2022</xref>). Immediately after a given stress stimulus, autophagosome initiation does not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis and is mainly regulated on a posttranslational level by a set of protein- and lipidkinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abeliovich et al., 2000</xref>). The serine/threonine kinase unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1, or its homolog ULK2), the mammalian homolog of yeast autophagy-regulated (Atg) 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Young et al., 2006</xref>), is the most proximal protein kinase specifically regulating canonical autophagosome biogenesis. The catalytic subunit ULK1 along with ATG13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hosokawa et al., 2009a</xref>), and ATG101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hosokawa et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Mercer et al., 2009</xref>) forms an asymmetric complex with RB1CC1/FIP200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hara et al., 2008</xref>), with a 1:1:1:2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Upon autophagy induction, this complex is recruited to ER subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Karanasios et al., 2016</xref>), where it phosphorylates several proteins important for functional autophagy, amongst others members of the lipid kinase VPS34 complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mercer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mercer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Due to technical and methodological improvements, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches continue to generate new insights into ULK1-dependent signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mercer et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, we decided to employ state-of-the-art MS-based proteomics to revisit ULK1 complex protein-protein interactions. In contrast to the majority of published approaches which used classical affinity purification (AP)-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Joo et al., 2016</xref>), we used a combination of AP- and proximity labeling (PL)-MS to generate a deep interactome of the ULK1 holocomplex. PL-MS relies on the expression of proteins-of-interest fused to enzymes covalently transferring chemical groups to proximal proteins labeling so called protein neighborhoods. This supports the identification of weak transient interactions in a radius of 10-20 nm around bait proteins (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Siva Sankar and Dengjel, 2021</xref>)). Using this double strategy, we generated a comprehensive picture of ULK1 complex interactions characterizing common and subunit-specific interaction partners. Corroborating data from signaling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mercer et al., 2021</xref>), the function of ULK1 appears to be more complex, not only affecting autophagosome initiation, but also later phases of the organelle life cycle.</p><p id="P4">One protein that caught our attention and that was studied in detail is Bcl-2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), which interacts via its BAG domain with HSC/HSP70 proteins, acting as a nucleotide exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Takayama and Reed, 2001</xref>). BAG2 is a member of the evolutionary conserved BAG family, which in humans consists of six members BAG1-6. BAG proteins are suggested to act antiapoptotic and were shown to modulate proteasomal as well as autophagosomal protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kabbage and Dickman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Pattingre and Turtoi, 2022</xref>). BAG2 is widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Munthe et al., 1996</xref>) and localizes to various subcellular locations such as mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Qu et al., 2015</xref>), ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arndt et al., 2005</xref>), and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">de Paula et al., 2016</xref>). It seems to modulate the balance between chaperone-mediated protein folding and chaperone-mediated protein degradation, amongst others by inhibiting CHIP, an HSC/HSP70 chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arndt et al., 2005</xref>). Similar as BAG3 and BAG6, BAG2 was shown to promote mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Che et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ragimbeau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Tahrir et al., 2017</xref>) and reticulophagy via its interaction with the selective autophagy receptor (SAR) SQSTM1/p62 in the context of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Liang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In the current manuscript, we characterize BAG2 as ULK1 complex interactor, target and downstream effector, one of its autophagy-relevant clients being the VPS34- and E3 ubiquitin ligase complex-member Activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (AMBRA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Antonioli et al., 2017</xref>). Under growth conditions BAG2 sequesters AMBRA1 attenuating autophagy; however, upon autophagy activation, BAG2 translocates to ER subdomains supporting functional autophagy. Changes in the intracellular localization of BAG2 are regulated by ULK1 via phosphorylation of BAG2 at Ser31.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The ULK1 holo-complex interacts with selective autophagy receptors in starvation conditions</title><p id="P6">Protein-protein interactions of ULK1 complex members have been analyzed by AP- and PL-MS in low and high throughput studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Tu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Siva Sankar and Dengjel, 2021</xref>)). Depending on the exact experimental setup (e.g., AP of endogenous or tagged-proteins, tag localization), different sets of interaction partners might be identified. To generate a comprehensive overview of ULK1 complex interactions in one cell line under one physiological condition i.e., nutrient starvation, we decided to generate a deep ULK1 complex interactome by combining AP- and PL-MS of N- and C-terminal tagged fusion proteins. Firstly, using CRISPR/Cas9 we generated four HeLa knockout (KO) cell lines, one for each complex member i.e., ULK1, ATG13, ATG101 and FIP200, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As anticipated, all four cell lines exhibited a block in autophagy as analyzed by accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, loss of single complex members had differential effects on abundances of the other members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>): loss of FIP200 led to a downregulation of all the other complex members, supporting its central function in complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, loss of ATG101 and ULK1 led to compensatory effects and increased abundances of the other members. Loss of ATG13 had a positive effect on the abundance of FIP200 and negative effects on ULK1 and ATG101 abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Goodwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hosokawa et al., 2009b</xref>). These data imply that the holo-complex forms by preassembled subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of complex members also affected ULK1 activity differentially as analyzed by phosphosite-specific western blots against the ULK1 target site on ATG14, Ser29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, pATG14). Whereas knockout of ULK1, ATG13 and FIP200 led to reduced ATG14 phosphorylation, knockout of ATG101 did not. This implies that loss of ATG101 does not interfere with ULK1 complex assembly and activity per se, but rather negatively interferes with the recruitment of downstream components such as ATG9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>), which ultimately also leads to a block of functional autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In each KO cell line, we introduced an inducible expression system supporting the doxycyclin (dox)- controlled expression of either the respective N-terminal or C-terminal tagged protein-of-interest (POI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S1</xref>). As tag we used a combination of the peptide epitope of human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and the biotin ligase variant miniTurbo (MT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Branon et al., 2018</xref>), supporting both AP- and PL-analyses using a single setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics we determined the interactions of ULK1 complex members under starvation conditions (90 min of HBSS treatment), the classical stimulus for the induction of bulk autophagy, by comparing POI- to HA-MT-GFP-based enrichments as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). For each analysis i.e., AP- and PL-MS of N- and C-terminal tagged POI, we performed three biological replicates, which led to a total of 48 LC-MS/MS experiments, 24 AP- and 24 PL-MS studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Tables S1A-B</xref>). Biological replicates correlated well with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, range from 0.57-0.93). Interestingly, the PL-MS studies of ATG101 showed reproducibly the lowest correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, 0.57-0.78). ATG101 is with 25 kDa by far the smallest protein of the complex and the low correlation of transient interactions identified by PL-MS might indicate a high mobility of ATG101. High-confidence interactors were defined as proteins which were identified as significantly enriched compared to the MT-GFP negative control in minimally two AP- or two PL-MS experiments, respectively (Significance A, p&lt;0.05, BH corrected for PL-MS, see Methods for details). As expected, PL-MS analyses yielded more significantly enriched neighboring proteins compared to interactors identified by AP-MS, one exception being ATG101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The site of the tag did have an influence on the identified interactions in both approaches. The most prominent differences were observed for the PL-MS analyses of ATG101 and FIP200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Whereas the N-terminal tagged version of FIP200 revealed 34 neighboring proteins, only five neighbors were enriched with the C-terminal variant. This reduced efficiency might be linked to the structure of the ULK1 holo-complex, in which two FIP200 protomers form a homodimer via their C-terminal regions and claw domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Turco et al., 2019</xref>). The C-terminal tag might interfere with holo-complex formation. For ATG101 the C-terminal tagged variant yielded a higher number of potential neighbors, which might highlight a better accessibility compared to the N-terminal variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Qi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In total we identified 317 proteins as neighbors and interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplemental Table S1C-D</xref>). Compared to other published ULK1 complex interactomes we cover 65 of the known and characterize 252 new interactors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Tu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), the overlap of this study to the published works being larger than the overlap between these. As has been described for AP- and PL-MS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), both approaches are highly complementary and uncover different sets of interacting and neighboring proteins. Using our stringent selection criteria only 16 proteins i.e., ca. 5% of the entire dataset, were identified by both approaches, amongst them the four holo-complex members themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Intriguingly, the selective autophagy receptors (SARs) CCPG1, NBR1, and TAX1BP1 appear to interact closely with the ULK1 complex as they were among the 16 commonly enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Newman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In selective autophagy, the recruitment of the ULK1 complex to degradation-primed cargo via interaction between FIP200 and SARs has been recognized as a decisive event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Ohnstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Turco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), TAX1BP1 being the main driver by FIP200 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Turco et al., 2021</xref>). Our finding indicates that also under starvation-induced autophagy i.e., the prototypical stimulus of non-selective bulk autophagy, selective removal of cargo might take place.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The ULK1-complex forms a signaling hub</title><p id="P9">The best-known function of the ULK1 complex is the induction of autophagy. Other functions are less well understood; however, analyses of its molecular targets indicate that it regulates also later stages of autophagy, such as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sanchez-Martin et al., 2023</xref>), and that it may affect other pathways, ranging from glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Li et al., 2016</xref>) to mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Schmitz et al.,2021</xref>). Our deep interactome revealed that out of the 317 interactors, 102 interacted with minimally two complex members and 215 were member-specific interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As a quality check we scanned the interactome for proteins with known functions in autophagy and were able to generate a subnetwork of 31 proteins i.e., ca. 10% of the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These proteins were mainly linked to early events in autophagy, such as membrane nucleation (PIK3C3, ATG16L1) and expansion (ATG2B, ATG5, WIPI2), and to cargo recruitment. Next to the SARs mentioned above we identified p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Sanchez-Martin et al., 2019</xref>), interestingly only by AP-MS and not by PL-MS, as well as NCOA4 and FTH1, which regulate ferritin degradation and iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dowdle et al., 2014</xref>). This subnetwork highlights the successful enrichment of autophagy-relevant proteins and supports our experimental and data analysis pipeline with the aim of identifying new proteins being important in autophagy regulation.</p><p id="P10">The identified 317 proteins are linked to numerous subcellular localizations as well as to many functions, indicating a much broader role of ULK1 in shaping the cellular response to starvation. We would like to highlight some interesting observations using the presented data as a resource to generate new hypotheses: the wealth of interactions indicates that the ULK1 complex acts as a signaling hub i.e., forms a macromolecular signalosome. We identified the ULK1 complex as interacting with five protein-, two lipid-, and two metabolite-kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S2B</xref>). Whereas the PI3P generating kinase PIK3C3/VPS34 is a well-known target of ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Egan et al., 2015</xref>), it is not known if ULK1 also phosphorylates PIK3C2A, another PI3P generating kinase which has been shown to induce autophagy in response to shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boukhalfa et al., 2020</xref>). The alpha subunit of the inhibitor of NFκB kinase CHUK/IKKA has been shown to be degraded by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Tan et al., 2020</xref>) and to promote AMBRA1-ATG8 interaction in mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Di Rita et al., 2018</xref>); however, a direct crosstalk with ULK1 has not been described. This is also true for the tyrosine protein kinase YES1, which was shown to promote autophagy in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), and for the protein kinases CIT, PAK2 and TNK1, which have been linked amongst others to cytoskeleton regulation but not to autophagy.</p><p id="P11">The ULK1 complex also interacts with eleven regulatory phosphatase subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S2C</xref>). Four of these, PPP1R2, PPP6R3, PPP1R13L and STRN were identified by us as ULK1 targets, the PP2a regulatory subunit STRN being involved in positive feedback promoting the dephosphorylation and activation of ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we scanned the entire interactome for known ULK1 targets and generated a subnetwork consisting of the four complex members and 60 published target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alsaadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Joo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mercer et al., 2021</xref>). The network contains proteins related to autophagy (FDR=0.0129), such as p62, ATG16L1, WIPI2, but also many proteins related to cytoskeleton (FDR=0.00031) and intracellular transport (FDR=0.0071), indicating that ULK1 also regulates autophagosome trafficking. Taken together, we generated a comprehensive list of proteins interacting or being in close spatial proximity of the ULK1 holocomplex under starvation conditions. Many of these are ULK1 targets and can be related to autophagy regulation or signal transduction supporting the interpretation that ULK1 complexes form macromolecular signalosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The co-chaperone BAG2 is a ULK1 interactor which modulates functional autophagy</title><p id="P12">The HSC/HSP70 co-chaperone BAG2 caught our attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Takayama et al., 1999</xref>), as it was one of the 16 proteins that were identified by both AP- and PL-MS approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) and as it carries a potential ULK1 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).

BAG2 was shown to support p62-dependent reticulophagy in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected</italic> macrophages by interfering with the Beclin1/BCL2 interaction, releasing Beclin1 to support autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Liang et al., 2020</xref>); however, its role in classical starvation-induced autophagy and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.</p><p id="P13">As indicated above, we identified BAG2 as significant interaction partner of ULK1, ATG101 and ATG13 by MS analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), as well as by biotin-based AP-western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S1</xref>). To test if these interactions are potentially direct, we expressed BAG2 and the three ULK1 complex members in yeast and performed two-hybrid assays. Only in the case of the C-terminal domain of ULK1 (amino acids 827-1050, abbreviated as ULK1.827C) we observed activation of the <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic> reporter genes and, thus, growth on selective medium lacking histidine or adenine, indicating that the ULK1-BAG2 interaction is likely direct. The interactions of BAG2 with ATG13 and ATG101 might be indirect as we did not observe activation of the reporter genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figures S3</xref>). In ULK1 AP-MS experiments, BAG2 was enriched to a similar extent as the other complex members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To confirm these findings, we tested the interactions in a reverse co-AP of ectopically expressed tagged BAG2 followed by western blot analysis against ULK1 and ATG13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>, n=3). Starvation appeared to stabilize the interaction of BAG2 and ULK1; however, the difference was not statistically significant. As the BAG2-ATG13 interaction was similar in growth and in starvation conditions, we conclude that BAG2 is likely a constitutive interaction partner of the ULK1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next asked whether BAG2 supports functional autophagy. For this we generated (i) CRISPR/Cas9-based HeLa KO cells using single guide RNAs (for sgRNA sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">supplemental Table S2</xref>), and (ii) HeLa knockdown (KD) cells using a shRNA-based approach. With respect to KO cells, we generated two cell clones that were negative for BAG2 using limiting dilution. We first analyzed autophagy flux in KO cells monitoring MAP1LC3A/B (LC3) and GABARAP lipidation levels in the absence and presence of Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which blocks lysosomal acidification and thus inhibits lysosomal protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Both clones exhibited an accumulation of lipidated LC3 and GABARAP in the absence of BafA1, especially under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). As the maximal lipidation level under BafA1 treatment did not increase in BAG2 KO clones compared to wildtype (WT) cells, this led to a reduction in autophagosome turnover, i.e., autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). In KO cells, a decreased autophagy flux under starvation conditions was also observed by monitoring LC3 and p62 protein abundances by MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S4A</xref>), as well as by p62 puncta accumulation by immunofluorescence (IF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S4B-C</xref>). Interestingly in KD cells, we did not observe an accumulation of lipidated LC3 and GABARAP in the absence of BafA1 under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>), BAG2 KD leading to an increase in autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). This was also seen by employing the Halo-Tag reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Yim et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S4D-E</xref>), as well as by p62 puncta accumulation by IF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S4F-G</xref>). Thus, whereas chronic removal of BAG2 leads to reduced autophagy flux, acute removal leads to an increase in autophagy flux. To address this difference, we monitored autophagosome-lysosome fusion by analyzing p62-LAMP2 colocalization by IF. Whereas we observed an increase in p62-LAMP2 colocalization in WT cells when lysosomal acidification was blocked by BafA1, and when autophagy was induced by starvation, we failed to observe this in BAG2 KO cells, indicating that lysosomal targeting of autophagosomal cargo is perturbed by the chronic loss of BAG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S5A</xref>). In addition, <italic>BAG2</italic> KO cells exhibited a perturbed lysosome localization under basal conditions, with a loss of a perinuclear lysosomal network. In shRNA-mediated BAG2 KD cells, p62-LAMP2 colocalization behaved similarly to control cells using a scrambled shRNA indicating that lysosomal targeting of autophagosomal cargo is not perturbed by the acute loss of BAG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S5B</xref>). Taken together, the acute effect of loss of BAG2 is an increase in autophagy flux. Under prolonged absence in KO cells, loss of BAG2 appears to have secondary effects that interfere with vesicle trafficking leading to a reduction in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal miss-positioning, which leads to a net reduction of autophagy activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>BAG2 changes its intracellular localization/interaction partners in response to autophagy induction</title><p id="P15">Having established that BAG2 modulates autophagy, we next aimed to elaborate potential underlying mechanisms. For this, we expressed N-terminally HA-Streptactin (SHA)-tagged BAG2 in BAG2 KO cells by lentiviral infection and analyzed BAG2 interaction partners by AP-MS both in growth and in starvation conditions. In three biological replicates each, we identified 736 proteins as significantly enriched comparing SHA-BAG2-APs to respective negative controls i.e., doxycycline treated BAG2 knockout cells infected with a lentiviral control vector (total of 12 APs, q&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">supplemental Table S3A-C</xref>). This is a rather large number of potential interactors and likely reflects BAG2`s promiscuous function as HSC/HSP70 cochaperone being involved in numerous cell biological processes. Of these enriched proteins, 97 bound stronger in starvation and 27 stronger in growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, q&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">supplemental Table S3C</xref>). Analyzing enriched GO terms to identify stimulus-dependent alterations, it appears that BAG2 changes its subcellular localization upon starvation. Whereas we identified several tubulin subunits as enriched under growth conditions, indicating a microtubular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), in autophagy-inducing conditions, enriched proteins carried GO terms related to endomembranes, specifically to vesicle coat and scaffold proteins, such as the COPII coat protein SEC13 and the ER exit sites (ERES) marker SEC16A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Indeed, focusing on starvation-specific proteins which carry the GO term “endomembrane system” we were able to generate a protein interaction network of 46 proteins using STRING DB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In agreement with a change in subcellular localization to endomembranes upon starvation, a crude cell fractionation separating micro-vesicles, i.e. the 17`000 <italic>g</italic> fraction containing ER, Golgi, endo- and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Dengjel et al., 2012</xref>), from cytosol, nuclei and mitochondria yielded an increased abundance of BAG2 in the RAB7-positive cell fraction in starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">One of the most strongly binding proteins in starvation conditions was the ER/Golgi-localized chloride ion channel CLCC1, mutations of which have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Li et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). CLCC1 constitutively localized to the 17`000 <italic>g</italic> fraction, independent of growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To further test if growth conditions lead to changes in intracellular localization and protein interactions of BAG2 and if this is dependent on ULK1 activity, we studied the BAG2-CLCC1 interaction in growth and starvation conditions in the presence and absence of the ULK1 inhibitor MRT68921 by AP coupled to western blot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Petherick et al., 2015</xref>). In starvation conditions, BAG2 interacts stronger with CLCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-G</xref>), which is in agreement with MS analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>); and this change in interaction is indeed dependent on ULK1 activity as MRT68921 treatment partially blocks it. Finally, also by IF, we observed that BAG2 colocalizes significantly stronger with both CLCC1 and SEC16A in starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S6</xref>). SEC16A being a marker of ERES, one principal site of autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). To further characterize the CLCC1-positive membrane compartment, its co-localization with membrane-bound organelle markers was analyzed by IF. We observed partial co-localization of CLCC1 with LMAN1/ERGIC-53, SEC13, but not with SNX1 indicating that CLCC1 at least partially localizes to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S7</xref>). Taken together, under starvation i.e., autophagy induction, a pool of BAG2 changes its subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions in an ULK1-dependent manner localizing to CLCC1-positive endomembranes, which include membranes that are positive for SEC13 and SEC16A being indicative for ERES, sites at which autophagosome biogenesis takes place.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>In nutrient starvation BAG2 supports AMBRA1 recruitment to the ER</title><p id="P17">One of the proteins that we found reproducibly significantly enriched in starvation conditions by MS-based proteomics of exogenous and endogenous BAG2 APs and that has a known function in autophagy regulation is the VPS34 complex member AMBRA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Antonioli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cianfanelli et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In agreement, we also identified an increased interaction between AMBRA1 and BAG2 in starvation conditions by comparing APs of tagged BAG2 using western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>) as well as by IPs of endogenous AMBRA1 using MS as readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, AMBRA1 binds to BAG2 and this binding is increased by limited nutrient availability. The interaction of AMBRA1 with BAG2 might be direct or indirect via HSC/HSP70 members. To discriminate these two options, we expressed the HSC70-binding deficient BAG2 variant BAG2<sup>I160A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carrettiero et al., 2022</xref>) in BAG2 KO cells and compared its interactome to BAG2<sup>WT</sup> expressing cells by AP-MS. As anticipated, HSPA4 and HSPA9 bound weaker to BAG2<sup>I160A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), as did CLCC1 indicating that the latter might interact indirectly with BAG2 via HSC70 proteins. Interestingly, AMBRA1 bound equally well to both BAG2 variants implying that this interaction is potentially direct and independent of HSC/HSP70-BAG2 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To address the relevance of the BAG2-AMBRA1 interaction, we studied the subcellular localization of AMBRA1 in HeLa WT and BAG2 KO clones by IF. In the absence of BAG2 we observed a perturbed intracellular distribution of AMBRA1. Whereas one could observe an increased localization of AMBRA1 to the ER membrane in starvation in wildtype cells, KO cells lost their ability to respond to starvation and exhibited an increased localization of AMBRA1 to the ER membrane also in growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F-G</xref>). This implies that one role of BAG2 in autophagy is the regulation of the subcellular distribution of AMBRA1, sequestering AMBRA1 in growth conditions at microtubuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Di Bartolomeo et al., 2010</xref>), and interfering with its localization to the ER membrane. As both KO clones behaved similarly, we performed further experiments with clone 2 only. To analyze if the observed changes in AMBRA1 localization mirror changes in VPS34 complex activity affecting the local production of PI3P, we monitored WIPI2 puncta formation in WT and BAG2 KO cells. WIPI2, an ortholog of yeast Atg18 is a PI3P-binding protein important for autophagosome expansion and serves as a docking site for the ATG5-ATG12/ATG16 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>). Its local accumulation in puncta can be used as proxy to address VPS34 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Axe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Polson et al., 2010</xref>). Reflecting the observation in ER-AMBRA1 localization, we also identified an increase in WIPI2 puncta in BAG2 KO cells in growth conditions that did not further increase under starvation conditions, in contrast to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-I</xref>). This increase was dependent on the absence of BAG2 as its ectopic re-expression in KO cells rescued this phenotype in contrast to KO cells expressing a control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-I</xref>). We observed the same phenotype in cells acutely depleted of BAG2 by the expression of a doxycyclin-inducible shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure S8</xref>). Thus, our results imply that acute or chronic loss of BAG2 leads to an increase in WIPI2-positive autophagosome nucleation sites, which is mirrored by an increased lipidation of LC3 and GABARAP under basal growth conditions in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>BAG2 Ser31 is a ULK1 target site regulating its protein interactions and subcellular localization</title><p id="P19">Finally, we addressed the question if ULK1 may directly regulate localization and/or protein-protein interactions of BAG2 by phosphorylation. In a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified Ser31 of BAG2 as a potential ULK1 target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>).

Both, by AP-MS as well as by AP-western blot we observed increased interaction of CLCC1 with BAG2<sup>S31E</sup> under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">supplemental Table S4</xref>).

The ULK1 kinase complex is crucial for canonical autophagy regulation and represents an interesting drug target which might support the specific modulation of autophagy in diverse disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Whitmarsh-Everiss and Laraia, 2021</xref>). In the current manuscript we present a deep ULK1 interactome using a combination of AP- and PL-MS-based proteomics. By employing N- and C-terminally tagged protein variants we characterize 317 high confidence subunit-specific and common ULK1-complex interactors. Focusing on BAG2, a common interactor that bound to more than one subunit and was identified by AP- and PL-MS, we characterized it as a new ULK1 effector protein that modulates functional autophagy by regulating the subcellular localization of AMBRA1.</p><p id="P23">MS-based proteomics is indispensable for the unbiased identification of protein-protein interactions and PTMs. The introduction of PL approaches supports the characterization of <italic>in vivo</italic> protein neighborhoods not necessarily focusing on direct interactors but rather on proteins being enriched in the vicinity of bait proteins. Compared to classical AP-MS approaches neighboring proteins are marked by chemical tags in their native environment, which reduces post-lysis artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, AP- and PL-MS are orthogonal approaches that commonly lead to the identifications of different sets of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Also in the current study, the overlap between interactors identified by AP- and PL-MS was rather small. What came as surprise was the observation that PL-MS yielded a smaller number of neighbors compared to AP-MS-based interactors when the bait protein has a similar size as the tag itself. Assuming that this is a general trend and not specific to ATG101, a positive interpretation of this observation is that smaller proteins might be more mobile, PL leading to more noise and by this interfering with the identification of transiently interacting proteins. A negative interpretation would be that the relative size of the tag has a substantial influence on protein localization, large tags leading to miss-localized i.e., non-physiological localized proteins. As we used a double-tag strategy combining both the PL-enzyme miniTurbo with the HA-peptide epitope in single fusion proteins, we tend to support the first interpretation. In our case, protein miss-localization should also be reflected by altered/reduced stable interactions identified by AP-MS, which was not the case.</p><p id="P24">The presented deep ULK1 complex interactome is a rich resource for research groups being interested in autophagy and its regulation. We highlighted the interaction with other protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases leading to the interpretation that the ULK1 complex forms a signalosome. This is further supported by the observation that autophagy initiation leads to clustering of ULK1 complex members at ER-sub-compartments which is observable by fluorescence microscopy i.e., ULK1 or ATG13 puncta formation at omegasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Karanasios et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Karanasios et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement, it was recently shown that under starvation conditions ULK1 forms large clusters at the ER containing more than 100 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Banerjee et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, we identified several SARs as common ULK1 complex interactors under starvation conditions. Nutrient starvation, in our case the lack of amino acids, growth factors and lipids (the only remaining energy source being glucose), is the classical stimulus for non-selective bulk autophagy. The enrichment of SARs implies that selective autophagy sub-pathways are also active under “bulk” starvation conditions. Indeed, non-selective bulk autophagy could also be envisioned as the sum of many selective autophagy pathways happening in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kirkin and Rogov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nair and Klionsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). Time-resolved, detailed characterizations of molecular events and autophagosomal proteome compositions are needed to further disentangle selective from potential bulk pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kallergi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Having performed “omics” type of experiments always raises the questions which and how many of the identified targets should be studied and to which detail. We decided to follow-up a single ULK1 interactor, the HSP70 co-chaperone BAG2, and to analyze the events that govern its function in autophagy in molecular detail. In contrasts to other members of the BAG protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Pattingre and Turtoi, 2022</xref>), the primary function of BAG2 appears to be the inhibition of autophagy under basal growth conditions, as its acute depletion by shRNA-based KD leads to increased autophagy flux. The increased flux is due to increased autophagosome nucleation sites as indicated by WIPI2 puncta formation. The increased number of WIPI2 puncta under basal conditions also indicates that the inhibitory function of BAG2 is likely independent of ULK1 activity. In KO cells, the phenotype is more complex: in agreement with the observations in KD cells, increased lipidation of ATG8 proteins and increased WIPI2 puncta numbers are observed; however, in contrast to the effect of acute reduction of BAG2 abundance by shRNA, the chronic reduction of BAG2 levels by KO leads to reduced autophagy flux as analyzed by western blot, MS and IF. That latter appears to be an indirect effect due to perturbation of lysosomal targeting related to loss of BAG2 as shown by reduced colocalization of p62 and LAMP2. Indeed, we identified BAG2 interacting with several vesicle coat proteins: clathrin-coat-proteins like adapter protein complex 2 members AP2A1, B1 and M1 which are important for clathrin-coated vesicle formation and cargo selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Owen et al., 2004</xref>), and to COPII-coat proteins like SEC13. Hence, BAG2 might have a general effect on vesicle formation and/or trafficking affecting autophagosome turnover also in an indirect manner. Further studies are needed to fully uncover the role of BAG2 in intracellular vesicle trafficking, fusion, and lysosomal activity. Under starvation conditions and activation of ULK1, BAG2 changes its protein interactions and with this its subcellular localization in a ULK1-dependent manner, localizing more to endomembranes, as exemplified by binding stronger to the ER-/Golgi-resident transmembrane protein CLCC1. In a recent spatial proteomics approach, BAG2 was identified as localizing to SEC16A-positive ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Nalbach et al., 2023</xref>), which are involved in autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Our data recapitulate this finding additionally implying that BAG2 may localize to different membrane subcompartments, which would support the interpretation that BAG2 may fulfill multiple functions important for autophagy activity. As the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of BAG2 and HSC70 have been shown to regulate intracellular protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fukuzono et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesize that the change in BAG2 localization likely affects also BAG2 client proteins. One autophagy-relevant client of BAG2 that was identified in the current study is AMBRA1.</p><p id="P26">KO of BAG2 supported increased AMBRA1 localization to the ER membrane. The increase in WIPI2 puncta in both KO and KD cells is in agreement with ER-localized AMBRA1, as their formation is PI3P dependent reflecting an increase in VPS34 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Axe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Polson et al., 2010</xref>). If the increase in autophagosome initiation sites in BAG2 depleted cells represent ER-connected phagophores or accumulated ATG9 vesicles will have to be addressed in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Broadbent et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Cook and Hurley, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Olivas et al., 2023</xref>). The change in BAG2 localization is directly regulated by ULK1, as pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 decreased and mutating the ULK1 target site Ser31 of BAG2 to a phosphomimetic glutamic acid increased CLCC1 binding, respectively. The respective alanine mutation had no effect. Indeed, by using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphoproteomics, we show that Ser31 of BAG2 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> ULK1 target site. Interestingly, the effects of <italic>BAG2<sup>S31E</sup></italic> expression and starvation seem to be additive with respect to CLCC1 binding implying that the interaction does not solely rely on Ser31 phosphorylation. Additional amino acids of BAG2 or CLCC1 might be modified in the tested condition affecting binding, either via phosphorylation by ULK1 or other kinases, or via additional PTMs, potentially also affecting AMBRA1 binding. The fact that the BAG2-CLCC1 interaction is also dependent on HSC70 binding as exemplified by the effects of the BAG2 Ile160Ala mutation further supports the interpretation that next to Ser31 phosphorylation additional mechanisms affect this interaction. Further studies are needed to characterize the regulation of BAG2 and the immediate effect of BAG2 Ser31 phosphorylation. It is also not clear how the interaction between AMBRA1 and BAG2 is regulated on a molecular level.</p><p id="P27">The synonym of AMBRA1 is DCAF3 (DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 3) as AMBRA1 has also been identified as a binding partner of E3 ubiquitin ligases, amongst them Cullin 4 and Cullin 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antonioli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jin et al., 2006</xref>), TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Nazio et al., 2013</xref>), and TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Di Rienzo et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, AMBRA1 and ULK1 appear to be linked by feedbacks, ULK1 phosphorylating AMBRA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Di Bartolomeo et al., 2010</xref>)which in turns supports the TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination and stabilization of ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Nazio et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas we did not observe clear BAG2 abundance changes comparing growth and starvation conditions, we cannot exclude that AMBRA1 affects the ubiquitination of BAG2 and with this its stability or proteinprotein interactions, affecting potentially both autophagosomal and proteasomal protein degradation. This will have to be addressed in the future.</p><p id="P28">Taken together, in the current study we generated a deep ULK1 complex interactome highlighting that the holo-complex forms an elaborate signalosome. By phosphorylating the co-chaperone BAG2, ULK1 modulates its subcellular localization, positively affecting autophagy initiation in response to stress by stabilizing AMBRA1 at the ER membrane. However, next to regulation of autophagy initiation, the ULK1 holo-complex appears to modulate adaptation to limited nutrient supply in general. SARs are important binding partners of ULK1 complex members indicating the activation of starvation-dependent selective autophagy pathways and questioning the relevance of non-specific bulk degradation by autophagy in response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell Culture and treatments</title><p id="P29">HeLa cells (ATCC CCl-2) were validated by genotyping (Microsynth) and negatively tested for mycoplasma.

Cells were washed with 1X PBS on ice for 5 times before harvesting by centrifugation at 3’000 rpm for 2 min and snap freezing in liquid nitrogen before storing the cell pellets at -80°C. For streptavidin-based affinity purification of respective proteins-of-interest (POI), 2x 15 cm dishes per label and replicate were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% triton-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, EDTA-free 1X protease inhibitors (Roche, 11-697-498-001), pH-7.5, 1:5000 Benzonase and 1 mM PMSF). All the above cell lysates were vortexed 4 times for 15 sec, and lysis was done for 30 min on ice. Then, lysates were centrifuged at 14’000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Protein quantification was determined by BCA assay as per manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, 23225). Equal amounts of proteins were taken in their respective experiments to perform streptavidin (ThermoFischer, Pierce 20361) affinity purification as follows. 100 μl bead slurry was washed 2x with RIPA buffer (without 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors, PMSF, 0.1% SDS) at RT. Lysates were incubated with beads on a rotor for 90 min. After affinity purification, beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer, three times with TAP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and two times with 50 mM ammonium carbonate. Elutions from the beads were performed using Laemmli buffer with 1 mM DTT and 25 mM biotin 75°C for 10 min. SILAC eluates of a respective experiment were mixed to give 150 μl final volume. Protein samples were reduced with 1 mM DTT followed by alkylation with 5.5 μM IAA and ran on 4-12% gradient gels. Gel pieces were sliced to have five fractions per replicate, in-gel digestion with trypsin (Promega) overnight. Peptides were purified via STAGE tips (C18 disc, 3M Empore, Cat#14-386-2) and dissolved in buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MS grade water) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses</title><p id="P44">The LC-MS/MS measurements were performed on a QExactive Plus or HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EasyLC 1000 nanoflow-HPLC. Peptides were separated on fused silica HPLC-column tips (I.D. 75 μm, New Objective, self-packed with reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm [Dr. Maisch] to a length of 20 cm) using a gradient of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile in water). Mass spectrometers were operated in the data-dependent mode; after each MS scan (mass range m/z = 370 –1750; resolution: 70’000 for QE Plus and 120’000 for HF-X) a maximum of ten, or twelve MS/MS scans were performed using a normalized collision energy of 25%, a target value of 1’000 (QE Plus)/4500 (HF-X) and a resolution of 17’500 for QE Plus and 30’000 for HF-X. MaxQuant software (version 1.6.2.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) was used for analyzing the MS raw files for peak detection, peptide quantification and identification using full length Uniprot human databases (version April 2016/ Jan 2022) and common contaminants. Carbamidomethylcysteine was used as fixed modification and N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionine, and in case of phosphorylation site analyses phosphorylation of serine, threonine or tyrosine were set as variable modifications. The MS/MS tolerance was set to 20 ppm and four missed cleavages were allowed for Trypsin/P as enzyme specificity. Based on a forward-reverse database, protein and peptide FDR was set to 0.01, minimum peptide length was set to seven, and at least one unique peptide had to be identified. The match-between run option was set to 0.7 minutes. For whole proteome analyses on the HF-X, the mass spectrometer was operated in the data-independent mode. Briefly, after each survey scan (mass range m/z = 350 – 1,200; resolution: 120,000) 28 DIA scans with an isolation width of 31.4 m/z were performed covering a total range of precursors from 350-1,200 m/z. AGC target value was set to 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>, resolution to 30,000 and normalized collision energy to 27%. Data were analyzed using Spectronaut software version 15.7 (Biognosys) with standard settings (without imputation) in directDIA mode using reference proteome of Human (UniProt, 2022, full length) and common contaminants.

Y2H interactions were documented by spotting representative transformants in 10-fold serial dilution steps onto SC-Leu-Trp (-LT), SC-Leu-Trp-His (-HLT; <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter), and SC-Leu-Trp-Ade (-ALT; <italic>ADE2</italic> reporter) plates, which were incubated for 3 d at 30°C. Growth on SC-Leu-Trp-His plates is indicative of a weak/moderate interaction, whereas only relatively strong interactions permit growth on SC-Leu-Trp-Ade plates. Y2H plasmids were constructed by standard cloning procedures using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5α for cloning and plasmid propagation.
