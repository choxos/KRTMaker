However, the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways that underpin their coordination are still poorly understood. CozE constitute a conserved family of membrane proteins implicated in cell division via regulation of penicillin binding proteins. It has been shown that the two staphylococcal <italic>cozE</italic> genes (<italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic>) constitute a synthetic lethal gene pair. Depletion of CozEa and CozEb simultaneously in <italic>S. aureus</italic> resulted in severely defective cell division phenotypes, reminiscent of cell lacking lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Indeed, we demonstrate that there is an intricate interplay between CozE, biosynthesis of LTA, and membrane homeostasis in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. By screening for potential genetic links, we establish that there is synthetic lethal relationship between CozE and UgtP, the enzyme synthesizing the LTA glycolipid anchor Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG. On the contrary, in cells lacking LtaA, the flippase of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG, the essentiality of CozEa and CozEb was alleviated. Furthermore, by immunoblotting, we found that CozEb plays a unique role in controlling LTA polymer length and stability. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes, we also demonstrated that CozE proteins modulate the glycolipid flipping activity of LtaA <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together, the results demonstrate a new function of CozE proteins, facilitating proper membrane homeostasis and LTA biosynthesis in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogen which is responsible for a wide range of infectious diseases in humans and animals, including skin and soft tissue infections, bloodstream infections, and infections associated with medical implant devices. This is made possible by the plethora of virulence factors produced by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Among the major factors contributing to staphylococcal colonization, infection, and immune evasion are the anionic teichoic acid (TA) polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Together with peptidoglycan, TAs are the main constituents of the staphylococcal cell wall. Interestingly, TAs do not only influence the susceptibility of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to antibiotics, but they also regulate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), making the TA biosynthetic pathways attractive as potential anti-virulence and antibiotic targets.</p><p id="P3">Staphylococcal TAs are mainly composed of repeating units of ribitol phosphate (RboP) or glycerol phosphate (GroP), that are either covalently linked to peptidoglycan (wall teichoic acids, WTAs) or anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane (lipoteichoic acids, LTAs). Although LTA is more important than WTA for cell viability, it is possible to create deletion mutants of genes involved in either pathway. However, it is not possible to delete both pathways simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Staphylococcal LTAs consist of poly-GroP chains that are associated with the cytoplasmic membrane through the glycolipid anchor diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG is synthesized in the cytoplasm by the glycosyltransferase UgtP (also called YpfP), which transfers two glucose moieties from uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glc) to DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG is translocated to the outer membrane leaflet by the multi-membrane spanning protein LtaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Lastly, the LTA synthase, LtaS, polymerizes the poly-GroP backbone chain by transferring GroP units, derived from the head group of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), to the Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG, on the outside surface of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), leaving extracellular DAG as a by-product. LTA polymers are often further modified by D-alanylation, carried out by the DltABCD system, and/or glycosylation, which modulates their properties and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The LTA synthase LtaS is considered essential for growth in <italic>S. aureus,</italic> as deletion of <italic>ltaS</italic>, in which LTA synthesis is completely abolished, is associated with suppressor mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Cells with deletion of the genes required for synthesis and flipping of the glycolipid anchor (Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> and Δ<italic>ltaA</italic>, respectively), are however still viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> cells, which completely lack the Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG anchor, LtaS can initiate LTA synthesis directly on PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> mutants have been demonstrated to produce a mixture of LTAs linked to both PG and Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>); hence, there must exist an unidentified mechanism that can translocate Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG, produced by UgtP, to the outer membrane leaflet in the absence of LtaA. In Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> or Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> cells, LTA length control is lost, resulting in cells that produce PG-linked LTA polymers which are abnormally long and less stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Importantly, several studies suggest a tight link between LTA synthesis and cell division in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Deletion of genes in the LTA biosynthetic pathway results in enlarged cells with severe division and morphological defects, suggested to be caused by changes in LTA length and abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Furthermore, UgtP, LtaA, and LtaS, have all been shown to interact with each other, as well as multiple cell division and cell wall synthesis proteins (e.g., EzrA, FtsA, FtsW, and PBP1-PBP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). LtaS has also been demonstrated to mainly accumulate at the septum in <italic>S. aureus,</italic> indicating that LTA synthesis predominantly occurs at the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Together this suggest that LTA biosynthesis is tightly coordinated with peptidoglycan synthesis and other processes during the staphylococcal cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P6">CozE (<underline>c</underline>oordinator <underline>o</underline>f zonal <underline>e</underline>longation) belongs to a family of multi-transmembrane proteins that are broadly distributed across the bacterial kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). CozE (also referred to as CozEa) was first studied in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</italic> where it was shown to direct localization of peptidoglycan synthesis possibly via interactions with the bifunctional class A PBP1a and the MreCD complex involved in cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Later studies have also indicated functional interactions with additional morphogenesis factors, such as RodZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). A CozE paralog in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, named CozEb, has also been found to be part of the same complex as CozE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), and there seems to be a complex interplay between the two paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>); individual deletions of <italic>cozE</italic> or <italic>cozEb</italic> in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> generated different phenotypes with regard to cell shape and growth inhibition, and while CozEb was not required for correct localization of PBP1a, overexpression of this protein could compensate for deletion of <italic>cozE</italic>, suppressing both growth and morphology defects.</p><p id="P7">In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureu</italic>s, the two CozE-paralogs, CozEa and CozEb, have been studied in the strain SH1000, where they were found to be important for proper cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). While neither <italic>cozEa</italic> nor <italic>cozEb</italic> was essential when deleted individually, a synthetic lethal phenotype was observed; a double deletion strain could not be obtained and knockdown of <italic>cozEa</italic> in a Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> background (or <italic>vice versa)</italic> resulted in significantly reduced growth, aberrant septal placement, distorted cell morphologies, frequent cell lysis, and a non-homogeneous nucleoid staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). CozEa and CozEb were found to interact with, and modulate the localization of the cell division regulator EzrA, suggesting that this interaction may be important for the coordination of cell division in this bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In this work, we demonstrate that there is a functional link between biosynthesis of LTA and CozE proteins in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. We show that the two CozE proteins have unique functionalities,as CozEb, but not CozEa, modulates the length and stability of LTAs and the flipping activity of LtaA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results presented here give insights into hitherto unknown functions of the broadly distributed CozE proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CozEa and CozEb affect cell division across different <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains</title><p id="P9">In a previous work, we showed that <italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SH1000 were synthetic lethal and possessed overlapping effects on growth and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). To investigate the functional conservation of <italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic> across different <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains and to characterize the phenotypes in more detail, Δ<italic>cozEa::spc</italic> and Δ<italic>cozEb::spc</italic> mutants were constructed in the methicillin-sensitive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MSSA) strain NCTC8325-4, while the <italic>cozEa::Tn</italic> and <italic>cozEb::Tn</italic> mutants in the community-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (CA-MRSA) USA300 strain JE2 were obtained from the Nebraska collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Neither of the single deletions resulted in any growth defects under the conditions tested, and no obvious morphological defects were found by microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). The cell sizes were not severely altered, although the JE2 Δ<italic>cozEa</italic> cells, as well as both NCTC8325-4 <italic>cozE</italic> mutants, on average were slightly smaller than their wild-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). Likewise, cell cycle phase distribution analysis (performed on cells with fluorescent vancomycin labelled cell wall; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) did not reveal differences between mutant and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2D</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic> mutants in JE2 and NCTC8325-4 were similar to their respective wild-types, which is consistent with the results from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SH1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Similar to what was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), we were unable to obtain a double Δ<italic>cozEaΔcozEb</italic> mutant in NCTC8325-4 by allelic replacement using the pMAD-vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We therefore used an established two-plasmid CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for knockdown of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In this system, dCas9 is expressed from an IPTG-inducible promoter on one plasmid, and the gene-specific sgRNA is constitutively expressed from the other. Indeed, simultaneous knockdown of <italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic> in wild-type backgrounds, knockdown of <italic>cozEa</italic> in the Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> backgrounds (Δ<italic>cozEb</italic>, CRISPRi(<italic>cozEa</italic>)) or <italic>vice versa</italic> caused a clear growth reduction in growth in both JE2 and NCTC8325-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1B, Fig. S2A</xref>). These cells also exhibited perturbed cell sizes, shapes and septa compared to the wild-type cells and single deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). By categorizing the cells into three cell cycle states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), we observed over-representation of phase 1 cells (cells before initiating septum synthesis) and under-representation of phase 2 (cells with incomplete septa) and phase 3 cells (cell with complete septa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2-D</xref>), showing that coordination of cell division is disturbed in cells lacking both CozE proteins. More specifically, this indicates that initiation of septum synthesis is inhibited in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cells lacking both CozE proteins have mis-localized cell wall synthesis</title><p id="P11">Localization of peptidoglycan synthesis was further investigated by labelling cells with the fluorescent D-amino acid 7-hydroxycoumarincarbonylamino-D-alanine (HADA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Since HADA is incorporated into newly synthesized peptidoglycan via transpeptidation during the labeling period, it is possible to distinguish sites of active growth. In this study, the cells were incubated with HADA for 2 minutes at 37 °C. Single deletions of <italic>cozEa</italic> or <italic>cozEb</italic> did not have an impact on the localization of nascent peptidoglycan in JE2 nor NCTC8325-4, it was located properly in the septal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, when both CozE proteins were absent, the HADA signals were highly heterogeneous with respect to signal intensity, and frequently appeared as clustered aggregates instead of being localized at the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2-D</xref>). These observations show that peptidoglycan synthesis in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is disturbed when both CozE proteins are absent.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The <italic>cozE</italic> genes have a synthetic link to genes involved in LTA synthesis</title><p id="P12">Mutants lacking both CozE proteins exhibited distinctive phenotypic traits, such as morphological abnormalities and impaired control of septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This resembles the phenotypes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutants with defects in LTA biosynthesis (Δ<italic>ltaS, ΔltaA</italic> or Δ<italic>ugtP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this context it is also interesting to note that in a study by Corrigan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), re-sequencing of <italic>ltaS</italic> deletion mutants resulted in potential suppressor mutations in <italic>cozEb</italic> (SAOUHSC_01358). This prompted us to investigate a potential link between CozE proteins and LTA synthesis. To screen for potential functional links between <italic>cozE</italic> and LTA synthesis genes, sgRNAs targeting <italic>ltaS</italic> and <italic>ugtP-ltaA</italic> were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <italic>ugtP</italic> and <italic>ltaA</italic> are in the same operon and are therefore targeted together with CRISPRi). A reduction in growth rate was observed upon depletion of UgtP-LtaA or LtaS in a wild-type background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>). LTA synthesis genes were then knocked down in the Δ<italic>cozEa</italic> and Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> genetic backgrounds, to see whether the absence of these genes affected the growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>). No major effects were evident, although the growth reduction observed in cells depleted of LtaS or UgtP-LtaA appeared to be slightly alleviated in both Δ<italic>cozEa</italic> and Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> backgrounds (indicated by the lengths of the red arrows in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>). Following up on this, the growth and cell size defects observed upon knockdown of LtaS were indeed less in a Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> genetic background, although the observed effect was relatively minor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Subsequently, we proceeded to investigate the growth phenotypes when both CozEa and CozEb were absent simultaneously with the LTA biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Interestingly, when UgtP-LtaA were depleted in a strain lacking both CozE proteins, the growth was improved compared to the control strain only lacking CozE proteins (MDB25 vs MDB11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B</xref>), suggesting that the detrimental effect of lacking both CozEa and CozEb is partly alleviated when UgtP and/or LtaA is removed. The same trend, although less clear, was also observed when LtaS was depleted in this background (strain MDB26, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B</xref>).

Both Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> and Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> exhibited growth rates comparable to the wild-type strain, and no alterations in growth were observed upon knockdown of the individual <italic>cozE</italic> genes in the JE2 Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> or Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5</xref>). Strikingly, however, simultaneous knockdown of <italic>cozEa</italic> and <italic>cozEb</italic> in Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> or Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> background caused dramatic, but opposite, alterations to the growth patterns (partial knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and full knockdown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6A</xref>).

The mis-regulation of septal synthesis and cell size defects previously observed in cells depleted of both CozE proteins, were further elevated in the absence of UgtP, as observed by phase contrast imaging and staining with VanFL (MDB19 and MDB45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). Conversely, in the Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> cells, depletion of CozEa and CozEb did not yield the same morphological abnormalities (MDB46, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), and the cell size distribution in this mutant more closely resembled that of the control strain (MDB46 and MDB44, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

Together, these results show that when UgtP is absent, and Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG are not produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), CozE proteins become more essential.

Detection of LTA in supernatants (which are thus no longer anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane) serves as an indicator of LTA stability. Strikingly, in the JE2 Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> mutant, LTA is clearly being released to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S8B</xref>), while no LTA is detected in the supernatant fraction of wild-type or Δ<italic>cozEa</italic>.

The size of the released LTA polymers corresponds to the LTA with increased length in the Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S8C</xref>), suggesting that only the abnormally long LTA polymers are unstable and consequently released into the growth medium. A Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> mutant, which has previously shown to release LTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), was included as a control in this experiment, and as expected LTA polymers with increased size were detected in the supernatant of this strain. For the double <italic>cozE</italic> mutants (Δ<italic>cozEb</italic>, CRISPRi(<italic>cozEa</italic>)), LTA with a range of sizes was detected in the supernatant. This observation can probably be attributed to the high degree of lysis observed in these double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), which likely leads to release of LTA to the supernatant. Collectively, these findings suggest that CozEb has a role in modulating the stability, as well as the length, of LTA polymers in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>CozE proteins are not critical for the membrane localization of UgtP</title><p id="P20">Next, we asked how CozE proteins could influence the LTA biosynthetic pathway.

Immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that the two fusion proteins (67.03 kDa for CozEa-GFP and 71.93 kDa for CozEb-GFP) have relatively similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S9A</xref>).

Interestingly, time-lapse microscopy revealed that the spotty localization is highly dynamic, indicating that both CozEa-GFP and CozEb-GFP move rapidly around in the cell membrane (see the arrows in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). While LtaA has been shown to localize uniformly in the membrane, a somewhat spotty membrane localization was reported for UgtP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The mechanism of membrane localization for UgtP, a 391 amino acid-long protein without any predicted transmembrane segments, is not established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and we therefore asked whether CozE proteins could be involved in this process. A strain with a chromosomally integrated ectopic copy of <italic>gfp-ugtP</italic> expressed from its native promoter was made, and as expected GFP-UgtP displayed a spotty localization in the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S9D</xref>).

Furthermore, bacterial two-hybrid assays, performed to identify potential protein-protein interactions, did not reveal any direct interaction between UgtP and the CozE proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S9E</xref>), together indicating that neither CozEa nor CozEb are solely responsible for the cellular localization of UgtP.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>CozE proteins modulate LtaA mediated flipping of Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG</title><p id="P21">Our results showed that in the absence of LtaA (implying that the translocation of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG across the membrane is impaired), the functional relevance of the CozE proteins is reduced. Thus, we asked whether the presence of CozEa and/or CozEb could influence the LtaA-mediated flipping of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG. To answer this question, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> flipping assays with LtaA proteoliposomes reconstituted alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) or in the presence of CozEa and/or CozEb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S10</xref>). Fluorescently labelled Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG (diglucosyl-diacylglycerol-NBD) was also incorporated in the proteoliposomes as a reporter of flipping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG-NBD in the outer leaflet undergo fluorescence quenching upon addition of the membrane-impermeable reducing agent sodium dithionite, and the extent of flipping can therefore be determined by measuring the percentage of fluorescence remaining after sodium dithionite addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Cell cycle analyses of CozE depleted strains show an enrichment of cells without septa (phase 1), and the aberrant localization of cell wall and peptidoglycan synthesis in these cells provides additional validation for their effect on cell division and septum formation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. The effect of CozE proteins on morphology and growth have consequently directed most studies of these proteins towards their direct interaction with the cell wall and cell division synthesis machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In the present study we have made discoveries that link the function of these proteins to LTA biosynthesis in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. It is indeed well established that mutants of <italic>ugtP, ltaA</italic>, and <italic>ltaS</italic> cause cell division defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). CozEa/CozEb do not interact with any of the PBPs found in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, LTA biosynthetic proteins are shown to associate with a number of proteins involved in cell wall synthesis and division, including PBP1, PBP2, PBP3, FtsW, EzrA, DivIB, DivIC, and FtsL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that LTA affects the activity of cell wall hydrolases required for proper cell splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). It should also be noted that in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, changes in UgtP activity directly affected the assembly of the division ring, and UgtP has been suggested to function as a metabolic sensor governing cell size in this bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In this context, the findings presented in this study suggest that the cell division phenotypes associated with CozE proteins in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> may, at least to some extent, be attributed to the effect CozE have on the LTA biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), although other mechanisms, such as their direct interaction with EzrA may also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Our data indeed demonstrate an intricate interplay between CozE proteins and the LTA biosynthetic pathway in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Firstly, it was noted that the mutants lacking both CozE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2</xref>) were phenotypically similar to staphylococcal cells lacking LTA biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Secondly, our genetic analyses demonstrated that the essentiality of CozE proteins is altered in the absence of LTA biosynthetic genes. Particularly interesting, when the flippase <italic>ltaA</italic> is deleted, resulting in accumulation of the glycolipid anchor Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG on the intracellular membrane leaflet and reduced levels of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG on the extracellular leaflet, the essentiality of CozE proteins appears to be alleviated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The opposite seems to be true for Δ<italic>ugtP</italic>. In these cells, where the glycolipid anchor is lacking completely, the absence of CozEa and CozEb results in an aggravated growth defect compared to the wild-type background (see further discussion below). In line with these genetic links, suppressor mutations in <italic>cozEb</italic> have previously been reported in a Δ<italic>ltaS</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Thirdly, we here observed that deletion of CozEb resulted in slightly longer and more unstable LTA polymers compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This has previously been associated with cells lacking (Δ<italic>ugtP</italic>) or having reduced levels of (Δ<italic>ltaA</italic>) the LTA anchor Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG on the extracellular leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In the absence of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG, PG can be used as an alternative starter unit for LTA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), and LTA polymers formed on PG are longer and more unstable than those formed on Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, CozE proteins are involved in spatiotemporal localization of peptidoglycan synthesis, probably through their interaction and control of the bifunctional class A PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The link between CozE proteins and teichoic acids observed here, may however be relevant also in this species. It has for example been shown that the growth reduction caused by <italic>cozE</italic> knockdown in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is improved in a mutant where the “LTA anchor formation protein B” gene (<italic>lafB</italic>, also named <italic>cpoA</italic>, involved in synthesis of glycolipid Gal-Glc-DAG) is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Furthermore, in a <italic>S. pneumoniae tacL</italic> (encoding the lipoteichoic acid ligase required for LTA assembly) deletion mutant, suppressors in <italic>cozE</italic> were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).The effect CozE proteins have on LTA biosynthesis in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> may be explained by their effect on membrane homeostasis such as the ability to modulate the flipping activity of LtaA, as demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The bilayer distribution of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG in the membrane may be changed in <italic>cozE</italic> mutant cells, thus disturbing the synthesis of LTA polymers, as observed in the Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> background. However, it still remains to be understood whether CozE proteins influence LtaA directly or indirectly and why CozEa and CozEb apparently have opposite functions in this regard. It is also interesting to note that both CozEa and CozEb are highly dynamic membrane proteins, and it could be speculated that their role is important not only for the flipping of lipids, but also for the lateral dynamics of lipids and/or fluidity of the membrane. Also worth noting in this context, is that a Δ<italic>cozEb</italic> mutant in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> has been shown to display increased susceptibility to the membrane targeting antibiotic daptomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Furthermore, our results showing that the essentiality of CozE proteins are oppositely affected in a Δ<italic>ltaA</italic> and Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggest that CozE proteins may be involved in the bilayer distribution of lipids. I.e., accumulation of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG (in Δ<italic>ltaA</italic>) somehow alleviates the need for CozE proteins observed in the wild-type (which probably has a more even distribution of Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG) and particularly in Δ<italic>ugtP</italic> (which do not contain Glc<sub>2</sub>DAG). Lipid scramblases are known to play important functions in regulating lipid distributions in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that CozE proteins function as bacterial membrane scramblases, and in that way affect many membrane-associated processes including peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation, for example by structural analysis of potential interactions between the highly dynamic CozE proteins and different lipids and/or by analyzing the distribution of lipids between the bilayers in different genetic backgrounds.</p><p id="P25">Our results also demonstrate, for the first time, that CozEa and CozEb are not fully redundant in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as deletion of <italic>cozEb</italic>, but not <italic>cozEa</italic>, resulted in longer and more unstable LTA polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This is not entirely surprising given the different roles of the two CozE paralogs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The notion of the unique functionality of these paralogs is indeed supported by a phylogenetic analysis of CozE proteins from <italic>Streptococcaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S11</xref>).

It should be noted that CozE proteins from more distantly related genera (<italic>Jeotgalicoccus</italic>, <italic>Salinicoccus</italic>, and <italic>Nosocomiicoccus)</italic> do not display this subclassification, but instead cluster into a separate group that is phylogenetically closer to CozEa (green in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S11</xref>), indicating that the function of CozEb may be unique for <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Macrococcus</italic>.</p><p id="P26">It has already been shown that CozEb can act as target for antibody-based infection treatment in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).
