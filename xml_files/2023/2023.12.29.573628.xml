After release of 5-HT and Na<sup>+</sup> into the cytoplasm, the transporter faces a rate-limiting challenge of resetting its conformation to be primed again for 5-HT and Na<sup>+</sup> binding. Early studies of vesicles containing native SERT revealed that K<sup>+</sup> gradients can provide an additional driving force, via K<sup>+</sup> antiport. Moreover, under appropriate conditions, a H<sup>+</sup> ion can replace K<sup>+</sup>. Intracellular K<sup>+</sup> accelerates the resetting step. Structural studies of SERT have identified two binding sites for Na<sup>+</sup> ions, but the K<sup>+</sup> site remains enigmatic. Here, we show that K<sup>+</sup> antiport can drive substrate accumulation into vesicles containing SERT extracted from a heterologous expression system, allowing us to study the residues responsible for K<sup>+</sup> binding. To identify candidate binding residues, we examine many cation binding configurations using molecular dynamics simulations, predicting that K<sup>+</sup> binds to the so-called Na2 site. Site directed mutagenesis of residues in this site can eliminate the ability of both K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> to drive 5-HT accumulation into vesicles and, in patch clamp recordings, prevent the acceleration of turnover rates and the formation of a channel-like state by K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>. In conclusion, the Na2 site plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the sequential binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and then K<sup>+</sup> (or H<sup>+</sup>) ions to facilitate 5-HT uptake in SERT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antiport</kwd><kwd>proteoliposomes</kwd><kwd>patch clamp electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter transporter</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Serotonin transporter (SERT, SLC6A4) plays a pivotal role in the nervous system by regulating the synaptic levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). SERT is essential for mood regulation and is, consequently, a prominent target for pharmaceutical agents, including antidepressants and drugs of abuse. 5-HT uptake across the plasma membrane is driven by a gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> ions at a 1:1 stoichiometry, and requires extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), similar to other solute carrier 6 (SLC6) transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The 5-HT transport cycle is initiated by binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to a conformation of SERT in which the 5-HT binding site is exposed only to the cell exterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) precluding Na<sup>+</sup> release into the cytoplasm. Subsequent binding of extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> and 5-HT to this resting state facilitates a protein conformational change, closing the extracellular pathway and exposing the central (or S1) binding site to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), according to the alternating-access mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This conformational change, along with subsequent dissociation of Na<sup>+</sup> into the cytoplasm, has been detected as a rapid inward peak current in SERT-expressing cells under whole cell patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>). The rate-determining conformational change to return to an outward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) can be accelerated by intracellular K<sup>+</sup>, increasing the turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Even when accelerated by K<sup>+</sup>, the return step is almost two orders of magnitude slower than the 5-HT-dependent forward step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Consequently, most of the transporters at the cell surface are in an inward-facing conformation during steady-state transport. In the presence of cytoplasmic K<sup>+</sup>, this conformation of SERT can become a conducting state whose steady, channel-like current is uncoupled from the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Similar to currents observed in the closely related dopamine transporter, DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), this current reflects inward flux of cations, presumably Na<sup>+</sup>.</p><p id="P5">An interaction with intracellular K<sup>+</sup> has also been reported for DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), though it has been more difficult to demonstrate that the K<sup>+</sup> efflux is coupled directly to dopamine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Early studies of SERT in platelet plasma membrane vesicles (PPMV) demonstrated that an outward-directed gradient of K<sup>+</sup> could drive accumulation of 5-HT with a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), consistent with its impact on rates measured by patch clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The overall transport cycle then involves one Na<sup>+</sup> entering the cell and one K<sup>+</sup> ion exiting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), unlike Cl<sup>–</sup> which, although required, apparently does not cross the membrane during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Notably, K<sup>+</sup> stimulation is not required for 5-HT uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), seemingly because intracellular H<sup>+</sup> can substitute for K<sup>+</sup> ions under appropriate conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Specifically, a transmembrane pH difference (ΔpH, more acidic inside) stimulated transport into PPMV even in the absence of a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient. In addition, elevated intracellular H<sup>+</sup> doubled the uptake rate, restored the substrate-induced steady current, and reduced the net positive charge appearing to cross the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), mimicking the phenotype of intracellular K<sup>+</sup>. In essence, K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> compete with Na<sup>+</sup> and 5-HT, preventing reversal of the inward transport step in the reaction cycle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">SERT adopts the so-called LeuT fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), comprising twelve membrane-spanning helices that can be roughly divided into two regions known as the bundle and scaffold. Orientational changes of bundle elements – mainly transmembrane (TM) helices TM1 and TM6 – relative to the scaffold, mediate alternating accessibility of the central binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion to the so-called Na2 site at the bundle-scaffold interface is critical for mediating the adoption of an outward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The Na2 site is proximal to the S1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), another Na<sup>+</sup> site, Na1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and a Cl<sup>–</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the site of K<sup>+</sup> binding remains elusive.</p><p id="P8">Here, we present evidence for the location of the K<sup>+</sup> ion binding site in SERT using simulations and site-directed mutation studies. The earlier studies of SERT in PPMVs relied on native SERT protein, precluding mutational studies. To interrogate the contributions of individual residues of SERT, we used WT and mutant SERT extracted from a heterologous expression system and reconstituted into liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We verify that substrate accumulation by wild type SERT into proteoliposomes can be driven by symport of Na<sup>+</sup> and antiport of K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>. Then, to predict the most likely binding site for K<sup>+</sup>, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations systematically varying the bound cations, as well as the protonation states of two key Asp residues. These simulations reveal the intricate interplay between Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> binding in SERT, while predicting that Na2 (hereafter referred to as the second cation site, Ct2) is the most likely site for binding of K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>. Finally, to test this hypothesis, we measured uptake by proteoliposomes containing SERT modified at the Ct2 site, and the response of those mutants to intracellular K<sup>+</sup> under whole cell patch clamp. Our data show that K<sup>+</sup> (or H<sup>+</sup>) accelerates transport by replacing the Na<sup>+</sup> ion at Ct2 during the return step of the transport cycle and that modification of this site can selectively target the ability of K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> to replace Na<sup>+</sup> in return step of the transport cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A K<sup>+</sup> gradient drives uptake in wild type SERT proteoliposomes</title><p id="P9">To provide control of the solutions on both sides of the membrane while probing the K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> dependence of transport by wild type and mutagenized SERT, we used SERT proteoliposomes reconstituted from membrane patches excised using diisobutylene maleic acid (DIBMA) based on a procedure published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Uptake of the substrate analog APP<sup>+</sup> in the presence of 130 mM NaCl was then measured as fluorescence accumulation over time. The APP<sup>+</sup> accumulation rapidly increased, and then decayed as the ionic driving forces diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Uptake of substrate by SERT was shown in PPMV to be driven by an inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similarly, no uptake into proteoliposomes was observed in the absence of an ion gradient, even in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bars 1 and 2), i.e., with 20 mM Na<sup>+</sup> on both sides of the membrane. However, APP<sup>+</sup> accumulation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref>) increased significantly upon application of a transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup> gradient with 150 mM Na<sup>+</sup> in the external solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bar 4), consistent with observations made with PPMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and this stimulation did not require K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bars 4 vs. 5). To test whether uptake could be driven by high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, we applied 130 mM K<sup>+</sup> to the solution on both sides of the membrane; the level of fluorescence did not increase above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bar 2). By contrast, an outward-directed gradient of K<sup>+</sup> (in the absence of a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient) with 130 mM K<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub> and 0 mM K<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub> stimulated uptake to a similar level as the inward-directed gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bar 3). Moreover, simultaneous application of an inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient and an outward-directed K<sup>+</sup> gradient elicited an additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bar 6). These high levels of uptake depended on the gradient, and not merely on the presence of K<sup>+</sup> on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bar 5). Taken together, these results are in strong support of the role of Na<sup>+</sup>:K<sup>+</sup> exchange during 5-HT<sup>+</sup> transport as previously measured in PPMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>An H<sup>+</sup> gradient drives uptake in wild type SERT proteoliposomes</title><p id="P10">Although a transmembrane gradient of K<sup>+</sup> stimulated APP<sup>+</sup> accumulation, the presence of K<sup>+</sup> was not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, bars 4 vs. 5). Previous studies suggested that H<sup>+</sup> could compete with K<sup>+</sup> ions during the antiport phase of the 5-HT uptake cycle and could fulfill the requirement for an antiported cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We therefore tested whether a similar effect was observable in the APP<sup>+</sup> uptake assay. To establish a baseline, we measured the APP<sup>+</sup> fluorescence of the proteoliposomes in the presence of 20 mM Na<sup>+</sup> with the pH on both sides fixed at either 7.4 or 5.8. Neither condition elicited substantial accumulation of APP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, bars 1 and 2), consistent with the absence of an ionic driving force. We therefore repeated these measurements in the presence of an outward-directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient (pH<sub>in</sub> = 5.8, pH<sub>out</sub> = 7.4), which was sufficient to drive uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, bar 3) to a similar level as an inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient at either pH 7.4 or 5.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, bars 4 and 5, respectively). Similar to the results observed for K<sup>+</sup> above, the driving force garnered by the outward-directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient was additive when applied in the presence of an inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, bar 6). Overall, these effects echo those obtained for K<sup>+</sup>, supporting previous observations that under appropriate conditions, either K<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> antiport will drive substrate uptake by SERT.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MD simulations reveal the preferred K<sup>+</sup> ion coordination in the known SERT cation sites</title><p id="P11">While K<sup>+</sup> antiport by SERT is firmly established, the location of the binding site for K<sup>+</sup> is unknown. Since H<sup>+</sup> can substitute for K<sup>+</sup> ions, the binding site is likely to contain one or more protonatable side chains. Consequently, two plausible locations for K<sup>+</sup> binding include the Na1 and Na2 sites, each of which contains one Asp side chain, namely Asp98 and Asp437, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Ct1 and Ct2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) are highly conserved across the wider neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), having first been reported in the eubacterial transporter LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The Ct1 site is adjacent to the Cl<sup>–</sup> ion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and this proximity is likely responsible for the inter-dependence of their binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, despite the conservation of both Ct1 and Ct2 in SERT, the stoichiometry of 5-HT<sup>+</sup> to Na<sup>+</sup> is 1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), raising the possibility that, like the Cl<sup>–</sup> ion, one of the two Na<sup>+</sup> ions may be bound also during the “return” step of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). To assess whether either of the two known Na<sup>+</sup> sites is suitable for K<sup>+</sup> binding, we carried out MD simulations of the substrate-free transporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). We assumed simultaneous occupancy of one Cl<sup>–</sup> ion, one Na<sup>+</sup> ion, and one K<sup>+</sup> ion (in either of the two sites), while also assessing all combinations of protonation states of the two Asp side chains.</p><p id="P12">Because K<sup>+</sup> enters from the cytoplasm during the physiological transport cycle, we first attempted to assess the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to SERT structures in which the cytoplasmic pathway is open. However, this approach proved problematic due to the frequency of unbinding and binding events (measured as distance to the ion binding residues; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), reflecting in part that the (K<sup>+</sup>) sites are not suitably organized, due to the separation of TM1 and TM8 in that state; moreover, the pathway is not expected to close reproducibly on a micro-second timescale even in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>. By contrast, simulations of an occluded conformation of substrate-free SERT produced trajectories in which the ion behavior was reproducible over repeated simulations on a 500 ns timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We assumed that stable coordination, measured as the distance between the ion and its (representative) binding site residues in the occluded conformation, reflects a thermodynamically (meta)stable intermediate, consistent with previous observations of Na<sup>+</sup> binding in occluded conformations of LeuT-fold transporters on a sub-microsecond timescale e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Analysis of the ion-protein distances revealed a striking dependence on the protonation state of the coordinating Asp groups. In particular, when both Asp were charged, the ions were poorly coordinated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>) and poorly localized to the sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). By contrast, consistency in the coordination and position was observed in simulations in which one of the two aspartates was protonated. Of these, the combination with the smallest perturbations in coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) consisted of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion at Ct1, coordinated in part by Asp98 in its protonated form, and a K<sup>+</sup> ion at Ct2, coordinated in part by Asp437 in its charged form.</p><p id="P14">Significant perturbations were observed in all simulations with a K<sup>+</sup> ion placed at Ct1. In particular, the Cl<sup>–</sup> ion coordination was influenced strongly by the character of the neighboring cation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4; S5</xref>), which affects the anion interactions with Asn368 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) and allows water penetration into the Cl<sup>–</sup> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, the simulations predict that K<sup>+</sup> binds at Ct2, while a constitutive Na<sup>+</sup> ion preferentially occupies Ct1. Notably, in this scenario, Asp98 is predicted to be protonated because that is the most stable configuration, unlike in the 5-HT bound state where the charged primary amine on the substrate, we believe, is directly interacting with Asp98 in its charged state.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MD simulations with a K<sup>+</sup> ion in S1 support the preferred ion combination</title><p id="P15">In the aforementioned simulations, the S1 site is occupied by water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Although to some this might be unexpected, such hydration is not an inherently unstable occurrence, as it is evidently preferable to a vacuum. Nevertheless, the presence of water in this region raises the possibility that K<sup>+</sup> ions compete with 5-HT by occupying the same location as the substrate primary amine group, which shares Asp98 coordination with Na1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). If the K<sup>+</sup> ion is in the S1 site, and we assume that only one Na<sup>+</sup> and one Cl<sup>–</sup> ion are bound, as above, then either Ct1 or Ct2 must be unoccupied. Given its limited impact on the Cl<sup>–</sup> ion, we assumed that the constitutive Na<sup>+</sup> ion would occupy the Ct1 site. We carried out MD simulations of SERT with a K<sup>+</sup> ion initially placed at the amino nitrogen of 5-HT<sup>+</sup> next to Asp98.</p><p id="P16">Tracking the position of the K<sup>+</sup> ion relative to the two sites demonstrates again an exquisite sensitivity to the protonation states of the aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In particular, when Asp98 was protonated and Asp437 was charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, leftmost column), the K<sup>+</sup> ion placed in the S1 site rapidly and reproducibly moved away from the neutralized Asp98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, upper panel) and into the Ct2 site toward the charged Asp437 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, lower panel; Movie S1). The endpoint of these trajectories was the configuration identified in the previous section, i.e., with Na<sup>+</sup> at Ct1, K<sup>+</sup> at Ct2, and Asp98 protonated. By contrast, when Asp98 was charged, or when both Asp were protonated, the K<sup>+</sup> ion remained in the central pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, Movie S2), as if encountering a kinetic barrier to entering the Ct2 site, presumably due to electrostatic interaction between the K<sup>+</sup> ion and the charge on Asp98. Notably, the observed movement into Ct2 could not be attributable purely to attraction to the charge at Asp437, because no similar transitions occurred when both Asp were charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, rightmost column). When in the S1 site the K<sup>+</sup> ion formed interactions that alternated between the backbone of Phe335 and the side chain of Ser438, in addition to a cation-pi interaction with the aromatic ring of Tyr95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). However, this coordination was overall less stable than that observed when K<sup>+</sup> occupied Ct2 and Asp98 was protonated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, taken together with the results above, the simulations also predict that K<sup>+</sup> binds at Ct2.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The substrate-induced current through D437T and S438A is insensitive to K<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub></title><p id="P17">To test the hypothesis that K<sup>+</sup> binds at Ct2, we made SERT mutants where we either replaced Asp437 with Thr (to recapitulate the binding site present in LeuT) or replaced Ser438 with Ala (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then recorded 5-HT<sup>+</sup>-induced currents obtained from cells transiently expressing these mutants. For comparison, we first replicated measurements made for wild type SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) at a range of applied voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, 5B</xref>). Upon application of 5-HT under physiological intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, wild type SERT rapidly elicited an inward peak current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), reflecting the movement of 5-HT and Na<sup>+</sup> charges across the membrane for all the transporters that were poised in an outward-facing conformation, and the subsequent release of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The peak current was also observed when the intracellular solution contained NMDG<sup>+</sup> instead of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

Both Asp437 and Ser438 are conserved across all 87 annotated SLC6A4 sequences in the UniprotKB database as of October 2023.

However, given that configurations predicted in the simulations with K<sup>+</sup> at Ct2 are not markedly different from that of the Na2-bound state, it remains to be understood from a molecular standpoint, why 5-HT does not bind together with K<sup>+</sup> and become exported, i.e., how the transporter prevents futile efflux of substrate.

In monoamine transporters, by contrast, the equivalent leucine (Leu99 in SERT), is flanked by Asp98, rearrangement of which is more sterically constrained.

It will be of interest in future work to explore the role of protons in accompanying the return step of transport, and thereby in defining the net stoichiometry of transport, in more detail.

These cells were then used to generate a stable line expressing SERT wildtype or they were transiently transfected with D437T or S438A, in serum-free DMEM using polyethyleneimine 25kDa (PEI) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, TX, USA) as the transfecting agent. The plasmid: PEI ratio was 1:3 (w/w). The cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. These cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FBS), 0.6 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> penicillin, 1 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin, and 100 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> of geneticin/G418 for positive selection of transporter-expressing clones. None of the cell lines used in this study were included in the list of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee.</p><p id="P41">24 hours prior to patching, the cells were seeded at a low density on PDL-coated 35 mm plates. Substrate-induced transporter currents were recorded under voltage clamp. Cells were continuously superfused with a physiological external solution that contained 163 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM glucose, and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). A pipette solution mimicking the internal ionic composition of a cell contained 163 mM K-mesylate, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), and 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 using KOH). In experiments in which we omitted intracellular potassium, we used the following solution: 163 mM NMDG-mesylate, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 using KOH). For experiments in which we lowered the internal pH to 5.5, we used a potassium-free solution, where we replaced HEPES with MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid). The pH was adjusted to 5.5 using methanesulfonic acid (MsOH).</p><p id="P42">For patch clamp recordings, we employed the whole-cell configuration using an Axon 200B amplifier equipped with an Axon 1550 digitizer (both from Molecular Devices, LLC, San José, CA, USA). Recordings were sampled with 10 kHz. We quantified current amplitudes and associated kinetics using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices, LLC, San José, CA, USA). Passive holding currents were subtracted, and the traces were digitally filtered using an 80 Hz digital 8-pole Bessel low-pass filter.</p><p id="P43">5-HT or cocaine was applied using a perfusion system (Octaflow II, ALA Scientific Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) that allowed for rapid and complete solution exchange around the cells within approximately 50 milliseconds. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (25°C) using a temperature control unit (cell microcontrol inline preheater, Green Leaf Scientific, Dublin, Ireland) connected to a temperature control system (PTC-20, npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). Both the patch-clamp holder and pipette electrode were operated via a PatchStar micromanipulator (Scientifica Ltd., Uckfield, East Sussex, United Kingdom).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Table and Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS193150-supplement-Supplemental_Table_and_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d227aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Division of Intramural Research of the NIH, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NS003139 (to E.H. and L.R.F.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32071233 and 32371304 to YW.Z.), the Guangzhou City-University Joint Research Program (2023A03J0046 to YW.Z.), the Basic and Innovative Research Program for Guangzhou University Postgraduate Students (2022GDJC-M15 to Q.C.), the Austrian Science Fund/FWF (P36667 to W.S.) and the Vienna Science and Technology Fund/WWTF (LSC17-026 to M.F.).

To this end, proteins such as serotonin transporter (SERT) leverage the gradients of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions across the cell membrane, generated by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. While the role of Na<sup>+</sup> in neurotransmitter transport is well understood, our understanding of the role of potassium in SERT has been limited. In this study, the authors use a combination of biochemical, electrophysiological, and computational tools, to identify the Na2 site as the binding site for K<sup>+</sup>, shedding light on a critical aspect of neurotransmitter transport.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of SERT indicating the possible locations of the K<sup>+</sup> binding sites tested in this work.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the binding site region showing the Ct1 and Ct2 sites (white spheres) and the neighboring chloride ion (green sphere).
