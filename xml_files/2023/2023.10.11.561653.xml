In this study, we demonstrate the protective role of hair follicle-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from scarring hair follicle degeneration. Mechanistically, disruption of EGFR signalling generates a cell intrinsic hypersensitivity within the JAK-STAT1 pathway, compromising the immune privilege in the context of CD8 T cell and NK cell-mediated inflammation. Genetic depletion of either JAK1/2 or STAT1 or topical therapeutic inhibition of JAK1/2 restores the immune privilege and activates stem cells to resume hair growth in mouse models of epidermal and hair follicle specific EGFR deletion. Skin biopsies from EGFR inhibitor-treated and from EGFR-independent cicatricial alopecia patients indicate active STAT1 signalling within the hair follicles. Notably, a case study of folliculitis decalvans, characterised by progressive hair loss, scaling and perifollicular erythema, demonstrates successful treatment with systemic JAK1/2 inhibition. Our findings offer mechanistic insights and present a therapeutic strategy for addressing scarring hair follicle destruction associated with EGFR-inhibitor therapy and cicatricial alopecia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hair serves an evolutionarily essential purpose in mammals by acting as a sensor, thermo-regulator and physical shield against external threats (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></italic>). Hair follicles, however, also represent a vulnerable portal within the epidermal barrier. Anatomical or immunological dysfunction of this unit can be exploited by microbes leading to hair follicle inflammation and the consecutive destruction of this essential body structure (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P3">To counter tissue destruction during inflammatory insults, hair follicles have evolved an immune privilege (IP) mechanism (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></italic>). This hair follicle stem cell IP is characterized by low expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) for self-tolerance, up-regulation of “no danger” signals such as CD200, generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment via TGF-β secretion, and recruitment of regulatory T cells, Trem2<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and invariant natural killer (NK) T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P4">Autoimmunity mediated by cytotoxic T cells can lead to the destruction of the hair follicle bulb region, which consists of transiently amplifying cells during hair growth, resulting in reversible hair loss known as alopecia areata (AA) in humans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></italic>). Several anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, have shown varying therapeutic effects in AA by targeting these T-cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P5">In contrast to AA, scarring (cicatricial) alopecia is characterized by the loss of the bulge region, which represents the hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) niche, leading to permanent and irreversible hair loss. Recent evidence implicates the collapse of the IP in HFSCs as a contributing factor in scarring alopecia types such as neutrophilic folliculitis decalvans and lymphocytic lichen planopilaris (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></italic>). Hallmarks of these conditions include hyperproliferation and apoptosis of HFSCs, upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II, reduced CD200 expression, and infiltration of various immune cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></italic>). So far, the therapeutic options for scarring alopecia are limited by the lack of mechanistic understanding.</p><p id="P6">Patients with loss-of-function mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or ADAM17, an EGFR ligands sheddase, as well as those undergoing long-term EGFR-inhibitor treatment during targeted cancer therapy, often experience severe chronic skin inflammation, which can be accompanied by scarring hair loss (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></italic>). The lack of effective treatments targeting the underlying causes of these cutaneous adverse events often leads to dose reduction or cessation of cancer therapy, compromising its efficacy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P7">Recently, we have demonstrated the importance of EGFR-ERK signalling in maintaining barrier integrity and preventing bacterial invasion and dysbiosis during hair shaft eruption, revealing the initial structural and inflammatory trigger (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></italic>). We could show that the barrier defect can be rescued by re-establishing active ERK signalling independent of EGFR through transgenic over-expression of SOS under the K5 promoter (EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> K5-SOS). In addition, the microbial arm of the skin inflammation can be reduced by broad spectrum antibiotic therapy (EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> Abx). However, the molecular and immunological mechanisms driving and sustaining the chronic phase of the skin inflammation and hair loss remain enigmatic.</p><p id="P8">Here we show that EGFR protects against microbiota-driven destruction of the HFSC niche and subsequent scarring hair loss. Mechanistically, tissue destruction is initiated by the lack of EGFR-ERK signalling and driven by unleashed JAK-STAT1 activation in a cell autonomous manner. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells expressing IFN-γ provoke disruption of the unguarded IP and its HFSC niche. Prophylactic and therapeutic JAK1/2 inhibition prevented the collapse of HFSC IP, restored hair growth, improved epidermal barrier function, and alleviated skin inflammation in epidermal and hair follicle specific EGFR deleted mouse models and a patient with previously untreatable folliculitis decalvans. Active STAT1 could be readily detected in patient samples during EGFR-inhibitor treatment and in different types of cicatricial alopecia.</p><p id="P9">These data represent mechanistic evidence of the HFSC intrinsic JAK-STAT1 cascade being responsible for exhausting the IP and implicates EGFR in securing its regulatory machinery. Our findings offer therapeutic strategies for effectively managing severe adverse events induced by EGFR inhibitors and scarring hair follicle destruction.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Hair follicle-specific EGFR protects from microbiota-driven inflammatory hair follicle destruction</title><p id="P10">As previously published by our group, constitutive deletion of epidermal EGFR using K5-cre (EGFR<sup>Δep</sup>) results in epidermal barrier disruption and skin inflammation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>). Interestingly, the reduction of the inflammation by transgenic K5-SOS expression and antibiotic therapy prevented visible hair loss between 2 and 5 months of age in EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Additional FACS analysis revealed that the inflammation is responsible for losing the CD34 positive hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and that this precedes macroscopic hair loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref> for overall FACS gating strategy). The rescue of HFSCs during antibiosis is paralleled by a reduction of αβT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Most EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice die within the first couple of weeks after birth due to the inflammation, which hinders the effective study of the late chronic inflammatory stage including hair loss (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>). Considering this, we generated a hair follicle-specific EGFR deletion mouse model using the Egr2-cre line (EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-G</xref>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></italic>). Efficient deletion of EGFR in the hair follicles and retained interfollicular epidermal EGFR expression was confirmed using immune fluorescence (IF) staining of EGFR in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> skin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Most importantly, these mice develop early hair follicle-specific inflammation, as described by Langerhans cell (LC) specific MHC-II up-regulation around the hair follicles and later-occurring, microbiota-dependent hair loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D and E</xref>). The restriction of the inflammation to the hair follicles leads to a dramatically improved survival of these mice over the pan-epidermal deletion model, which enabled us to study the events leading to the late-stage chronic skin inflammation and the subsequent hair loss in detail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Chronological analysis revealed that the HFSC niche is established during morphogenesis and persists up to the first month after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, starting with the first anagen hair cycle phase after morphogenesis, the HFSCs gradually disappeared over time with no detectable CD34 positive HFSCs remaining after 5 months concomitant with an epidermal influx of immune cells and visible hair loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). Moreover, we also observed a time-delayed size reduction of the entire hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that hair follicle-specific EGFR protects from microbiota-driven inflammatory hair follicle destruction and hair loss.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Hallmarks of scarring alopecia identified through RNA profiling of EGFR-deficient hair follicle bulge stem cells</title><p id="P11">Up to the first month of age, HFSCs can be detected in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In order to analyze their transcriptional status, we isolated these cells using the CD34 HFSC surface marker from WT and EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice at 1 month and performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Efficient <italic>Egfr</italic> deletion was verified by RT-PCR from the sorted cells and <italic>Egfr</italic> is the most significantly down-regulated gene in the RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). Principal component analysis revealed the dramatic transcriptional differences between WT and EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>). Regulon analysis using DoRothEA revealed differential expression of transcription factors involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g. Foxm1, E2f2, E2f4 and Myc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, among the top 50 deregulated genes (DEG) in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSCs was the downregulated <italic>Bmp6</italic>, implicated in HF quiescence and the upregulated proliferation-induced gene <italic>Mki67</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>). These data prompted us to specifically look at proliferation, HFSC activation and quiescence genes, which revealed the hyper-proliferative status of the EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSCs compared to the WT situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Next, we confirmed these findings using IF to detect the proliferating bulb region and Ki67 expressing bulge CD34 positive HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In line with this, shaved dorsal skin of 2-month-old EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice revealed that EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice remained in the anagen hair cycle phase (dark skin color) at 2 months of age as opposed to the light telogen skin of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>). Interestingly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA Wiki pathways), apart from proliferation, also identified signatures of apoptosis and fibrosis in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Therefore, we performed IF analysis from 3-month-old EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice, which confirmed apoptotic (Caspase 8<sup>+</sup>) HFSCs and Vimentin expression as a sign of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). After macroscopically visible hair loss at 5 months of age, skin sections of EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice indicate follicular plugging and fibrotic hair structures, with a dramatic decline of hair follicles after 10 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Taken together, we identified that during the chronic phase of skin inflammation, EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice develop hallmarks of scarring hair follicle destruction.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Hair follicle intrinsic inflammatory JAK-STAT1 signaling induces immune privilege breakdown, hair follicle destruction and skin barrier disruption upon EGFR deletion</title><p id="P12">Next, we aimed to find the active signaling hubs in the HFSCs of EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice. Cell signaling analysis from the HFSC RNAseq data set with PROGENy identified the activity of the inflammatory JAK-STAT and TNFα pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Previous studies indicated that the TNFα pathway does not play a prominent role in the inflammatory EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> phenotype (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></italic>). In line with the PROGENy pathway analysis from our EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSC RNA profiling, we detected a broad induction of the JAK-STAT signaling hub, including downstream effectors (e.g. interferon induced genes: <italic>Ifi47</italic>, <italic>Ifi214</italic> and <italic>Ifitm3</italic>) and the downregulation of its negative regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (<italic>Socs3;</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, first panel). SOCS3 protein down-modulation could also be visualized in the hair follicles from skin sections from EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice as compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). Notable, we also discovered a remarkable up-regulation of various JAK-STAT utilizing receptor complexes on EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> second panel). This prompted us to further investigate possible downstream effectors. MHC up-regulation has been linked to the JAK-STAT1 signaling cascade in keratinocytes (KCs) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></italic>). Indeed, we first recognized the upregulation of genes encoding for the MHC including its functional components (transporter associated with antigen processing: <italic>Tap1</italic> and <italic>Tap2</italic> genes) and regulators (Nod like receptor 5: <italic>Nlrc5</italic>) together with components of the immunoproteasome (e.g. proteasome subunit beta type-9, 8 and 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, third and fourth panel). MHC I and II protein up-regulation were confirmed on the cell membrane of epidermal cells from EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice in the chronic inflammatory phase as compared to the WT situation using FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref> for gating). Quiescent immune-privileged HFSCs have low MHC expression and are able to resist pro-inflammatory signals to prevent its up-regulation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></italic>). Especially MHC-I antigen presentation on HFSCs is considered as breakdown of the immune privilege (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></italic>). EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> HFSCs displayed MHC up-regulation on the RNA level and protein surface expression between 2 (postnatal day 15) and 4 (p30) weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). In line with immune privilege breakdown, we could additionally detect the downregulation of the anti-inflammatory surface proteins CD55 and CD200 in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we utilized our EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> K5-SOS/antibiosis model system to investigate the role of barrier immunity versus microbiota in influencing MHC regulation. HFSC-specific MHC-I surface expression was predominantly induced by the bacterial arm of the skin inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). In order to interfere with the hair follicle specific JAK-STAT1 cascade and investigate its involvement in the MHC expression status, skin function and inflammation, we crossed EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice with either STAT1- or JAK1/2 floxed mice to generate double and triple hair follicle-specific knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-H</xref>). Superficial hair loss was ameliorated in EGFR STAT1<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice as compared to EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). FACS analysis of the HFSCs revealed that their MHC-I expression is dependent on JAK-STAT1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, HFSC MHC-I). Most importantly, HFSC destruction can be prevented by interrupting the cell-intrinsic JAK-STAT1 cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, CD34+ HFSC). Additionally, we also observed an overall amelioration of the skin inflammation as measured by epidermal CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cell infiltration and specifically αβ and γδT cell influx, which was paralleled by a reduction of the skin barrier defect (trans-epidermal water loss, TEWL) in the EGFR JAK1/2<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> and EGFR STAT1<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G and H</xref>). In summary, we conclude that the hair follicle-specific activation of the JAK-STAT1 cascade plays a dominant role in immune privilege collapse, hair follicle destruction and barrier immunity triggered by the lack of EGFR.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Single-cell analysis revealed that immune privilege collapse and hair follicle destruction is driven by IFNγ-expressing NK and CD8 T cells</title><p id="P14">The initial trigger of the inflammation is a structural barrier breach at the hair follicle accompanied by microbial invasion, with the latter inducing JAK-STAT mediated MHC up-regulation, prolonging the barrier defect and driving αβ and γδT cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-G</xref>). This indicates a microbiota-dependent immune effector, which triggers and feeds into the hair follicle JAK-STAT1 cascade. Therefore, we next sought to investigate the immune infiltrate and the epidermal cytokine/chemokine milieu. Chronically inflamed, bald EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice at 5 months of age show a dramatic shift in their epidermal immune cell compartment as compared to the homeostatic dendritic epidermal T cell (DETC) and LC networks in WT mice as measured by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). They lose these steady-state compartments and acquire an immune infiltrate dominated by αβ-, γδT cells and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In order to expand the depth of this analysis, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the hair follicle and immune cell compartment of EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice at 3 months of age, which confirmed the FACS data and additionally identified two types of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer cells (NK cells) and allowed stratification of T-cells into CD4, CD8 and T regulatory cells (Tregs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Confirming our data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we also observed the fibrotic transition of the bulge compartment (fibrotic bulge, FB) indicating scarring hair follicle destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). We next used this dataset to map the chemokine and cytokine profile of the immune- and hair follicle cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This captured the multifaceted inflammatory microenvironment in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice, with prominent <italic>Il17</italic>-producing γδT cells and ILC3s, <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> producing CD4 Th2 cells and ILC2s, <italic>Ifnγ</italic> producing CD8 T-cells and NK cells and IL1α/β and OSM expressing macrophages. Given the importance of the JAK-STAT cascade in the hair follicles of EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice, we next sorted out the possible JAK-STAT inducers IL4, IL13, IFN-γ and OSM among the cytokine profile and screened for their potential in epidermal MHC regulation using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> skin explant culture system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). We observed a significant up-regulation of MHC I and II only with IFN-γ, whether or not the tissue was incubated with the EGFR-inhibitor erlotinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Putative cell-cell interaction analysis using CellChat indicated that the only cellular sources of <italic>Ifnγ</italic> were the CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). CellChat also revealed a complex chemokine signaling network capable of recruiting the various T cell subsets and NK cells with <italic>Ccl5</italic> interlinking CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></italic>). Interestingly, the gene signatures of the CD8 T cell and NK compartments cluster relatively close together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). Intracellular FACS analysis for IFN-γ confirmed its up-regulation in infiltrating αβT cells and NK cells at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In order to investigate the functional role of these cells during hair follicle destruction we used depletion antibodies for CD8 or NK1.1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. After confirming the cell deletion efficiency by the antibodies, we could show by FACS analysis, that both CD8 T cells and NK cells are influencing the HFSC immune privilege status and survivability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Interestingly, however, CD8 T cell and NK cell depletion did not impact the γδT cell compartment and did not ameliorate the epidermal barrier defect as observed with JAK1/2 and STAT1 deficient hair follicles (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H and I</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H and I</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that among the heterogeneous immune environment induced by prolonged EGFR deficiency, IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells and NK cells drive the hair follicle JAK-STAT dependent immune privilege decline and initiate the HFSC destruction.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Therapeutic JAK inhibition re-initiates hair growth, rescues the immune privilege and ameliorates overall skin function and inflammation in EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> and EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice</title><p id="P17">We next tested the direct effect of IFN-γ on <italic>in vitro</italic> KCs, either from EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice with their respective WT controls or WT mice treated with or without the EGFR-inhibitor erlotinib. MHC II induction was dramatically enhanced in EGFR-depleted or inhibited KCs as compared to WT induction and this expression could be inhibited by the clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Encouraged by these results, we next applied the JAK1/2 inhibitor topically on 5-month-old bald EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Although, these mice had only a rudimentary HFSC niche and already degraded hair follicles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), we could, during the course of 28 days treatment, observe the induction of novel hair regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This visible therapeutic effect was accompanied by the reduction of MHC surface expression and the re-appearance of the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). Interestingly, however, the re-activated HFSCs still had reduced expression levels of the mature stem cell surface marker CD34 but could be readily detected by the stem cell marker SOX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). Prophylactic ruxolitinib treatment starting from 1 month old EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice, however, prevented the loss of CD34 surface expression, similar to the JAK1/2 or STAT1 deletion in this model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>). In the therapeutic setting, the re-appearance of SOX9 positive HFSCs was concomitant with an increase in hair follicle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Apart from novel hair re-growth, therapeutic JAK1/2 inhibition was able to restore the epidermal barrier function, normalize epidermal thickness and stopped αβT cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F-H</xref>). Interestingly, JAK1/2 inhibition did not influence the γδT cell compartment, the neutrophil recruitment and the NK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In order to extrapolate the mechanism and the therapeutic protocol to the full-scale skin inflammation model, we applied the JAK1/2 inhibitor to the right side (including the ear) of mice lacking EGFR in the complete epidermal compartment (EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice) with the left side treated with vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I-J</xref>). Similar to the results from the EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> hair follicle model, JAK1/2 inhibition reduced MHC expression, re-established skin barrier function and restored hair growth on the right side of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I-J</xref>). Especially the restored epidermal barrier function and the hair regrowth indicates the successful preclinical therapeutic approach for treating the full blown skin inflammation. We next crossed EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice with STAT1 floxed animals and could observe similar prophylactic effects as with the EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> hair follicle model (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H-J</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K-M</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We could previously demonstrate that EGFR-controlled ERK signaling prevents the initial barrier disruption during novel hair shaft eruption or outgrowth (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>). In order to investigate the involvement of the JAK cascade during this initial structural insult, we treated EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice during hair eruption (starting from p6 until p19) topically with the JAK1/2 inhibitor (Fig. S 5E and F). As expected, this early prophylactic JAK1/2 inhibition did not impact the initial ERK dependent barrier breach, but only ameliorated MHC expression and prevented αβT cell influx. This indicates that the early barrier disruption is independent of JAK1/2 signaling and that hyper-activated JAK-STAT1 drives only the chronic phase of hair and skin inflammation. Taken together, we could demonstrate the effectiveness of topical JAK inhibition in reducing skin inflammation, restoring epidermal barrier function and reversing hair follicle destruction caused by prolonged EGFR dysfunction. These data represent pre-clinical evidence for the therapeutic potential of JAK inhibitors to manage adverse events during EGFR-inhibitor-targeted cancer therapy and reverse developing scarring hair follicle destruction.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Phosphorylation of STAT1 in EGFR-inhibitor-treated patients and its relevance in cicatricial alopecia, along with the efficacy of JAK-inhibitor therapy in folliculitis decalvans</title><p id="P20">In order to confirm the most important hallmarks of our findings in patients, we next analyzed biopsies of EGFR-inhibitor treated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cancer patients. Comparison of pre- and post-EGFR-inhibitor treatment skin biopsies confirmed the breech of IP by epidermal MHC I upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Furthermore, we detected the presence of phosphorylated STAT1 protein in clinical samples after EGFR inhibition, indicating its activation during the course of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In line with our mouse model, phosphorylated STAT1 was elevated in the hair follicle and epidermis of patients with folliculitis decalvans, frontal fibrosing alopecia and lichen planopilaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Most importantly, we administered oral baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, to a 31-year-old male patient diagnosed with folliculitis decalvans. Notably, no prior treatments yielded success for this patient over the course of three years. The histopathological examination revealed the presence of fibrotic hair follicles along with an inflammatory histiocytic and lymphocytic infiltrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). Noticeable improvements became apparent 4 weeks into JAK inhibitor therapy. Perifollicular erythema, yellowish and adherent scaling, and progressive scarring hair loss began to resolve and continued to improve over the subsequent 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). These positive clinical outcomes underscore the practical application of our research findings to human skin pathology. Moreover, they emphasize the significance of targeting the JAK-STAT1 signaling hub as a crucial therapeutic strategy in the context of EGFR inhibition and the treatment of human scarring alopecia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">The hairy coat is a survival necessity of mammals, as it protects from life-threatening outer influences like cold or ultraviolet radiation. In humans, reversible or irreversible hair loss, irrespective of the cause, severely affects the Quality-of-Life and psychological well-being of patients (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P23">Using hair follicle-specific JAK1/2 and STAT1 knockout mice, we refined the spectrum of activity of the JAK inhibitors to HFSC-specific IP protection in scarring alopecia. As this condition is considered irreversible and current treatment regimens are only able to delay hair loss, it is of clinical importance that we were able to prophylactically prevent but also therapeutically reverse developing scarring hair follicle destruction using JAK inhibitors in mice and in a case study of human follicultis decalvans.</p><p id="P24">This suggests that not all HFSCs are destroyed simultaneously, but rather that the HFSC niche is constantly degraded and scarred over time. We observed a decline in HFSCs concomitant with the first anagen phase at 1 month of age and the start of visible hair loss from 3-month-old EGFR<sup>ΔEgr2</sup> mice onward. Despite that, we were able to effectively regain hair growth up to 5 months of age. In older mice (e.g. 10 months of age), the complete scarring of the hair follicle then prevents therapeutic intervention indicating the irreversible loss of the stem cell niche. This represents evidence of a therapeutic window for treating scarring hair loss, although, in the various human conditions, it may differ greatly depending on the intensity of the inflammatory insult and the source and potency of the respective JAK-STAT1 activator.</p><p id="P25">It has been described that JAK inhibitors, although effective in some autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or AA, do not necessarily have a clinically stable effect and after the cessation of the therapy, relapses are very common (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></italic>). This might be reflective of the only temporary inhibiting effect on T cells. However, in scarring alopecia a more stable or longer lasting therapeutic effect could be possible in part due to the here-described multidirectional mode of action, which includes cell intrinsic restoration of the IP, blunting the recruiting and activation of the immune effectors, supporting anti-microbial immunity and by the restoration of skin barrier function. Additionally, other off-label case studies report successful JAK inhibitor therapy in cases of some scarring alopecia types (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></italic>). We now present the mechanistic explanation for these unbiased treatment attempts. Future clinical trials will disclose, whether JAK inhibitors can impact scarring alopecia in the long-term.</p><p id="P26">Upon EGFR inhibition, the initial immune response does not require the adaptive arm of the immune system. However, during the chronic phase, microbial dysbiosis leads to the recruitment of various T cell subsets to the epidermal compartment. Their cytokine profile indicates Th1, 17 and 2 responses, which are supported by their corresponding innate lymphoid cells, similar to what can be observed in atopic dermatitis (AD). Depleting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN-γ identified the driver of hair follicle-specific JAK-STAT1 activation and re-established the HFSC IP. Additionally, we identified NK cells as IFN-γ producers, which were also capable of disrupting the IP in our EGFR specific model system.</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, transcriptional profiling of the HFSCs revealed a broad up-regulation of JAK-STAT potent receptors. Among them the IL4- and IL13 receptors. Recent clinical case studies indicate that blocking IL4 and IL13 during AD-associated alopecia can reverse the hair loss indicating that various JAK-STAT inducers can feed into the HFSC intrinsic cascade (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></italic>). This additionally indicates that HFSC specific inhibition of the JAK-STAT1 cascade might act universally and is independent of the driving cytokines and its cellular source.</p><p id="P28">Therefore, it would be beneficial for patients with scarring alopecia, irrespective of the type, to screen for therapeutic markers highlighting JAK-STAT1 activity or JAK-inhibitor sensitivity to predict treatment efficiency or success. Common genetic signatures of cicatricial alopecia patients, identified fibrosis, immune cell pathways and susceptibility of frontal fibrosing alopecia with a locus containing the MHC-I region (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></italic>). We could readily visualize the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the up-regulation of MHC-I on epidermal cells from patients under EGFR-inhibitor therapy and the pSTAT1 signature in patients with cicatricial alopeciás. These might represent possible candidates and readily available diagnostic markers for pre-screening patients with hair loss. However, more stable targets downstream of JAK-STAT1 like interferon induced transcription factors or soluble indicators measurable in liquid biopsies could help to effectively stratify patients in the future.</p><p id="P29">The molecular mechanism by which EGFR regulates the JAK-STAT1 sensitivity of epidermal cells might be ultimately driven by cell intrinsic receptor over-expression and simultaneous down-modulation of negative feedback mechanisms like SOCS3 as we could show here. EGFR, apart from regulating epidermal ERK and AKT signaling, is known to feed into the STAT3 cascade. Therefore, it is possible that the decline of epidermal EGFR mediated STAT3 signaling switches the balance in favor of STAT1 activation as it is described for STAT3 knockout conditions in various model systems including cancer cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P30">It is intriguing to speculate that similar mechanisms of IP preservation in HFSCs, identified in this study, are also active in various EGFR-dependent solid tumors and that EGFR inhibition renders them more immunogenic, thereby supporting anti-cancer therapy efficiency. Indeed, it is a long-standing observation that the overall survival of cancer patients positively correlates to their EGFR-targeted anti-cancer therapy’s adverse events (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></italic>). Our study, however, indicates that the cell intrinsic JAK-STAT1 sensitivity introduced by the lack of EGFR also needs to be triggered and driven by the immune cell compartment, which opens room for improving or boosting the therapy effect by JAK activators.</p><p id="P31">Vice versa, further studies need to evaluate the feasibility of using JAK-inhibitors to treat EGFR-inhibitor induced adverse events, as JAK-inhibitors are predicted to rather support cancer growth by blunting the activity of cytotoxic T-cells. Therefore, topical application in this setting is crucial for the benefit of the patient and cancer therapy outcome.</p><p id="P32">Lastly, topical EGFR activation might represent a prophylactic strategy to strengthen the hair follicle IP and prevent disease onset in patients with genetic susceptibilities to scarring alopecia.</p><p id="P33">Taken together, our study identifies EGFR as cell intrinsic immune modulator, which tightens the strings on the JAK-STAT1 cascade to prevent inflammatory destruction of evolutionary important tissues like the hair follicle.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Mice</title><p id="P34">EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> and K5-SOS transgenic mice were generated as previously described in Lichtenberger et al.(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></italic>) and Klufa et al.(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>).
