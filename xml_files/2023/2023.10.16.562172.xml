However, the mechanisms underlying chromosome configuration and reorganization are currently not fully understood. Using 3D single-molecule localization microscopy and live-cell imaging, we show that the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-associated configuration during rapid growth. To study the influence of different biosynthetic processes on nucleoid morphology and positioning, we recorded multi-colour super-resolution images during drug treatment. After developing analysis routines for confocal and super-resolution images, we captured highly resolved snapshots which revealed the complete loss of the membrane-bound state of the nucleoid within 10 minutes of halting transcription and translation. This indicates an active role of transertion (coupled transcription, translation and membrane insertion) in nucleoid organization. In contrast, cell wall synthesis inhibition only affects nucleoid organization during morphological changes. Further, we provide evidence that the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid spatially correlates with MreB in unperturbed <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, while this correlation diminishes in cells with changed cell geometry or upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Replication inhibition experiments, as well as multi-drug treatments highlight the role of entropic effects and transcription in nucleoid condensation and positioning. In summary, we provide experimental evidence for transertion as a principal organiser of the bacterial nucleoid, and show that an altered metabolic state and antibiotic treatment both lead to major changes in the degree of transertion and overall spatial organization of the nucleoid. Our high-resolution characterization reveals dynamics of antibiotic action and provides tools to quantify bacterial chromosome organization. This does not only provide valuable insights into the role of transertion, but can also be applied to study other cell-biological processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chromosome replication and segregation represent the fundamental processes underlying cell proliferation and survival. In bacteria, they occur simultaneously with other cellular processes, such as transcription, translation or signalling, and share the same space due to the lack of compartmentalisation. Despite this lack of compartmentalisation, bacterial chromosomes were found to be highly organized spatiotemporally, with nucleoid organization strongly differing between bacterial species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The entity of chromosomal DNA in a bacterial cell is called the ‘nucleoid’ and much research is dedicated to investigate its organization. Seminal work showed that the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> nucleoid is not randomly floating within the cell cytosol but shows structuring into domains of varying sizes on the molecular level by the action of nucleoid-associated proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Similar to eukaryotic nuclei, chromosomal regions populate specific areas in non-replicating cells and replicating nucleoids show precise intracellular positioning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid exhibits varying complexity, i.e. degree of sub-structuring, depending on the nutrient availability and, thus, growth rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, nucleoids are more condensed and structurally complex during fast growth than during slow growth, where it populates a larger fraction of the cytosol. The global morphology of these ‘complex’ nucleoids was found to be stable on the minute time scale, while fast imaging in slowly growing cells revealed rapid transversal nucleoid fluctuations along the entire bacterial long axis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Despite these large differences in organization, we still do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms that shape the nucleoid in an environment-dependent manner.</p><p id="P3">Entropy has early been identified as a key principle in chromosome organization, contributing to sister chromosome segregation, nucleoid positioning and compaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Other factors involved in nucleoid organization are confinement, molecular crowding, cell size and morphology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Wall-less <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, so-called L-forms, exhibit abnormal cell and nucleoid shapes, while their growth in a confined space resulted in nucleoid morphology and chromosome segregation patterns as they are seen in walled cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Chromosome size and positioning was further found to scale with cell size due to confinement and molecular crowding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The correlation between cell and nucleoid size was recently extended to a wide range of bacterial species, highlighting a conserved contribution of physical principles to chromosome organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In addition, various biological processes strongly influence bacterial chromosome organization. A large body of work investigated the effect of biosynthetic processes such as transcription or translation on nucleoid structure, revealing dramatic reorganization during inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These effects are so severe that cell and nucleoid morphology can be used as a readout for drug mode-of-action studies, drug screening applications and antibiotic susceptibility testing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Particularly, transcription was found to affect chromosome size and dynamics in different bacterial species as shown by Hi-C and microscopic experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Inhibition of translation or DNA replication also leads to strong nucleoid phenotypes, indicating that chromosome organization is tightly connected to biosynthetic processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Of note, nucleoid reorganization by transcription- and translation-halting drugs occurs on a rapid time scale, as e.g. shown by Bakshi and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This provided evidence that spatiotemporal coupling of transcription, translation and insertion of membrane proteins, so-called transertion, keeps the nucleoid in an expanded state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Localized protein biosynthesis increases efficiency and is conserved in eukaryotic cells, in which proteins are co-translationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. As transcription in bacteria often occurs co-translationally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, an indirect coupling of the nucleoid to the membrane represents an attractive hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In fact, passive segregation by membrane attachment of the origin of replication together with cell elongation was one of the first proposed mechanisms for bacterial chromosome segregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The observation of rapid re-centring of nucleoids in asymmetrically dividing cells, however, highlights entropy as the driving force behind chromosome positioning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. While transertion could just be a consequence of co-transcriptional translation in a highly confined space, it was recently shown to be important for the assembly of bacterial secretion systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">While many studies investigated the effect of individual processes on bacterial chromosome organization, there is little work on synergistic effects. In addition, most microscopic work uses diffraction-limited approaches and do not take advantage of the benefit provided by super-resolution microscopy, in particular single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We thus sought to study <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid organization at high resolution during unperturbed growth and drug treatment. We chose rapidly growing cells to investigate the highly complex and structured nucleoid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and to reveal the mechanisms that mediate this organization. SMLM showed a condensed nucleoid positioned close to the inner membrane, which we could verify in live cells. To investigate the nature of this organization, we chemically fixed bacteria at different time points during inhibition of cell wall synthesis, transcription, translation, protein translocation and DNA replication. Perturbation of cell wall synthesis highlighted the membrane-bound state of the nucleoid. Inhibition of transcription or translation, on the other side, resulted in a complete nucleoid detachment from the membrane within the time scale of 2-10 minutes, strongly indicating transertion as the mechanism behind the observed nucleoid anchoring. By reversibly arresting DNA replication, we further observe that nucleoids locate at the cell centre of elongating cells and rapidly repopulate DNA-free areas after release from replication block. This happens faster than cell elongation, highlighting the role of cell geometry and entropy in nucleoid positioning and expansion. Together, our work shows that transertion determines the three-dimensional configuration of the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid during fast growth, while nucleoid positioning is mainly mediated by entropic effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The nucleoid in fast-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> is condensed and tethered to the membrane</title><p id="P6">Previous studies suggested that the nucleoid in fast-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> possesses a helical or twisted configuration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. To investigate this at high spatial resolution, we metabolically labelled DNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells growing at a mass doubling time of 27 min using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We labelled these cells with Alexa-Fluor 647 via click chemistry, which allows for high-resolution 3D single-molecule imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) due to the superior brightness of this fluorophore. 3D imaging revealed a condensed, ring-like nucleoid structure with a clear DNA-free centre in the cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A iii and iv</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). This arrangement was not seen in the 2D projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A i</xref>), highlighting that projection effects in widefield and 2D SMLM images might not reveal the actual organization of the target structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In the 3D image, the nucleoid appears positioned close to the cell membrane, as we have previously shown using STED microscopy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. As recent studies suggest that transertion affects the positioning of genetic loci and nucleoid structuring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we co-imaged the nucleoid with MreB, which is part of an essential, abundant and exclusively membrane-associated multi-protein complex. As copper-catalysed click-labelling destroys fluorescent proteins, we used transiently binding labels and performed dual-color point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) in cells expressing an MreB<sup>sw</sup>-sfGFP protein fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. To increase the resolution, we deconvolved 3D stacks of the MreB fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) and registered the resulting image with the highly-resolved PAINT images. Pseudo-3-color imaging in the same spectral channel (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>) using MreB-sfGFP<sup>sw</sup>, JF<sub>503</sub>-Hoechst and Potomac Gold suggests a moderate degree of spatial correlation between elongasomes and the nucleoid, which is investigated in this study.</p><p id="P7">To exclude fixation artefacts and validate that the membrane-proximal nucleoid arrangement exists <italic>in vivo</italic>, we created <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that express an H-NS-mScarlet-I or HU-α-mScarlet-I protein fusion in the MreB<sup>sw</sup>-sfGFP background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To obtain images of cross-sections, we imaged these strains in vertical orientation using the VerCINI approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. While the nucleoid is positioned at the radial cell centre during slow growth (M9, t<sub>d</sub> ~ 120 min), it locates at the periphery during rapid growth, both at 30°C and 37°C (t<sub>d</sub> ~ 25-30 min). We thus deduced that the highly wound arrangement and membrane-proximal positioning is a feature of the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid during rapid growth. The increased nucleoid complexity at faster growth is in agreement with previous studies, so is the centred positioning of an elongated nucleoid during slow growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We also performed live-cell imaging of these strains using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM), which showed nucleoid dynamics on the second time scale and a stable nucleoid positioning at the cells’ quarter positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Videos 2 and 3</xref>). Global nucleoid positioning hereby coincided with MreB distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inhibition of biosynthetic processes alters nucleoid organization</title><p id="P8">To study the basis for the observed membrane-proximal positioning, we treated exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures with antibiotics that inhibit specific steps in biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). For inhibition of cell wall synthesis, we used MP265 (A22 analogue, inhibits MreB polymerization) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and Mecillinam (PBP2 inhibitor, inhibits peptidoglycan transpeptidation) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Protein biosynthesis was inhibited using high concentrations of rifampicin (transcription inhibition) and chloramphenicol (translation inhibition) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, we perturbed protein translocation (sodium azide) and DNA replication (nalidixate, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitor). Each antibiotic was added to the <italic>E. coli</italic> culture during mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 0.25) and aliquots were chemically fixed at defined time points, labelled for DNA and membranes and imaged by CLSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Over the time course of 60 minutes during unperturbed growth, the nucleoid shows the expected sub-structuring and positioning at quarter positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Both MP265 and Mecillinam treatments induced a rod-to-sphere transition with significant cell rounding occurring after 30 min. Interestingly, inhibition of MreB polymerization with MP265 led to the rapid formation of polar foci or aggregates that were most prominent in the first 2-10 minutes of treatment and successively disappeared with ongoing MP265 exposure. Azide treatment did not show apparent changes in nucleoid morphology, but increasing MreB aggregation at 30-60 min exposure. When we inhibited protein biosynthesis, changes in nucleoid morphology were more dramatic. Both inhibition of transcription (rifampicin) and translation (chloramphenicol) led to an instant contraction of the nucleoid in the first minutes, in line with previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. While nucleoids started to expand after ~10-20 minutes of rifampicin treatment, condensation continued in chloramphenicol-treated cells. Stalling of replisomes by the gyrase inhibitor nalidixate led to nucleoid positioning at the cell centre, while cells continued to grow and formed large, nucleoid-free areas. MreB hereby populated the entire cell cylinder and facilitated elongation also in nucleoid-free regions.</p><p id="P9">To assess global changes induced by the different antibiotics, we developed an image analysis routine that provides heat maps of the nucleoid and MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). For this purpose, we extracted individual cells from CLSM images and processed these images by straightening, alignment, normalization and finally averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, i</xref>). The resulting image represents the average cell for the specific condition (antibiotic treatment and exposure time), which we term ‘population average’ throughout this study.</p><p id="P10">For quantitative analysis, we measure the relative nucleoid length (RNL) in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, ii</xref>). RNL describes the fraction of cell length that is populated by chromosomal DNA. This metric is similar to the relative nucleoid size used by Cabrera and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, yet we prefer RNL in diffraction-limited images due to the 2D projection effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To monitor reorganization of MreB following antibiotic treatment, we quantified its relative distribution at the cell cylinder and cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, iii</xref>).The latter are typically avoided by MreB, likely due to a combination of processive elongasome-driven motion of MreB and spontaneous alignment of curved MreB filaments circumferentially around the cell sidewall <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Population averages of the drug treatments validate the observations made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. Untreated cultures showed two bilobed sister chromosomes, as it is expected under fast-growing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While population averages hide length-dependent effects, the existence of two nucleoids and the global positioning at quarter positions was observed for all length intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Upon inhibition of MP265 and mecillinam treatment, changes in nucleoid positioning and morphology only appeared during rod-to-sphere transition, while apparently, no changes were observed during short drug exposure. To assess global changes in nucleoid organization, we measured the long- and cross-axis profiles in population averages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref> – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8</xref>). Polar recruitment of MreB during MP265 treatment is clearly visible in length-axis plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and was strikingly consistent for both replicates. Concomitant with cell rounding, the bilobed nucleoid distribution diminished for both MP265 and Mecillinam treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Here, cross-axis plots did not reveal strong reorganization along the bacterial short axis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For the inhibition of protein biosynthesis, population averages revealed severe changes in nucleoid morphology. When inhibiting transcription (rifampicin) or translation initiation (chloramphenicol), population averages show an abrupt nucleoid condensation along the bacterial long axis. Nucleoids expand again after 5 min rifampicin exposure, while they continue condensing during chloramphenicol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>). Cross-axis plots further showed that nucleoids also contract along the short axis. This effect is stronger for rifampicin treatment than for chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). Inhibition of protein translocation with sodium azide only induced MreB clustering at long exposure times, while global nucleoid organization was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 and S7</xref>).</p><p id="P12">RNL measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and analysis of MreB intensity distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) confirmed our observations made by visual inspection. In particular, RNL analysis showed a maximal longitudinal nucleoid condensation in rifampicin-treated cells after 5 min, while it plateaued at 30 min in CAM-treated cultures. Other treatments did not show severe changes in RNL. Of note, we did not observe changes in control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>), which showed a constant RNL of 0.64 ± 0.02 (s.d.) throughout the time course of 1 h. The RNL at t = 0 min for all treatments was also reproducible with an average value of 0.65 ± 0.04 (s.d., n = 12). MreB distribution analysis revealed maximal polar localization after 5 min of MP265 treatment, which declined gradually with continuous exposure time as observed previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. This effect was also observed in live cells immobilized under MP265-containing agarose pads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 4</xref>). However, drug treatment dynamics were delayed under agarose pads, likely due to the change in temperature (25°C vs 32°C), lack of agitation, or partial drug inactivation during its addition to warm LB-agar. To exclude artefacts induced by cell density or length, we analysed the MreB distribution in population averages of the control culture and for specific length intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). Both controls showed a constant MreB intensity distribution, with most signals being detected in the cylindrical part of the average cell. Interestingly, inhibition of PG crosslinking using mecillinam also induced a slight reorganization of MreB towards the cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). This indicates that MreB polymerization might be coupled to the action of PBP2. Perturbation of protein synthesis or translocation led to a gradual shift of MreB towards the poles. As MreB localization coincides with nucleoid distribution along the bacterial long axis, we additionally blocked DNA gyrase using nalidixate, which is known to stall DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).

This reduces the effect of 2D projection compared to untreated cells, as the DNA ist distributed within a larger axial range while the observed cross-section remains constant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Positioning of chromosomal DNA close to the membrane thus becomes more evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, MP265 and Mecillinam, 30’ and 60’). In contrast to untreated cells (t = 0 min), the nucleoid also populated the cell poles, indicating that cell geometry affects nucleoid positioning. As observed in confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), treatment with sodium azide did not lead to global nucleoid reorganization. Next to MreB aggregation, nucleoids appeared to be slightly less condensed, which might be attributed to a reduced activity of SMC complexes upon de-energization. Specific inhibition of SecA by sodium azide explains MreB reorganization, as a similar MreB mislocalization was recently observed in SecA-defective cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. PAINT images of rifampicin- and chloramphenicol-treated cells visualized the instant collapse of the nucleoid upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

Interestingly, the loss of nucleoid fine structure also appeared on the minute timescale, suggesting that entropic effects such as depletion attraction and nucleoid occlusion might play a significant role. Super-resolved snapshots of nalidixate-treated cells showed that the mid-cell stalled nucleoid remains associated with the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Release from replication block resulted in structured, strongly elongated nucleoids with membrane-proximal positioning along the entire cell cylinder (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>). To compare the changes in nucleoid organization, we calculated the RID for all treatments and time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>) and extracted the centre of mass of the intensity distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) as well as the distribution width (FWHM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In agreement with CLSM results, rifampicin and chloramphenicol had the strongest effect on nucleoid arrangement with a rapid shift of the DNA distribution towards the radial cell centre and a strong decrease in FWHM within the first 10 minutes. Cell widening upon MP265 and mecillinam exposure led to a shift of DNA signal towards the cell periphery and a narrowing of the radial intensity distribution, both attributed to the reduced effects of 2D projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>/D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Our super-resolved images surprisingly showed qualitative evidence for a moderate association of chromosomal DNA with MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S12-S19</xref>). To test whether the apparent spatial correlation between the nucleoid and MreB is random or specific, we developed a circular cross- correlation approach using intensity traces of two channels measured along the cell perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In the example cell, the intensity profiles (300 nm line width) of MreB and DNA signals overlap to a large extent. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, mid panel). Circular shifting of one intensity trace allows calculating the cross-correlation between the two signals, which we performed for lag distances between - 2 µm and 2 µm. A correlation would result in a peak centred at a lag distance of 0, while this peak would be absent in a random intensity distribution. We simulated the latter by reversing one intensity trace (rv), which should result in a loss of correlation. Indeed, we observe a peak for MreB and DNA signal, but not for the reversed DNA intensity trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, right panel). We further validated our method with simulations, in which we equidistantly positioned adjacent foci along a circle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S22</xref>). Rotation of both foci in 5° increments retains cross-correlation of the two signals, while the correlation averages out in the reversed control. Shift of only one channel resulted in a peak shift in the cross-correlation analysis. We thus assume that this method is suitable for detecting non-random association of two signals, in this case the <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleoid and elongasomes. Applying the method to the super-resolved images, the average circular cross-correlation showed a local maximum at the centre position for untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S22</xref>). This indicates that the observed spatial correlation between the nucleoid and MreB are non-random. Inhibition of protein biosynthesis leads to the loss of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, 60’ rifampicin, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S22</xref>), indicating that protein expression tethers the nucleoid to the inner membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nucleoid compaction depends on active transcription, but not on cell geometry</title><p id="P20">Recent work with wall-less L-forms of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> showed that nucleoid positioning depends on confinement and cell geometry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To test whether this is also the case for nucleoid compaction in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we inhibited protein biosynthesis in cells that had been widened by pre-treatment with MP265 using rifampicin or chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, cell widening reduced the effect of 2D projection, as larger parts of the nucleoid are positioned outside of the projected volume (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). This leads to a shift of the RID centre of mass (CoM) from 0.41 A.U. in untreated cells to 0.53 A.U. in widened cells. Interestingly, inhibition of transcription initiation in pre-widened cells using rifampicin results in a detached nucleoid that maintains visible sub-structuring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This stands in contrast to elongated cells, where transcription inhibition resulted in a relatively unstructured and elongated nucleoid positioned along the bacterial long axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In pre-widened cells, the RID CoM dropped from 0.53 A.U. (MP265 only) to 0.37 A.U. (MP265 + 5 min rifampicin) and 0.39 A.U. (MP265 + 10 min rifampicin), while it dropped to 0.30 A.U. for both 5 and 10 min rifampicin treatment in elongated cells. Inhibition of translation with chloramphenicol resulted in a condensed nucleoid as it is also observed in elongated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, the positioning at the cell centre is much more apparent in widened cells as also shown by the shift of the nucleoid signal towards the cell centre in the RID analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) (CoM = 0.36 A.U. and 0.32 A.U. for 10 and 20 min chloramphenicol, respectively). To determine whether the relative nucleoid size changes with morphology, we segmented super-resolved nucleoids using a neural network that we trained on manually segmented nucleoids (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). The analysis revealed that the relative nucleoid size in treated bacteria is independent of cell geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">This leads to a model in which nucleoid positioning depends on protein biosynthesis and entropic forces, while nucleoid compaction is mainly caused by active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

However, the strong and rapid reorganization observed during inhibition of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) does not support this hypothesis, unless the inhibition leads to a fast reduction in filament rigidity. Another study suggests that a condensed, donut-shaped nucleoid is thermodynamically favourable, but it does not take biosynthetic processes into consideration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Recently, a computational study showed that attractive and repulsive interactions between ribosomes and the nucleoid can cause DNA depletion at the radial cell centre, fitting the observation we made in our experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Our data support a model where protein biosynthesis and likely transertion couples the nucleoid to the inner membrane. This strengthens observations of previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and provides high-resolution data of nucleoid reorganization dynamics. The rapid detachment upon rifampicin and chloramphenicol treatment occurs within the first 10 minutes, a time scale that matches transcription and translation of most genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The gradual detachment observed in early time points might hereby reflect the runoff of active transcription/translation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17 and S18</xref>). The different responses of the two treatments after a rapid contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) is attributed to the condensing force of active transcription and is in agreement with literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Notably, the observed changes in nucleoid positioning are almost binary, showing the entire DNA in membrane-proximity in widened cells and a complete detachment and centre-positioning of the nucleoid upon shutdown of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S21</xref>). mRNA encoding for membrane proteins was shown to position at the inner membrane and a significant fraction of transcription is thought to happen co-translationally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Although mRNA can localize to the membrane independently of translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, transertion remains the most likely explanation for our observations.</p><p id="P25">Surprisingly, we found evidence of colocalization between MreB and the nucleoid. This could be mediated by previously reported interactions of MreB with EF-Tu, RNA polymerase and SecA, all representing potential links between elongasomes and the transertion machinery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. However, our data does not support an essential direct role of MreB in nucleoid anchoring, as MreB depolymerization does not affect nucleoid distribution and chromosomal DNA is not recruited to the cell poles upon MreB aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Instead, we observe a strong effect of cell morphology on nucleoid distribution. Both during MP265 and mecillinam treatment, nucleoid reorganization coincides with rod-to-sphere transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In widened cells, chromosomal DNA is also found at polar membranes, a phenomenon that is typically not observed in rod-shaped cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicates that confinement and/or cell curvature are involved in nucleoid positioning to the quarter positions. While cell widening did not change the relative nucleoid size both during unperturbed and perturbed protein biosynthesis, it had an influence on the expansion of detached nucleoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Cells treated with MP265 and rifampicin showed nucleoid sub-structuring that is not visible in rod-shaped cells, in which the nucleoid shows a sausage-like arrangement along the bacterial long axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We attribute this observation to changes in confinement along the cells’ short axis as was recently observed in L-form bacteria confined in channels of various sizes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Increased mixing of ribosomes and the nucleoid in a larger space might also promote nucleoid expansion, but this remains to be tested by correlative imaging of ribosomes and DNA and/or single-particle tracking. A more expanded nucleoid was also observed in larger <italic>Xenorhabdus doucetiae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that cellular dimensions and thus confinement affects nucleoid organization.</p><p id="P26">We further observed that replication arrest by nalidixate resulted in a mid-cell-positioned nucleoid that still showed membrane-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>).

The dynamics hereby exceeded the speed of cell elongation, thus suggesting entropic forces as the main cause of nucleoid expansion.

The dramatic reorganization of the nucleoid upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis, occurring within minutes, strongly implicates active transertion in maintaining this expanded, membrane-tethered state. While our data cannot conclusively demonstrate a direct role for transertion in shaping nucleoid morphology, it provides compelling evidence for transertion as a key organizing principle. By tracking the rapid response of the nucleoid to potential disruption of transertion, we have captured valuable insights into the dynamics of this process. Going forward, correlative imaging of the transertion machinery components and the nucleoid will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Beyond elucidating the role of transertion, our work establishes analytical tools to quantitatively assess nucleoid organization relative to cellular landmarks like the membrane and proteins. The automated image analysis routines we developed, including population averaging, RID analysis and circular cross-correlation, can provide versatile new approaches for investigating spatiotemporal organization in bacteria.

Schematic of the generation of population average images (i): Bacterial cells are detected in confocal images, rotated, straightened and aligned. After normalization by cell length and width, cells are averaged for each time point, generating a population average image (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>). NR = Nile red. DNA distribution along the bacterial long axis was determined on the single cell-level by measuring the nucleoid length relative to the cell length (ii). (iii) Quantification of MreB distribution: Polar (yellow) and cylindrical sections (white) were segmented in population average images and the relative MreB intensity was calculated. [B] Population average images of selected time points. Cell outlines (white lines) were obtained from membrane average images.

[F] Determination of the average nucleoid width using population average intensity distributions. Shown are exemplary cross-axis plots without treatment (left) and 10 min rifampicin treatment (middle). The full-width at half maximum (FWHM, blue arrows) was determined by integrating the intensity distribution. FWHM over treatment time differ for antibiotic treatments (right). Error bars in [B] and [E] (left plot) represent the standard deviation and in [D] and [E] (right plot) the standard error of the mean. Control and azide treatment experiments were only performed once. Shaded areas in [F] represent standard deviations (left and middle plot: pixel-wise standard deviation of population average images; right plot: standard deviation of two replicates).
