For example, in glioblastoma (GBM) quiescent glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) play an important role in re-establishing the tumour, leading to relapse. While most studies have focused on identifying differentially expressed genes between proliferative and quiescent cells as potential drivers of this transition, recent studies have shown the importance of protein oscillations in controlling the exit from quiescence of neural stem cells. Here, we have undertaken a genome-wide bioinformatic inference approach to identify genes whose expression oscillates and which may be good candidates for controlling the transition to and from the quiescent cell state in GBM. Our analysis identified, among others, a list of important transcription regulators as potential oscillators, including the stemness gene <italic>SOX2</italic>, which we verified to oscillate in quiescent GSCs. These findings expand on the way we think about gene regulation and introduce new candidate genes as key regulators of quiescence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Quiescence is a state of cell-cycle arrest which, unlike senescence or terminal differentiation, is reversible upon receiving appropriate signals from the environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Quiescence is thought to be a property commonly found in stem cells and it is important for homeostasis and regeneration by maintaining a pool of cells from which new cells can be produced, upon exit from quiescence, to replenish cells depleted through ageing or injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Quiescence is also important in a cancer context; here, it is thought that transition of cancer stem cells to a quiescent state creates a population with the potential to enter the cell cycle at a later time point, thus, contributing to reactivation of a tumour and clinical relapse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The magnitude of this problem is underscored by recent studies suggesting that cancer treatment may push some surviving cancer cells into quiescence from where they can be reactivated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Reactivation from quiescence may be problematic for any cancer, but it may be particularly an issue for cancers with a high rate of relapse such as glioblastoma. Glioblastoma, also historically referred to as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common and most deadly adult primary brain cancer, comprising more than half of all gliomas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Despite decades of dedicated research and numerous clinical trials collectively covering a range of often innovative treatment modalities, tragically, there remains no cure and relapse is often inevitable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, there is a great need for innovative scientific approaches to better understand the basic biology of this cancer and in particular, to understand the mechanisms by which cells enter and exit quiescence.</p><p id="P4">Efforts to identify molecular drivers of quiescence often focus on differential gene expression between normally dividing cells and their dormant counterparts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, even with state-of-the-art molecular methods, such differential gene expression, that is causally related to the acquisition of the quiescent state, has proved elusive to define. Thus, some recent studies have focused on epigenetic changes. Indeed, it was shown that in GBMs there is a failure to lock cells into a differentiated state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, creating a state of increased plasticity whereby cells can transition into undesirable states.</p><p id="P5">In our own recent work, we have provided evidence for a dynamic conceptual framework of controlling the transition to and from quiescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Working with normal, i.e. non-cancerous neural stem cells, we have discovered that protein expression oscillations of the mammalian Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) transcription factor (TF), are needed for cells to be able to exit the quiescent state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Such oscillations have a periodicity, which is typically shorter than the well-known circadian periodicity, and are increasingly recognised as playing an important role in cell-state transitions in normal development, in a number of different models and contexts e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">There is emerging evidence that oscillations are also important in a cancer context. Specifically, HES1 has been shown to oscillate in a breast cancer model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and so have p53 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and p21 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In breast cancer cells, HES1 oscillations are important for efficient proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, while p53 oscillations determine the response to radiotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These findings present a new way of understanding cell-state transitions, based on dynamic gene expression that includes entry to and exit from quiescence. But how common are oscillations and which genes are likely to oscillate? Our previous work has shown that the network motif that commonly underlies oscillatory gene expression (autoregulation and microRNA interaction) is very widespread among mammalian TFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, because the presence of oscillations is context specific, we argued that a more direct approach was needed for GBM.</p><p id="P7">Thus, to answer this question, we leveraged two recent developments. First, we took advantage of a recently developed bioinformatic pipeline, which is designed to uncover oscillatory gene expression in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, irrespective of their periodicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This pipeline was developed by Leng et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and optimised by us <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> to improve on the statistical robustness and sensitivity of the method. Second, we took advantage of the availability of a plethora of scRNA-seq data from different human GBM tumours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">By applying this bioinformatic methodology we uncovered up to 3K genes with the potential to oscillate in GBM. We also found that oscillators that are shared across GBM tumours associate with processes that contribute to cancer pathogenesis, highlighting a potential functional role. To validate our findings, we created an endogenous reporter knock-in GBM line for <italic>SOX2</italic> and we optimised a GBM quiescence protocol. We report that <italic>SOX2</italic> oscillates in both proliferative and quiescent stem cells, with a period of 17h.</p><p id="P9">Our findings provide a global view of oscillatory gene expression in GBM, which shows that it is more common than previously appreciated. They also uncover a previously unknown level of <italic>SOX2</italic> regulation, which may be important for regulating the transition to quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Inference of oscillatory gene expression in GBM tumours</title><p id="P10">To identify putative oscillators in GBM we interrogated publicly available scRNA-seq data from the Neftel et al. 2019 study, an in-depth transcriptomic study of GBM tumours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Five tumours (MGH124, MGH125, MGH102, MGH143, MGH115), representing the most common subtypes of GBM tumours in patients, were selected for inference analysis of oscillators. The tumours correspond to neural-progenitor-like (NPC-like) (MGH124, MGH125, MGH102), astrocyte-like (AC-like) (MGH143) and a mixture of astrocyte-like (AC-like) and mesenchymal-like (MES-like) (MGH115) subtypes according to the classification described in Neftel et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To specifically identify important oscillators for tumour formation and progression, we sought first to determine the neoplastic (tumour cell) compartment of each tumour by using the “Label Transfer” method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). “Label Transfer” is a reference-based integrative analysis approach used to transfer previously identified cell identities onto a query dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In our case, we treated the scRNA-seq data from the 5 tumours as the query dataset and used as a reference dataset the cell identities of neoplastic and non-neoplastic (immune, oligodendrocyte precursors cell (OPC), vascular, neuronal, oligodendrocyte and astrocyte) cells in GBM, as previously described in Darmanis et al., 2017 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, to separate the groups of cells with tumour-cell characteristics from their more differentiated or immune infiltrating counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Oscillatory genes are expected to have variable levels between cells thus, we wanted to ensure that we minimise false positive results due to variability in gene expression originating from the mixing of different cell types or states within each neoplastic population. Therefore, additional clustering was performed to identify more homogeneous neoplastic subclusters based on differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These subclusters revealed appreciable differences in terms of their enrichment for the Human Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) Hallmark gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To infer oscillatory gene expression in the neoplastic populations we used the OscoNet computational algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, an optimised version of a previously described gene oscillatory inference pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. OscoNet capitalises on the fact that within an unsynchronised but homogeneous population, genes which are dynamically expressed are expected to have variable levels that follow a sinusoidal process. To distinguish from noisy expression, and acknowledging that the expression values of genes oscillating with similar frequencies would form an ellipse on a scatter plot (independently of cell order), the algorithm searches for pairs of genes whose expression best fits a two-dimensional sinusoidal function, to uncover genes that oscillate with similar frequencies but possibly different phases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">OscoNet was applied in each of the neoplastic subclusters separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), using the following two filtering criteria. First, for a gene to be considered for OscoNet analysis it had to be expressed in at least 80% of the cells within each subcluster (zero-filtering criterion), as an in-silico exploration determined that the presence of zero expression values affects negatively the performance of the algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Second, genes that had passed the zero-filtering were further filtered based on gene expression variance (variance-filtering criterion), such that only genes whose expression variance was higher than the mean variance of all genes were chosen as an input for the OscoNet pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our analysis revealed that out of all genes that are expressed across each subcluster in ≥ 80% of cells (average of 930 genes), approximately 45% them were found to be highly variable (average of 418 genes) with the majority (87%) of these subsequently inferred to be oscillators (average of 361 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Considering that only a handful of genes in the literature have been shown to oscillate to date, this in-silico study suggests that a considerably large number of genes, at least in the setting of GBM, oscillate.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OscoNet identifies potential oscillators in GBM</title><p id="P14">The OscoNet inference pipeline identified 361 genes on average to oscillate per neoplastic subcluster per GBM tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), whereas all inferred oscillators across all neoplastic subclusters in all tumours were found to be 3422 (named “All Oscillators”) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Amongst these, there were known genes that have been previously shown to exhibit oscillatory expression at an ultradian scale (i.e. oscillate with a period less than 24h) and be important for normal neural development. Such genes were HES1, HES4, HES6, Ascl1 and Olig2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, we found that cell cycle regulators (GO_0007049, selected those expressed in ≥ 80% of cells in at least one neoplastic subcluster) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), whose expression may oscillate during the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, were significantly enriched in our predicted list of oscillators across all tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These findings suggest that the OscoNet pipeline can successfully identify known oscillators.</p><p id="P15">To independently verify our predictions, we cross-referenced our findings with that of an alternative bioinformatic screen for genes capable of dynamic gene expression, including oscillations. We have previously found that transcription regulators with the potential to autoregulate (i.e. bind to their own promoter) and which are involved in dual feedback interactions with a miRNA are very common in mammalian TFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In particular, in humans, we identified 582 TFs to potentially autoregulate and be in a feedback loop with a miRNA (we call this a “dynamic gene network motif”) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Thus, we sought to identify if any of these genes have been predicted to oscillate by OscoNet in GBM.</p><p id="P16">We focused on comparing genes with TF activity as the information about genes involved in dynamic gene networks is available only for transcription regulators. We hypothesised that TFs that were inferred to oscillate in GBM were more likely to be involved in such a network as opposed to “Non-oscillators”. In this case, “Non-oscillators” were defined as genes that were expressed in at least one tumour (i.e. passed zero-filtering) but had not been found to oscillate in any of the tumours (643 genes) (named “Non-oscillators”) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). We also hypothesised, that TFs involved in dynamic gene networks would be more prevalent amongst inferred oscillatory TFs that were shared across the 5 tumours, as they were always predicted to oscillate. For the latter, we intersected the oscillators from all neoplastic subclusters per tumour and found a total of 117 oscillatory genes in common (named “Shared oscillators”) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We then selected only the TFs from each of “All oscillators” (3422), “Shared oscillators” (117) and “Non-oscillators” (643) lists by cross-referencing them against the list of all human TFs as described by Lambert et al., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). From these TFs we further selected only those for which it was feasible to assess their involvement in a dynamic gene network motif (i.e. availability of information on autoregulation) and compared them against all TFs that belonged in a dynamic gene network motif (582 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Importantly, we found that all TFs in the “Shared oscillators” (100%) were involved in network motifs predicted to oscillate as opposed to 64.8% and 50% in the lists of “All oscillators” and “Non-oscillators” respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These findings lend further support to our method for identifying putative oscillators and suggest that genes predicted to oscillate in every GBM tumour are potentially the highest confidence candidate genes to have dynamic behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Oscillatory genes in GBM tumours associate with processes that contribute to cancer pathogenesis</title><p id="P17">Next, we aimed to gain some insights into the type of genes we have identified that may oscillate in the GBM tumours. As previously mentioned, we considered the “Shared oscillators” to be high confidence oscillators and potentially functionally important. Gene ontology analysis on the “Shared oscillators” revealed that the most enriched molecular and cellular functions were related to cell proliferation and development, cell death and survival, and cell movement, which align with the cancerous profile of the neoplastic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). On the contrary, the “Non-oscillators” had lower enrichment scores overall and associated mainly with processes such as protein/molecule trafficking, cell function and maintenance and cellular assembly and organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Accordingly, the top enriched canonical pathways in the “Shared oscillators” associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, all known to associate with cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), whereas “Non-oscillators” enriched for core cell processes such as translation and rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">“Shared oscillators” were also enriched for Hallmark gene sets that are included in MSigDB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Amongst the most enriched were gene sets that associate with apoptosis, hypoxia and the reactive oxygen species pathway, which all constitute hallmark pathways of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Conversely, “Non-oscillators” did not enrich for any of the Hallmark gene sets. These findings consistently reveal that oscillators appear enriched in known gene pathways and processes that contribute to cancer pathogenicity whereas “Non-oscillators” tend to associate with more house-keeping processes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Oscillatory genes in quiescent/low-cycling GBM tumour cells</title><p id="P20">Considering that the inevitable tumour relapse is one of the main reasons GBM is practically an incurable disease, we next sought to identify oscillators that are potentially important for driving this process. Recent evidence suggest that the main cause of relapse is the activation of quiescent GBM stem cells (GSCs) that are left behind after surgery, are refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are able to re-initiate tumour formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To this end, we decided to look at oscillators that specifically overlap with a quiescent gene signature or are expressed in the quiescent/low cell-cycling population of the neoplastic cells.</p><p id="P21">To address this, we interrogated the list of “Shared oscillators” (which we found to be our highest confidence candidates) and particularly the TFs in this list as we argued that an oscillator is more likely to drive cell-state transitions (e.g. exit from quiescence) if they control the expression of downstream genes. We therefore intersected the inferred oscillatory TFs that are shared across the tumours, with a list of GBM neoplastic cell-specific Neural G0 marker genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The latter had been previously derived by applying a cell-cycle classifier to identify a putative quiescent-like state in gliomas along with the pathways that associate with it <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The overlap of all these lists provided us with a short list of 6 genes (<italic>SOX2, JUNB, FOS, NFIB, TCF4, TSC22D1</italic>) which are predicted to oscillate, regulate transcription and associate with a quiescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">As an independent way to identify oscillators that potentially control the quiescent state of GBM, we looked at oscillators that were specifically expressed in the low-cell cycling neoplastic subclusters of these tumours, defined as those enriched for Hallmark gene sets associated with the downregulation of cell cycle genes. This analysis identified a list of 99 oscillators shared across the low-cycling neoplastic subclusters in the 5 tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table S9</xref>) out of which only 6 were found to be putative TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, 4 out those 6 genes (<italic>SOX2, JUNB, FOS, TSC22D1</italic>) were also identified by our previous analysis on the Neural G0 signature-associated oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) revealing a core of 4 TFs that oscillate and are potentially important for regulating the quiescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Establishing an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to study oscillatory gene expression in quiescence</title><p id="P23">Having identified a core list of candidate oscillators in low-cycling neoplastic cells, our next objective was to establish a GBM <italic>in vitro</italic> system to verify protein expression oscillations in a quiescent state. Our oscillator inference analysis was based on 5 tumours represented primarily by the NPC-like and MES-like subtypes (proneural and mesenchymal subtype respectively according to Verhaak classification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>), with the majority belonging to the NPC-like subtype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore chose the previously characterised GBM1 patient-derived GSC line as our experimental model, which was found to primarily enrich for a proneural transcriptional signature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Next, we used the GBM1 cells to induce a quiescent state <italic>in vitro</italic> by replacing the EGF and FGF mitogens in the culture with BMP4. Previous studies have shown that GSCs undergo cell-cycle arrest in response to BMP4, and although they exhibit astrocyte differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> they subsequently fail to permanently exit the cell cycle and remain susceptible to re-entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, live image-based confluency analysis of GBM1 cells over a period of 14 days showed that cells amplify over time in the presence of mitogens but they stop within 48h of BMP4 administration and remain cytostatic for as long as they are treated with BMP4 (up to 7 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Importantly, upon withdrawal of BMP4 and re-introduction of FGF and EGF mitogens in the culture, GBM1 cells were able to re-enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results suggest that administration and subsequent removal of BMP4 facilitates a reversible cell-cycle arrest suggesting that addition of BMP4 induces a quiescent state. Immunostaining of the cells for the Ki67 proliferation marker in proliferative, quiescent and re-activation conditions confirmed the loss of Ki67 in the presence of BMP4 and re-expression of the marker following re-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>).

A large number of studies in the literature have highlighted the important role of <italic>SOX2</italic> in promoting GBM malignancy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and the association of high SOX2 levels with tumour aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We therefore chose <italic>SOX2</italic> as our prime candidate to verify whether its protein expression oscillates in GSCs. To assess this we generated a <italic>SOX2-mKate2</italic> fusion knock-in line, using CRISPR/Cas9, to mark the endogenous SOX2 expression in GBM1 cells. In particular, we inserted a linker, followed by the mKate2 fluorophore and a P2A-Neomycin cassette, at the C-terminus of the SOX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). This direct fusion enabled us to follow the kinetics of the endogenous SOX2 protein while maintaining the SOX2 protein intact.

Tracking of the SOX2-mKate2 protein expression in single cells for approximately 50-70 hrs, revealed that SOX2 is dynamically expressed, showing peaks and troughs in intensity over time in single nuclei, where SOX2 is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). As a negative control, we tracked expression of the GFP fluorophore driven by the UbC promoter in the same cells, which had been previously transduced in the GBM1 cell line. Conversely to SOX2-mKate2, GFP expression showed no apparent or regular dynamicity, with GFP intensity forming a flat line over time denoting steady expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). To determine whether the SOX2-mKate2 protein expression oscillates, we performed periodicity analysis on multiple single cell intensity tracks using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).

In this paper, we have used a tailored bioinformatic pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> to identify genes that are expressed in an oscillatory manner in human GBM tumour samples. Based on our previous work, we have reasoned that such dynamically expressed genes are likely to be important for the transition of cells between states, such as a proliferative and a quiescent state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.

Time-series scRNA-seq or pseudotime inference methods fail to detect ultradian oscillations, which unlike circadian oscillations, tend to be out of phase between cells and therefore are very difficult to distinguish from expression noise. To get around this limitation, the approach that we used is based on pairwise gene comparisons, which looks at the co-expression relationship within each cell and across all cells and how well that fits a sinusoidal process, irrespective of real time information and accounting for a phase shift <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, two caveats remain: First, the absence of real time information precludes any direct estimation of periodicity. Second, our method detects potential oscillations at the mRNA level, which would be translated to protein expression oscillations only in appropriate production/degradation parameters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Indeed, in some cases mRNA oscillations were translated in a stepwise accumulation of the protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Therefore, further experimental validation of the potential oscillations is needed, ideally by tagging the endogenous protein, as we have done for the case of <italic>SOX2</italic> here.</p><p id="P30">In this work, several steps have been taken to increase confidence in detecting potential oscillations. First, we verified that the inference pipeline can detect known oscillators such as HES1, Olig2 and ASCL1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and cell cycle genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Second, we chose genes that were consistently predicted to oscillate in each of the 5 tumour samples analysed (“Shared oscillators”) thus, less likely to be false positives. Third, we found that all shared oscillatory TFs (100%) were involved in gene network motifs capable of driving dynamic expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Collectively these steps suggested that genes that were predicted to oscillate in our pipeline were high confidence candidates.</p><p id="P31">Our analysis predicted that approximately ~3K genes (excluding cell cycle regulators) are likely to oscillate at the transcriptional (mRNA) level across all the tumours. Given that the number of genes previously shown to oscillate at the protein level across biological contexts is in the tens for the ultradian scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and in the hundreds for the circadian scale (GO_0007623), rather than the thousands, this is a significant increase, suggesting that oscillations are a more widespread form of gene regulation that one might anticipate.</p><p id="P32">Interestingly, the “Shared oscillators” were enriched for functions that contribute to cancer pathogenesis, as opposed to “Non-oscillators”, which associated primarily with cell maintenance processes. In that regard, we hypothesise that oscillations are likely to enable cancer cells to develop adaptative strategies to survive and grow. Such examples we find in bacteria where studies have shown that microbial cells are known to use pulsatile expression to create a range of phenotypes that help them adapt a bet-hedging strategy to respond to environmental changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, our inference analysis can potentially help us identify key regulators that control cell-state transitions.</p><p id="P33">In GBM, quiescent GSCs have been found to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and responsible for re-initiating tumour growth following treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We have therefore looked specifically for oscillators that may control the quiescent state and identified a core list of 4 genes. From those, we selected the <italic>SOX2</italic> gene for further experimental validation. <italic>SOX2</italic> is well known for its role in maintaining pluripotency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

In addition, it was found that chromatin regions enriched for SOX binding motifs fail to reconfigure in response to BMP4, suggesting that the levels and/or activity of SOX proteins may impede the exit from self-renewal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">By generating an endogenous knock-in reporter we have found that <italic>SOX2</italic> oscillations are detected at the protein level in both proliferative and quiescent GBMs with a periodicity of 17hrs. This is a novel aspect of SOX2 expression that provides new insights into the way it may regulate downstream targets, whereby not just the presence or absence of SOX2 protein, but also its pattern of expression may dictate diverse cell-fate decisions.</p><p id="P35">Our findings are significant because dynamic gene expression in general, and ultradian oscillations in particular, have been linked to the ability of the cell to make cell-state transitions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. SOX2 protein oscillations in GBM quiescent cells are indeed reminiscent of HES1 oscillations in quiescent neural stem cells.

It remains to be seen whether inhibiting SOX2 oscillations, but not affecting its overall expression, will prevent exit from quiescence of GBM cells. Locking cells in quiescence is an important therapeutic avenue to explore in addition to tumour resection and chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Alternative therapy strategies, such as promoting BMP4-induced tumour differentiation have been proven challenging with several barriers to implementation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, as tumour cells fail to commit to differentiation and are susceptible to de-differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.
