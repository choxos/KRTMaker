During SR activation in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, SpoT synthesizes the secondary messengers (p)ppGpp, which affect transcription by binding RNA polymerase to downregulate anabolic genes. (p)ppGpp also impacts expression of anabolic genes by controlling the levels and activities of their transcriptional regulators. In <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, a major regulator of anabolic genes is the transcription factor CdnL. If and how CdnL is controlled during the SR and why that might be functionally important is unclear. Here, we show that CdnL is downregulated post-translationally during starvation in a manner dependent on SpoT and the ClpXP protease. Inappropriate stabilization of CdnL during starvation causes misregulation of ribosomal and metabolic genes. Functionally, we demonstrate that the combined action of SR transcriptional regulators and CdnL clearance allows for rapid adaptation to nutrient repletion. Moreover, cells that are unable to clear CdnL during starvation are outcompeted by wild-type cells when subjected to nutrient fluctuations. We hypothesize that clearance of CdnL during the SR, in conjunction with direct binding of (p)ppGpp and DksA to RNAP, is critical for altering the transcriptome in order to permit cell survival during nutrient stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CarD</kwd><kwd>CdnL</kwd><kwd>stringent response</kwd><kwd>proteolysis</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacterial replication requires available nutrients and transcription of anabolic genes. When nutrients become limiting, cells adapt to their environment by activating the broadly conserved bacterial stress response pathway known as the stringent response (SR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). During the SR, stressors such as nutrient limitation and/or heat shock are sensed by Rel/Spo homolog (RSH) proteins, which synthesize and/or hydrolyze the second messengers guanosine 5’-diphosphate 3’-diphosphate and guanosine 5’-triphosphate 3’-diphosphate (collectively known as (p)ppGpp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). (p)ppGpp broadly impacts DNA replication, transcription, translation, and metabolism by directly or indirectly interacting with various proteins to halt growth until conditions improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (hereafter <italic>Caulobacter</italic>) is a Gram-negative freshwater α-proteobacterium with a dimorphic life cycle that allows it to exist as a nutrient-seeking swarmer cell or as a reproductive stalked cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Nutrient limitation and (p)ppGpp accumulation slow the swarmer-to-stalked transition, likely to allow the swarmer cell more time to seek out nutrients before differentiating into a stalked cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). This transition is governed by regulatory proteins, whose levels and activities are impacted by (p)ppGpp upon SR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The availability of nutrients thus regulates the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell cycle, promoting anabolic processes and cell cycle progression in nutrient-rich environments, while favoring catabolic processes and nutrient-seeking behavior when nutrients are lacking.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Caulobacter</italic> inhabits oligotrophic environments and is regularly exposed to fluctuations in nutrient availability; therefore, cells must balance anabolism with SR activation by readily responding to nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, nutrient limitation is sensed by a single bifunctional RSH protein that is known as SpoT, which synthesizes (p)ppGpp during nutrient stress to initiate the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Ultimately, (p)ppGpp accumulation causes downregulation of genes required for translation, growth, and division, and upregulation of genes important for responding to stress, thus impacting the activities of proteins involved in both anabolism and SR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A major way in which (p)ppGpp exerts these effects on gene regulation is by binding directly to two sites on RNA polymerase (RNAP). These are referred to as “site 1” and “site 2” in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and both sites are conserved in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Site 2 is formed at the interface between RNAP and the transcription factor DksA, and the binding of (p)ppGpp to this site specifically has been implicated in enhancing the influence of DksA on RNAP and leading to inhibition of rRNA promoter activity and decreased anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P5">(p)ppGpp can also cause a downregulation of anabolic gene transcription by controlling the levels and activities of other transcriptional regulators. In <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, a major regulator of anabolic gene transcription and cell cycle progression is the broadly conserved transcription factor CdnL, which stands for “CarD N-terminal like” as it shares homology with the N-terminal domain of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> transcription factor, CarD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Under nutrient-rich conditions, CdnL directly binds to RNAP and promotes transcription of housekeeping genes and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> CdnL homolog CarD was shown to be an activator of rRNA genes whose levels are positively correlated with mycobacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We have previously shown that loss of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> CdnL (Δ<italic>cdnL</italic>) results in slowed growth and altered morphology, as well as downregulation of anabolic genes, such as those involved in macromolecule biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These data are further supported by metabolomic analyses showing altered metabolite levels in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The physiological changes observed in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells mirror many of those of cells undergoing stringent response activation. Indeed, mycobacterial CarD was recently found to be downregulated during stress conditions, though a link to the SR was not examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). These putative connections made us consider if CdnL is regulated in a similar manner during the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> SR. Here, we demonstrate that CdnL is regulated post-translationally during the SR, and that this regulation promotes effective adaptation to changes in nutrient availability by altering anabolic gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CdnL is cleared during the stringent response in a SpoT-dependent manner</title><p id="P7">Our prior work indicated that many anabolic genes are regulated in a CdnL-dependent manner, apparently echoing transcriptional changes that occur during the SR. This prompted us to review transcriptomic data from our lab and others to explore a potential relationship between CdnL and the SR. In comparing Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells to wild-type (WT) starved cells, we find 213 genes downregulated during carbon starvation are also downregulated in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic>, which is a significant enrichment as determined by hypergeometric probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). This enrichment is, at least in part, SpoT-dependent, as 130 genes that are downregulated in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells are downregulated during carbon starvation in a SpoT-dependent manner, which is also statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). These overlaps suggest a link between activation of the SR by SpoT and the absence of CdnL.</p><p id="P8">To investigate a potential connection between SR activation and loss of CdnL, we assessed CdnL protein levels during nitrogen, carbon, and phosphate starvation. Both carbon and nitrogen limitation activate the SR in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, while phosphate limitation does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). To do this, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells were grown in minimal media, then washed and incubated in media lacking a carbon, nitrogen, or phosphate source. Cell lysates were sampled at up to 90 minutes of starvation and CdnL levels were assessed by immunoblotting. We found that CdnL was cleared in WT cells under both nitrogen and carbon starvation with half-lives of 18 and 15 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). Notably, CdnL levels remained stable under phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The fact that CdnL is cleared upon carbon and nitrogen starvation, but not phosphate starvation, is consistent with CdnL regulation being downstream of SR activation. Therefore, we asked if CdnL clearance depended on the only RSH enzyme in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, SpoT, by repeating these starvation experiments in cells lacking SpoT (Δ<italic>spoT)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). During nitrogen and carbon starvation, CdnL levels were significantly more stable in the Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background than in WT, with the half-lives increasing to 60 min and over 500 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S1A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). CdnL was also stabilized during carbon starvation in the presence of a (p)ppGpp synthetase-dead SpoT variant (SpoTY323A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These observations indicate that both SpoT and (p)ppGpp are necessary for CdnL clearance during starvation.</p><p id="P10">We next tested if (p)ppGpp is sufficient for CdnL clearance using a strain harboring a xylose-inducible, constitutively active version of the <italic>E. coli</italic> (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA (RelA’) or a catalytically inactive RelA variant (RelA’-dead) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We found that CdnL was cleared under nutrient-replete conditions upon expression of RelA’ with a half-life of 103 min, while CdnL is stable in the presence of RelA’-dead, indicating that (p)ppGpp is sufficient to clear CdnL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CdnL is cleared during conditions that activate the SR, and that (p)ppGpp is both necessary and sufficient to induce clearance. For simplicity, we chose to use carbon starvation to probe the mechanism and importance of CdnL clearance during stringent activation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptional control of <italic>cdnL</italic> is not sufficient to regulate CdnL levels during the SR</title><p id="P11">We observed that CdnL protein levels decrease upon carbon starvation, but it was unclear if regulation of CdnL levels during starvation occurs transcriptionally, post-transcriptionally, and/or post-translationally. Indeed, previous studies showed that <italic>cdnL</italic> transcript levels also decrease upon carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We first asked if transcriptional activity at the <italic>cdnL</italic> promoter contributes significantly to controlling CdnL levels during the SR. To do this, we expressed <italic>cdnL</italic> from a xylose-inducible promoter in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic>, Δ<italic>spoT</italic>Δ<italic>cdnL</italic>, and SpoTY323A Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> backgrounds. In this system, we can shut off <italic>cdnL</italic> transcription independently of SR activation or (p)ppGpp production by washing out xylose and resuspending cells in nutrient-replete media lacking xylose (M2G), or in carbon starvation media lacking both xylose and glucose (M2). Under carbon starvation conditions and after the removal of xylose to prevent further <italic>cdnL</italic> transcription, CdnL was rapidly cleared in Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells with a half-life of 13 min. In contrast, for Δ<italic>spoT</italic>Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> and SpoTY323A Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> cells, CdnL levels remained stable with half-lives of 139 and 334 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). This suggests that transcriptional control is not sufficient for CdnL clearance. There appear to be additional factors governing CdnL stability during the SR, however. While CdnL was cleared more rapidly in starvation conditions compared to nutrient-replete conditions in a Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> background after the removal of xylose (13 min compared to 27 min), we found that in the Δ<italic>spoT</italic>Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> and SpoTY323A Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> backgrounds, CdnL was actually cleared more rapidly in nutrient-replete conditions compared to starvation conditions after the removal of xylose (70 and 75 min compared to 139 and 334 min, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S2A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). These data imply that CdnL levels are regulated post-transcriptionally in a manner that is partially SpoT-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CdnL is a ClpXP target</title><p id="P12">Since transcriptional regulation is not sufficient to control CdnL levels during the SR, we next asked if CdnL is regulated post-translationally. CdnL bears two alanine residues on the C-terminus, which is a common degradation signal (degron) recognized by the ClpXP protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). It was previously shown that the CdnL C-terminus was important for ClpXP-mediated degradation of CdnL <italic>in vivo</italic>, which caused us to wonder how this might relate to regulation of CdnL during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We asked if eliminating this putative degron impacts CdnL levels during starvation by changing the two alanine residues to aspartate residues, thus creating the variant CdnLDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We found that CdnLDD protein was not cleared during either nitrogen or carbon starvation, suggesting that ClpXP targets CdnL for degradation during the SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S1A,C</xref>). We asked if CdnL is a direct proteolytic target of ClpXP <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that purified ClpXP was capable of degrading purified CdnL, but not purified CdnLDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The ability of ClpXP to degrade CdnL <italic>in vitro</italic> is not affected by (p)ppGpp, as the addition of (p)ppGpp did not further stimulate CdnL turnover. Finally, we assessed if ClpX activity was required <italic>in vivo</italic> for CdnL clearance during carbon starvation using a dominant-negative ATPase-dead ClpX variant (ClpX*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). When cells were starved of carbon after a 1-hour induction of ClpX*, CdnL levels were once again stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). These data confirm that CdnL is a ClpXP target as well as demonstrate that ClpXP-mediated proteolysis is required for regulation of CdnL during carbon starvation.</p><p id="P13">It is evident that the CdnL C-terminus is critical for the regulation of CdnL by ClpXP. To assess if the CdnL C-terminus is sufficient for ClpXP-mediated degradation during starvation, we tagged GFP with the last 15 amino acids from the CdnL tail (GFP-AA) or with the last 15 amino acids from the stabilized CdnL tail (GFP-DD). We then expressed these constructs on a plasmid under control of the <italic>ruv</italic> operon promoter, as transcript levels for the <italic>ruvA</italic> DNA helicase gene are not affected during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Strikingly, GFP-AA was rapidly degraded during carbon starvation while GFP-DD remained stable, demonstrating that the CdnL tail is indeed sufficient for degradation of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). We next sought to test if there is a SpoT-dependence to this degradation. To do this, we put the GFP-AA construct into the Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background and repeated the carbon starvation. GFP-AA was degraded more slowly in a Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background than in WT, with a half-life of 68 min in comparison to the 14 min half-life in the WT background, indicating that there is at least a partial SpoT-dependence to ClpXP-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The CdnL-RNAP interaction is not sufficient to protect CdnL from proteolysis</title><p id="P14">There appear to be other factors governing CdnL stability outside of the C-terminus since we found that GFP-AA was cleared, albeit slowly, in Δ<italic>spoT</italic> cells, while CdnL itself remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). Since CdnL interacts with RNAP while GFP does not, we hypothesized that the interaction with RNAP may reduce CdnL degradation, possibly by protecting CdnL from proteolysis by ClpXP. To assess this, we constructed two CdnL point mutants, V39A and P54A, that have a reduced affinity for RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We then assessed their stabilities during carbon starvation. Both the V39A and P54A mutants exhibited reduced half-lives (15 and 18 min, respectively) compared to WT CdnL (32 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>). These observations are consistent with the interaction between CdnL and RNAP contributing to CdnL stability under carbon starvation conditions. To test the sufficiency of this interaction in determining CdnL stability, we put the V39A and P54A point mutants into a Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background and performed another carbon starvation. If the CdnL-RNAP interaction serves as a barrier to CdnL proteolysis by ClpXP, we expected that these point mutants with a reduced RNAP interaction may still be less stable than WT CdnL in a Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background. However, we found that the point mutants are equally as stable as WT CdnL in the Δ<italic>spoT</italic> background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S3C,D</xref>). These results indicate that disrupting the RNAP-CdnL interaction is not sufficient to promote CdnL clearance during starvation and reiterates the dependency on SpoT to stimulate CdnL turnover.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CdnL is cleared during stationary phase in a SpoT and ClpXP independent manner</title><p id="P15">In addition to starvation, another time in which cells experience nutrient stress is during stationary phase when resources become depleted as a population saturates. (p)ppGpp levels peak upon entry into stationary phase, and then dip to stabilize at levels that are still higher than basal levels occurring during logarithmic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). As we have found that both SpoT and ClpXP play important roles in maintaining CdnL levels during starvation when (p)ppGpp levels are high, we were curious to understand how these factors might contribute to regulating CdnL levels during stationary phase. To this end, we assessed CdnL protein levels from mid-log to late stationary phase in WT, CdnLDD, and Δ<italic>spoT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S4</xref>). CdnLDD levels were consistently higher than CdnL levels in both WT and Δ<italic>spoT</italic>, with Δ<italic>spoT</italic> having the lowest CdnL levels throughout. In all strains, CdnL levels started to decline at an OD<sub>600</sub> of about 1.0. This reduction was stark for both WT and Δ<italic>spoT</italic>, while it was more gradual for CdnLDD. Surprisingly, we found that CdnL was cleared in all strains by an OD<sub>600</sub> of about 1.6, suggesting this mechanism of regulation is (p)ppGpp-independent and distinct from that of carbon starvation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CdnL and CdnLDD exhibit reduced chromosomal binding during starvation</title><p id="P16">Mechanistically, we have shown that CdnL is cleared post-transcriptionally in a SpoT- and ClpXP-dependent manner, and that mutation of the C-terminal degradation signal to CdnLDD stabilizes protein levels during starvation. As CdnL is a transcription factor, we sought to understand if stabilization of CdnL protein would permit increased CdnL occupancy on the chromosome during starvation, presumably via interaction with RNAP, thus leading to transcriptomic changes that would be disadvantageous during carbon starvation. To begin to understand the consequences of CdnL regulation on transcriptional reprogramming during nutrient limitation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to assess the occupancy of WT CdnL and CdnLDD on the chromosome under both nutrient-replete (M2G) conditions and after 60 minutes of carbon starvation. We selected this time point as WT CdnL was almost completely cleared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>) and broad transcriptional changes are reported at this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). After identifying 107 peaks with a &gt; 2-fold enrichment in the binding profile of WT CdnL in M2G compared to the Δ<italic>cdnL</italic> control, we looked at these peaks in the binding profiles of WT CdnL and CdnLDD in both M2G and M2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>). In M2G, the binding profiles of WT CdnL and CdnLDD were well correlated with each other and with our prior ChIP-Seq analysis of CdnL association across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Consistent with our previous transcriptomic analyses, DAVID analysis of locus function revealed a significant enrichment in aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis and ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). During carbon starvation (M2 media), we observed three clusters of loci with distinct CdnL association profiles. WT CdnL had an overall reduction in binding at Group 1 genomic loci, while Groups 2 and 3 showed either equal or increased CdnL binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This is surprising given that CdnL protein levels are significantly reduced in the absence of carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). Interestingly, CdnLDD showed an overall decrease in binding after 60 minutes of starvation, similar to WT, despite the fact that CdnLDD levels in M2 are comparable to WT CdnL levels in M2G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). These observations suggest that while CdnLDD is highly stable, it largely does not associate with the DNA after 60 minutes of carbon starvation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>CdnL stabilization alters ribosomal and metabolic gene transcription</title><p id="P17">Although CdnLDD does not interact with the chromosome after 60 minutes of carbon starvation, we were interested in understanding if CdnLDD could still facilitate transcriptional changes. To address this, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess the transcriptional profiles of WT and CdnLDD at 0 and 60 minutes of carbon starvation. In comparing CdnLDD to WT at 0 minutes carbon starvation, we found that 101 genes were at least 2-fold differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Dataset S2</xref>).

This set of genes showed no overlap with the 101 genes differentially regulated at 0 minutes of starvation. The most highly upregulated transcript in WT compared to CdnLDD was CCNA_03545 (ribosome silencing factor), which acts to separate the large and small ribosomal subunits during stationary phase and stress, further implicating CdnLDD in altered ribosome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Dataset S3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Additionally, DAVID functional annotation analyses indicated a relative upregulation of transcripts associated with toxin-antitoxin systems and stress responses in WT, suggesting that CdnLDD may not be appropriately responding to nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Dataset S3</xref>). Nonetheless, the relatively small differences in the transcriptional profiles between WT and CdnLDD is consistent with their similar binding profiles demonstrated by ChIP-seq and further suggests that CdnL stabilization does not cause global changes in transcription after 60 minutes of starvation.</p><p id="P19">While CdnL stabilization does not globally impact the immediate transcriptional response to starvation, we wondered how the transcriptome might be impacted over a longer starvation. It is possible that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> would experience even longer periods of starvation in nature. Indeed, we found that the WT transcriptome changes from 60 minutes of starvation to 24 hours of starvation, prompting us to investigate potential differences between WT and CdnLDD transcripts at additional time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Dataset S4</xref>). We decided to assess the WT and CdnLDD transcriptional profiles at 24 hours of starvation, a time point in which CdnLDD remains stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S6A</xref>). At this time point, we found 279 genes to be 2-fold differentially regulated between WT and CdnLDD, 21 of which were also differentially expressed after 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Dataset S5</xref>). Of these genes, 177 were more highly expressed in WT, including the ribosome silencing factor again, while 102 were more highly expressed in CdnLDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Dataset S5</xref>). For the genes more highly expressed in WT, DAVID functional annotation analyses revealed a relative upregulation of transcripts associated with cell projections, such as flagella and pili (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Dataset S5</xref>). Lower relative expression of these transcripts in CdnLDD could suggest that CdnLDD is continuing to promote cell cycle progression in spite of (p)ppGpp accumulation, which normally slows the swarmer-to-stalked transition and leads to an accumulation of flagellated swarmer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Of the genes upregulated in CdnLDD compared to WT, many were associated with ribosomes, including translation initiation and elongation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Dataset S5</xref>). The production of ribosomes, and protein synthesis in general, is typically reduced under starvation conditions to slow growth and allow resources to be diverted to amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Additionally, transcripts associated with metabolic pathways, such as the electron transport chain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, were found to be enriched in CdnLDD, suggesting increased flux through these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Dataset S5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We also wanted to understand if CdnL stabilization could affect transcription during the adaptation phase when nutrients are replenished after a long starvation. Therefore, we assessed the transcriptome of WT and CdnLDD 60 minutes after the addition of glucose, a time point in which WT CdnL has not returned to basal levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S6A</xref>). After replenishing glucose and allowing the cells to recover for 60 minutes, 199 genes were found to be differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Dataset S6</xref>). In addition to again finding a relative upregulation of transcripts associated with cell projections in WT, DAVID analyses also showed an enrichment of transcripts for genes involved in chemotaxis and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Dataset S6</xref>).

Together, these observations suggest that the WT cells were responding to nutrient availability by resuming growth, cell cycle progression, and polar development. For CdnLDD, ribosome-related transcripts were again found to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Dataset S6</xref>). Interestingly, additional transcripts enriched in CdnLDD point to an upregulation of genes involved in the DNA damage response and repair pathways, including the alkylated DNA repair protein <italic>alkB</italic> (CCNA_00009), the SOS-induced inhibitor of cell division <italic>sidA</italic> (CCNA_02004), an oxidative DNA demethylation family protein (CCNA_00745), the bacterial apoptosis endonuclease <italic>bapE</italic> (CCNA_00663), and the DNA replication and repair protein <italic>recF</italic> (CCNA_00158) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Dataset S6</xref>). Upregulation of these transcripts could suggest DNA damage in CdnLDD.</p><p id="P21">In summary, these RNA-seq analyses reveal that CdnL stabilization causes increased levels of transcripts associated with ribosomal and protein synthesis genes under both nutrient-rich and carbon-starved conditions, as well as an increase in transcripts associated with metabolic pathways after 24 hours of starvation. During nutrient-repletion, CdnL stabilization leads to an upregulation of transcripts related to DNA damage response and repair proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>CdnL clearance during carbon starvation is necessary for efficient outgrowth upon nutrient repletion</title><p id="P22">Since we observed transcriptional changes between WT and CdnLDD during starvation and upon nutrient repletion, we wondered if CdnL stabilization impacts the ability of cells to adapt to nutrient fluctuations. Being a global regulator of growth, we hypothesized that CdnL clearance during starvation facilitates transcriptional changes that enables adaptation by ultimately promoting survival instead of proliferation. To this end, we measured the growth of WT and CdnLDD strains both before a 24-hour carbon starvation and after the 24-hour starvation upon glucose repletion. Before starvation, WT and CdnLDD showed similar growth rates, with doubling times of 2.1 and 2.2 hours, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S2</xref>). During the outgrowth from 24 hours of starvation, the strains again had similar growth rates; however, CdnLDD had a slightly longer lag time compared to WT and reached an OD of 0.1 after about 9.3 hours as opposed to 8.3 hours, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Because we observed that cells with an inability to clear CdnL have a slight defect in outgrowth from carbon starvation, we wondered how this phenotype might relate to the effects of other transcriptional regulators involved in the stringent response. We repeated these experiments, this time assessing the growth of several mutant strains, including: a strain expressing an RNAP with a (p)ppGpp binding site 1 mutation (RNAP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>); a strain lacking the transcription factor DksA (Δ<italic>dksA</italic>), which normally would bind to RNAP to form the second (p)ppGpp binding pocket during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>); a Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1 strain, thus generating an RNAP that is essentially blind to the major effects of (p)ppGpp; and a CdnLDD/ Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1 strain. Before starvation, the RNAP-1, Δ<italic>dksA</italic>, and Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1 strains all exhibited growth rates very close to that of WT and CdnLDD, while the CdnLDD/ Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1 strain had a slightly longer doubling time and lag time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S2</xref>). After the 24-hour starvation, there was a clear striation in outgrowth, with the RNAP-1 strain displaying a similar growth pattern to CdnLDD, followed by Δ<italic>dksA</italic> and Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1. The CdnLDD/ Δ<italic>dksA</italic>/ RNAP-1 strain showed the greatest lag upon outgrowth, reaching an OD of 0.1 after about 11.6 hours in comparison to 8.3 hours for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S2</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the ability of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> to efficiently adapt to nutrient repletion following a period of starvation requires appropriate stringent response-mediated transcriptional reprogramming, which includes (p)ppGpp binding to RNAP, DksA, and clearance of CdnL.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>CdnL clearance during the SR is important for adaptation to nutrient limitation during competition</title><p id="P24">On its own, CdnL stabilization appeared to cause a slight defect in adaptation to changes in nutrient status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S2</xref>). We also observed transcriptional changes suggesting that CdnL stabilization promotes the transcription of genes that are typically downregulated upon SR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B – E</xref>). Because of these observations, we wondered if cells with a stabilized CdnL would be at a disadvantage if they were forced to compete with WT cells while adapting to changes in carbon availability. We tested this by competing a kanamycin-resistant or spectinomycin-resistant CdnLDD strain, which is unable to clear CdnL during starvation, with a spectinomycin-resistant or kanamycin-resistant WT strain, respectively. This allowed us to ask if the presence of CdnL is detrimental to fitness during starvation when in competition with cells that can effectively clear CdnL upon activation of the SR. We mixed equivalent OD units of the reciprocal strains in either M2G for nutrient-replete conditions or M2 for carbon-starved conditions. After 24 hours, we took a sample of the mixed culture and plated it on both a kanamycin plate and a spectinomycin plate in order to compare colony forming units (CFUs) between the CdnLDD and WT strains. We then either diluted the remaining culture into M2G to keep the cells in an exponential phase of growth, or into M2 to starve the cells.</p><p id="P25">We first tested the ability of CdnLDD to compete with WT under nutrient-rich conditions only. Over the course of 6 days, the CdnLDD and WT strains formed colonies in ∼1:1 ratio, suggesting that CdnL stabilization does not impact fitness when there are nutrients readily available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, left). However, after periods of carbon starvation and recovery, the CdnLDD strains formed fewer colonies than the WT strains, indicating that the WT strains outcompeted the CdnLDD strains in the mixed culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle). This trend was observed regardless of the initial nutrient composition, and a competitive disadvantage was observed for CdnLDD after a single round of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, right). These data suggest that stabilization of CdnL puts cells at a disadvantage when trying to adapt to fluctuating nutrient availability and supports the idea that one way in which <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adapts to nutrient stress is through clearance of this transcriptional regulator.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Adapting to environmental challenges such as nutrient deprivation requires efficient changes in transcription in order to downregulate biosynthetic genes and upregulate those that promote survival. While the direct binding of the SR alarmone (p)ppGpp to RNAP is a major way in which cells alter the transcriptome, other factors play key roles in allowing for an effective response to starvation. For instance, binding of the transcription factor DksA to RNAP has been shown to enhance the transcriptional effects of (p)ppGpp on RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>); however, it is not only the presence of factors that promote stress responses that enables adaptation to nutrient stress, but also the absence of anabolic regulators that shifts the transcriptional balance from anabolism to survival.</p><p id="P27">Here, we show that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> CdnL, a CarD-family transcriptional regulator involved in ribosome biosynthesis and anabolism, is regulated upon SR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). We find that transcriptional control at the <italic>cdnL</italic> promoter is not sufficient to control CdnL levels, and that regulation of CdnL protein occurs post-translationally in a manner dependent on SpoT, with (p)ppGpp being sufficient for CdnL clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We also show that CdnL is regulated at the protein level by the ClpXP protease, and that mutation of a degradation signal in the CdnL C-terminus stabilizes CdnL levels during the SR. Surprisingly, CdnLDD does not bind the chromosome after 60 minutes of starvation, nor does it globally alter transcription at this time point. Transcriptional changes that arise from CdnL stabilization are most obvious after 24 hours of starvation, where we find misregulation of ribosomal and metabolic genes. Ultimately, we find that clearance of CdnL is physiologically important, as CdnL stabilization causes adaptation defects. We propose that the combined and potentially synergistic actions of SpoT and ClpXP during the SR facilitate rapid clearance of CdnL protein. CdnL clearance allows for adaptation by transcriptionally downregulating ribosome biosynthesis and flux through metabolic pathways, thereby promoting <italic>Caulobacter</italic> survival when nutrients are lacking. When conditions become favorable again, re-introduction of CdnL enables cells to adapt by reactivating biosynthesis and metabolism, thereby allowing growth to resume.</p><p id="P28">The connection between the stringent response and the regulation of CdnL and its homologs in diverse bacteria has been a point of confusion. Indeed, transcription of mycobacterial CdnL homolog, <italic>carD</italic>, was initially shown to be upregulated during starvation, and CarD depletion was reported to sensitize cells to stressors such as starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, recent studies indicate that while <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels increase due to stabilization of the transcript by the anti-sense RNA AscarD, CarD protein levels ultimately decrease through decreased translation and degradation by the Clp protease. Transcription of <italic>ascarD</italic> is proposed to be under control of a stress sigma factor SigF, thus connecting regulation of CarD to nutrient stress. This regulation of CarD was shown to help mycobacterial cells respond to various stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Likewise, we find CdnL regulation to be functionally important for <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells to adapt to the stress of nutrient fluctuations. Cells producing the stabilized CdnL variant, CdnLDD, have a slight defect upon outgrowth from carbon starvation, which is exacerbated in the absence of DksA and (p)ppGpp binding to RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We also find that CdnLDD cells are outcompeted by WT cells when subjected to periods of carbon starvation, indicating that CdnL regulation is important for cells to adapt to nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P30">These adaptation defects are likely caused by the effects of CdnLDD transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B - E</xref>). While we found that after 60 minutes of starvation, CdnLDD does not bind the chromosome and causes a relatively limited number of transcriptional changes, the effects of CdnL stabilization on transcription become more apparent after 24 hours of starvation and during the adaptation phase when nutrients are replenished. CdnL stabilization increases transcription of genes associated with ribosomes and metabolic pathways during nutrient stress. As ribosome biogenesis and maintenance are costly, it would be disadvantageous to promote these processes during times of limited resources. Likewise, promoting metabolic gene expression can lead to increased flux through these pathways during a time when extra metabolic activity would not be favored. Additionally, the redox reactions of the ETC, if inappropriately managed, can create damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). As many DNA damage response and repair proteins are upregulated in CdnLDD 60 minutes after the addition of glucose following a 24-hour starvation, it is tempting to speculate that increased flux through the ETC is creating ROS and causing DNA damage. The repair of damaged DNA coupled with the costly misregulation of ribosomes can put cells with a stabilized CdnL at a disadvantage when trying to adapt to nutrient fluctuations and reinitiate growth.</p><p id="P31">Regulation of CdnL during stress appears to be a common theme across diverse bacterial phyla.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min at 25°C, and cell pellets were washed 3 times with 50 mL of M2 media (without glucose) at 25°C. Each of the washed cell pellets was split into two and used to inoculate 50 mL of M2 (carbon starvation) and 50 mL of M2G (preheated culture medium at 30°C), respectively. Cultures were incubated at 30⁰C (shaking at 200 rpm) for additional 60 minutes and then, supplemented with 10 μM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) at RT for 10 min to achieve crosslinking. Subsequently, the cultures were incubated for an additional 30 min on ice and washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The resulting cell pellets were stored at -80°C. After resuspension of the cells in TES buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl) containing 10 mM of DTT, the cell resuspensions were incubated in the presence of Ready-Lyse lysozyme solution (Epicentre, Madison, WI) for 10 minutes at 37°C, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>The stringent response (SR) is a ubiquitous bacterial stress response that promotes adaptation to nutrient deprivation. While it is known that SR activation affects RNA polymerase activity to reprogram the transcriptome, the impact of the SR on other transcriptional regulators is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved transcription factor, CdnL, is cleared upon activation of the SR, and that its clearance is important for cells to efficiently adapt to nutrient fluctuations. Our results suggest that CdnL regulation enables adaptation by transcriptionally downregulating ribosome biosynthesis and flux through metabolic pathways, thereby promoting survival during nutrient stress. As CdnL homologs are broadly found, we hypothesize that CdnL regulation is a conserved mechanism of bacterial adaptation to stress.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CdnL is cleared during conditions that activate the stringent response</title><p>A.
