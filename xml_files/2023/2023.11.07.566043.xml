Defective IL7R expression in humans hampers T cell precursors proliferation and differentiation during lymphopoiesis resulting in absence of T cells in newborns, who succumb to severe infections and death early after birth. Previous attempts to tackle IL7R-SCID by viral gene therapy have shown that unregulated IL7R expression predisposes to leukaemia, suggesting the application of targeted gene editing to insert a correct copy of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene in its genomic locus and mediate its physiological expression as a more feasible therapeutic approach. To this aim, we have first developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based IL7R-SCID disease modelling system that recapitulates the disease phenotype in primary human T cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Then, we have designed a knock-in strategy that targets <italic>IL7RA</italic> exon 1 and introduces via homology directed repair a corrective, promoterless IL7RA cDNA followed by a reporter cassette through AAV6 transduction. Targeted integration of the corrective cassette in primary T cells restored IL7R expression and rescued functional downstream IL7R signalling. When applied to HSPCs further induced to differentiate into T cells in an Artificial Thymic Organoid system, our gene editing strategy overcame the T cell developmental block observed in IL7R-SCID patients, while promoting full maturation of T cells with physiological and developmentally regulated IL7R expression. Finally, genotoxicity assessment of the CRISPR/Cas9 platform in HSPCs using biased and unbiased technologies confirmed the safety of the strategy, paving the way for a new, efficient, and safe therapeutic option for IL7R-SCID patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gene editing</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cells</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>immunodeficiency</kwd><kwd>disease modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The group of severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) represents the most serious form of primary immunodeficiency diseases, affecting approximately one infant in every 50,000 live births. SCID is characterized by a block in T cell development or function, variably associated with defects in B or natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. IL7R deficiency causes approximately 10% of SCID cases, and the majority of T-B+NK+ cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. IL7R-SCID is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene, which encodes for the α chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R).</p><p id="P3">The interaction of IL-7 with IL7R leads to the recruitment of intracellular signalling molecules and to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways which are important for transcriptional activation of genes involved in T cell differentiation, survival, maturation, and TCR rearrangement. IL7R expression is restricted to T lymphocytes in humans and it is tightly regulated during T cell development to ensure correct cell maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In the human thymus, αβ T cell thymopoiesis proceeds from haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) via common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) which commit to the T-lineage following Notch signalling. CLPs differentiate into double-negative (DN1, DN2, DN3; CD4<sup>–</sup>CD8<sup>–</sup>), then double-positive (DP; CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) thymocytes, which are positively selected for TCR functionality and become single-positive (SP) CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> mature T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Only CLPs express IL7R without requiring it, allowing human <italic>IL7RA</italic>-deficient CLPs to develop into normal B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. From the DN2 stage, BCL-2 expression, essential for protecting thymocytes from apoptosis, becomes IL7-dependent. IL7R also promotes V(D)J recombination in DN2–3 cells and T cell receptor γ (TCRγ) rearrangement and is thus essential for γδ T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. IL7R expression is then downregulated at the DN4 stage and disappears in DP thymocytes, when TCR-αβ becomes expressed and takes over the anti-apoptotic role (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]). As such, disruption of IL-7 signalling arrests T cell development at the DN2-3 stage in <italic>IL7RA</italic>-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], preventing productive TCR rearrangement and leading to T cell lymphopenia. Absence of T lymphocytes results in profound failure of both humoral and cellular immunity, with severe and opportunistic infections and failure to thrive, leading to fatal outcome within the early years of life of IL7R-SCID children.</p><p id="P4">Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors is the leading therapy for patients with SCID, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] however it is available to less than 20% of patients. While matched HSCT often successfully reconstitutes T cells in IL7R-SCID patients and raises their low immunoglobulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], mismatched-donor transplantation is associated with aggressive graft-versus-host disease, long-term hepatic complications of myeloablative conditioning, insufficient immune reconstitution, and mortality, especially if infection occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Consequently, HSCT does not represent a viable therapeutic option for the remaining patients lacking a suitable donor. Genetic correction of autologous patient HSPCs and subsequent transplantation eliminates the risk of alloreactivity associated with HSCT and facilitates the use of sub-myeloablative conditioning. Successful gene therapy approaches for ADA-SCID and SCID-X1 have demonstrated the applicability of this technology to treat rare genetic diseases that affect the hematopoietic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, pre-clinical gene therapy studies using a retroviral vector to introduce a correct copy of <italic>IL7RA</italic> in HSPCs derived from IL7R-deficient mice showed that constitutive, unregulated and ectopic expression of the protein can promote non-lymphoid cell proliferation, causing pre-leukemic neutrophil expansion and splenomegaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that forced IL7R expression throughout thymopoiesis diminishes the DN4 cell pool due to DP cell overconsumption and reduces thymic cellularity and peripheral T cell numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene amplification and human gain-of-function mutations that increase IL-7 sensitivity associate with T-ALL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], while IL7R overexpression may also protect pre-leukemic T cells from apoptosis, allowing time for additional mutations to accumulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Ultimately, it has been shown that IL7R overexpression predisposes mice to thymoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Taken together, these observations highlight the need of tight <italic>IL7RA</italic> transcriptional regulation for therapeutic correction of IL7R-SCID. While the introduction of <italic>IL7RA</italic> specific regulatory regions in the viral vector design could serve this purpose, no studies have succeeded so far in correcting this disease through viral gene therapy, mostly due to: 1) difficulties in defining the minimum regulatory regions required to recapitulate endogenous IL7R expression; 2) the complex regulatory networks needed to control <italic>IL7RA</italic> transcription and translation are prohibitively large for incorporation into a viral vector to achieve tight physiological regulation; 3) semi-random vector integration pattern, which may impact on transgene expression.</p><p id="P5">An alternative to using virus-based gene therapy is to utilize genome editing, to correct the endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus while avoiding issues of unregulated transgene expression. Gene editing uses programmable nuclease to generate site-specific genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) in which desired alterations can be introduced during DNA repair. The major repair pathway is non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), in which the DSB site gains a random assortment of small insertions and/or deletions (indels) and point mutations. The alternative pathway is homology-directed repair (HDR), in which a donor template with flanking arms homologous to the DSB-surrounding region accurately integrates into the DSB site. This allows targeted therapeutic transgene integration as a platform for correcting multiple mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Robust protocols have been developed for CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing in HSPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and several gene editing platforms to treat primary immunodeficiency diseases relying on high-fidelity HDR to integrate a therapeutic transgene in its own locus have been developed preclinically (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]), reaching up to 70% of HSPCs correction and complete haematopoietic reconstitution in mice, establishing the safety and efficacy of this approach.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we aim to develop a safe and effective CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing platform to treat IL7R-SCID by directly knocking-in a IL7RA cDNA in frame with the endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> translational start codon, allowing regulated transcription from the promoter and enhancers naturally present in the locus, as well as the functional correction of all the mutations in the <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene responsible for the onset of the disease. Given the rarity of the disease and the difficulty in accessing patient blood samples, we devised a disease modelling strategy based on a multiplexed HDR platform to mimic both IL7R deficiency in T cells and HSPCs from healthy donors, as well as its restoration by monoallelic or biallelic knock-in of the corrective IL7RA cDNA through gene editing. By taking advantage of this system, we showed almost complete restoration of IL7R expression and function in IL7RA cDNA knocked-in T cells, as well as rescue of T cell development when the corrective transgene is incorporated in <italic>IL7RA</italic> knock-out HSPCs. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a CRISPR/Cas9-based platform as a viable therapeutic approach to treat IL7R-SCID and paves the way for its potential clinical translation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Culture of human CD34+ HSPCs and T cells</title><p id="P7">Under written informed consent, CD34+ HSPCs were isolated from GCSF mobilized healthy donor apheresis using CD34+ Microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotec, UK).

To generate <italic>IL7RA</italic> knock-out (KO) cell clones, we designed 5 different gRNAs targeting <italic>IL7RA</italic> exons 2-5 to introduce mutations that would abrogate the <italic>IL7RA</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The RNP complexes containing gRNA5-9 were nucleofected in DG-75 cells and the efficacy of gene editing assessed by a T7 Endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assay and TIDE analysis, showing up to 37% of cutting frequency when gRNA6 was employed, which in turn led to a significant reduction of IL7R expression as detected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-1</xref>). Clonal populations of <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO cells were manually selected from the edited cell bulk and assessed for IL7R deficiency by immunoblotting; clone #65 showed complete abrogation of IL7R protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>), further confirmed by <italic>IL7RA</italic> open reading frame disruption downstream the gRNA6 cut site as revealed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure 1D) and was thus utilized in the following experiments as an IL7R deficiency cell model. Electroporation of DG-75 clone #65 with the Cas9:gRNA4 RNP complex followed by transduction at increasing doses of the AAV6 donor template carrying the coIL7RA-pA cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>) led to the successful insertion of the therapeutic cDNA at the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus by HDR at a frequency plateauing 40% of the cells, when a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50,000 was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref>). This corresponded to a proportional restoration of IL7R protein expression (38% of the protein level detected in wild-type DG-75 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref>), suggesting that our strategy has the potential to fully rescue physiological IL7R expression in the target cell upon knock-in of the corrective cDNA.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Modelling and correcting IL7R-SCID in T-lymphocytes by multiplexed gene editing</title><p id="P23">Expression of the appropriate level of IL7R in target cells is critical to ensure therapeutic effectiveness. To evaluate this however, acquiring a considerable number of IL7R-SCID patient T cells or HSPCs from the peripheral blood or the bone marrow would be required, which poses challenges due to the very rare nature of the disease, the early age of IL7R-SCID infants, and the invasiveness of the procedure. To overcome this challenge, we devised an HDR multiplexing platform to mimic both <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO and coIL7RA cDNA monoallelic and biallelic knock-in (KI) in human primary hematopoietic cells derived from healthy donors. The <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO multiplexing strategy entails the use of two distinct AAV6 donor vectors carrying either an elongation factor 1α short (EFS) promoter-driven GFP or mCherry reporter cassette. The integration of these cassettes into the <italic>IL7RA</italic> exon 1 at the gRNA4 cut site via HDR simultaneously abrogates endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> transcription (and thus protein expression) and expresses reporter genes permitting the selection of GFP<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> double positive cells that underwent biallelic gene KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>top panel</bold>). A similar strategy allows selection of cells that bear biallelic KI of the corrective transgene, by utilising AAV6 donor vectors that carry the GFP or mCherry reporter gene preceded by the coIL7RA cDNA; the simultaneous integration of these cassettes in the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus will again abrogate endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> transcription while expressing the therapeutic cDNA together with the respective reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>bottom panel</bold>). As monoallelic correction of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus is in principle sufficient for the disease treatment due to the functional immune systems observed in heterozygous parents of IL7R-SCID patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], we also paired one KO with one KI AAV6 donor vector carrying two different reporter genes, to mimic KO of the endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene in both alleles and KI of the corrective cassette in one allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>middle panel</bold>).</p><p id="P24">T cells isolated from the PB of three different healthy donors were electroporated with the Cas9:gRNA4 RNP complex and transduced with the combination of AAV donor vectors required to achieve either complete <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO (KO<sup>-/-</sup>), monoallelic coIL7RA cDNA KI coupled with monoallelic <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO (KI<sup>+/-</sup>), or biallelic coIL7RA cDNA KI (KI<sup>+/+</sup>). HDR-mediated transgene integration was successfully achieved as measured by flow cytometry, with an average of 2.5-4.5% of biallelic and 10-15% of monoallelic integration per each reporter gene, respectively, totalling an average of 25-34% of editing frequency of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). GFP<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells were FACS sorted to obtain pure populations of cells with the desired genotype; flow cytometry gating showed sufficient separation between populations for effective purification, which was further confirmed by ddPCR analysis on individually sorted populations showing correct integration of each reporter cassette in approximately 50% of the GFP<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells (Supplementary Figure 2). To evaluate the restoration of IL7R expression in T cells in which the coIL7RA cDNA was precisely inserted in frame with the translational start site of the endogenous <italic>IL7RA</italic> gene, cells were fixed, permeabilised and stained for IL7R intra- and extra-cellular expression. A proportional analysis of IL7R expression compared to wildtype (WT) cells is necessary as IL7R is usually stochastically expressed in only a minority of cells even in healthy donor samples, reflecting its status as an altruistically regulated receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly increased proportion of IL7R-positive cells in WT and edited cells relative to KO<sup>-/-</sup> cells, with biallelic coIL7RA cDNA KI (KI<sup>+/+</sup>) cells recapitulating WT expression and monoallelic KI<sup>+/-</sup> cells exhibiting an intermediate proportion of IL7R-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Comparison of IL7R mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in edited cells showed that biallelic KI of the coIL7RA cassette led to the expression of the protein at levels comparable to those observed in WT cells, while monoallelic KI<sup>+/-</sup> cells expressed it at reduced levels, likely reflecting the presence of only one functioning copy of the corrective cDNA per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To assess whether Cas9/AAV6-based integration of the coIL7RA cDNA restores IL7R functionality, we evaluated the levels of phosphorylated STAT5 protein (pSTAT5) in KI<sup>+/-</sup>, KI<sup>+/+</sup>, KO and WT T cells upon IL-7 stimulation. Indeed, binding of the IL-7 cytokine to its receptor activates a downstream IL7R signalling cascade which results in the phosphorylation of STAT5 and activation of an IL7R-dependend transcriptional profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Intracellular pSTAT5 staining in IL-7-stimulated cells indicated a trend towards restoration of the proportion of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> T cells in both biallelic and monoallelic KI cells, while KO cells showed no IL7R functionality, mimicking pSTAT5 levels detected in unstimulated IL-7 WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). While STAT5 phosphorylation is a common downstream cascade effect of many cytokines mostly signalling through the common gamma chain receptor in T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], we confirmed that signalling disruption in IL7RA KO and its restoration in KI cells is strictly dependent on the presence of IL7R, as no significant difference in the frequency of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells was detected in all experimental groups when cells were stimulated with IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Knock-in of a corrective IL7RA cDNA in HSPCs restores T cell development</title><p id="P26">Having demonstrated the successful development of a gene editing strategy to model IL7R deficiency and its correction by HDR-mediated gene knock-in in primary human T cells, we next assessed if the same approach would be effective when applied to HSPCs, the target cell type for the definitive treatment of IL7R-SCID. Because IL7R expression is neither detectable nor required in these cells, therapeutic success of the gene editing platform applied to HSPCs would be demonstrated by differentiation into mature TCRαβ<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, which is abrogated in the SCID phenotype. Furthermore, during the differentiation process from HSPCs to T cells, tight regulation of IL7R expression is necessary to faithfully recapitulate its physiological role during T cell development and homeostasis. To evaluate these aspects, we took advantage of the 3D Artificial Thymic Organoid (ATO) system, which models the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and maturation of T cells from HSPCs, allowing us to elucidate the precise stages in which T cell developmental blocks occur in SCIDs and if gene editing is able to ameliorate such developmental obstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P27">To this aim, HSPCs isolated from the PB of three different healthy donors were electroporated with the Cas9:gRNA4 RNP complex and transduced with the combination of AAV donor vectors required to obtain <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO (KO<sup>-/-</sup>), monoallelic (KI<sup>+/-</sup>) and biallelic (KI<sup>+/+</sup>) coIL7RA cDNA KI. HDR-mediated transgene integration was successfully achieved as measured by flow cytometry, with a frequency of 0.4-4% of biallelic and 6-21% of monoallelic integration per each reporter gene, respectively, totalling an average of 28.4% of editing frequency of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). ATOs seeded with edited and FACS sorted cell populations, alongside unmanipulated wild-type HSPCs, were cultured for 6–8 weeks and their final compositions characterized by flow cytometric analysis of thymopoietic surface markers at different time points to track T cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3A, B). By week 4 post seeding, ATOs were able to recapitulate the two early phenotypic stages of thymic T cell progenitors: multipotent CD34+CD7−CD5− early thymic progenitors (ETP) and developmentally downstream CD34+CD7+CD5+ pro-T2 progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), identified based on a classification scheme using CD5 and CD7 markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. At this stage, WT, KI<sup>+/-</sup>, KI<sup>+/+</sup> and KO<sup>-/-</sup> groups show similar proportions of ETPs; however, pro-T2 progenitors are already absent from the KO<sup>-/-</sup> sample, reflecting the known IL7R dependence of pro-T2 cell survival during thymopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Contrary to this, the frequency of both precursor types in the monoallelic and biallelic KI samples resembled those observed in the WT samples, suggesting that knock-in of the corrective coIL7RA cDNA does rescue pro-T2 cell survival and the block in T cell development observed in patients. ATOs were further assessed for complete T cell maturation at week 6 and week 8 of culture. Similar trends as observed at earlier time points were borne out in the pre-T (CD34– CD7+ CD5+), early double positive (EDP; CD34–CD3–CD4+CD8+), and mature T cell (CD34– CD3+ TCRαβ+) populations at 6 and 8 weeks of culture, when the frequencies of these populations in the KI samples again recapitulated the behaviour of WT samples, while KO<sup>-/-</sup> ones kept exhibiting curtailed thymocyte proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3B). These results indicate that <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO recapitulates the expected pro-T2 block in thymopoiesis and that coIL7R KI rescues all thymocyte populations downstream of the initial IL7R dependence at the pro-T2 stage. HAs previously discussed, IL7R expression derived from a gene addition approach must be tightly controlled throughout T cell development to avoid the occurrence of adverse events and dysregulated immunity. When looking at IL7R protein abundance in the samples seeded on ATOs, we observed correct restoration of protein expression mediated by the coIL7RA cDNA knocked-in in the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus in both KI experimental groups, with biallelic KI achieving an average of 65% of WT IL7R expression in both pre-T and mature T cells. Most importantly, IL7R was not constitutively expressed throughout cell differentiation, but correctly shut down at the immature EDP stage and subsequently reactivated at the mature DP cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Overall, these data show that HDR-mediated knock-in of a <italic>coIL7RA</italic> cDNA in frame with its endogenous regulatory regions mediates sufficient protein expression to relieve the block in T cell development observed in IL7R-deficient patients and does so in a physiologically regulated fashion.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Off-target analysis confirms the safety of the gene editing platform</title><p id="P28">One of the potential concerns associated with gene editing is the introduction of unwanted genetic modifications at off-target sites and the occurrence of gross chromosomal rearrangements, posing a huge risk for clinical therapeutic applications involving engineered nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. To determine the specificity of our gRNA targeting <italic>IL7RA</italic>, we delivered the CRISPR/gRNA4 RNP to HSPCs derived from the PB of three different healthy donors and assessed the presence of indels at non-specific sites using GUIDE-seq (genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing) an unbiased genome-wide analysis tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], as well as the bioinformatic prediction tool COSMID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Analysis of the GUIDE-seq sequencing data retrieved 10 different off-target sites at extremely low read numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). However, targeted deep sequencing of these sites in CRISPR-treated and mock-treated HSPCs from three different healthy donors demonstrated no significant gene disruption at the genomic locations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In parallel, off-target activity at the top 10 genomic sites showing high homology with <italic>IL7RA</italic> gRNA target sequence (up to 3 mismatches) by COSMID was measured by targeted deep-sequencing in treated and mock-treated HSPCs. At a read depth of 50,000x we could not detect any genetic disruption at a statistically significant frequency compared to mock-treated controls in all genomic sites tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Lastly, we sought to identify the potential occurrence of large chromosomal aberrations, such as translocations, insertions or deletions, at off- and on-target gRNA cutting sites by using the CAST-seq technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. For this analysis, we edited HSPCs with a Cas9:gRNA4 RNP complex containing a wild-type recombinant Cas9 protein, to be able to evaluate the presence of remote and rare rearrangement events that would not be detectable when using a high fidelity Cas9. Despite this, the CAST-seq analysis confirmed the safety of this gene editing platform, with only rearrangements at the <italic>IL7RA</italic> on-target locus being visible because of non-HDR mediated DNA repair at the CRISPR/Cas9 cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Here, we report the successful application of a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing platform to model and correct a rare and devastating primary immunodeficiency, IL7R-SCID, through editing of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus in primary human T cells and HSPCs. There has been a limited number of studies showing treatment options for this disease and this work represents the first evidence of therapeutically relevant genetic correction in primary cells using a gene editing approach. IL7R-SCID represents an ideal candidate for gene editing applications for many reasons: 1) previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of genetically-corrected HSPCs in curing different forms of SCID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]; 2) safety issues raised by preclinical studies using viral gene therapy approaches for IL7R SCID suggest the need of a physiologically regulated and restricted IL7R expression during T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], which can be achieved through <italic>in situ</italic> gene editing; 3) the tremendous selective advantage that functionally corrected cells have compared to mutated cells in a SCID setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] can compensate for the relative low HDR correction rates that can be obtained in more primitive, long-term repopulating HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and could ideally allow infusion of autologous gene edited cells without pharmacological conditioning; 4) absence of a definitive treatment available to all the patients urges the need for new, innovative treatments to be established.</p><p id="P30">Our strategy restores IL7R expression by integrating a full-length, codon optimised IL7RA cDNA next to <italic>IL7RA</italic> endogenous translational start site on chromosome 5, utilising a highly specific gRNA cutting at the beginning of the <italic>IL7RA</italic> first exon and an AAV6 donor vector carrying a promoterless therapeutic cassette. This approach mediates the targeted integration of one/two correct copy/ies of the coIL7RA cDNA per cell, maintaining a normal gene copy number and reducing the risks of genotoxicity caused by the semi-random integration of copies in the genome of patient’s cells observed with viral gene therapy approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Moreover, controlled integration of the corrective cDNA in the <italic>IL7RA</italic> locus allows the transcriptional regulation by endogenous regulatory elements, ensuring physiological <italic>IL7RA</italic> expression upon integration of the cassette. In addition, our platform can treat all disease-causing mutations with only one set of reagents thus representing a universal platform that could be applied to all IL7R-SCID patients and ideally to many other rare genetic disorders that require correction of the genetic defects at the HSPC level. The gene editing platform devised by us performed efficiently when tested in a <italic>IL7RA</italic> KO B-cell line, in T cells and in healthy human HSPCs, with high levels of targeted integration of the cassette in the desired locus and no major disruption in cell viability and HSPCs colony forming and.differentiation capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the limited access to precious SCID patient cells limits our ability to evaluate whether expected thresholds for clinical efficacy are met in terms of editing efficiency, protein expression and function, as well as toxicity. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a multiplexing gene editing system that can efficiently mimic gene knock-out and knock-in by taking advantage of the simultaneous HDR-mediated integration of two expression cassettes with distinct reporter genes that allow FACS sorting of pure cell populations with the desired genotype. While modelling strategies similar to ours have been already devised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], here we show its versatility in modelling both monoallelic and biallelic gene correction in two human primary cell types, T cells and HSPCs.</p><p id="P31">By applying our multiplexed targeted integration approach to T cells, we were able to completely abrogate IL7R expression and downstream signalling, thus obtaining a pure population of IL7R KO cells that recapitulate the IL7R-SCID defect. On the other hand, efficient monoallelic and biallelic KI of the corrective coIL7RA cDNA restored near physiological levels of protein expression, especially in the biallelic configuration, validating the use of our gene editing platform for therapeutic purposes. Assaying IL7R expression and signalling pathways is important not only for evaluating whether cDNA integration restores physiological IL7R expression and functionality, but also whether these lie below thresholds associated with oncogenic transformation risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Levels of phosphorylation of STAT5 are a widely used readout for IL7R signalling, as it represents a major downstream transcription factor mediating IL-7-dependent survival and differentiation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We indeed confirmed that KI<sup>+/+</sup> and KI<sup>+/-</sup> cells showed significantly greater IL7R expression and pSTAT5 levels than KO T cells, while no IL7R overexpression or pSTAT5 over-phosphorylation were observed in these samples relative to WT T cells. Moreover, correction of the pSTAT5 signalling cascade by gene KI was IL7R-specific, as no changes in the signalling pathways were observed across experimental conditions when T cells were stimulated with IL-2 instead of IL-7.</p><p id="P32">Because a potential gene editing application for IL7R-SCID would require the manipulation of HSPCs as the target population, we implemented the same disease modelling strategy to those cells, in order to assess a) achievable rates of gene correction; b) functional correction of HSPCs’ capability to give rise to mature T cells once gene edited; and c) restoration of physiological protein expression in mature T cells. Evidence from bone marrow transplantation in IL7R-SCID patients and preclinical gene therapy studies have shown that as little as 10% of corrected cells engrafting the host bone marrow is sufficient to functionally cure T–B+ SCIDs due to the selective advantage of corrected cells over SCID cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. While the efficiency of biallelic KI of the corrective cassette in HSPCs failed to meet the 10% threshold, total editing efficiencies including monoallelic KI cells frequently exceeded 25%. As such, total KI efficiency achieved is a clinically relevant figure for IL7R-SCID as, being an autosomal recessive disorder, even monoallelic correction alone is sufficient to enable normal haematopoiesis in carrier parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Previous work by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] with similar gene editing strategies applied to HSPCs reached KI rates sensibly higher than those achieved in our modelling system. We believe that this discrepancy could be due to the increased viral burden of transduction with two AAV viruses required for multiplexed HDR at high MOI, which likely artificially suppressed edited cell survival as a results of cell toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Moreover, the increased length of the HDR donor molecules due to the inclusion of an EFS-GFP/mCherry cassette also likely reduced KI efficiency compared to smaller clinical constructs lacking reporter genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. This is backed up by results obtained in previous works using multiplexed HDR platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], and additionally by the increased KI rates (up to 58%) achieved in this study when only one AAV donor vector carrying the shorter coIL7RA cDNA cassette was employed to edit HSPCs. Overall, the evidence suggests that by further counteracting gene editing- and AAV-related toxicities (e.g. by reducing the MOI used for AAV transduction, by inhibiting DNA Damage Repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] or by optimising HSPC culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]), we could further improve our overall KI rates <italic>in vitro</italic> to ensure engraftment of corrected IL7R-SCID HSPCs at therapeutically beneficial levels <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P33">As the hallmark of IL7R-SCID is the immunodeficiency caused by an IL7R-dependent T-lymphocyte developmental block, we sought to understand if our gene editing platform could restore HSPCs’ ability to give rise to mature T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, by taking advantage of the ATO system. The IL7RA-KO ATO model successfully recapitulated the block in thymopoiesis and absence of mature T cells seen in IL7R-SCID patients. The observation of diminished cell populations arising from differentiating KO<sup>-/-</sup> HSPCs from the pro-T stage onwards agrees with previous works showing that abrogation of IL7R function causes blocks at the pro-T2/DN2 stage of thymopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], as thymocyte survival becomes reliant on IL-7-dependent BCL-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Some studies reported that this block occurs at the pre-T/DN3 stage instead, indicating there may be some variability between ATO and mouse studies, though there is broad agreement in the literature that IL7R-deficient development cannot proceed to the DP stage, as also shown by our data. On the other hand, coIL7RA-KI ATOs showed the successful overcoming of the above-mentioned developmental block when IL7R expression is reinstated, with cell frequencies detected at every developmental stage tested being comparable to WT ATOs in both mono- and bi-allelic KI conditions. Importantly, we demonstrated that IL7R expression is tightly regulated during lymphopoiesis in the ATO system, with correct down-regulation of the protein expression at the intermediate EDP/DP stages followed by its reintegration in mature TCR<sup>+</sup> TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> cells, highlighting the indisputable advantage of our gene editing strategy that relies on endogenous regulatory regions for gene expression. When checking the frequency of cells expressing IL7R upon gene editing and T cell differentiation, we observed an average of 65% IL7R<sup>+</sup> cells (as a fraction of WT IL7R<sup>+</sup> cells) in both monoallelic and biallelic KI samples at both the Pre-T and mature T cell stages analysed, exhibiting an MFI equivalent to that detected in T cells derived from WT HSPCs. The fact that we do not see an increase in IL7R expression going from monoallelic to biallelic cDNA KI suggests that there may be a maximum threshold of protein expression that can be achieved with our system, or that the populations analysed by FACS using established panels of markers contain heterogeneous population of T cells at different developmental stages and thus with different IL7R expressing levels when pushed to differentiate in the ATO system. The final, intriguing possibility is that intronless coIL7RA cDNA used in our KI strategy lacks important regulatory elements that limit transgene expression when placed under its endogenous promoter and enhancer. A previous Cas9–AAV6 gene editing approach for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease showed undetectable transgene expression using an intronless exon 1–13 cDNA, but retention of intron 1 by downstream integration of an exon 2–13 cDNA was necessary and sufficient for physiological gene expression, presumably due to the presence of key intron-encoded regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Intronic IL7R-SCID-associated mutations have been reported as causing splicing aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], but in light of Sweeney et al.’s work they may also have unexplored regulatory significance. Future work could include bioinformatic assessment of putative regulatory regions in the IL7R introns, generation of cDNA constructs incorporating the minimal critical sequences and reassessment of KI cell function and HDR rates with the enlarged construct size. Inclusion of the ∼600-bp woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) could also be an effective potential strategy for improving cDNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Addition of such sequences in the donor vector may however increase the size of the integrant and therefore be detrimental to the rates of targeted integration of the therapeutic cassette. Nevertheless, as heterozygous parents of SCID patients have functional immune systems, an IL7R protein expression of at least 50% of WT levels is thought be sufficient to rescue the disease phenotype, thus validating the efficacy of our gene editing platform in its current design. Moreover, the strong selective advantage of IL7R-corrected cells over deficient ones in a SCID setting may lead to eradication of the disease even when infusing HSPCs with much lower correction rates and protein expression levels than those achieved here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Additionally, the lack of an increase in protein expression in biallelic versus monoallelic KI cells and relative to WT cells does imply that coIL7RA integration does not predispose T cells to overexpression of IL7R, an important safety aspects giving that IL7R overexpression associated with clonal dominance and thymocyte lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While a limitation of this study is that it mostly relies on an <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of the platform, it suggests that our gene-editing strategy successfully rescues thymopoiesis through IL7R expression reconstitution when applied to primary human HSPCs and has the potential to perform similarly when assessed in immunodeficient mouse models and IL7R-SCID clinical trials using patients-derived cells.</p><p id="P34">CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted integration through HDR provides a potentially safer strategy of gene correction than viral gene therapy, as it mitigates the risk of oncogenic transformation and genotoxicity associated with the use of viral vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. While the safety of engineered nucleases for therapeutic purposes is still under investigation, with indels generation at off-target sites being a potential threat to their safe clinical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], we demonstrated absence of non-specific targeting of our gRNA and of major chromosomal rearrangements upon DNA cutting, using biased and unbiased detection tools. Indeed, deep-sequencing of 20 putative off-target sites in HSPCs detected through either GUIDE-seq or a sequence similarity prediction algorithm returned no significant modifications at those sites when our optimized CRISPR/Cas9 reagents were used.
