RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RBM20, an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing non-productive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>neural development</kwd><kwd>cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neurons exhibit complex transcriptional programs that instruct the specification of functionally distinct neuronal cell types. Functional and anatomical properties of neurons emerge during development. However, the molecular underpinnings that define cell type-specific properties are only beginning to be elucidated. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as key regulators of neuronal function through modification of mRNA processing, localization, stability, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ule &amp; Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Babitzke <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Vuong <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mauger &amp; Scheiffele, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Holt <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ule &amp; Blencowe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gomez <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Moreover, RBP dysfunction is a significant contributor to pathologies, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ling <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lopez Soto <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gebauer <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schieweck <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Here, we discovered an unexpected neuronal function for the SR-related protein, RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20). Thus far, RBM20 was considered to be muscle-specific and to represent a key alternative splicing regulator in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in the <italic>RBM20</italic> gene are linked to an aggressive form of dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brauch <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, RBM20 protein controls alternative exon usage of transcripts encoding key sarcomere components (Titin and Tropomyosin) and proteins involved in calcium signaling, such as CAMK2D and the α1 subunit of the L-type voltage gated calcium channel (CACNA1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). RBM20 contains an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain, two zinc finger motifs, and an extended arginine/serine-rich region. This domain organization is shared with the paralogues Matrin-3 (MATR3) and ZNF638 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and is similar to FUS and TDP43, two RNA/DNA binding proteins that regulate various steps of RNA metabolism. Comprehensive RBM20 protein-RNA interaction maps have been defined for cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Briganti <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, RBM20 expression and function in the brain, are unknown. Considering its highly selective expression in specific cell populations and the critical roles in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that neuronal RBM20 controls key steps of RNA metabolism and contributes to the regulation of neuronal gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RBM20 is selectively expressed in specific GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons</title><p id="P3">To discover regulators of neuronal cell type-specific transcriptomes, we analyzed a neuronal gene expression dataset covering cortical pyramidal cells and the major GABAergic interneuron populations of the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Furlanis <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). We generated a hand-curated list of 234 potential RBPs, selected based on the presence of at least one predicted RRM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Transcripts for 182 of these RRM proteins were significantly expressed in mouse cortical neurons. While some (such as <italic>Eif3g, Hnrnpl</italic>) were broadly detected across all neuronal populations, others were differentially expressed in specific neuron classes. Thus, <italic>Rbm38</italic> was almost exclusively expressed in VIP<sup>+</sup> (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive) interneurons and <italic>Ppargc1a and Rbm20</italic> in parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, indicating that they may play an important role in cell type-specific gene regulation. Identification of <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression in the brain was surprising considering that the RBM20 protein was thought to be muscle-specific. Thus, we focused our further studies on probing potential functions of RBM20 in the mouse brain.</p><p id="P4">To validate the neuronal expression, we investigated <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA distribution in the mouse neocortex by RNA fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FiSH). This analysis confirmed significant expression of <italic>Rbm20</italic> in PV<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B-D</xref>). Moreover, we detected <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA in somatostatin-positive (SST<sup>+</sup>) interneurons of the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B - D</xref>). A survey of open-source datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sjostedt <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) revealed that <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA expression in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons is evolutionary conserved in human. To examine RBM20 at the protein level, we raised polyclonal antibodies and confirmed RBM20 expression in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons of the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). The parvalbumin-negative RBM20<sup>+</sup> cells most likely represent somatostatin<sup>+</sup>-interneurons which also express significant levels of Rbm20 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1C-D</xref>). Notably, these experiments also uncovered neuronal RBM20 expression outside of the neocortex, with particularly high protein levels in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B,D, and E</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1E</xref> for comparison to protein expression in the heart and Fig.S5A,B for antibody validation in immunostaining). In the olfactory bulb, RBM20 was restricted to glutamatergic cells in the mitral cell layer (MCL) and glomerular layer (GL) as opposed to the expression in GABAergic populations in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Genetic marking and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for markers <italic>Vglut2</italic> and <italic>Tbr2</italic> confirmed the glutamatergic neuron expression of <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA in tufted and mitral cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A-C</xref>), with only very low levels in a small number of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref>). Similarly, we detected RBM20 protein in mitral cells of newborn mice (genetically marked with <italic>Tbx</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>::Ai9</italic><sup><italic>tdTOM</italic></sup>), suggesting that its expression is initiated during development and continues into the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neuronal RBM20 binds distal intronic regions of mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins</title><p id="P5">In cardiomyocytes, RBM20 acts as an alternative splicing regulator that gates exon inclusion by binding to exon-proximal intronic splicing silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dauksaite &amp; Gotthardt, 2018</xref>). Within the nucleus, RBM20 localizes to foci in close proximity to <italic>Titin</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) and has been proposed to form “splicing factories”, sites for coordinated processing of mRNAs derived from multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bertero <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). By contrast, neuronal RBM20 did not concentrate in nuclear foci but instead, was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This difference in the sub-nuclear localization likely arises from the lack of <italic>Titin</italic> and/or other similarly abundant mRNA targets in neuronal cells. To contrast neuronal and cardiomyocyte RNA targets, we mapped transcripts directly bound by RBM20 in the olfactory bulb and in the heart using cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ule <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>). Our RBM20 antibodies lacked sufficient affinity for immunoprecipitation. Thus, we generated a <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>HA</italic></sup> knock-in mouse line where the endogenous RBM20 protein is tagged with a Histidine-Biotin acceptor peptide and a triple HA-epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A and B</xref>). Introduction of this tag did not alter overall RBM20 protein levels or expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">RBM20 CLIP-seq analysis on heart and olfactory bulb tissues from P35-P40 <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>HA</italic></sup> knock-in mice identified significant peaks in 956 and 2707 unique transcripts, respectively. Recovery of protein-RNA adducts was UV-crosslinking dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig.S4A,B</xref>) and CLIP tags obtained in biological replicates were highly correlated (two replicates for heart and three for olfactory bulb, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4C and D-F</xref>). In both tissues, the majority of the identified RBM20 CLIP peaks mapped to introns (80% in the heart and 94% in the olfactory bulb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Only a low fraction of peaks was identified in the 3’ untranslated region (11% in the heart and 1% in the olfactory bulb) and coding regions (7% in the heart and 3% in the olfactory bulb). RBM20 targets detected in the heart recapitulated all major target mRNAs identified in previous studies, including <italic>Ttn, Tpm, Pdlim5, Scn5a, Camk2d, Cacna1c, Cacna1d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fenix <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In heart and olfactory bulb, approximately 90% of the intronic RBM20 binding sites localized to distal regions (&gt; 500 bp from splice site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The previously reported UCUU motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Upadhyay &amp; Mackereth, 2020</xref>) was significantly enriched at cross-link-induced truncation sites (CITS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4G</xref>) and <italic>de novo</italic> binding motif enrichment analysis identified a corresponding U-rich motif at RBM20 bound sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4H</xref>).</p><p id="P7">When directly comparing heart and olfactory bulb CLIP-seq datasets, we found transcripts from 363 genes that were commonly bound by RBM20 in both tissues. Other transcripts like <italic>Ttn</italic> are recovered as RBM20-bound only in one of the two tissues due to tissue-specific expression of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Camk2d</italic> and <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, two important targets of RBM20 alternative splicing regulation in the heart, were identified as RBM20-bound in the olfactory bulb, however, binding sites mapped to different introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, and see TableS1). Finally, there was a sizable portion of pre-mRNAs (from 2721 genes) commonly expressed in both heart and olfactory bulb but selectively recovered as RBM20-bound in only one of the two tissues (539 genes in the heart and 2182 in the olfactory bulb). This suggests that RBM20 binds to target mRNAs in a tissue-specific manner. A tissue-specific function of RBM20 was further supported by gene ontology (GO) analysis. RBM20 target mRNAs in the heart showed enrichment for terms of muscle fiber components (M-band, Z-disc, T-tubule, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). By contrast, target genes in the olfactory bulb showed enrichment for terms related to pre- and postsynaptic structures, ion channels, and cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S2</xref>). These include gephyrin (<italic>Gphn</italic>), a major scaffolding protein of GABAergic synapses, the adhesion molecule Kirrel3, and Downs Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule-like 1 (<italic>Dscaml1</italic>). This suggests that neuronal RBM20 plays a role in the regulation of synapse-related mRNA transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Neuronal RBM20 is required for normal expression of long pre-mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins</title><p id="P8">To investigate the impact of RBM20 on the neuronal transcriptome, we performed loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Rbm20</italic> global and conditional knock-out mice. <italic>Rbm20</italic> was conditionally inactivated selectively in either parvalbumin-positive interneurons (<italic>Pvalb</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>::Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>, referred to as “<italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔPV</italic></sup>”) or glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Vglut2</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup><italic>::Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>, referred to as “<italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔVglut2</italic></sup>”). In global <italic>Rbm20</italic> knock-out mice, RBM20 immune-reactivity was abolished in the olfactory bulb and cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> for western blots). Similarly, in the conditional knockout mice we observed a loss of RBM20 immune-reactivity in the respective cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A and B</xref>). Importantly, neuronal cell types were normally specified in <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔVglut2</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5C-F</xref>). We then applied a Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification protocol (RiboTRAP) optimized for small tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Heiman <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sanz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Di Bartolomei &amp; Scheiffele, 2022</xref>) to uncover the impact of RBM20 loss-of-function on the neuronal transcriptome. Isolations were performed for <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔPV</italic></sup> and <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔVglut2</italic></sup> conditional knock-out and matching <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> mice (postnatal day 35-40). For quality control, we confirmed appropriate enrichment and de-enrichment of cell type-specific markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6A, B</xref>). Subsequently, we assessed the transcriptomes by deep RNA sequencing (4-5 replicates per condition, male and female mice, paired-end, 150 □base pair reads, &gt;80 million reads per replicate, see TableS3 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6C - F</xref> for details). To identify genes with altered expression in <italic>Rbm20</italic> conditional knock-out mice we used DESEQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Love <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Using this approach, we did not identify significant differences in the overall transcriptome of <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔPV</italic></sup> PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Table S4</xref>). However, in the olfactory bulb glutamatergic cells isolated from Rbm20<sup><italic>ΔVglut2</italic></sup> mice we identified de-regulation of 409 genes (FC ≥ 1.5, adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). 256 of these genes showed decreased expression in the conditional knockout mice as opposed to transcripts from 153 transcripts that were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the heart, RBM20 is considered a major regulator of alternative splicing. Thus, we quantified shifts in alternative exon usage upon <italic>Rbm20</italic> loss-of-function. We identified 859 differentially regulated alternative exons in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and 1924 exons in the <italic>Vglut2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> population in the olfactory bulb (FC in splicing index ≥ 1.5, p-value ≤ 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Table S5</xref>). The functions of the gene products with alternative splicing de-regulation were diverse and the only significantly enriched gene ontology term for genes with de-regulated exons was “mitochondrial protein-containing complexes” (p-value = 0.0003, 100 genes identified) for the olfactory bulb (<italic>Vglut2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>) population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Table S6</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To uncover transcript isoforms directly regulated by RBM20, we probed the intersection of the RBM20 binding sites identified by CLIP and alternative exon expression in the <italic>Vglut2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell population. Of the 1924 exons with differential incorporation in <italic>Rbm20</italic><sup><italic>ΔVglut2</italic></sup> cells, there were 659 exons with at least one significant RBM20 CLIP peak mapping to the corresponding gene. This frequency was higher than expected for a random distribution of CLIP peaks over all genes expressed in the sample (p = 5.2 * 10<sup>-8</sup>, hypergeometric distribution test for enrichment analysis). Interestingly, the vast majority of CLIP peaks were distant (&gt;10kb) from differentially expressed exons. This applied regardless of the type of alternative exon feature (alternative last exon, alternative transcription start sites, cassette exons or complex alternative splicing events). Thus, we identified only 1 differentially regulated cassette exon with a proximal RBM20 binding event (&lt; 500bp from the regulated exon) in the gene <italic>Arhgef1</italic>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). This suggests that suppression of alternative exons through proximal intronic splicing silencer elements is unlikely to be the primary essential function of neuronal RBM20.</p><p id="P10">Overall, RBM20 binding sites identified by CLIP distributed throughout the entire length of introns and did not exhibit a particular concentration at exon-intron boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). When examining the intersection of differential gene expression and CLIP data, we observed that 129 of the 256 down-regulated transcripts contained CLIP peaks (50.4%) whereas only 7 of the 153 up-regulated transcripts were bound by RBM20 (4.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This suggests that RBM20 loss-of-function in neuronal cells results in the loss of mRNAs whereas the observed elevation of selective transcripts is likely to be an indirect, compensatory response. This notion is further supported by the distinct gene ontologies of the de-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated genes displayed a significant enrichment in GO terms related to synaptic components and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Table S6</xref>). By contrast, for the up-regulated genes, there was a pronounced enrichment in mitochondrial components and ribosome composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Table S6</xref>).</p><p id="P11">TDP-43 and MATR3, two proteins with similar domain organization to RBM20, regulate target mRNAs by suppressing aberrant splicing into cryptic exons, a phenotype most significant for genes with long introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Polymenidou <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ling <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Attig <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).

Importantly, mean intron length was substantially larger for down-regulated transcripts when compared to all detected genes or to up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). This difference was amplified when selectively examining introns of down-regulated genes with CLIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F and G</xref>). Finally, introns bound by RBM20 were significantly longer than expected by chance as assessed with a permutation test. Random regions with the same properties as RBM20 CLIP peak regions were generated on introns from genes expressed in our Ribo-TRAP dataset (see methods). This resulted in a mean expected intron size of 41.5 kb which is substantially smaller than the mean size of RBM20-bound introns (59.0 kb; p-value &lt; 0.0002). Thus, long neuronal mRNAs are preferentially bound by RBM20 and particularly sensitive to loss of neuronal RBM20 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">Our work establishes an unexpected function for RBM20 in neuronal RNA metabolism. We identified RBM20 expression in two specific neuronal populations in the mouse brain. Interestingly, these two populations are derived from highly divergent lineages: glutamatergic neurons of the olfactory bulb from the rostral telencephalon and PV<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons in the somatosensory cortex which arise from the medial ganglionic eminence of the subcortical telencephalon. Genetic deletion of RBM20 had only a modest impact on gene expression and transcript isoforms in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons but was associated with substantial alterations in glutamatergic cells of the olfactory bulb. This might be due to the higher expression of RBM20 in mitral and tufted cells as compared to PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Moreover, PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons express high levels of the RBM20 paralogue MATR3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>) which may have overlapping functions.</p><p id="P13">In cardiomyocytes, several direct targets of RBM20-dependent alternative splicing regulation contain intronic RBM20 binding sites in close proximity to regulated exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In neuronal cells, we did not observe a similar regulation of proximal exons by RBM20.
