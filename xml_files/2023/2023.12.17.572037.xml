The cross-generational effects of early life stress have been modeled in mice and demonstrated to be associated with epigenetic factors in the germline. While stress is known to affect gut microbial features, whether its effects can persist across life and be passed to the progeny is not well defined. Here we show that early postnatal stress in mice shifts the fecal microbial composition (binary Jaccard index) throughout life. Further effects on fecal microbial composition and structure (weighted Jaccard index) are detected in the progeny across two generations. These effects are not accompanied by changes in bacterial metabolites and related predicted metabolic pathways in any generation. These results suggest that changes in the fecal microbial community induced by early life traumatic stress can be perpetuated from exposed parent to the offspring.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">It has long been established, that early life is a critical developmental window in which individuals are primed for life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Traumatic stress in early life is one of the major causes of mental and physical diseases, particularly psychiatric disorders. These diseases often not only affect individuals directly exposed to early life stress but also sometimes their offspring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Alterations in signaling pathways <italic>via</italic> the gut-brain axis have been suggested to contribute to the consequences of stress exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Signaling <italic>via</italic> gut-brain axis is thought to occur by bacterially produced metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and γ-aminobutyric acid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Since gastrointestinal tract maturation and the establishment of the gut microbiota occur in parallel with brain development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, alterations in the gut microbiome may contribute to brain dysfunctions later in life. Experiments with germ free mice have indeed suggested the involvement of gut microbes in anxiety like behavior and behavioral despair induced by early life stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Early life stress has been shown to induce distinct gut microbial alterations in rodent models including the decrease of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> species and increase in <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species. Though, observed changes are heterogenous and differ substantially between studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Similar observations exist in humans, though observed stress effects on the gut microbiota remain correlative and cannot be distinguished from confounding effects such as diet and lifestyle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Previous research has mainly focused on changes in gut microbial composition rather than changes in function. In the few available human studies referring to gut microbial metabolic changes associated with early life stress, socioeconomic risk exposure explained a significant amount of the functional gut microbial diversity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and a decrease of four gut metabolites (i.e. glutamate gamma-methyl ester, 5-oxoproline, malate, and urate) was observed when comparing exposed with non-exposed individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Given the effects of early life stress on brain functions and health in the progeny, it is conceivable that early life stress induced alterations in the gut microbial community can also affect the offspring. Today, a potential intergenerational effect of early life stress on the gut microbiota has not been carefully examined.</p><p id="P5">The mouse model of unpredictable maternal separation combined with unpredictable maternal stress (MSUS) distinguishes itself from other rodent models of stress by applying unpredictability as traumatic factor and by combining stress of mothers and of pups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This model has been extensively characterized and shown to induce behavioral, metabolic and physiological alterations across generations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Epigenetic factors in the germline have been proposed as mediators of transmission and expression of phenotypes, and sperm RNA was causally demonstrated to be a vehicle of transmission between exposed father and offspring and grand-offspring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Although, the MSUS paradigm has been shown to induce visceral sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, the effects of early life stress on the gut microbial community across generations has not been evaluated before.

These observations suggest that early life stress exposure alters host factors, which modulate gut microbes, which then themselves signals back to the host exhibiting phenotypic changes. This notion could be present in F2 and F3 MSUS mice explaining observed gut microbial changes without directly experiencing early life traumatic stress beforehand. One candidate of communication between host and gut microbes independent of genetic background, might be non-coding RNAs. Long non-coding RNA in gut tissue has been shown to substantially differ between conventionalized and different gnotobiotic mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, small non-coding RNA such as microRNA are being released by intestinal epithelial cells and have been shown to be common in the gut lumen, where they may enter gut microbes and modulate gene expression and bacterial growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Conversely, gut microbes are thought to modulate intestinal epithelial microRNA expression most likely <italic>via</italic> excreted metabolites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, luminal microRNA has been suggested as a marker for host-microbiota homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, whether these non-coding RNAs are truly involved in the transgenerational effect on gut microbial community observed in the MSUS model remains highly speculative and would need to be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="P31">Though, the present study exhibits various strength, including relatively large sample size, monitoring of fecal microbial changes over time, and addressing the coprophagous nature of rodents (i.e. cage effect) it also has limitations. Fecal samples only serve as a proxy of the gut microbial community and functionality in the gastrointestinal tract. Akin to humans, pH and the gut microbial community varies along the gastrointestinal tract of mice and is thus considerably different from fecal samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, a previous study has illustrated that the murine colon mucosa-associated and lumen microbial community are differentially affected by stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, observations in the present study may not be directly extrapolated to all niches of the gastrointestinal tract. Biological relevance of observed microbial changes needs to be addressed in future studies. Direct cecal bacterial metabolite quantification was limited to one timepoint each in F1 and F2. In addition, bacterial metabolic pathway prediction <italic>via</italic> PICRUSt2 has several restrictions, especially for non-human samples. A recent study revealed that PICRUSt2 performs substantially worse for murine compared to human samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, further bias is introduced due to the inability to detect strain specific functionality and the strong dependency on reference genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The relatively large NSTI values observed in the present study, which are approximately 3.5-fold higher than values observed for the Human Microbiome Project <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, suggest a lack of suitable sequences in the reference space. Together with the notion, that murine gut bacterial species are only in the process of being annotated and characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, results need to be interpreted with caution. High-resolution techniques (i.e. metabolomics, shotgun metagenomics, or RNA sequencing) are warranted to address potential functional changes in gut microbiota between MSUS and controls over different generations.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, the MSUS paradigm not only changes the fecal microbial community in directly exposed mice but also in their offspring. Further well-designed studies are warranted to validate and extend on present results, using high-resolution techniques and addressing host factors responsible for gut microbial modulation. Though, our distance based analyses (based on binary and weighted Jaccard index) suggested that the fecal microbial community in F2 mice were not directly linked to the father’s microbiota. Further carefully designed experiments are warranted to entirely omit potential direct transmission of gut microbes from parents to offspring. For instance, assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination could be used to avoid interactions between parents and eliminate related social confounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Previous research has shown that early life stress modulates the murine gut microbial community in a sex-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Whether changes in gut microbial features observed in the present study are also detectable in matrilines remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S18"><title>Mouse husbandry and MSUS paradigm</title><p id="P33">Ethical approval was given by the Swiss cantonal regulations for animal experimentation under license numbers ZH057/15 and ZH083/18.
