Ancient genomics is a promising tool to detect recent introgression and disentangle it from ancient polymorphisms. Alpine ibex <italic>(Capra ibex)</italic>, a wild goat species native to the European Alps, faced near-extinction two centuries ago, but has recovered thanks to successful restoration programs. Previously, signals of introgression from the domestic goat <italic>(Capra aegagrus hircus)</italic> into the Alpine ibex genome were found at the major histocompatibility complex. This introgression was suggested to potentially be adaptive since it introduced new diversity at a gene locus important for immunity. But no genome-wide analyses of introgression have been performed to confirm the potential relevance of immune loci.</p><p id="P2">Here we take advantage of two ancient whole genomes of Alpine ibex combined with 29 modern Alpine ibex genomes and 31 genomes representing six related Capra species to investigate genome-wide patterns of introgression. Our complementary analysis of putatively introgressed haplotypes and demographic modelling suggests 2.3% recent domestic goat ancestry among wild Alpine ibex. The introgression was estimated to have happened during the last 300 years coinciding with the time when the species had very small population size. Further analysis suggested an enrichment of immune-related genes, where the adaptive value of alternative alleles may give individuals with otherwise depleted genetic diversity a selective advantage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anthropogenic hybridisation</kwd><kwd>introgression</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>ancient genomics</kwd><kwd>Alpine ibex</kwd><kwd>Domestic goat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The transmission of adaptive genetic variation is referred to as adaptive introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hedrick, 2013</xref>). The altitude adaptation in Tibetans was reported to be the result of introgression from archaic humans into modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Huerta-Sánchez <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Another famous example of adaptive introgression was described in mice, where resistance to rodent poison was transferred from the Algerian mouse <italic>(Mus spretus)</italic> to the European house mouse <italic>(Mus musculus domesticus)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Song <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, introgression was repeatedly shown in genes related to the immune system. Due to pathogen-mediated balancing selection loci of the immune system are usually highly polymorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Radwan <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Hence, receiving variation from a related species may be favorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wegner and Eizaguirre, 2012</xref>). For example, as modern humans migrated out of Africa, they encountered new environments and locally adapted archaic humans. Accordingly, it was suggested that the bottlenecked migrating human population restored genetic diversity at immune loci after admixture with archaic populations allowing them to adapt to the newly encountered pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abi-Rached <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Quach <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Enard and Petrov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gouy, Excoffier and Nielsen, 2020</xref>). Exposure to the same environment and hence pathogens may also be involved in the adaptive effect of gene flow at immune-related genes between wild and domestic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barbato <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Howard-McCombe <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). However, the fact that immune-relevant loci are expected to be under balancing selection, also means that some of the variation at those loci is expected to be ancestral polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>). Ancient genomic data is a promising tool to disentangle ancient polymorphisms (or ancient introgression) from recent introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Díez-del-Molino <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Alpine ibex, a wild goat species living in high altitude terrain of the European Alps, have recovered after near-extinction, which happened 200 years ago, and are known to hybridize with the closely related domestic goat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Couturier, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Giacometti and Ratti, 2003</xref>). During the captive breeding enabling their recovery, Alpine ibex were crossed with domestic goats <italic>(Capra aegagrus hircus)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Giacometti and Ratti, 2003</xref>). Hybrids between the two species are viable and fertile, but their reintroduction was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Couturier, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Giacometti and Ratti, 2003</xref>). The failure to reproduce was attributed to the fact that domestic goats and hybrids give birth earlier in the year than Alpine ibex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bächler, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Couturier, 1962</xref>). Nevertheless, hybridization between these species has also been observed in the wild. Feral goats and (suspected) hybrids discovered in the wild are sometimes culled due to the fear of negative effects on the wild population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Moroni <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, most Alpine countries do not have clear management regulations in place for dealing with feral goats and hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Moroni <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). A recent survey of 70 populations across the Alps discovered locally very high numbers of suspected hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Moroni <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), many of which have in the meantime been genetically confirmed to be hybrids (personal communication Noel Zehnder).</p><p id="P5">A previous study reported introgression from domestic goat into Alpine ibex at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene region important for immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). It was suggested that this goat allele may have adaptive effects, since it was found at relatively high frequency in certain populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The observation of locally high levels of ongoing hybridisation from a domestic species, combined with potential signals of adaptive introgression, calls for a more in-depth and genome-wide analyses of introgression in Alpine ibex. If the previously reported introgression at the MHC was indeed adaptive, other immune-relevant genes would be expected to show signals of introgression from domestic goat to Alpine ibex. But also potential negative consequences of introgression from a domesticated species are expected and therefore important to be examined. Neither the genome-wide extent of introgression nor the timing(s) of past hybridization event(s) are currently known. It has been hypothesized that the previously described introgression event at the DRB gene happened during the near-extinction of the Alpine ibex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, given the shared habitat over centuries, hybridisation and introgression may have already been frequent earlier on.</p><p id="P6">A major challenge for the study of genome-wide patterns of introgression is to disentangle signals of introgression from signals of ancient polymorphisms, in particular at loci known to be under balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>). As is the case of many other species facing hybridization during or right after a near-extinction event, there are no known non-introgressed Alpine ibex populations, a requirement for many tools used to detect introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sankararaman, 2020</xref>). A further challenge to the analysis of introgression among hybridizing species is to disentangle ancient from recent gene flow. Ancient gene flow between ibex species has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pidancier <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To alleviate these difficulties, we here combined two ancient whole genome sequences with 29 available modern whole genome sequences of Alpine ibex and 31 whole genomes representing related <italic>Capra</italic> species to analyze genome-wide patterns of recent introgression.

Modern Alpine ibex <italic>(Capra ibex)</italic> were represented by 29 samples from eight Swiss populations and the source of all current Alpine ibex, the Gran Paradiso population in Italy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The other Capra species were represented by four Iberian <italic>(Capra pyrenaica)</italic>, two Nubian <italic>(Capra nubiana)</italic> and two Siberian ibex <italic>(Capra sibirica)</italic>, one Markhor <italic>(Capra falconeri)</italic>, six Bezoar <italic>(Capra aegagrus)</italic> and 16 domestic goat individuals <italic>(Capra aegagrus hircus)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Different breeds of domestic goat individuals were included to maximize the genetic diversity and included European, African and Middle Eastern breeds. Additionally, five sheep samples (two <italic>Ovis aries</italic>, one <italic>O. orientalis</italic>, one <italic>O. vignei</italic>, one <italic>O. canadensis)</italic> were included as the outgroup (from here onwards referred to as sheep). One of the two ancient Alpine ibex samples was over 300 years old (1695 CE, based on historical record) and originated from the southern part of Switzerland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), the second ancient Alpine ibex sample was over 6500 years old (6590±30BP, based on C14, ETH-62929) and was discovered in a cave in central Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Robin <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The genomic data of the domestic goat, Bezoar and sheep are available through the NextSeq Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextgen.epfl.ch">https://nextgen.epfl.ch</ext-link>).

Therefore, no additional post-mortem assessment was performed for the ancient samples (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Robin et al. [2022]</xref> for further detail). The reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bolger <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and subsequently mapped with bwa-mem v0.7.17 (Li, 2013) to the domestic goat reference genome (ARS1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bickhart <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).

HaplotypeCaller and Genotype GVCF v4.0.8.0 (GATK) were used for the genotype calling and low-quality SNPs were removed with VariantFiltration of GATK. The filter criteria for VariantFiltration were as follows: QD &lt;2.0, FS &gt; 40.0, SOR &gt; 5.0, MQ &lt; 20.0, -3.0 &gt; MQRankSum &gt; 3.0, -3.0 &gt; ReadPosRankSum &gt; 3.0 and AN &lt; 46 (corresponding to 80% of all Alpine ibex individuals in the dataset). We only considered autosomal SNPs (chromosomes 1-29), which had a minor allele count of 1. The obtained autosomal data were further filtered with VCFtools v0.1.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Danecek <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The settings were as follows: Max-missing was set to 0.9, which only retains SNPs with a maximum of 10% missing data and thinning to a minimal among-SNP distance of 100 bp was implemented using the option --thin 100. Lastly, sites with more than two alleles were discarded (max-alleles 2). This left a final data set consisting of 19,880,663 SNPs across all species.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Population structure</title><p id="P9">For a first exploration of the species relationships, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on maximum likelihood using RAxML v8.2.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>).

The F<sub>3</sub> statistic is used either for estimating shared genetic drift between two populations compared to an outgroup or to test whether a population is a mixture between two other populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Patterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Here, we applied F<sub>3</sub> statistics for the second purpose. More precisely, we tested whether Alpine ibex are identified as a mixture between domestic goat and another species. A statistically significant negative F<sub>3</sub> statistic is evidence of admixture. However, a non-significant negative value does not exclude admixture as a possibility. The F<sub>4</sub> statistic identifies gene flow between populations by examining whether the SNP allele frequency is consistent with an unrooted phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Patterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We calculated the F<sub>4</sub> statistic for modern Alpine ibex (A), against ancient specimen or Siberian ibex (B), Bezoar or domestic goat (C) and domestic sheep as the outgroup (D, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A statistically significant deviation from zero indicates gene flow. In a next step, to estimate the goat ancestry among modern Alpine ibex, the F<sub>4</sub>-ratio statistic was calculated by varying the sister taxa of the modern Alpine ibex. Accordingly, the F<sub>4</sub>-ratio statistic took the following form: α = (F<sub>4</sub>(Bezoar, Sheep; modern Ibex, sister taxa))/(F<sub>4</sub>(Bezoar, Sheep; domestic goat, sister taxa)), where the sister taxa was one of the following groups/species: the ancient specimens, the Iberian ibex, Nubian ibex or Siberian ibex (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Demographic modelling for inference of genome-wide gene flow</title><p id="P13">To further investigate the level of potential gene flow between species, we performed demographic modelling using <italic>fastsimcoal2</italic> v2.7.0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Excoffier <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">2021</xref>). <italic>fastsimcoal2</italic> uses site frequency spectra (SFS) to infer demographic parameters via a continuous-time coalescent model.

ANGSD’s realSFS was used to convert the saf.idx file into the SFS, which was reformatted into <italic>fastsimcoal2</italic> input format using a custom-made script. For each estimated parameter, a predefined range was given, where the lower range limit is an absolute minimum, but the upper range limit is only used to randomly choose an initial value, hence there is no upper limit. The model was set up to estimate long-term effective population sizes for Bezoar (predefined range 2,000 to 2,000,000), domestic goat (predefined range 2,000 to 2,000,000), ghost domestic goat (representing non-sampled goat variation, predefined range 200 to 200,000), modern and ancient Alpine ibex (predefined range 40 to 20,000 and 200 to 2,000,000, respectively). Note that a ghost goat population was introduced because the goat source population is unknown. The model also estimated the time of divergence (informed by previous studies) between the Bezoar and ancient Alpine ibex (predefined range 80,000 to 250,000 generations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Manceau <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), Bezoar and domestic goat (predefined range 626 to 45,000 generations; domestication latest 5000 years ago assuming a generation time of 8 years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Luikart <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), ancient and modern Alpine ibex (predefined range 112 to 1,600 generations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pidancier <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Ureña <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) and domestic goat and ghost domestic goat (predefined range 101 to 625 generations). Additionally, the model also estimated the rate and timing of gene flow between the ghost domestic goat and modern Alpine ibex. The predefined range of the long-term gene flow was set to 0 to 25% in both directions. Furthermore, the start of recent gene flow (predefined range 9 to 100 generations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and end of recent gene flow (predefined range 0 to 8 generations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) were added to the model. In <italic>fastsimcoal2</italic>, to estimate the frequency spectra through simulations, the data type was set to FREQ. With these input settings, we performed 100 independent simulation runs each computing the SFS for the derived alleles in the population (-d) with 200 000 simulations for each set of parameters (-n 200 000) with 50 loops of parameter estimation (-L 50) by maximum composite likelihood (-M). All runs were ordered according to smallest AIC and highest maximum likelihood value. According to the ranking we took the mean for each parameter of the 10 best runs.

This step included the options -n1 (one simulation performed for each parameter file), -b99 (number of bootstraps performed on polymorphic sites), -s0 (output all SNPs along a DNA sequence) and -l (generating mutations according to an infinite site mutation model). As a last step, <italic>fastsimcoal2</italic> estimated the parameters based on these bootstrapped SFS with the settings: 30 loops performed to estimate the parameters (-L) by maximum composite likelihood (-M), 100 000 simulations per parameter file (-n), computing the SFS of the derived alleles for each population sample (-d).

To this end, we implemented the tool admixfrog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Peter, 2020</xref>) which compares the allele frequency at each genomic position in a target to a number of sources (here either ancient Alpine ibex or domestic goat). The total sequence length in heterozygous state ranged from around 32 Mb to 52 Mb and between 32 Mb to 42 Mb in the homozygous state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).

Additionally, alleles located on the introgressed sequence interact with the other genes. This may positively or negatively affect the individual fitness.

To investigate the potential accumulation of putatively introgressed sequences at genes with a certain biological function, gene ontology (GO) term analysis was carried out. The regions identified as introgressed by admixfrog overlapped with 496 genes across all autosomes. The detected regions were not uniformly distributed across autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The highest number of overlaps was found on chromosome 23 (over 70 overlaps, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and chromosome 15 (over 40 overlaps) while less genes overlapped with putatively introgressed regions on for instance chromosomes 14, 21 and 22. On chromosome 23, a large number of overlaps occurred with the MHC and other immune-related genes. The GO term analysis suggested a strong and highly significant enrichment for introgressed regions in the categories of response to stimulus (p &lt; 0.0001, 319 of 4625 genes), antigen processing and presentation (p &lt; 0.0001, 20 of 48 genes) and immune response (p &lt; 0.0001, 60 of 431 genes, Figure 5). Since these results are expected to be driven by the MHC complex situated on chromosome 23 (Dong et al. 2012), the same analysis was performed by excluding all MHC associated coding sequences or all immune associated coding sequences (including the terms “MHC”, “immun” or “antigen” in the annotation), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We still observed several immune-related biological processes enriched after excluding all MHC associated coding sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>), but the most significant enrichments were now for G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway (p &lt; 0.0001, 133 of 1458 genes), response to stimulus (p &gt; 0.0001, 300 of 4311 genes) and cell communication (p &gt; 0.0001, 247 or 3562 genes).</p><p id="P27">Next, we were interested in what GO terms were underrepresented among introgressed haplotypes as an indicator for gene categories putatively under negative selection if introgressed.

Theory predicts that new alleles originating from mutations or introgression are favored in genomic regions under balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Schierup <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Castric <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Targeted sequencing in allopatric and parapatric newts supports the prediction that balancing selection facilitates introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fijarczyk <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). It was therefore suggested that introgression may be an important process shaping the high variation found at the MHC, a major gene complex of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wegner and Eizaguirre, 2012</xref>) and immune-relevant loci in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Reilly <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Adaptive introgression at the MHC has indeed been suggested in a number of species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abi-Rached <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), newts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gaczorek <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gaczorek <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). The generally high genetic diversity at the MHC loci in domestic livestock was suggested to originate from intentional or accidental backcrosses with their wild ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Vilà et al., 2005</xref>). But evidence from the wild remains scarce and is still mostly based on a limited number of markers. Even less studies investigated possible adaptive introgression at immune-relevant genes in general. Evidence for adaptive introgression at immune-relevant genes comes most of all from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Quach <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Enard and Petrov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gouy and Excoffier, 2020</xref>), a study based on a SNP-chip suggested adaptive introgression at immune-relevant gene regions from mouflon to domestic sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barbato et al. 2017</xref>) and a very recent study on wildcats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Howard-McCombe <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The whole genome sequences of the modern Alpine ibex revealed clear differentiation from the domestic goat samples indicating that no early generation hybrids (e.g., F1, backcross individuals) were included in this analysis. However, the demographic model suggested low genome-wide levels (2.3%) of introgression from domestic goat into Alpine ibex. Under the assumption of neutral evolution, this level of introgression is in accordance with the main introgression event having taken place between 5 to 6 generations ago (3.1 to 1.6 percent). Assuming a generation time between 8 and 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Stüwe and Grodinsky, 1987</xref>), the main hybridization event leading to this level of introgression would have happened only 48 to 60 years ago rather than during the near extinction of Alpine ibex as was proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Yet the start of gene flow was estimated to much earlier, about 300 years ago. And the GO term analysis identified an enrichment of immune-relevant genes overlapping with the introgressed regions. The discrepancy between estimated time period and amount of introgression together with the enrichment analysis suggests that the introgressed haplotypes did not evolve neutrally but rather were preferentially retained at immune-relevant genes while potential negative selection acted in other gene regions.Our F-statistics outcomes were highly sensitive to the chosen sister group with an apparent correlation with phylogenetic relationship. If a closely related population or species was used as the sister group (i.e., ancient specimen or Iberian ibex), gene flow was suggested to be more likely between domestic goat and either of the two groups or between Alpine ibex and domestic sheep. However, for the two more distantly related species (Nubian and Siberian Ibex) relatively high proportions of domestic goat ancestry were estimated in Alpine ibex. It is worth noting that Iberian ibex also experienced a strong bottleneck in the recent past and hybrids with domestic goat have been reported repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cardoso <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). It is therefore possible that Iberian ibex received gene flow from domestic goat in the past and the Nubian and Siberian ibex received less. However, it is less straight-forward to explain the apparent admixture between ancient Alpine ibex and domestic goat except that potentially the more recent specimen of the two, dating to 1695 already received some introgression. Therefore, these results are to be interpreted with caution. Possible effects of gene flow into ancient Alpine ibex is also reflected in the estimates of effective population size for ancient Alpine ibex, which with over 200’000 were very high and more likely an effect of population structure (due to both space and time difference between the two ancient samples) and potential gene flow from related species rather than very large populations in the past. Hence, the estimate of 2.3% domestic goat ancestry in modern Alpine ibex is an estimate of recent introgression, while overall gene flow between the two species was potentially higher. The small Ne estimate for modern Alpine ibex (Ne=32) on the other hand is a likely result of the near-extinction.</p><p id="P30">Due to this history of near-extinction, Alpine ibex have a low genome-wide diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grossen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2020</xref>). Our genome-wide analysis suggesting that introgressed haplotypes are more likely retained at immune-relevant genes is in accordance with introgression potentially being beneficial at such loci. Higher MHC-diversity was indeed recently shown to correlate with higher resistance to keratoconjunctivits (an infection of the eye) in Alpine ibex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brambilla <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) and another study found an association between two immune-relevant loci (including Toll-like receptor) and the risk of brucellosis infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Quéméré <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). However, regions under balancing selection are candidates for ancient polymorphisms and disentangling signatures from introgression and ancient polymorphisms are not trivial. Our approach of using two ancient genomes as baseline alleviates this issue by focusing the analysis on recent gene flow.</p><p id="P31">We were also interested in genomic regions potentially under negative selection. We found that genes involved in metabolic processes and gene expression were underrepresented among putative introgressed haplotypes. These genes are expected to be under purifying selection. However, although introgression is likely to be disfavored under purifying selection, also the power to detect introgression is lower due to the generally low divergence in such regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Schumer <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, introgression may affect a species on a wide spectrum of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edmands, 2007</xref>). Adaptive benefits of introgression under certain selection schemes may drive the retainment of introgressed sequences as suggested by this study for immune-relevant loci. Potential positive effects of adaptive introgression and genetic rescue can increase adaptive genetic variation and for instance improve adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brauer <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) or resistance to disease (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Enard and Petrov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gouy <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Howard-McCombe <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref> and this study). However, this is context-dependent and introgression may be maladaptive in another selective environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dolgova and Lao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020</xref>). Hybridisation is a major concern and subject of debate in conservation biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Allendorf <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Quilodrán <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). It is observed with particular attention if it happens with domesticated species as for instance in wildcats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Howard-McCombe <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) or wolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Muñoz-Fuentes <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Galaverni <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Anthropogenic introgression can be a serious threat for a species potentially leading to negative fitness effects (e.g. plains bison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hedrick, 2010</xref>) up to swamping as seen in the Scottish wildcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Senn <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Howard-McCombe <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To inform the conservation management of species, a better understanding of hybridization and its consequences in the wild is required. Improved understanding of the balance between positive versus negative effects of hybridisation and how this affects the faith of introgressed gene regions in the wild (i.e., how likely introgressed gene regions will be retained over multiple generations), would be particularly informative. In the case of the Alpine ibex, the introgression is mainly localized at genes of the immune system. Thus, at least in this species, the introgression from the domestic goat into its wild, inbred relative may have had some positive effects. As previously mentioned, the outcome cannot be anticipated, due to the interplay of many factors. Hence, the common practice of quickly removing hybrids resulting from anthropogenic hybridization from the wild gene pool is the most conservative approach, even if this may represent a missed chance to increase the genetic variation of an otherwise genetically depleted species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191542-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d153aAdJbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (31003A_182343 to C.G.).</p><p>This study makes use of data generated by the NextGen Consortium (grant number 244356) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2010-2014).</p><p>The authors also acknowledge support from the Science for Life Laboratory, the National Genomics Infrastructure and UPPMAX for providing assistance in massive parallel sequencing and computational infrastructure.</p></ack><sec id="S18" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Accessibility and Benefit-Sharing</title><p id="P33">The two ancient whole genome sequences used for this project and corresponding Metadata will be deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive under the Accession nos.
