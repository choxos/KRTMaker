DSBs are mainly repaired through homologous recombination (HR) when template DNA is present and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in its absence. Additionally, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and single strand annealing (SSA) provide back-up DSBs repair pathways. However, the mechanisms controlling their use remain poorly understood. By employing a high-resolution CRISPR screen of the ubiquitin system after IR, we systematically uncover genes required for cell survival and elucidate a critical role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> in cell cycle-dependent DSB repair. We show that SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> -mediated EXO1 degradation prevents DNA end resection in mitosis, allowing MMEJ to take place. Moreover, we identify a conserved cyclin F recognition motif, distinct from the one used by other cyclins, with broad implications in cyclin specificity for cell cycle control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>double-strand breaks</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>proteasomal degradation</kwd><kwd>cyclin F</kwd><kwd>EXO1</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>ionising radiation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The maintenance of genomic integrity is a fundamental aspect of cellular homeostasis for cell survival. Among the different DNA lesions, double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a significant threat to genome stability, as they or their improper repair can lead to loss of genetic information, chromosomal rearrangements, oncogenic transformations, and cell death. To safeguard against these deleterious outcomes, cells have evolved an intricate and tightly regulated DNA damage response (DDR) network, including multiple DNA damage repair pathways. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are the major DSB repair pathways in mammalian cells. NHEJ joins the DNA ends with minimal sequence homology in an error-prone manner, while HR utilizes the sister chromatid only available in late S/G2 phases of the cell cycle as a template for error-free repair.</p><p id="P3">A key regulatory process in the DDR network is ubiquitination, a covalent and reversible post-translational modification mediated by the E1-E2-E3 cascade (ubiquitin-activating enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and ubiquitin ligase, respectively). Ubiquitination orchestrates the recruitment of DNA repair factors, signal transduction, and the temporal control of DNA repair pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, ubiquitination is also known to regulate the pathway choice between HR and NHEJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Besides these major repair pathways, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA) are considered back-up mechanisms when HR and NHEJ are compromised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast to the extensively studied HR and NHEJ pathways, our knowledge of how MMEJ and SSA are executed and regulated remains scarce; they are simply known to be error-prone and characteristically dependent on DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) and RAD52, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. HR and SSA both require exonuclease 1 (EXO1)- or DNA2-mediated long-range 5’→3’ nucleolytic degradation and the sequential generation of a 3’ single-stranded DNA overhang— a process known as the long-range DNA end resection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. As EXO1- or DNA2-mediated DNA end resection can remove several hundreds to a few thousands nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, the activities of these exonucleases need to be tightly regulated and precisely executed to avoid DNA breakage during damage repair, loss of genetic information, and, to an even worse extent, unwanted recombination due to extensive homology exposure among random genomic regions. An example of such regulation is the post-translational modification or direct inhibition of EXO1 upon DNA damage induction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. DNA structures produced by long-range end resection are known to be poor substrates for NHEJ and MMEJ machineries, indicating a possible role of DNA end resection in dictating DSB repair pathway choice. To date, various mechanisms have been reported to direct pathway choice between NHEJ and HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the role of ubiquitination in DNA end resection and in determining alternative DSB repair pathways choice is understudied.</p><p id="P4">Cyclin F is the funding member of the F-box family proteins, the characteristic F-box domains of which can interact with the SKP1-CUL1 complex so that the F-box protein can function as a substrate receptor (the direct substrate interactor) in the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligases holocomplex. Approximately 70 F-box proteins have been identified in mammal. SCF complex that utilises cyclin F as the substrate receptor is called the SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> E3 ligase. SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> was previously reported to degrade various proteins involved in cell cycle progression and in DNA damage repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Starting from a focused CRISPR screen to systematically discover E1s, E2s, and E3s that are required for cell survival after ionising radiation (IR), we identified <italic>CCNF</italic> (the gene encoding cyclin F) as a crucial determinant of cell survival after IR. The following mechanistic study revealed that SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> degrades EXO1 in the G2 and M cell cycle phases to prevent DNA hyper-resection and SSA, and promote MMEJ. Disruption of this axis either by <italic>CCNF</italic> knockout or by expression of a non-degradable R842A EXO1 mutant promotes hyper-resection and chromosome aberrations, which in turn increases IR-induced cell death. This study unravels a novel mechanism to regulate DSB back-up repair pathways in the context of cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CRISPR screen of the ubiquitin system identifies genes required for cell survival after IR</title><p id="P5">Radiotherapy by ionizing radiation (IR) is used extensively to treat cancer in both palliative and curative contexts. For some tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), radiotherapy remains the major therapeutic strategy besides surgery due to the scarcity of chemotherapy options. However, patients still suffer from dismal prognoses due to GBM cells’ fast development of radioresistance. It is, therefore, imperative to identify the major pathways conferring IR resistance so as to develop strategies to re-sensitize cancer cells to radiation. To this end, we performed an unbiased CRISPR screen on genes involved in ubiquitin conjugation for the identification of radioprotective genes in GBM cells. We tested the IR sensitivity of 7 glioblastoma-derived cell lines via colony formation assay following IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>) and identified LN229 as the most radioresistant, and therefore the best model for drop-out screens— a screen to identify genes whose depletion promotes radiosensitivity.</p><p id="P6">Cas9 was introduced into the LN229 cells using a lentiviral expression system and a clonal population was then generated to achieve a high level of Cas9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). To minimize variations caused by Cas9 expression and clonal effects, we isolated several clones and selected the one that showed no differences in cell proliferation and radio-sensitivity when compared to the LN229 parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">A commercially available library focused on the ubiquitin system was utilized in the screen. The library covers 5 E1s, 35 E2s, 531 established or putative E3s, 31 core essential genes as positive controls, and 100 non-targeting controls. Each gene was targeted with 10 sgRNA guides and we chose a fold representation of ∼750 in order to gain more resolution in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells were treated with 4 Gy IR in a single dose, which was previously found to kill around 50% of LN229 cells via colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The replicates of the screen showed significant correlation and clustering in the principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). In addition, we calculated the effect size for all guides using Cohen D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>). The score indicates a large effect size, highlighting the high sensitivity and resolution of the screen.</p><p id="P9">We first analysed the results in untreated cells, comparing cells harvested immediately after library transduction (Sample T<sub>0</sub>) to cells that survived puromycin selection (Sample Untreated). We not only identified positive control genes (core essential genes) provided in the library but also a set of essential genes specific to LN229 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate a good retrieval of essential genes.</p><p id="P10">To identify the genes required for survival after IR, we compared cells treated with 4 Gy IR to the untreated cells. A Z-ratio score was plotted using CRISPRAnalyzeR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crispr-analyzer.dkfz.de">http://crispr-analyzer.dkfz.de</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Over-representation analysis (ORA) was performed on the statistically significant genes that conferred either IR sensitivity or IR resistance (with Z-ratio &gt; 1.96 or &lt; −1.96). A significant enrichment was detected for genes participating in DNA damage and repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">It is worth noting that we identified <italic>UBE4A</italic>, <italic>RNF168</italic> and <italic>RNF8</italic> as top hits. These are all genes known to have crucial roles in mediating DNA damage responses and repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, indicating the screen could also potentially reveal hitherto uncharacterized players in these processes. We also identified <italic>UBA3</italic>, the E1 for neddylation Neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 is a potent radiosensitiser with an unknown mechanism, and our finding further supports the idea that neddylation is required in responding to and repairing DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In addition to these well-established DNA damage regulators, we also identified CUL1, the scaffolding protein of SCF complexes, and several F-box proteins, which function as substrate receptors in SCFs.</p><p id="P12">Among the F-box adaptors identified from the screen, <italic>CCNF</italic> ranks the highest, making it a good target for validation. To this end, we employed a classic colony formation assay in HeLa cells where the <italic>CCNF</italic> gene has been knocked out using CRISPR. <italic>CCNF</italic> knockout (<italic>CCNF</italic> K/O) significantly sensitised HeLa cells to IR at all doses tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We also performed straight western blotting (WB) to assess the DDR. <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O significantly upregulated the steady-state levels of the previously reported SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> substrates —RRM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and E2F1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the delivery of IR to <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells also induced upregulation of RPA32 phosphorylation at Ser4/Ser8 (a marker of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) at DSB repair sites upon activation of signalling proteins ATM and DNA-PK) and Ser33 (marker of ssDNA upon ATR activation) at steady-state levels and after IR. Moreover, the classic DSB marker γH2Ax was also upregulated in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells compared to the parental line, both at steady state and after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that loss of cyclin F could increase DNA damage at a basal level and prevent or delay the repair of damaged DNA after IR treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cyclin F interacts with EXO1 during G2 and M and after IR, facilitating its ubiquitination</title><p id="P14">To understand how cyclin F would regulate IR sensitivity and DNA damage response and repair, we established a cell line expressing cyclin F fused to TurboID (an engineered biotin ligase that conjugates biotin to proteins within tens of nanometres of its fused protein) to identify the cyclin F interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). This approach, which exploits a non-specific biotin ligase, has been used extensively to identify interacting partners of cellular proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, with improvements made to enhance specificity and efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We compared untreated cells to those treated with MLN4924 to generate a comprehensive view of all potential SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). MLN4924 helps to enrich cyclin F-substrate interactions by inhibiting the ligation of ubiquitin to substrates, which would then cause dissociation of the substrate from cyclin F. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, several proteins are significantly enriched following MLN4924 treatment, with EXO1 identified as one of the top hits.</p><p id="P15">Interaction between cyclin F and EXO1 was then validated via immunoprecipitation-western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, with complete abrogation of CUL1 neddylation as validation of MLN4924 treatment’s efficacy, MLN4924 promoted cyclin F interaction not only with the well-established substrates RRM2 and E2F1, but also with EXO1. On the contrary, interaction between cyclin F and the SCF components CUL1 and SKP1 remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">As cyclin F oscillates during the cell cycle and only peaks in G2, cyclin F substrates are expected to be degraded mainly in the G2 and M phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To test this, cell cycle synchronisation via double thymidine block release was performed in HeLa parental and <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells to assess changes in EXO1 protein levels from the start of the G1/S transition to mitosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, EXO1 protein levels started to decrease 7 hours after cells were released into thymidine-free media — the exact time when cyclin F level peaks in G2. EXO1 is almost entirely depleted at the 14-hour time point when cells enter mitosis (evidenced by two markers of CDK1 activation - phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 and loss of phosphorylated CDK1 on threonine 14 / tyrosine 15). However, this downregulation of EXO1 in G2 and M can be completely abrogated by <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To further test whether EXO1 is a SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> substrate targeted for degradation, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiment. As CHX is a ribosomal toxin and can block protein synthesis, net degradation and therefore half-lives of proteins can be assessed in CHX chase experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, the half-life of EXO1 is less than 1 hour in parental cells but increases to over 5 hours in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar results were also obtained with si<italic>CCNF</italic> in LN229 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Conversely, over-expressed cyclin F was found to downregulate EXO1 protein level in both LN229 and HEK293T. This down-regulation is rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>), suggesting cyclin F-mediated EXO1 downregulation is proteasome-dependent and further supporting the idea that EXO1 is a SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> substrate targeted for proteasomal degradation.</p><p id="P18">To establish a direct role of cyclin F in ubiquitinating and degrading EXO1, we employed two methods to detect EXO1 ubiquitination. We first isolated overexpressed EXO1 proteins following cyclin F overexpression in HEK293T and observed a clear upregulation of EXO1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Overexpressed ubiquitin and E3 ligases can lead to artefacts, however, so we then probed EXO1 ubiquitination at an endogenous level. After unbiasedly enriching all ubiquitinated proteins from parental HeLa cells using the recombinant ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA domain) of the UBIQLN protein in an ubiquitin binding entity (UBE) pulldown assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, we managed to detect endogenous levels of polyubiquitinated EXO1 in HeLa parental cells using an EXO1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). More importantly, this polyubiquitinated smear signal is completely lost in the <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells, suggesting SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> as a major E3 responsible for the ubiquitination of endogenous EXO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To further elucidate the chain specificity of SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup>-mediated EXO1 ubiquitination, we performed a ubiquitination assay by overexpressing either wild-type (WT) ubiquitin or K48R ubiquitin mutant. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>, the K48R mutation completely abrogated both basal-level EXO1 ubiquitination and cyclin F overexpression-induced EXO1 ubiquitination, demonstrating that EXO1 ubiquitination uses K48 linkages.</p><p id="P20">We observed reduced levels of EXO1 3 hours after IR treatment in accordance with findings by Tomimatsu et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This reduction of EXO1 is also fully cyclin F-dependent because in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells, we could detect high levels of EXO1 after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). We then measured the interaction between EXO1 and cyclin F at different time points after IR treatment and detected an increase over time, suggesting that cyclin F also promotes EXO1 degradation after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). We cannot exclude that the degradation of EXO1 in these conditions is triggered by cells moving from S phase to mitosis after IR, but the interaction between cyclin F and RRM2 was reduced in the same experiments, suggesting the presence of additional modes of EXO1 regulation after DNA damage. The cyclin F-EXO1 interaction was also promoted by treatment with camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor known to arrest cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous ubiquitination of EXO1 was increased after treating cells with IR as detected by UBE assay. The ubiquitination ladder was fully dependent on cyclin F as it disappeared upon cyclin F depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> is the major E3 targeting EXO1 for K48-linked polyubiquitination both in mitosis and after DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EXO1 accumulation Leads to increased IR sensitivity upon cyclin F depletion</title><p id="P22">We have established that EXO1 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. However, the functional significance of this regulation remains unclear. Since EXO1 is one of the key exonucleases in DNA end resection after DSBs and participates in DNA damage repair, we speculated it could be the main substrate whose accumulation leads to IR hypersensitivity in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells.</p><p id="P23">To test our hypothesis, we generated <italic>EXO1</italic> knockout (<italic>EXO1</italic> K/O) cells within a <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O background. In total, we generated four cell lines: HeLa WT, HeLa <italic>EXO1</italic> K/O, HeLa <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O, and HeLa <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O <italic>EXO1</italic> K/O (the double K/O), and assessed their sensitivity to IR. <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O showed increased sensitivity as shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), while <italic>EXO1</italic> K/O cells did not have a significant impact on IR sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). In accordance with our hypothesis, the depletion of <italic>EXO1</italic> in a <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O background fully rescued the IR sensitivity observed in <italic>CCNF</italic> single knockouts, supporting the idea that EXO1 accumulation upon cyclin F loss is responsible for the IR hypersensitivity observed in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Moreover, DNA damage markers after IR endorsed this observation at a molecular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), where elevated levels of RPA32 phosphorylation at S33 and S4/8 caused by <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O were fully rescued by <italic>EXO1</italic> K/O in the double K/O cell line. Similar results were obtained in LN229 using sgRNAs targeting <italic>CCNF</italic> and <italic>EXO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the IR hypersensitivity observed upon cyclin F depletion is due to EXO1 accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The RxIF (F-deg) motif defines a specific cyclin F recognition site</title><p id="P24">The mechanism of EXO1 recognition by cyclin F is not known, so we mapped the domains mediating the interactions on both proteins. We and others have previously shown that cyclin F uses the cyclin domain to recruit substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To establish that the cyclin domain is required for EXO1 recruitment and ubiquitination, we tested EXO1 interaction with two previously reported cyclin F mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> — ΔF (with L45A and P46A mutation in the F-box domain of cyclin F, compromising SKP1 and therefore CUL1 interaction) and ΔC (with M309A mutation, which disrupts the cyclin domain).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that cyclin F interacts with EXO1 through its cyclin domain.</p><p id="P25">Similarly, we mapped cyclin F interaction site(s) on EXO1. To this end, the exonuclease domain (amino acid residues from 16 to 256), MSH3 interaction domain (129-390), MLH1 interaction domain part 1 (391-490), MSH2 interaction domain (603-end), and MLH1 interaction domain part 2 (786-end) were isolated and tested for their interactions with endogenous cyclin F (domains are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, only C-terminal truncation on EXO1 disrupted its interaction with cyclin F, indicating the requirement of the last 60 amino acid residues on EXO1 for cyclin F interaction. Interestingly, alignment of the last 60 residues in EXO1 with the previously identified RRM2 degron revealed striking similarity in the two regions— a T824 residue in EXO1 closely resembles T33 in RRM2, which was previously identified as the priming phosphorylation site in initiating cyclin F binding, and an RxIFQ motif from 842 to 846 resembles residue 49 to 53 in RRM2, including an RRI motif previously identified as essential for cyclin F interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Since our findings potentially extended the well-established RxI motif to RxIFQ, we decided to test the essentiality of each of the RxIFQ residues in both RRM2 and EXO1. In both cyclin F substrates, the mutation of R, I and F to alanine prevented substrate interaction with cyclin F, while substitution of Q to A did not impact on cyclin F’s interaction with both EXO1 and RRM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). As expected, an <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assay also demonstrated that mutations in the RxI motif abrogated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). To establish that RxIF was the essential motif for the interaction with cyclin F, we synthesized peptides containing the last 15 amino acids of EXO1 with the RxIF motif. This peptide was sufficient to retrieve cyclin F from cell lysates while mutations in the RxIF completely abolished its interaction with cyclin F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Identification of this motif facilitated a homology-based search within the human proteome for other potential cyclin F substrates. The search retrieved 997 matches, including several well-established cyclin F substrates and interactors identified by LC/MS by us and other groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Since the threonine site was also conserved in the cases of cyclin F interaction to both EXO1 and RRM2 and we confirmed the threonine’s essentiality in mediating cyclin F interaction to both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), we restricted the search to proteins containing an RxIF motif with a TP site 10 to 25 amino acid residues upstream. Using this approach, we retrieved a list of 34 novel putative cyclin F substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), among which, NEK9 was successfully validated as a cyclin F interactor through IP-WB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>), suggesting the TP plus RXIF motif identified in this study can be used to identify uncharacterised cyclin F substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>EXO1 T824 phosphorylation by CDK1/cyclin A is required for interaction with cyclin F and subsequent ubiquitination</title><p id="P26">As mentioned earlier, T824 in EXO1 closely resembles T33 in RRM2, whose phosphorylation was found to be essential for initiating RRM2-cyclin F interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we therefore wondered whether the cyclin F-EXO1 interaction is also phosphorylation-dependent, and whether the phosphorylation takes place on T824. We first tested the T824 dependence by mutating it to alanine. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, the T824A mutation abrogated cyclin F-EXO1 interaction. Moreover, unbiased analysis via LC/MS of IP-purified EXO1 WT and EXO1 T824A identified cyclin F as the major differential interacting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). And as expected, the EXO1 T824A could not be ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>).

One out of the two affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were found to be highly specific to EXO1 pT824. To establish that the antibody specifically recognises the phosphorylated form of EXO1, we treated cells with calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), to elevate global phosphorylation in cells. In addition, we also treated immunoprecipitated proteins with λ phosphatase (λPP), a Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase with activity towards phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Treatment with calyculin A was found to elevate the EXO1 pT824 signal, while treatment with λPP completely removed it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating EXO1 is phosphorylated on T824 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, calyculin A induced hyperphosphorylation also promoted cyclin F’s interaction not only with the classic cyclin F substrate RRM2, but also with EXO1. However, λPP treatment after calycuclin A only brought cyclin F-RRM2 interaction back to the untreated level and had no effect on the cyclin F-EXO1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that T824 phosphorylation is indeed required to initiate cyclin F-EXO1 interaction but is dispensable for the maintenance of the interaction.</p><p id="P28">To identify the kinase responsible for T824 phosphorylation, we used the home-made site-specific phosphorylation antibody to screen a panel of inhibitors targeting kinases involved in the cell cycle and DNA damage responses. While several inhibitors impacted cyclin F levels and its interaction with EXO1, only RO-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor) and K03861 (CDK2 inhibitor) induced a notable reduction in both cyclin F-EXO1 interaction and EXO1 T824 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). BI6727 (PLK1 inhibitor) and CKIIi VIII (Casein Kinase II inhibitor) also drastically downregulated cyclin F-EXO1 interaction, likely due to the reduction in endogenous cyclin F protein levels as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, but they did not impact on EXO1 T824 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus, the kinases phosphorylating EXO1 on T824 are likely to be CDKs in line with the degradation of EXO1 at G2 and M when CDK activity peaks.</p><p id="P29">To further define the specific cyclin/CDK partner(s) responsible for the T824 phosphorylation, we implemented an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay using CDK2/cyclin E, CDK2/cyclin A, CDK1/cyclin A, and CDK1/cyclin B. A significant increase in EXO1 T824 phosphorylation was detected only upon the addition of CDK1 into the reaction but not CDK2, regardless of the types of the cyclin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, as an effort to further identify the responsible cyclin protein, CDK1/cyclin A and CDK1/cyclin B were tested for their capability in phosphorylating EXO1 at T824 and only CDK1/cyclin A significantly increased EXO1 T824 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that cyclin A/CDK1 phosphorylates EXO1 at T824.</p><p id="P30">Both RRM2 and EXO1 rely on the threonine phosphorylation step and RxIF motif for cyclin F interaction. The mechanism of interaction can be explained by the phosphorylation being a priming mechanism that triggers exposure of the RxIF motif, or by the phosphorylation being an additional binding site that directly interacts with cyclin F cooperatively with the RxIF motif. The latter possibility was tested using Alphafold-Multimer to dock cyclin F with the EXO1 peptide spanning from the phosphorylation site to the end of the RxIF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, the model highlights hydrogen bonds between EXO1’s R842 residue and cyclin F’s E319 residue, which closely resemble the interaction between p27’s R30 residue and cyclin A’s E220 residue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, the same model predicts a hydrogen bond forming between EXO1’s T824 (mutated to E824 to mimic the phosphorylated residue) and cyclin F’s Y387, indicating a potential second valence mediating the cyclin F-EXO1 interaction. The results above suggest a multivalent binding mechanism similar to that used by other ligases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and they outline a possible multi-step procedure to prevent uncontrolled degradation of CDK/cyclin substrates by SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup> at the G2 and M transition.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>EXO1 R842A mutation phenocopies <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O</title><p id="P31">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, EXO1 is the major mediator of IR sensitivity upon <italic>CCNF</italic> loss, and downregulating the stabilised EXO1 can reverse <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O’s radiosensitisation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that EXO1 stabilisation should phenocopy <italic>CCNF</italic> loss in regard to IR sensitivity. To test this hypothesis in a refined system, we generated cell lines that, upon doxycycline treatment, express HA-tagged wild-type EXO1 (WT) or EXO1 R842A (which, according to previously demonstrated data, abrogates cyclin F-EXO1 interaction and EXO1 ubiquitination). As validation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows, both WT and R842A mutant EXO1 were successfully expressed upon induction with doxycycline, with R842A demonstrating a higher protein level in the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). IP-WB also confirmed that the R842A mutation significantly reduced its interaction with cyclin F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, CHX chase experiments also showed a significantly longer protein half-life of the R842A mutant, proving that EXO1 R842A is indeed resistant to SCF<sup>cyclin</sup> <sup>F</sup>-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In a cell cycle synchronisation experiment, we also observed that EXO1 WT was degraded in G2 and M when the level of cyclin F peaks, while EXO1 R842A was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), confirming that cell cycle regulation of EXO1 is directly mediated by cyclin F through the interaction with the RxIF motif. Lastly, enrichment of endogenous ubiquitinated proteins using UBE pulldown assay confirmed that EXO1 WT can be ubiquitinated while EXO1 R842A cannot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), validating a crucial role of the R842 in potentiating EXO1 ubiquitination.</p><p id="P32">Given that IR sensitivity in cyclin F-depleted cells can be fully rescued by concomitant EXO1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), EXO1 R842A is expected to recapitulate the radiosensitisation phenotype observed in <italic>CCNF</italic> K/O cells (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, the colony formation assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref> demonstrated that cells expressing the EXO1 R842A mutation are significantly more sensitive to IR compared to cells expressing EXO1 WT.

This speculation is indeed supported by the significantly higher incidence of chromosome aberrations observed after IR in hTERT RPE-1 cells expressing EXO1 R842A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Viral particles were transduced into an LN229 Cas9-stable line with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 (less than 3% of all cells will be infected by more than one viral particle). We performed the transduction to ensure a fold of representation of 750 (meaning that, on average, the each guide was transduced into 750 different cells in the pooled population) and kept this fold of representation throughout the screen. Each sample was run in biological quadruplicates. After treatment, genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using Qiagen DNA extraction kit (Cat.

Schematic representation of the CRISPR screen. Two days after transducing Cas9-expressing LN229 with the sgRNA library, Sample T<sub>0</sub> was collected as a reference sample of sgRNA expression. Cells were then selected with puromycin for 7 days before ionising radiation (IR) treatment. 14 days after IR, cells were collected for genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the sgRNA sequences. PCR product was sent for next generation sequencing (NGS) so that change in relative abundance of each sgRNA before and after IR can be assessed.</p><p>B.
