For this purpose, MLM were trained on thousands of measured interactions between a panel of phage and sequenced bacterial isolates. The concept was applied to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) associated with urinary tract infections. This is an important common infection in humans and companion animals from which multi-drug resistant (MDR) bloodstream infections can originate. The global threat of MDR infection has reinvigorated international efforts into alternatives to antibiotics including phage therapy. <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibit extensive genome-level variation due to horizontal gene transfer via phage and plasmids. Associated with this, phage selection for <italic>E. coli</italic> is difficult as individual isolates can exhibit considerable variation in phage susceptibility due to differences in factors important to phage infection including phage receptor profiles and resistance mechanisms. The activity of 31 phage were measured on 314 isolates with growth curves in artificial urine. Random Forest models were built for each phage from bacterial genome features and the more generalist phage, acting on over 20% of the bacterial population, exhibited F1 scores of &gt;0.6 and could be used to predict phage cocktails effective against previously untested strains. The study demonstrates the potential of predictive models which integrate bacterial genomics with phage activity datasets allowing their use on data derived from direct sequencing of clinical samples to inform rapid and effective phage therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>predictive phage therapy</kwd><kwd>UTI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) are among the most common causes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in both humans and companion animals. It is reported that up to 80% of UTIs in humans and 35-69% of UTIs in small animal pets are caused by UPEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). UTIs are widespread, affecting an estimated 150 million people a year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and 40% of women will develop an UTI during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). It is also reported that 14% of dogs will suffer with a UTI over their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). UPEC employ several virulence factors that give them the capacity to colonise, invade and survive outside of the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). They can transfer from the intestinal environment and ascend and colonise the urinary tract often causing uncomplicated transient infections that selfresolve. However, the likelihood of antibiotic treatment increases if the infection persists and/or the symptoms are more severe. Bladder (cystitis) infections can sometimes ascend to the kidney(s) (pyelonephritis) and potentially into the bloodstream resulting in bacteraemia. Up to 50% of human sepsis cases are associated with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) originating from a urinary tract infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Conversely and much less commonly, kidney infections and UTIs can result from a bloodstream infection. Recurrent and chronic infection increases the exposure of strains to multiple antibiotics and therefore the potential emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and treatment failure. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins are common first-line antibiotics used to treat UTIs in humans. Antibiotics from these classes are also used to treat pets with UTIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem globally and has serious consequences, including increased healthcare costs and the spread of potentially lifethreatening infections. High-risk globally disseminated MDR human UPEC strain types such as ST131 and ST410 are now being reported in veterinary settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Alternative non-antibiotic treatments for UTIs are urgently required to help prevent further development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and offer treatment options for MDR infections. A recent review highlights potential alternatives which include bacteriophage (phage) therapy but acknowledges further advances in the understanding of phage biology is required before phage therapy could be routinely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>)</p><p id="P3">The use of phage, viruses that specifically kill bacteria, is now gaining traction as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections. Phage were first described over 100 years ago by Felix d’Herelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and used to treat bacterial infections in this era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, the advent and routine use of antibiotics by the 1940s meant phage therapy development stalled globally. As a result of the rising threat of AMR, there has been a renaissance in phage research with major advances in the characterisation of bacterial resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and knowledge of the counter-offensive strategies evolved by phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Phage as a therapy have many advantages; they are naturally occurring, usually highly specific, non-toxic, effective on antibiotic resistant bacteria and self-dosing. However, the specificity is also a disadvantage as ideally a therapeutic phage needs to be matched to an infecting strain, traditionally by manual screening using agar overlay assays. Phage are sought that are ‘generalist’ meaning they are active on a reasonable proportion of an infecting species, but this is a much greater challenge for some species over others depending on their genome plasticity. This includes <italic>E. coli</italic>, as integrated prophage play a major role in their diversification and often introduce defence mechanisms against other phage to promote their own survival.</p><p id="P4">To overcome phage specificity issues and potential resistance development, phage therapy has often been developed using cocktails of phage, usually between 2 and 10 phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). While phage interference can occur especially if too many phage are included, such cocktails are more likely to include phage that can predate on the infecting strain and conceptually there is a reduced likelihood that the bacteria can develop resistance if the phage use different infection pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Even with cocktails, the incredible diversity of <italic>E. coli</italic> associated with UTIs in human and companion animals make phage selection for effective treatment a major challenge. Recent advances in genomics and machine learning analysis should allow the development of ‘smarter’, personalised medicine approaches within the field of phage therapy. Machine learning is a computational technique capable of analysing large and complex datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) which has already been applied for predicting viral hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However, previous studies have focused on species-level host differentiation, whereas phage therapy will require a greater level of resolution for host attribution, down to individual bacterial isolates. To that end, we propose that machine learning models custom-built around predicting infection efficacy of phage on bacterial isolates of a species can be used to design personalised phage cocktails for patients, aiming to achieve improved efficacy over a generic cocktail.</p><p id="P5">To help address a knowledge gap of bacterial-phage interactions in clinically relevant conditions and move towards a predictive approach to phage therapy, we have generated a large data set of phage-UPEC interactions in an artificial urine medium. This has been used to train machine learning models for predictive phage therapy but also gives a wealth of information to inform the selection of phage, including activity groups and distribution of resistance mechanisms. Coupled to the direct sequencing of infected urine samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), the study shows how therapeutic phage cocktail selection can be quickly achieved using a bacterial genomics approach and appropriate interaction datasets. These cocktails can be constructed at a generic level, best on the shelf preparation or in a bespoke manner to an individual infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Local epidemiology of UPEC strains for phage treatment</title><p id="P6">For this study, focused on urinary tract infections, 314 UPEC strains from both canine (n=203) and human (n=111) patients in the Edinburgh area were whole genome sequenced (Illumina, MicrobesNG). This was required as input data to train the machine learning models but also enabled an understanding of local strain diversity. In addition, it facilitated the selection of representative strains for phage enrichment to expand our phage collection from wastewater samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the phylogenetic tree alongside their source host for the 314 strains as well as a set of 10 validation strains used later in the study. The sequences were uploaded to Enterobase allowing assessment of phylotype, sequence type (ST) and O-antigen. Some phage use components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including the O-antigen portion as host receptors and other phage activity may cluster with phylogeny so mapping this information against phage activity could be important for rational cocktail design even without predictive models.</p><p id="P7">As expected, most of the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains in the UPEC collection belonged to phylotype B2 and D, the phylotypes most associated with extraintestinal disease in humans and domestic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The human strains had a higher proportion associated with phylotype D than the canine strains (18.9% of strains compared with 4.4%). The differences in predominant ST and to a lesser extent O-antigen types between the human and the canine derived isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) indicate that different types of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains are associated with UTIs in these two hosts locally and this is likely to impact phage specificity. ST131, ST69, ST95 and ST73 are globally disseminated pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> lineages that are associated with UTI and bloodstream infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and these are the most abundant ST groups represented in the human UPEC set. ST73 is also an abundant ST group in the canine strains (6.9%) although ST372 and ST12 represent almost 38% of the canine isolates.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Generation of a host-phage interaction data set</title><p id="P8">To develop machine learning models and better understand genotype to phage activity phenotype, an interaction data set is required for training and analysis. While this potentially could be mined from online databases, the methods used would be varied and there would be a lack of negative data. To overcome this, and to test for activity in conditions more closely reflecting those <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated an interaction dataset by growing 314 bacterial UPEC strains in an artificial urine (AU) medium in 96 well plate growth assays and challenging them with a set of 31 phage. Ultimately phage selected to treat UTIs need to be active in the host environment and to assess phage activity against UPEC the ideal growth medium would be urine but repeated urine collection would introduce too much variability. Our preliminary work for this study therefore included development of an AU medium based on published studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). The AU approximated canine pooled urine in terms of growth dynamics and phage activity and also demonstrated that the activity of certain phage could be lost when the bacteria were cultured in urine and AU compared to Lysogeny/Luria Broth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Phage were initially selected from our phage library by screening of activity against a small subset of UPEC strains using LB plate assays. Around 60 phage were then assayed in liquid AU against 38 bacterial isolates selected to represent the diversity of the wider UPEC collection. From this data, a final set of 31 phage were selected to generate interaction data for the remaining 284 bacterial isolates (314 in total), &gt;9000 interactions, each measured in triplicate against a no phage control. The final phage set were primarily selected as those showing the broadest host range and diverse activity profiles but some narrower range phage and phage with very related activity were also included. An interaction score was determined for each strain-phage combination using the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) for phage treatment over a no-phage control culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). A score of 100 indicated no activity while scores under 100 were indicative of phage interaction and reduced bacterial growth. Some interactions scored higher than 100 in the interaction assays i.e. where the bacteria grew better in the presence of the phage preparation than the no phage control. The scores were plotted as a heatmap to visualize patterns of phage activity across the strain collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with any interaction that scored over 100 being given the score of 100 for the purposes of the heatmap illustration. With a score of 60 or less indicating clear phage activity, only two phage in our test set showed activity on more than 40% of strains in the bacterial collection, Chap1 (54%) and Nea2 (41%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). 4% of strains (n=14) were completely resistant to all 31 phage tested (all phage interactions scored higher than 90). Subsequent to the generation of this data set, these strains were used to enrich for further phage which will be used to broaden the host range of the phage collection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Machine learning predictions of phage activity</title><p id="P10">The principal aim of this work was to generate an interaction database that could be used, with features extracted from bacterial whole genome sequences, to train machine learning models to predict phage activity based on an <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence. This is a ‘proof of principal’ study with 31 phage to gain insight into the capacity of the method to predict phage activity, and design effective cocktails, without further manual screening.</p><p id="P11">The main genomic features used for testing were predicted genes generated by a pangenomic analysis and defined as protein variants (PVs). Separate models were created for each phage, resulting in a total of 31 models. Models were initially evaluated on RMSE scores, which represent the difference between the observed and predicted scores (available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The individual models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) had average RSME values between 8 and 23. The interaction datasets for some of the phage were very imbalanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), which required a more stringent investigation of model bias. To reflect their use in a clinical setting, observed and predicted interaction scores were classified either side of a threshold score of 60 (below 60 was a positive (active) interaction and above 60 a negative (inactive) interaction). A confusion matrix was generated for each phage model, and the models were further evaluated on classifier-based metrics; F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), recall and precision (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). F1 was chosen as the best performance metric, taking class imbalance into account, and there was a clear trend that more generalist phage yielded more reliable models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The spread of predicted vs observed scores for the most generalist phage Chap1 (F1=0.83) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>. Similar figures for the other 30 phage models can be found in the supplemental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The information was also plotted across the phylogeny of the strains, based on core SNP variation, and activity as well as significant positive or negative deviation of the predicted score from the measured score was generally distributed across the phylogeny and not limited to one sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Assessment of different approaches to select phage cocktails</title><p id="P13">Clinically, phage are often administered as a cocktail of multiple phage. The advantage of using a phage cocktail is two-fold; (i) the construction of a general cocktail that could be used ‘off the shelf’ to treat an infection where the inclusion of a range of phage should increase the chance at least one is effective against the infection; (ii) a bespoke cocktail where the included phage are matched to the infection and so should all be effective and the inclusion of multiple active phage should help overcome the development of bacterial resistance to the phage treatment. In both these cases it is useful to include phage with diverse activity and therefore an increased probability they use different mechanisms to infect the host bacteria. Here, the phage were clustered by activity on the bacterial strains generating five primary activity groupings. For this, a matrix with the bacteriumphage interaction scores was used to produce a heatmap (gplots version 3.1.3) and dendrogram based on pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Cocktails were generated based on using one phage from each activity group. We selected Chap1, F1, TB69, RV2 and Phage P for a general cocktail, which were the broadest range phage from each activity group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). From the dataset of single phage interactions, this cocktail was expected to be effective on 64% (201/314) of strains in the training data set as at least one phage in the cocktail has activity against the strain. This was validated on a subset of 50 strains from the UPEC collection, selected to represent the diversity across the collection (orange dots on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, this general cocktail was effective on 64% of the strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Apendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). With most of the strains tested, the general cocktail limited the strains to a similar level to the most active single phage in the cocktail on that strain. There was little evidence of synergistic effects from the general cocktail where the score for the cocktail was less than any of the individual phage. In fact, the opposite could be seen where the cocktail score was higher than the best individual phage indicating some antagonist activity.</p><p id="P14">Bespoke cocktails could also be designed using the phage interaction dataset by choosing a selection of diverse phage active against a strain, a feature that would help combat the development of bacterial phage resistance. Only a small proportion of strains from the test set of 50 were susceptible to more than two phage in the general cocktail (5 strains, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). A bespoke cocktail selected for each strain would mean that all phage included in the cocktail should some activity against the strain. A few strains from the set of 50 could not have a bespoke cocktail of 5 phage designed due to a limitation of overall phage activity, but assessment was possible for 38 strains. The bespoke cocktails were significantly more effective when compared to the general cocktail with a lower median score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, p=2.081e-05). As expected, analysis of the growth curves from these interactions generally showed much less bacterial regrowth in the bespoke cocktails compared to the general cocktail (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) resulting in lower scores.</p><p id="P15">A key question is whether the predictive models have the potential to inform phage selection of cocktails and how selection using this method compares to the general cocktail. To assess this and to look at phage activity on strains outside the original 314 in the training dataset, 10 newly isolated clinical UPEC strains (3 canine, 7 human), were genome sequenced and these sequences run through the predictive models to give predicted phage interaction scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). From the predicted scores, cocktails were constructed using specific rules (materials and methods) so they could be compared to cocktails created using the same rules from observed phage activity data (that was subsequently carried out for validation). Phage cocktail composition for each strain can be found in supplementary material with selection accounting for F1 scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). The full set of cocktails (general, bespoke observed and bespoke predicted) were tested against the strains in AU, and as a final validation, in canine urine (CU). The scores from each of these cocktails for duplicate experiments are recorded in supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>) and the distribution of scores shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>. Three of the strains were insensitive to all the phage tested and none of the cocktails worked well on these strains. The bespoke predicted cocktail performed at a level equivalent to the observed bespoke cocktail and was significantly more effective than the general cocktail in both AU and canine urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">This history of successful phage therapy over the last century has often occurred when a more bespoke approach has been used, i.e. where phage are identified that act on the infecting bacteria. While there are some exceptions to this, including ‘jumbo’ phage targeting a wide range of <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars for a recent advance in food safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), the high-profile news stories and the long-standing work at the Eliava Institute are based on identifying the infecting organism and selecting appropriate phage from extensive phage collections. This highlights the potential of phage therapy but a bespoke approach is much harder to do at scale. The selection of appropriate antibiotics is strengthened with knowledge of the antibiotic resistances of the infecting strain, and similarly a diagnostic platform that provides information about phage effectiveness would greatly advance the development of phage treatment. The premise for this study was that genomic information about the infecting strain should be the basis of phage cocktail selection. Towards this, phage activity models were generated from bacterial sequence data combined with phage interaction data allowing prediction of phage that are active on ‘unseen’ strains, i.e. those not used in the model training sets. Phage predicted as active from the models can then be combined into cocktails for treatment.</p><p id="P17"><italic>E. coli</italic> UTIs are an appropriate challenge for phage selection as horizontal gene transfer mediated by phage and plasmids has resulted in an ever-increasing pangenome of &gt;100,000 genes relative to a ‘core’ genome of only a few hundred genes. Prophage integration also introduces resistance mechanisms to phage infection and this accounts for major variation in phage susceptibility along with receptor and metabolic diversity. As a consequence of the presence of these genomic determinants, phage activity on a strain should be identifiable from its genome sequence. To date, most of the predictive effort has been focused on possible hosts for phage based on phage genome sequencing, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), in particular prediction of bacteriophage sequences from metagenomic studies and predictive calling of possible bacterial hosts. These have mainly used nucleotide information including k-mer biases, although one study has taken into account CRISPR sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). These studies are identifying phage interactions at the level of phylum or genus and have not been focused on defining phage that would be active on clinically infecting strains of a species based on their sequence data. The idea of predictive models based on the different steps in infection has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and our approach presented here, while relatively agnostic in that it uses differential PVs (predicted genes) as features, may well include receptors and resistance mechanisms. However, this is hard to dissect as the majority of features used are grouped genes with no clear annotation. Future pipelines for phage selection could apply both associative features as well as those based on functional knowledge. Either way, good quality training sets with phenotypic interaction data will still be critical.</p><p id="P18">For the majority of methods using genome features for prediction (reviewed for source attribution in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>)) there will be significant phylogenetic influence. This will mean that features are used with statistically significant associations with phage activity but which do not have a functional relationship to phage susceptibility. This is not an issue for the models as long as they are used within a similar population structure to the training dataset but there would be reduced accuracy if the models are applied to strains from different structures. Machine learning models are also prone to replicating existing biases in their training datasets. This was demonstrated in the predictions scored of phage with very imbalanced datasets (e.g. A01), in which the model was trained on mainly high interaction scores indicating no infection and a very small subset of low scores, indicating infection. The resulting model struggled to differentiate isolates that the phage would actually infect and would be prone to generating false negatives. From a cocktail perspective, the failure to select a phage that would have been active (false negative) is actually preferred to false positives, although a high rate of false negatives may lead to a paucity of phage predicted as active from which to select a cocktail. We note that with the better models presented in this study the frequency of false positives and false negatives falls within a range where if five phage are selected for a cocktail the majority will be correctly predicted. For example, for Chap1 the predictive model generated 7% false negative scores (22/314) and 10.8% were false positive scores (34/314).</p><p id="P19">Our analysis on a set of completely independent sequenced isolates did demonstrate that the predicted cocktails were more effective than a generic cocktail and in fact were comparable with the bespoke cocktails that were based on individual measured activity. This result on ‘unseen’ isolates provides confidence in the main concept of the study. To really move such predictive phage therapy into the clinic, there are areas the research has highlighted that require further development along with the safety and registration issues that are being tackled more globally by the phage community. A key improvement would be inclusion of more generalist phage in the interaction dataset. Based on the findings illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the models trained on datasets with a class imbalance as high as 85:15 were able to produce results of practical value for phage selection, as defined by a predefined F1 cutoff of 0.6. For greater reliability, it would be preferable to use phage with a class imbalance less than this, and therefore phage that can target at least 30% of the population. More generalist phage will also provide more options for cocktail selection especially if they can be distributed across different activity groups. The work shown is a ‘proof of concept’ and valuable interaction datasets for prediction models could now be produced in a short period of time using high throughput platforms, including those that can measure 50 x 96 well plates with appropriate phage and strain collections in place.</p><p id="P20">Another major consideration is the actual activity of the selected phage in the infection environment, in this case urine which can vary considerably in terms of composition and constituent concentrations, especially pH and osmolarity, as well as factors associated with the host response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We have tried to mitigate this by measuring phage activity in artificial urine but acknowledge this cannot capture the complexity of real urine as although it is a defined reproducible medium and a closer match to urine than many rich broths that are routinely used for phage activity studies that allow faster bacterial growth. The bespoke phage cocktails formulated in this study based on the predictive models showed good activity in canine urine, comparable with results in artificial urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), and this mirrored our preliminary work on the activity of a subset of individual phage in artificial urine vs pooled canine urine. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Predictive phage therapy would be used in conjunction with diagnostic sequencing. Direct sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from clinical sample has been successfully used for diagnosis for viruses, fungi and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) including UTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and we have applied it to direct sequencing of <italic>E. coli</italic> in canine urine samples with respect to the selection of appropriate antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). There is the challenge of feature extraction for the phage models from long read data of more complex samples compared to assemblies of short reads from purified strains, as used in this study. If there are multiple strains associated with the infection then the models may still be useful to select phage, even without their separation at a genome level, although that remains to be tested. The testing of phage activity with sequenced clinical samples would be used to continually reinforce the learning dataset and improve predictions.</p><p id="P22">It should be emphasised that the primary aim of this study was to signpost what could be possible for phage therapy with machine learning or alternative predictive methods based on comprehensive interaction datasets. The study looked at both canine and human UTI <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates presented by patients at local hospitals and used a selection of 31 phage from an initial pool of just over 100. While these are only representative subpopulations, we consider they allowed the concept of predictive phage therapy to be tested with a promiscuous and important pathogen than can exhibit multi-drug resistance. We are optimistic that there will be a rapid expansion of advances in this space and the best methods could be combined in pipelines to transition the best approaches into clinical practice. However, the wider adoption of phage therapy in the veterinary or human clinic will require changes in licensing and management of expectations of both clinicians and the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Strain Information</title><p id="P23">203 <italic>E. coli</italic> were isolated from UTIs in canine patients at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Hospital for Small Animals between Jul. 2017 and Jun. 2019.

Working stocks of phage cocktails were prepared by mixing equal volumes of each selected phage already prepared at 10<sup>6</sup> per mL such that the 10 μL volume transferred to each triplicate well of a 96-well plate contained an equivalent total number of virus particles to the single phage assays, so that the overall MOI remained at 0.01.

bacterial diseases including urinary tract infections (UTIs). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the main causative agent of UTIs in both humans and companion animals with multidrug resistant strains such as the globally disseminated ST131 becoming more common. Bacteriophage (phage) are natural predators of bacteria and potentially an alternative therapy. However, a major barrier for phage therapy is the specificity of phage on target bacteria and therefore difficulty efficiently selecting the appropriate phage. Here, we demonstrate a genomics driven approach using machine learning prediction models combined with phage activity clustering to select phage cocktails based only on the genome sequence of the infecting bacterial strain.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) Phylogentic tree showing the relationship of the UPEC strains from the collection used in this study (314 strains in training set and 10 strains from validation set).

A statistical analysis (paired t-test) comparing the general to the bespoke cocktail for these 38 strains shows that the bespoke cocktail is more effective (p= 2.081e-05).

(D) A set of 10 strains that had not been in the training set were used to validate the prediction models. Using defined rules bespoke cocktails were created using the predicted scores and separately the observed scores and compared alongside the general cocktail.
