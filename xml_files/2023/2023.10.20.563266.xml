A major mechanism of acquired resistance involves “bypass” switching to alternative pathways driven by non-targeted RTKs that restore proliferation. One such RTK is AXL whose overexpression, frequently observed in bypass resistant tumors, drives both cell survival and associated malignant phenotypes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition and migration. However, the signaling molecules and pathways eliciting these responses have remained elusive. To explore these coordinated effects, we generated a panel of mutant lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cell lines in which each AXL intracellular tyrosine residue was mutated to phenylalanine. By integrating measurements of phosphorylation signaling and other phenotypic changes associated with resistance through multivariate modeling, we mapped signaling perturbations to specific resistant phenotypes. Our results suggest that AXL signaling can be summarized into two clusters associated with progressive disease and poor clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients. These clusters displayed favorable Abl1 and SFK motifs and their phosphorylation was consistently decreased by dasatinib. High-throughput kinase specificity profiling showed that AXL likely activates the SFK cluster through FAK1 which is known to complex with Src. Moreover, the SFK cluster overlapped with a previously established focal adhesion kinase (FAK1) signature conferring EMT-mediated erlotinib resistance in lung cancer cells. Finally, we show that downstream of this kinase signaling, AXL and YAP form a positive feedback loop that sustains drug tolerant persister cells. Altogether, this work demonstrates an approach for dissecting signaling regulators by which AXL drives erlotinib resistance-associated phenotypic changes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, accounting for almost 25% of all cancer deaths in the United States for 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Comprehensive genomic sequencing and expression profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, the most common form of lung cancer, has helped to identify genetic alterations that drive disease progression and can be therapeutically targeted with improved clinical efficacy and safety compared to conventional chemotherapy. One such therapy is the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib which is effective in patients with advanced EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, despite being initially effective, targeted therapies invariably result in incomplete responses, with tumor relapse upon acquiring drug resistance. A major source of resistance to EGFR targeted therapy arises from secondary mutations in the kinase domain, such as the “gatekeeper” EGFR<sup>T790M</sup>, leading to an increased affinity towards ATP relative to its TKI affinity. Second- and third-generation EGFR TKI therapies, such as afatinib and osimertinib respectively, have been developed to effectively target resistance derived from mutant forms of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, while agents targeting EGFR secondary mutations delay tumor relapse, the efficacy of these therapies is ultimately limited by resistance through still other mechanisms.</p><p id="P3">Another well-appreciated means of resistance to EGFR inhibition is receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) “bypass” resistance, wherein alternative pathways are activated so that cells are no longer reliant on the drug-targeted pathway. Our lab and others have shown that, while individual RTKs are able to activate a common set of downstream pathways, they do so to varying extents and thus have varied capacity to confer bypass resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Two well-studied RTK bypass resistance mechanisms are Her3 signaling providing resistance to Her2-targeted therapy in breast carcinoma and Met signaling driving resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Bypass resistance-conferring RTKs may contribute to intrinsic or acquired resistance, can become activated by ligand-mediated autocrine or paracrine induction, amplification, or mutations, and can sometimes be targeted by combination therapy<sup>10</sup>.</p><p id="P4">AXL, a member of the Tyro3, AXL, and MerTK (TAM) RTK family, is frequently upregulated in tumors resistant to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy, across cancer types, including EGFR-driven NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). AXL expression is additionally associated with additional phenotypic changes in resistant cells, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration, indicative of increased metastatic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Furthermore, AXL has been shown to sustain the viability of osimertinib resistant cells in lung cancer <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> EGFRm lung cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). A landmark study describing AXL-driven erlotinib resistance showed that tumor xenografts with acquired resistance harbored altered expression of several EMT marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). AXL additionally drives resistance to EGFR inhibition of cycling drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells by protecting them against treatment-induced DNA damage through the activation of low-fidelity DNA polymerases, MYC activation, and a pyridine/pyrimidine metabolism imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The triple combination treatment of osimertinib, cetuximab, and an anti-AXL antibody led to cures in mice whose tumors had already acquired resistance to osimertinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Based on these observations, ongoing phase I/II clinical trials are testing the clinical benefit of AXL and EGFR inhibitor combinations in EGFRm NSCLC (NCT02729298).</p><p id="P5">Although drug resistance is commonly quantified as a measure or proxy of cell number, tumor relapse is a multifaceted challenge driven by the development of malignant phenotypes that coordinately promote tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). AXL has been involved in a myriad of biological processes that direct cancer progression, including EMT and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and induction of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and tumor immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Consequently, it is unclear exactly which pathways AXL activates to promote resistance, and therefore where, when, and how AXL-mediated resistance develops. Increasing our mechanistic understanding of how AXL regulates these pathways will inform the design of more precise targeted therapy combinations that simultaneously inhibit AXL as well as effector downstream pathways driving resistance. Moreover, a better characterization of AXL signaling might help to better understand the shortcomings of anti-AXL therapies currently undergoing clinical trials. However, identifying these pathways is hindered by RTK crosstalk and signaling pleiotropy: Each RTK regulates a set of downstream pathways that can be also regulated by other RTKs alone or in combination. Therefore, we require a methodology that specifically addresses RTK redundancy and signaling pleiotropy to mechanistically characterize AXL-mediated bypass resistance.</p><p id="P6">Mutational studies perturbing phosphorylation sites can break RTK pleiotropy into pathway-specific effects. Upon interaction with its cognate ligand, an RTK dimer auto-phosphorylates tyrosine (Y) residues within its kinase domain and C-terminal tail, creating binding sites for interacting adapters and kinases with phospho-binding domains (PBD) such as SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The RTKs then phosphorylate these signaling proteins to initiate downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Since phenylalanine (F) is a non-phosphorylatable mimetic of Y, Y-to-F mutational studies provide a tool for dissecting the signaling role of individual phosphosites. For instance, AXL drives resistance to cetuximab and radiation through interaction of Abl1 with AXL Y821 in head and neck cancer; accordingly, editing Y821 to F abolishes this resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Other AXL Y-to-F mutational experiments have shown that Y821 serves as a docking site for PLCγ, p85, GRB2, as well as Src and Lck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). As individual AXL Y-to-F mutations have different signaling effects, we hypothesized that these mutations would also distinctly mediate AXL’s ability to confer erlotinib resistance, providing an opportunity to establish specific AXL signaling and phenotypic associations during bypass resistance.</p><p id="P7">Here, we apply an integrated experimental and computational strategy to systematically elucidate the downstream signaling proteins and pathways driving cell survival and associated phenotypes in response to AXL activation. To do so, we generated a cell line panel wherein each cell line carries a single Y-to-F mutation in AXL. We measured phosphorylation signaling alongside viability, apoptosis, migration, and an erlotinib-induced clustering effect in AXL-activated cells treated with erlotinib. Through statistical modeling to analyze the paired AXL-driven phosphoproteomic and phenotypic measurements, our results indicate that AXL activates Src-family kinases (SFK), Abl1, and focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) which serve as key upstream components of the YAP pathway to promote cancer cell growth. Accordingly, we observed that AXL activation drives increased YAP nuclear translocation, whereas YAP inhibition led to decreased AXL expression and kinase activity. The fact that the AXL downstream signaling signature was strongly correlated with AXL expression in EGFRm tumors, as well as poor survival and progressive disease in LUAD patients, supports the clinical relevance of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AXL’s capacity for erlotinib resistance varies across AXL Y-to-F mutants</title><p id="P8">To isolate the AXL pathways driving specific phenotypic effects, we generated a panel of AXL Y-to-F mutant cell lines and collected phosphoproteomic and phenotypic measurements of each during AXL-driven bypass signaling. We selected these AXL tyrosines based on selection-based FACS assays wherein we transiently introduced an AXL-IRES-GFP plasmid in PC9 AXL KO cells treated with erlotinib (E) and quantified E-based selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A/B</xref>). We knocked-out (KO) AXL in PC9 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and then expressed either AXL wild-type (WT) (KI), AXL kinase-dead (K567R, KD), or one Y-to-F AXL mutant cassette among Y634F, Y643F, Y698F, Y726F, Y750F, or Y821F using lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We confirmed AXL total abundance, cell-surface abundance, and activation in each cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C/D</xref>). We observed that around 25% of the transduced PC9 cells express AXL, yet the total AXL expressed and measured by western blot is at least equal to PC9 parental. This suggests that each transduced AXL-expressing cell possesses on average 4-fold more AXL compared with parental cells. While this is a caveat of our methodology, the higher AXL expression of the PC9 Y-to-F mutant cells is still within the range of the reported AXL expression in other EGFRm lung cancer cell lines such as H2279 and H4006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). AXL activation is challenging to faithfully manipulate given its dependence on phosphatidylserine (PS) present in apoptotic bodies and the spatially heterogeneous presentation of its ligand Gas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Therefore, we used the AXL-activating antibody AF154 (A) as a reproducible means of driving receptor activation. We did not detect AXL phosphorylation in AXL KO and AXL Kinase Dead (KD) cells whereas KI and the Y-to-F mutants showed different levels of kinase activity among each other. Notably, KI and the Y-to-F mutants display lower activation levels than PC9 parental cells which indicate that despite the increased AXL expression in PC9-transduced cells, the total amount of activated receptor on the cell surface is still higher in the parental (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). As expected, we observed complete inhibition of p-EGFR upon E treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E)</xref>, and A-induced AXL activity was confirmed by phosphorylation increase of Akt S473-p, a known indirect downstream effector of AXL signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we measured the ability of the different AXL mutant cell lines to proliferate, survive, migrate, and form cell “islands” in the presence of E or the combination of E and A (EA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We monitored cell proliferation and cell death using live cell imaging over 96 hours of treatment with either E or EA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B/C</xref>). We observed a significant increase in cell proliferation and decrease in apoptosis in EA-treated PC9 parental cells compared to the E condition. KI cells followed the same trend with lesser magnitude, likely because each PC9 AXL mutant cell line had a lower amount of the receptor on the cell surface than parental (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). As expected, EA did not enhance proliferation or survival versus E in AXL KO and KD. While the mutants Y643F and Y750F effectively behaved like AXL KO or KD, Y698F and Y726F cells promoted proliferation and prevented apoptosis upon AXL activation. On the other hand, when EA-treated, Y821F and Y634F cells failed to increase cell proliferation and yet significantly blocked apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B/C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We performed a scratch-wound assay in parallel to evaluate the migratory capacity of each cell line after treatment. After making a wound, we used live cell imaging for 24 hours to quantify the ability of each cell line to migrate and re-occupy the space in the presence of E or EA. PC9 parental cells treated with E unexpectedly migrated similarly in the presence or absence of the AXL-activating antibody, whereas the migratory ability of KO and KD was blocked, regardless of treatment. Moreover, Y643F, Y698F, and Y726F became more motile after receptor activation, while the mutations Y634F, Y750F, Y821F did not respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">While evaluating the other phenotypes, we observed that E induced a clustering effect wherein cells establish cell-to-cell adhesions and form small “cell islands” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the different PC9 AXL mutant cell lines varied in demonstration of this phenotype. To quantify the extent of cell clustering, we applied Ripley’s K function, a spatial clustering metric frequently used in astronomy to model whether objects such as stars are found closer to one another than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). This algorithm allowed us to test the spatial distribution of PC9 cells against the null hypothesis that the cells are distributed randomly. In agreement with our initial observation, we found that parental PC9 cells were more clustered than expected by chance in response to E, whereas AXL activation partially reverted this clustering. Y-to-F mutant cell lines displayed a trend counter to that observed in the scratch wound assay: Y643F, Y698F and Y726F effectively behaved like PC9 parental and KI, whereas Y634F, Y750F, and Y821F remained clustered upon EA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We used principal components analysis (PCA) to explore the relationships among the four phenotypes we measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F/G</xref>). Most of the variation, represented by principal component (PC) 1, prominently separated untreated cells from the other two treatment groups, and partly separated EA from E cells. We took this component to represent overall cell fitness, which is increased by moving positively along PC 1 for all the mutants except KO and KD, where A had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, scores). Phenotypes increased by AXL activation are positively associated with PC 1, while those decreased are negatively associated. By contrast, PC 2 separated AXL-induced viability from migration effects; moving positively along PC 2 indicated an increase in viability and a decrease in apoptosis while migration decreased; cells formed islands in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, loadings). The cell lines showed varying effects with AXL activation: Y726F and Y750F shifted positively along PC 1 and negatively along PC 2 with A treatment, reflecting migration-driven effects; Y634F and Y821F moved positively along PC 1 and PC 2, reflecting cell viability/apoptosis-driven effects.</p><p id="P13">Overall, these results suggest that each Y-to-F mutant affects cell viability, death, migration, and clustering differently. On the one hand, representing extremes of phenotypic behavior, while Y750F cells blocked all phenotypic effects, behaving like KO and KD, Y698F and Y726F cells behaved like PC9 parental and KI, with little impact on phenotypic outcomes. On the other hand, representing the most varied phenotypic outcomes, Y634F and Y821F mutant cells blocked AXL-induced viability, migration, and scattering, while simultaneously enhancing cell survival in the presence of E.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AXL mutants selectively disrupt downstream pathway effects</title><p id="P14">Intrigued by these differential phenotypic outcomes and to address whether differences in downstream signaling drive these differences, we applied a mass spectrometry approach, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), to measure the signaling effect of AXL activation in the PC9 AXL mutant cells during EGFR inhibition. We treated each PC9 mutant cell line with E for 4 hours and then stimulated AXL for 10 minutes before lysis. Hierarchical clustering of the resulting phosphoproteomic data set showed AXL KO and KD clustered together, as expected, whereas the other cell lines did not display obvious clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To identify significant clusters in our data, we applied Dual Data-Motif Clustering (DDMC), an approach that we previously developed to improve the computational modeling of signaling networks by clustering phosphoproteomic data based on both abundance variation and sequence information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). We then used Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to establish associations between these signaling clusters and cellular response and DDMC to infer the upstream kinases regulating each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">DDMC requires selecting a series of hyperparameters (namely cluster numbers, sequence weights, and PLSR components), which we did by assessing the ability of PLSR to predict the phenotypes using each set of hyperparameters. We additionally inspected the interpretability of the top 5% performing models and selected the one comprised by 5 clusters, a sequence weight of 2, and 2 PLSR components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A–D</xref>). Several models using both the phosphorylation abundance and sequence information, with a sequence weight of 1, 2, 3, or 5, outperformed all models using either information source exclusively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The resulting cluster (C) centers grouped the AXL-responsive behaviors. C1, C2, and especially C3 were markedly decreased in PC9 AXL KO and KD cells, with varied phosphorylation signal across Y-to-F mutants. C3 peptides were of particular interest to us because, in addition to a dramatic phosphorylation decrease in AXL KO and KD, it showed an increased abundance in PC9 AXL Y698F—a mutant that phenotypically behaves like PC9 parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>)—compared with the other clusters. Conversely, C4 shows an increase in PC9 KO—but not KD—with respect to parental, and a lower phosphorylation signal in Y634F compared to the rest of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Cluster 5 had biologically inexplicable signaling trends, and so was disregarded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>). We next investigated the cluster membership for all AXL phosphorylation sites (phosphosites) and found all of them within C3, consistent with C3 displaying the most dramatic AXL responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C/D</xref>). The lack of correlation between the phosphorylation differences observed in the AXL phosphosites with total or cell surface AXL levels per cell line suggests that the variation in signaling was not due to varying ectopic AXL expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We ran Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on each cluster to explore their functional roles. We found that C1 is strongly enriched in a TGF-beta signaling pathway signature; C2 and C3 share the enrichment of several biological processes associated with the activation of RTK signaling (EGFR / VEGFR) and the regulation of focal adhesions; and C4 is uniquely enriched in a STAT3 signaling pathway signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These results highlight known AXL-mediated processes, such as downstream EGFR pathway re-activation and focal adhesion regulation, as well as less established programs such as TGF-beta and STAT3 signaling<sup>27</sup>. To obtain a general view of the composition of the different clusters, we next explored the cluster assignments and phosphorylation of RTKs, receptor adapters, and canonical protein kinases in PC9 parental and AXL KO cells treated with EA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Among RTKs, we found a decrease in the phosphorylation of Epha2 Y594-p and Her2 Y877-p in AXL KO compared to PC9 parental. On the other hand, we observed an E-induced phosphorylation increase in Met S988-p and Her2 Y877-p in E-treated PC9 parental cells which was abolished in the presence of the AXL inhibitor R428 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). This E-induced phosphorylation is of particular interest because it is consistent with previous studies that have suggested signaling crosstalk between AXL and HER2 to drive resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer, as well as between AXL and EPHA2 or MET to confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Of similar interest is the fact that the RTK adapters Gab1/2, Eps8, Sos1, or Dapp1 as well as the E3-ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b are markedly downregulated in AXL KO, and that the phosphorylation of these proteins is dependent on the availability of AXL Y821, as evident from the fact that these phosphosites were not phosphorylated in the AXL Y821F cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Moreover, we observed increased phosphorylation of the Src-Family Kinases (SFK) Frk, Lyn, Lck, Yes1, as well as Abl1 and its substrate and regulator Abi2 in C2 and C3. While Frk, Lyn, and Lck phosphorylation was increased upon E treatment, monotherapy, or concomitant addition of the AXL inhibitor R428 decreased their phosphorylation. R428 also inhibited Abi2 and Abl1, suggesting an AXL-specific activation of SFK and Abl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F/G</xref>). AXL activation led to a strong phosphorylation increase of Y187-p and Y204-p located in the activation segment of Erk1 and Erk2, respectively. AXL-mediated Erk1&amp;2 activation, which are both C3 members, have been previously reported as drivers of erlotinib resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Administration of E (in the absence of the AXL-activating antibody) and R428, as single agents or in combination, inhibited both Erk1&amp;2 phosphosites, which suggests an activation of ERK signaling by AXL. Conversely, JNK2 and JNK3 phosphosites were modestly more abundant in AXL KO than in PC9 parental and clustered in C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F/G</xref>). Given the signaling behavior and cluster composition of C3, we decided to use STRING to map the protein-protein interactions while observing the phosphorylation changes of PC9 parental compared AXL KO cells within C3. We found that in addition to Erk1/2, other kinases are highly regulated by AXL activation within C3 such as Cdk1 (as shown by the lack of phosphorylation of its inhibitory phosphosite Y15), Prkcd, Cilk1, Ack1, and the phosphatase Shp2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>). GSEA indicated that signaling cluster C3 displays increased phosphorylation abundance focal adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This focal adhesion signature includes SHP2 Y542-p, SIPRA Y496-p, Tjp1 S1196-p, Tjp2 Y249-p, p130cas (<italic>BCAR1</italic>) Y234-p, Actin1 Y215-p, and Afadin (<italic>MLLT4</italic>) Y1230-p, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, the phosphorylation-based signaling landscape varied across AXL phosphosite mutants, demonstrating that single Y-to-F mutations lead to distinct AXL-specific signaling perturbations and cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). DDMC summarized the network-level phosphorylation changes across PC9 Y-to-F mutants during switched AXL activation and found that C1, C2, and especially C3 correlate with AXL activation levels, while peptides in C4 are slightly increased in AXL KO cells compared with parental. These results led us to identify specific signaling-to-phenotype relationships by PLSR.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DDMC clusters predict AXL-mediated phenotypic responses and identify C1, C2, and C3 as downstream drivers of erlotinib resistance</title><p id="P20">To associate the different AXL-mediated signaling clusters and phenotypes, we regressed the DDMC cluster centers against the phenotypic responses using PLSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To verify the importance of DDMC-mediated clustering for prediction, we assessed the prediction performance of a PLSR model using different clustering strategies: no clustering (i.e., regressing the phosphoproteomic data set directly), k-means clustering, clustering with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), DDMC using only the sequence information (DDMC seq), or DDMC equally prioritizing the phosphorylation abundance and peptide sequences (DDMC mix). We found that PLSR was only able to accurately predict all four phenotypes when using the cluster centers generated by DDMC mix. By contrast, a PLSR model fit to the MS data directly was not able to predict any of the phenotypes, likely due to the overwhelming number of peptides (498) compared to cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The scores and loadings of the resulting PLSR model illustrate the varying capacity of the different PC9 cell lines to promote cell proliferation and migration. PC 1 was indicative of overall cancer cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I/J</xref>) like PC 1 of the AXL phenotypes PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F/G</xref>). PC9 parental, as well as the AXL mutants Y698F and Y643F, associated with increased cell fitness positively along PC 1, whereas PC9 AXL KO and KD were heavily negatively weighted along the same axis, thus strongly associating with erlotinib-induced apoptosis and the island effect. PC 2 appears to capture variation that is specific to apoptosis as cells with increased apoptotic phenotypes move positively along this axis. The PLSR model captures an inverse association between apoptosis and the PC9 AXL mutants Y634F and Y821F as they are negatively associated with PC 2, consistent with the exclusive phenotypic effect of Y634F and Y821F in reducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>); their PLSR scores were not weighted along PC 1 and therefore not associated with proliferation, migration, nor the island effect. These results highlight that the phosphoproteomic variation of AXL Y634F and Y821F are consistent with signaling changes that drive their ability to exclusively block cell death, without affecting other phenotypes. We found that only C3 strongly associates with cell migration and proliferation along both PC1 and PC 2, whereas C1, C2, and C3 strongly associate with cell migration and proliferation across PC1 but not PC 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I/J</xref>). Altogether, the results of our paired experimental and computational approach suggest that AXL activates C1, C2, and C3 to promote cell proliferation and migration in the presence of E.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>AXL downstream signaling correlates with poor patient survival and progressive disease in EGFRm LUAD patients</title><p id="P22">We sought to explore the clinical relevance of the AXL downstream signaling identified by our analysis and its association with resistance to EGFR therapy. To do so, we first selected the phosphosites in C1, C2, and C3 and ranked them by log2 fold-change in PC9 parental versus PC9 AXL KO. This was used to define an “AXL downstream signature” that shows an enrichment of an EGFR TKI resistance signature according to ranked GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Next, we interrogated proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and transcriptomic data sets from different clinical studies to investigate the relationship between AXL, its downstream signaling defined by C1, C2, and C3, and patient outcomes. We asked if this AXL downstream signature is enriched in AXL-high LUAD tumors and whether it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. To achieve this, we used data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) study which covers the proteogenomic data of over 100 treatment-naïve lung adenocarcinoma tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). We stratified the CPTAC LUAD patient samples into AXL-high or AXL-low tumors based on the receptor’s protein expression and looked at the overall and phosphorylation abundance of the members of C1-3. At the protein level, there was a significant enrichment in the abundance of C1, C2, and C3 proteins in AXL-high and EGFRm tumors compared to AXL-low and EGFR WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B/C</xref>). Among the 491 phosphosites observed in our AXL mass spectrometry data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), only 110 were measured in CPTAC. After grouping these peptides into C1, C2, and C3, we did not observe a difference in their phosphorylation abundance when comparing AXL-high versus AXL-low tumors, however, in EGFRm compared with EGFR WT tumors, AXL-high tumors displayed a strong phosphorylation enrichment of the AXL signature, specifically in C2 and C3 but not C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A/B</xref>). Thus, the identified AXL downstream signaling occurs in clinical specimens and is specific to EGFRm tumors.</p><p id="P24">Even though phosphorylation and transcriptional changes are often discordant, most of the biological information of tumor biopsies at the single cell resolution is comprised by gene expression. Thus, we asked whether the gene expression of those proteins included in the phosphoproteomic AXL downstream signature is higher in EGFRm tumors displaying progressive disease and metastasis, and thus resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. Using previously published single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), we observed that AXL expression was significantly increased in progressive disease and metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C/D</xref>). The gene expression of our phosphoproteomic AXL downstream signature was significantly upregulated in cancer cells compared with other cell types, in L858R EGFR+ tumors, as well as in progressive disease and metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-J</xref>). By plotting each cluster separately, we found that these differences can be accounted for by the contribution of genes present in C2 and C3, but not C1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E-S</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Using TCGA data, we explored whether the gene expression of AXL downstream signaling correlates with poor overall survival of LUAD patients.

Enrichment of our AXL signature in PAAD patients with poor clinical outcomes is consistent with the fact that many PAAD tumors are driven by mutant EGFR. Moreover, AXL has indeed also been implicated in resistance to TKI in both LUSC and PAAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Above we showed that DDMC identified three clusters of phosphosites regulated by AXL activity that correlate with cell viability and migration in vitro. Here, we asked whether these sites, as well as the transcript and protein expression of these proteins, are associated with poor clinical outcomes in different patient cohorts. At the phosphorylation level, we observed that the AXL downstream signature is specifically enriched in EGFRm and not EGFR WT tumors. At the protein level, the expression of C1, C2, and C3 members was higher in EGFRm and AXL-high tumors. Finally, the transcriptional expression of these proteins showed a remarkable association with poor clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dasatinib selectively targets C2 and C3</title><p id="P27">Given the strong correlation between the transcript expression of the proteins in C2 and C3 identified in our phosphoproteomic model and poor prognosis in LUAD patients, we decided to further investigate the regulation of these clusters by AXL signaling. A feature of DDMC is the construction of position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for each cluster which represent the frequency of each residue across peptide positions. These computationally derived kinase motifs can then be compared against a compendium of 60 experimentally determined kinase motifs to infer the upstream kinases regulating each cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P28">DDMC inferred that CK2, Abl1, and SFK act upstream of C1, C2, and C3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). C1, the only pS/T cluster, displays a kinase motif characterized by the strong enrichment of an acidophilic C-terminus, a known hallmark of CK2 specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). The GSEA results of C1 provides support to this DDMC upstream kinase prediction as CK2 has been reported to be activated by TGFβ treatment and required for TGFβ-induced EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). CK2 has also been shown to phosphorylate the C1 members Mcm2, Ldlr, and Sptbn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). With C2, the PSSM is consistent with an Abl1 kinase motif; the kinase specificity of Abl1 features a proline at position +3 with respect the phosphorylation site, an isoleucine at -1 and an alanine at +1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2I</xref>). Both C2 and C3 have sequence motif features associated with SFK: C2 has a strong enrichment of acidic residues at position -3 and to a lesser extent at position -2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2J</xref>). The SFK Yes1 specifically favors glycine, threonine, and tryptophan at position +1 as well as serine, glycine, and methionine at -2, which are all included in the PSSM of C2. On the other hand, C3 displays a strong enrichment of hydrophobic residues leucine and phenylalanine at position +3, serine and threonine at +2, and basic residues at position +4 and +5, which are all specificity drivers of SFK. C3 was also inferred to be regulated by RTK signaling as its motif is highly preferred by several receptors such as Alk, Met, and INSR. These receptors tend to target substrates that present highly hydrophobic C-terminus in addition to hydrophilic residues at -1, which are characteristics of the motif of C3. The association of C3 with RTKs is illustrated by a STRING network map and is consistent with the GSEA of C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To experimentally test these links and whether SFKs and Abl1 may regulate C2 and C3 peptides, we measured cell proliferation and the global phosphoproteomic state of PC9 cells upon treatment with the targeted inhibitor dasatinib. We first asked whether dasatinib was able to block the cell proliferation increase induced by AXL activation. We treated PC9 parental cells with E, EA, or E with the AXL inhibitor R428, all in the context of increasing concentrations of dasatinib. As expected, EA and E+R428-treated cells were significantly more and less proliferative, respectively, than cells treated with E, and we observed a dose-response decrease of cell proliferation with increasing concentrations of dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We performed another pY-based mass spectrometry experiment to ascertain whether there was an enrichment of phosphosites from C2 and C3 in those peptides most prominently depleted by dasatinib treatment. We activated AXL in PC9 parental cells after pretreating with E and increasing concentration of dasatinib for 4 hours. In parallel, we also pretreated AXL KO cells. We then lysed cells and ran mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Hierarchical clustering identified a cluster of peptides that were highly sensitive to dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D/E</xref>). Beyond Abl1- and SFK-related phosphosites, this dasatinib-induced cluster includes most of the AXL-regulated kinases previously described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> including Ack1, Prkcδ, FAK1/2, and Epha2, as well as proteins associated with focal adhesion regulation and cytoskeletal remodeling such as p130cas, CasL, Git1, Tjp1, Paxillin, and Actin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Highly sensitive peptides to dasatinib had a selective and statistically significant enrichment overlap with C2 and C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Finally, the dasatinib treatment data revealed an additional cluster of interest that displays AXL-dependent increased phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>).

A strategy to address this question is inferring AXL substrates by inspecting its kinase specificity profile and its likelihood of phosphorylating these different phosphorylation sites in vitro. Since a study comprehensively characterizing AXL’s kinase specificity had not been performed to date, we adapted a previously developed high-throughput specificity screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) to identify AXL substrates and complement our phosphoproteomics analysis. In peptide display screening, a genetically encoded library of peptides is displayed by an eCPX receptor in <italic>E. Coli</italic> and subsequently phosphorylated by incubation with an isolated kinase of interest. Upon phosphorylation, a pan-pY antibody is used to pull down and enrich for phosphorylated peptides, so that by deep sequencing the original and post-enrichment libraries, a per-peptide enrichment score can be calculated. An anti-Myc antibody binding to the c-Myc tag present in all peptides allows the assessment of, and normalization by, the degree to which each peptide is displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). An important feature of peptide display compared to previous methods used to measure substrate specificity is that, by encoding specific peptide libraries, we can not only obtain an optimal phosphorylation motif for a given kinase but also assess phosphorylation preference and likelihood for a defined set of peptides. Thanks to this unique feature, here we can accomplish three different goals, namely (i) defining AXL’s optimal substrate motif, (ii) ascertaining whether AXL preferentially phosphorylates the peptides identified in our study relative to most known human phosphotyrosines, and (iii) identifying the highest-scoring substrates within our phosphoproteomics data set.</p><p id="P33">Shah <italic>et al</italic> built a library comprised of 2600 annotated human tyrosine phosphorylation sites—which they, and we, refer to as the “pTyr-Var” library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Consistent with the fact that the “pTyr-Var” library provides only partial coverage of the human phosphoproteome, we found that only ∼10% of the peptides within our AXL phosphoprotoemics dataset were part of the pTyr-Var library. To study all peptides within our AXL phosphoproteomics dataset, we built a second purpose-made library, hereafter referred to as “AXL spiked-in library”, including the 415 pY peptides from our study that populate C2, C3, and C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <bold>S4A</bold>). While we screened both glutathione S-transferase (GST)- and biotin (BTN)-tagged AXL so that we could rule out significant tag-derived effects, both screens led to largely overlapping peptide specificities, as indicated by a Pearson’s coefficient of 0.96 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>), with the most noticeable difference being cysteine enrichment unique to AXL-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B/C</xref> and <bold>S4C/D</bold>). Since we reasoned that this cysteine might be mediated by the relatively larger GST tag, and therefore focused on the results from our AXL-BTN screen.</p><p id="P34">We computed a PSSM representing AXL’s substrate motif by quantifying the relative enrichment or depletion of a given residue along the peptide sequence positions using phosphorylation abundance of each peptide within the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B/C</xref>). AXL shows a strong preference for hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal part of the peptide (positions +1 to +5 relative to the phosphorylation sites). It also favors peptides with hydrophilic residues at +1, namely aspartate or histidine. On the N-terminal side, AXL displays a strong preference for isoleucine or leucine at -1, a common substrate specificity hallmark for many tyrosine kinases. Moreover, AXL preferentially phosphorylates peptides with an asparagine in their N-terminal side, particularly in positions -5 through -3. AXL also disfavors substrates containing the basic residues lysine and arginine, albeit shows a marked preference for histidine at positions -5, +1 and +5. Consistent with the expectation that similar kinases are likely to share similar substrate specificities, AXL’s specificity profile is very similar to the reported substrate specificity of another TAM-family kinase, MerTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).</p><p id="P35">By comparing the peptide display screening from the two libraries side-by-side, we observed that the phosphosites included in our phosphoproteomics data set are preferentially phosphorylated by AXL compared with most phosphotyrosines within the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We then asked how high-scoring peptides in the top 25% within the AXL spiked-in library were represented across the DDMC clusters. We observed an enrichment of the top 25% AXL substrates in C2, no enrichment in C3, and a depletion of top substrates in C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> While we found no SFK or Abl1 peptides to be directly phosphorylated by AXL, we observed the activating phosphosite Y861-p of FAK1 to be among the top 5% of AXL substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). FAK1 is a known regulator of focal adhesions and migration, frequently associated with malignancy and metastasis. A previous study defined that a FAK pathway signature in EMT-mediated erlotinib resistant lung cancer cells was counter-acted by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). These mesenchymal resistant cells overexpressed many of the proteins that our model identified to correlate with migration and proliferation when differentially phosphorylated upon AXL activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F/G</xref>). Thus, we asked whether our AXL downstream signature overlaps with the FAK signature. Consistent with the study that identified the FAK1 pathway to drive EMT-mediated erlotinib resistance, we found this pathway, like C2&amp;C3, to be significantly depleted by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). We saw that AXL-activated PC9 cells display an increased phosphorylation of FAK signaling compared with AXL KO, and that this pathway activation is mainly driven by C3 with Cdk1 and Ack1 being most dramatically activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H/I</xref>). Moreover, we observed higher protein expression and phosphorylation of FAK1 in EGFRm AXL-high LUAD tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J/K</xref>), which is consistent with the AXL downstream signaling trends described previously in the same dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref> and <bold>S3B</bold>).</p><p id="P36">Among the top-scoring AXL substrates, our in vitro phosphorylation screen identified several known AXL substrates, such as Ack1, SHP-2, CTNND1, and PEAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>) as well as less established interactors including the cytoskeletal-remodeling proteins TJP2, BCAR1, TNS1, ANXA2/5, TWF1, ITSN2, the kinase DYRK1A/3, and the E3-ubiquitin ligases CBLB and CBLC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4E</xref>). Six different NEDD9 phosphosites were among the top 10% AXL substrates, consistent with the GSEA enrichment of C2 and C3 and previous studies describing the role of AXL in regulating focal adhesions and migration through this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <bold>S4E</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).

By doing so, we found AXL to highly phosphorylate FAK1 Y861-p in vitro. Moreover, FAK1 signaling pathway largely overlaps with C3 and is effectively inhibited by dasatinib. This suggests that FAK1 might play a critical role in regulating C3 signaling; the cluster most affected by AXL across Y-to-F mutants and that shows the strongest correlation with cell migration and viability in our PLSR model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C/J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>AXL drives upstream YAP regulators which feed back to drive AXL expression and activation</title><p id="P38">To extend our understanding of the mechanism by which the identified phosphoproteomic signaling changes affect AXL-driven phenotypes, we decided to explore the transcriptional changes occurring during switched AXL signaling. We collected RNAseq data of each PC9 AXL Y-to-F cell line treated with E or EA. PCA analysis of the RNAseq data found that PC1 represents AXL activation since the scores of all cell lines shift positively along PC 1 in EA-treated cells compared with E. We generated a ranked gene list based on the PC 1 scores by ranked GSEA analysis and found a YAP signature enriched in AXL-activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <bold>S5A</bold>). This is consistent with our DDMC upstream kinase predictions of C2 and C3, as Abl1 and SFK phosphorylation of YAP is a well-known mechanism of YAP nuclear translocation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).

Additionally, a recent study shows that FAK1 signaling is the main driver of YAP activation to enable the emergence of drug tolerant persister cells during EGFR-targeted therapies in patient-derived models and in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). Our phosphoproteomics and bacterial display data show that FAK1 and its associated signaling is activated by AXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F–K</xref>). Together, these insights led us to hypothesize that AXL is a key upstream component of the YAP pathway—namely SFK, Abl1, and FAK signaling—mediating the emergence of drug-tolerant persister cells.</p><p id="P39">To test this hypothesis, we first treated cells with increasing concentrations of dasatinib and blotted for the inhibitory YAP phosphosite S127 which, when phosphorylated, is bound by 14-3-3 proteins to sequester YAP in the cytoplasm and prevent its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Indeed, we found that dasatinib induces an increase in the phosphorylation abundance of the YAP S127-p which is further exacerbated in the absence of AXL.

We seeded cells at high or low density as YAP is known to respond to changes in cell confluency, with the transcription factor becoming inactive at higher cell densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). As expected, we found that YAP S127-p most strongly decreases in response to E or EA at low cell density. While AXL KO cells displayed the same trend, the overall phosphorylation signal of S127-p is substantially higher in AXL KO compared to PC9 parental or AXL KI cells, again reflecting AXL-specific YAP activation.</p><p id="P41">To further assess YAP state, we directly quantified YAP cellular localization in PC9 parental and AXL KO cells using immunofluorescence. We treated cells with E or EA for 3 days to observe YAP localization in cancer cells persisting in the presence of inhibitor. PC9 cells treated with EA display significantly higher nuclear YAP than cells treated only with E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E/F</xref>). Moreover, while most AXL KO cells have cytoplasmic YAP, parental cells displayed much more nuclear localization of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Consistent with the western blots of YAP S127-p, we observed AXL-independent, erlotinib-induced YAP nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E/F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B/C</xref>).</p><p id="P42">While several studies indicate that AXL can be a target of YAP when in complex with the DNA-binding TEAD proteins, thereby proposing that YAP acts upstream of AXL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>), others have reported that it is in fact AXL kinase activity which induces YAP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). A third role emerged when another study showed that AXL and the YAP homologue TAZ form a positive feedback loop to promote the development of lung cancer brain metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Our results additionally suggest that upon AXL activation, SFK, Abl1 and FAK1 kinases engage a network of cytoskeletal-remodeling, EMT-associated, signaling proteins that affect YAP translocation. We therefore explored the effect of indirectly disrupting YAP activity, via dasatinib, on AXL expression and activation and found that both total and phosphorylated AXL in PC9 parental cells decrease with increasing concentrations of dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G/H</xref>).

XAV-939 is a tankyrase inhibitor that is widely used as an indirect inhibitor of YAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). After treatment for 15 days, we replaced the treatment solutions with complete media and assessed the ability of resistant cells to regrow. We used RXDX-106 instead of R428 because RXDX-106 is more AXL-specific; R428 has been shown to trigger AXL-independent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). We found that EGFR inhibition alongside genetic or pharmacological inhibition of AXL modestly delayed the emergence of DTP cells, while combined EGFR and Erk1/2 blockade more strongly inhibited DTP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>). Triple inhibition of EGFR, AXL, alongside either YAP or Erk1/2, completely blocked the emergence of resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K/L</xref>). Consistent with the notion that dasatinib disrupts both AXL and YAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B/G/H</xref>), the combination of E and dasatinib prevented cancer cell regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K</xref>).

Leveraging the fact that, unlike in proteomics and phosphoproteomics data, all transcripts are measured by RNAseq in all tumor samples, we were able to confidently ascertain whether a Yap signaling signature is associated with AXL protein expression.

Our modeling and specificity screening results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicate that AXL proximally engages the adapters GAB1, SOS1, GRB2, and DAPP1 through Y821, a signaling cascade of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins such as NEDD9, PEAK1, and TJP2, as well as the kinases FAK1, ACK1, and DYRK1A/3 and the phosphatase SHP-2. Our model identified three clusters that most prominently correlate with malignancy, namely the phospho-serine cluster C1, and C2 and C3 which are formed by phospho-tyrosine sites. Given that we performed tyrosine phosphoproteomics and that, unlike C2 and C3, the transcriptional changes of C1 members did not correlate with poor patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), we decided to focus on C2 and C3. DDMC inferred that both clusters generally displayed favorable kinase motifs for SFK, whereas C2 additionally included key determinants of Abl1 specificity which suggested to us that these kinases might act as upstream regulators of C2 and C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H-J</xref>). SFK and Abl1 inhibition via dasatinib treatment effectively blocked AXL-mediated bypass resistance and selectively decreased the phosphorylation of C2 and C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A/F</xref>). Our bacterial specificity results showed that FAK1 Y861-p is a top AXL substrate in vitro and we observed that a FAK1 pathway signature was substantially inhibited by dasatinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F/G</xref>), which led us to hypothesize that FAK1 might play an important role in AXL bypass signaling. Indeed, we observed that FAK1 pY signaling was significantly enriched in PC9 parental compared with AXL KO cells and that the differentially phosphorylated peptides pertaining to the FAK1 signature were clustered in C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H/I</xref>). We then asked what transcriptional programs were most affected by AXL bypass signaling and identified a YAP signaling signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). We then experimentally showed through western blots, Luminex, and immunofluorescence that AXL activation induces YAP nuclear translocation and effector functions which in turn allows AXL activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-I</xref>). Finally, combination treatment of E and the Abl1/SFK inhibitor dasatinib, or the triple combination treatment of E, the AXL inhibitor RXDX-106, and indirect inhibition of YAP via XAV-939 or Erk1/2 inhibition via trametinib blocked the emergence of drug-tolerant persister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J-L</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P47">The reactivation of oncogenic pathways mediated by RTKs not targeted by therapy, referred as RTK bypass signaling, is a well-known resistance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Met activation has been shown to mediate bypass resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and, in fact, the identification of this resistance mechanism led to the recent FDA-approval of Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody directed against EGFR and MET for patients with advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC (NCT04599712) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). However, we still do not have a clear grasp on the signaling landscape that bypass RTKs activate to mediate drug resistance. Identifying key signaling networks driving bypass resistance may lead to (i) an increased mechanistic understanding of RTK inhibitors reaching the clinic and (ii) the identification of new drug targets. Several challenges intrinsic to the study of RTK downstream signaling, such as RTK crosstalk or signaling pathway interdependency, hinder the identification of the specific RTK phosphoproteomic and phenotypic changes driving bypass resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we devised a combined computational and experimental approach centered around the use of a panel of PC9 AXL Y-to-F mutant cell lines. Using these cell lines, we measured their phosphoproteomic and phenotypic changes during EGFR inhibition and AXL activation and applied multivariate modeling to identify the most prominent AXL-driven signaling pathways that promote cell fitness. This methodology naturally associates molecular and phenotypic variation observed across cell lines to identify AXL- and phenotype-specific signaling.</p><p id="P48">We identified three phosphosite clusters (C1, C2, and C3) that define an “AXL downstream signature” correlating with cell viability and migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G/H</xref>). C2 and C3, but not C1, correlated with poor treatment response, metastasis, and overall survival in LUAD patients alongside AXL expression. The gene and protein expression of the AXL downstream signature were significantly enriched in AXL-high EGFRm LUAD tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B/C</xref>) whereas the phosphorylation signal was significantly higher in EGFRm LUAD compared with WT tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <bold>S3B</bold>). It remains to be shown, however, whether the identified bypass signaling machinery is conserved across several RTKs or is AXL-specific. A re-implementation of this methodology with a wider panel of RTKs would help elucidate this question and similarly separate the various pathways downstream of each receptor. We observed some amount of AXL-independent, E-induced YAP activation, which suggests that other RTKs might also activate oncogenic YAP signaling. This is consistent with the fact that combined EGFR and AXL inhibition only achieves a delay in the emergence of resistance and that additionally blocking AXL downstream effectors such as YAP, the YAP upstream kinases SFK/Abl1/FAK1, or Erk1/2 completely kills DTP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J–L</xref>). Therefore, our data suggests that concomitantly targeting bypass downstream signaling might provide superior therapeutic efficacy to inhibiting only RTKs.</p><p id="P49">The Hippo pathway effector YAP is known to drive resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). Although YAP has been shown to upregulate AXL gene expression, other studies suggest that it is AXL which acts upstream of the transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). DDMC indicated that C2 and C3 display kinase motifs favored by Abl1 and SFK, respectively, and we found that dasatinib selectively inhibited both clusters, alongside YAP activation, which suggests that these clusters work upstream of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B/C</xref>). Moreover, transcriptomic profiling during switched AXL activation revealed a strong enrichment of YAP targets in AXL-activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). A recent study showed that a previously established FAK1 signaling signature activates YAP to mediate osimertinib resistance, whereas FAK1 inhibition through VS-4718 reduced YAP nuclear translocation and DTP survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). EA-treated PC9 cells show increased phosphorylation of C3 phosphosites of proteins pertaining to this FAK1 signature compared with EA-treated AXL KO cells which suggests that DTPs, at least in part, rely on AXL for FAK1-mediated YAP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H/I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K/L</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Whereas previous reports indicate that SFKs and Abl1 can be phosphorylated by AXL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), our bacterial display specificity screen shows that neither SFK nor Abl1 motifs are preferentially phosphorylated by AXL in vitro, suggesting that either such phosphorylation is particularly favored in cells or that this link is indirect. On the other hand, FAK1 which is a known regulator of SFK signaling, is among the top 5% of putative in vitro AXL substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).

Importantly, genetic ablation of YAP or inhibition of the YAP upstream kinases SFK and Abl1 by dasatinib decreased AXL protein expression and its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G–I</xref>) which indicates that the AXL-SFK/Abl1/FAK-YAP axis forms a positive feedback loop to promote malignancy.</p><p id="P51">Resistant cells to single-agent osimertinib can emerge through a variety of mechanisms, including Erk1/2 reactivation or YAP activation, whereas YAP activation becomes the dominant resistance mechanism of cells overcoming combined EGFR and MEK inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Here, we show that AXL can mediate both Erk1/2 reactivation and YAP activation during bypass signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Intriguingly, we show that SFK/Abl1 inhibition, and consequently YAP inactivation, through dasatinib treatment in EA-treated PC9 cells promotes Erk1/2 activation, whereas dasatinib treatment leads to loss of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in AXL KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). This suggests that AXL might enable cancer cells to rely in either Erk1/2 or YAP to overcome EGFR inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, long-term viability assays with TKIs showed that targeting AXL in addition to Erk1/2 or YAP is required to block the emergence of DTP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J–L</xref> and <bold>S5D–I</bold>).</p><p id="P52">A caveat of our methodology is that each AXL-transduced PC9 cell line expressed about 25% the amount of AXL on the cell surface and around 4-fold more of total receptor compared with their parental counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). The phosphoproteomic and phenotypic measurements from these cell lines were utilized to generate C1, C2, and C3 which allowed us form hypotheses about the key signaling pathways activated by AXL.

To discard any unchanging peptides across cell lines, we filtered out phosphosites out containing less than a 0.5-fold change between the maximum and the minimum across every cell line. Overlapping peptides were then averaged across replicates. The resulting preprocessed phosphoproteomic data set was then fit using DDMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Prediction of AXL-mediated Phenotypes using PLSR</title><p id="P66">To predict the AXL-mediated phenotypes, a 4-component PLSR model (scikit-learn) was built using the DDMC cluster centers. To assess the predictive performance of PLSR, leave-one-out cross-validation was applied; the model was trained using the paired cluster centers and phenotypic measurements in all cell lines except one. The cluster centers of that remaining cell line were used to predict its phenotypic measurements and a mean squared error between the predicted and actual value per phenotype was computed. This process was iterated across all cell lines to obtain a final predictive correlation per phenotype. To benchmark the ability of PLSR to predict the phenotypes using the DDMC clusters, we additionally fit PLSR using either the unclustered phosphoproteomic data set directly, k-means clustering, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), DDMC using only the peptide sequence information, or the selected DDMC model combining the phosphorylation and sequence information (referred as DDMC mix). All cluster methods were used with 5 clusters and the number of PLSR components used was optimized for each case.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Hyperparameter Selection</title><p id="P67">The preprocessed phosphoproteomic data set was fit to DDMC using 5 clusters, a sequence weight of 2, and 2 PLSR components. This hyperparameter combination was determined via an exhaustive hyerparameter search (<bold>Figure S3A-D</bold>). Using scikit-learn’s GridSearch, we assessed the ability of the pipeline model comprised of DDMC and PLSR to predict the AXL-mediated phenotypes using different hyperparameter combinations; namely 2 to 15 clusters, a sequence weight of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500, and 1 to 4 PLSR components. Note that a model with a sequence weight of 0 uses only the phosphorylation abundance for peptide clustering, a weight of 500 mainly uses the sequence information, and intermediate values use a combination of both information sources.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>RNAseq Sample Preparation and Sequencing</title><p id="P68">To generate the RNAseq data, 300,000 cells of each PC9 AXL Y-to-F mutant cell line were seeded in 100 mm dishes. The next day, each was treated with E or EA and, after 24 hours of treatment, cells were lysed with RIPA and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA sequencing and read alignment was performed by Novogene. Any genes with less than 10 TPM were filtered out.

Suspected phosphorylation sites were identified from these proteins to create 11-residue peptide sequences, with 5 residues flanking a central tyrosine on each end. The central tyrosine was represented with a ‘TAT’ codon, and the surrounding peptide sequences converted into DNA sequences that are codon-optimised based on E. coli codon usage and avoiding any SfiI restriction sites. For peptides containing tyrosine residues surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine site, we substituted those surrounding tyrosine residues for phenylalanine. All sequences were then flanked with 5’-GCTGGCCAGTCTGGCCAG-3’ on the 5’ side and 5’-GGAGGGCAGTCTGGGCAGTCTG-3’ on the 3’ side, as oligos. This oligo pool was generated using on-chip massively parallel synthesis (Twist Bioscience), and PCR amplified with Oligo-pool forward (5’-GCTGGCCAGTCTGGC-3’) and reverse (5’-CAGACTGCCCAGACTGC-3’) primers over 10 cycles. All PCR reactions were done with Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB), and PCR products were subsequently purified with DNA clean-up after each PCR and restriction.

The mixture was heated to 37℃ for 2 minutes, and 0.5 μL of 100 mM ATP was added to the reaction mixture. To evaluate AXL kinase activity 10 μL aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at 5-, 10-, 20-, 40-, and 80-minute intervals. For the final assay, 30 minutes reaction time was used.

Subsequently, the cells were pelleted at (1500 g, 20 min), and washed with 20 μL PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), before being pelleted as a precursor to antibody incubation. To evaluate the efficiency and kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction, the 10 μL pellets from 5-, 10-, 20-, 40-, and 80-minute reaction intervals were labelled by resuspension with 1:25 dilution of the PY20-PerCP-eFluor 710 conjugate (eBioscience) and 9E10 Alexafluor-488 conjugate (eBioscience) in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 hour on ice, in the dark.
