Here we demonstrate a correlation between the presence of <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> in natural soil communities and the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Further, introducing <italic>M. xanthus</italic> isolates also enriches antibiotic resistance. This is due to the mass lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, which results in a toxic environment that fosters the proliferation of pre-existing resistant bacteria rather than de novo resistance evolution. Metagenomic analysis revealed that this enrichment is not limited to the tested antibiotics in culture-based methods, indicating its broader relevance. Crucially, these findings go beyond laboratory settings, showing <italic>M. xanthus</italic> introduction enriches resistant isolates in natural soil communities. Finally, we demonstrate that the mass lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells during starvation-induced development—key aspect of the lifecycle of <italic>M. xanthus</italic>—also results in the enrichment of antibiotic resistance in soil communities. Together, we demonstrate how life-history traits in bacterial predators, like <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> significantly impact antibiotic resistomes in nature. This study also highlights the complex dynamics at play in the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the role of interspecies interactions in shaping antibiotic resistance profiles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Advances in sequencing and molecular technologies over last decade have revealed a previously unfathomable distribution and abundance of antibiotic resistance in varying geographical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and ecological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> conditions.

To do so, twenty-five random soil samples were first categorised as the ones in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was detected (16 out of 25) and the ones in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was not detected (9 out of 25). These samples were named as <italic>M. xanthus</italic> positive and <italic>M. xanthus</italic> negative soil samples, respectively. Next, frequencies of non-myxobacterial isolates resistant against clinically relevant antibiotics (Ampicillin, Gentamycin, Kanamycin, Rifampicin, Tetracycline, Vancomycin) were measured. These experiments revealed that the mean frequency of antibiotic resistant isolates in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> positive samples (0.5878 %) was higher relative to the samples in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was not detected (0.0012 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, independent-sample t-test for differences between arcsine square root transformed frequency of resistant microbes in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> positive soil and <italic>M. xanthus</italic> negative soil sample p = <italic>1.941e<sup>-14</sup></italic>).</p><p id="P7">Higher frequencies of resistant isolates can be the result of either one or many distinct isolates carrying resistance against a minority of the antibiotics used in our study. However, we observed resistance against majority of antibiotics in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> associated communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, independent-sample t-test for differences between soil samples in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was detected and the ones in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was not detected, p = <italic>0.0000656</italic>). Twelve out of sixteen <italic>M. xanthus</italic> positive soil samples harbored resistance against each of the six antibiotics and remaining four samples harbored resistance against five out of six antibiotics used. Whereas similar analysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> negative soil did not exhibit such high prevalence of resistance against the diversity of antibiotics tested.</p><p id="P8">Abundance of antibiotic resistant isolates was estimated using three distinct media types (see methods). Therefore, we also tested whether the media types in addition to the presence or absence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> can influence the frequency of antibiotic resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>, independent-sample t-test between M+ and M- conditions in each media type, LB (0.1X): p = <italic>3.864e<sup>-12</sup>;</italic> LB (1X) : p = <italic>2.2e<sup>-16</sup>;</italic> TSA (0.1X) : p = <italic>1.002e<sup>-08</sup></italic>). Our analysis revealed that only presence or absence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> had an effect on the resistance frequency and neither the media nor the identity of the soil community had an effect. Further, relative frequency of resistant isolates for different antibiotics varied greatly among distinct soil samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Together, these results show correlation between presence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and enrichment of antibiotic resistance in nature.</p><p id="P9">Strong correlation between the presence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> with a higher antibiotic resistance frequency in natural soil communities suggested that <italic>M. xanthus</italic> is responsible for the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria. To test this hypothesis, the effect of addition of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> on the changes in the abundance of antibiotic resistant isolates was measured. For this, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was inoculated with four randomly sampled soil communities in an antibiotic free environment, and frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria was estimated after 6 days of co-culture. These experiments revealed that across all the four soil communities introduction of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> resulted in an enrichment of resistant isolates across six clinically relevant antibiotics and three media conditions. On an average, across four soil communities 0.902 % isolates exhibited resistance to at least one or more antibiotics tested when the consortia were co-inoculated with <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Whereas mean frequency of antibiotic resistant isolates was significantly lower (0.000027 %) in soil communities which were not co-inoculated with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, paired-sample t-test for differences between percentage of resistant isolates when soil communities were cocultured with or without <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> p &lt; <italic>0.000004</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>, paired-sample t-test between M+ and M- conditions in each media type, LB (0.1X): p = <italic>4.218e<sup>-07</sup>;</italic> LB (1X) : p = <italic>5.554e<sup>-07</sup>;</italic> TSA (0.1X) : p = <italic>4.467e<sup>-05</sup></italic>)</p><p id="P10">We tested whether the enrichment of antibiotic resistant microbes brought about by <italic>M. xanthus</italic> is a more generalised response to presence of any <italic>M. xanthus</italic> isolate, or it is specific to the isolate used here. To do so, we repeated the assay with six randomly selected natural isolates of <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> These experiments revealed that only three of the six natural isolates tested could influence frequency of antibiotic resistant microbes in soil communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>, paired-sample t-test between day 0 and day 6 post addition of each <italic>M. xanthus</italic> to the community, p &lt; <italic>0.05</italic>). These results demonstrate that not all <italic>M. xanthus</italic> isolates can have the similar effect on the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria as the focal strain S3 used in this study.</p><p id="P11">Although introduction of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> resulted in enrichment of antibiotic resistant isolates, to further understand the dynamics of increase in the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria upon introduction of <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> we simultaneously tracked both <italic>M. xanthus’s</italic> growth and overall resistance frequency over the course of co-culture experiment. For this, four distinct soil communities were cocultured with <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> and population size of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria was measured every day for 6 days. These experiments demonstrated that <italic>M. xanthus</italic> could grow and increase in number for the first day, and then showed a drastic population decline reaching below detection limit after 2 days on incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Further, the frequency of resistance isolates increased only after day 2 of incubation i.e. once <italic>M. xanthus</italic> could no longer be detected. These findings suggest that the death of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> might be responsible for the enrichment of antimicrobial resistance in soil communities.</p><p id="P12">Our culture based detection method can detect frequency of resistant isolates against the antibiotics used in the assay, and may not reveal the overall abundance of antibiotic resistance across distinct antibiotic types. Therefore, to detect if addition of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> can alter the overall abundance of antibiotic resistance alleles within soil communities, total DNA was extracted from the communities that were either cocultured with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> or grown in its absence. Shotgun metagenome analysis of the extracted DNA revealed that antibiotic resistance genes were indeed enriched in the communities that were cocultured with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), compared to when <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was not added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, amongst the three major classes of antibiotic resistance genes (aminoglycosides, beta lactams and fosfomycins) that were detected in these communities, resitance against aminoglycosides enriched the most in the communities that were cocultured with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Together, metagenome analysis supports the results from culture based assays.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mass-lysis in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> population can modulate the environmental toxicity resulting in enrichment of antibiotic resistance</title><p id="P13">Since, bacteria are known to release antibiotics and growth inhibitors upon cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that mass-lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> population might also result in release of growth inhibitory diffusible substances in environment. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> is known to have a large repertoire of secondary metabolites that contributes differentially to specific life-cycle stages. For example, secretion of antibiotics, toxins, and enzymes during predation, secondary metabolites during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and diffusible substances to help germination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Sudden release of growth inhibitory substances such as antibiotics and toxins because of mass lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> might results in enrichment of microbes resistant to such substances.</p><p id="P14">To test this hypothesis, the spent media from coculture experiments in which <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was co-incubated with soil communities, were extracted at every 24 h interval. Freshly harvested soil communities were then inoculated in the medium conditioned with the harvested spent medium. If lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) results in the release of diffusible molecules that can potentially enrich antibiotic resistant bacteria, then addition of spent media from day 2 to soil communities should also result in the enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Whereas, spent media from day 1 and day 0 should not result in any enrichment. Since all of the results were consistent across six antibiotics used in earlier experiments, we measured resistance against three representative antibiotics from different classes. This was primarily done for the ease of logistics. In line with our expectations, addition of spent media from second day onwards can results in enrichment of resistance frequencies in complex soil communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We further show that the diffusible molecules present in the spent media from 2 day old coculture is indeed growth inhibitory to different lab strains of soil bacteria (<italic>A. globiformis, E. coli, P. putida and R. vitis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, one-sample t-test [FDR corrected] for relative growth of respective species, p &lt; <italic>0.02</italic>). Together, these result support the hypothesis that release of growth inhibitory substances in the environment by dying <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> may select for resistant isolates, thereby enriching overall antibiotic resistant isolates in complex communities.</p><p id="P15">Although our results show that the enrichment in antibiotic resistance is most likely brought about by presence of diffusible growth inhibitory molecules in the environment, we further tested if these molecules are specifically released as a result of lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells. To do so, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells were lysed by sonicating the vegetative cells (See methods), and the soil communities were cultured in the medium with and without <italic>M. xanthus</italic> lysate. These experiments demonstrated that on an average, introduction of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> lysate results in enrichment of antibiotic resistant isolates by 6472 percentage folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, paired-sample t-test between resistance frequencies where lysate was added or not added, p = <italic>0.032</italic>). Identification of the nature of the active molecules released by lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> requires extensive investigation. Hence, though it would be intriguing to identify the active molecules responsible for these observation, this aspect of the study is part of future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Enrichment of AMR in natural soil communities are most likely brought about by cell lysis during development phase of <italic>M. xanthus</italic></title><p id="P16">Starvation induced development of spore filled fruiting body is an important aspect of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> biology. Importantly, during the development process majority of (˜ 90 %) <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells die<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, death of majority of population is part of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> lifecycle. We hypothesised, that in nature, death during development might be responsible for the release of growth inhibitory substances that enrich antibiotic resistance in soil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). To test this, supernatant was extracted from population of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> after allowing them to form fruiting bodies on starvation media. Freshly extracted soil communities were then cultured either in the presence or the absence of this supernatant. Estimation of the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria in these experiments revealed that the addition of supernatant extracted from starved population of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> results in the enrichment of antibiotic resistant isolates by 13 % compared to when supernatant was not added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, Paired-sample Wilcoxon test, p = <italic>0.048</italic>). Hence, since mass-lysis of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> population is an essential part of its starvation response phase of the life cycle, abundance of antibiotic resistant isolates in the presence of M. xanthus might be because of the presence diffusible substances released by dying cells of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> during fruiting body formation.</p><p id="P17">Significance of reproducing laboratory experiments in nature has been highlighted time and again<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. While our laboratory experiments were conducted on liquid minimal media, we understand that conditions in soil may vary significantly, both in terms of nutrient content as well as structuredness of the environment. Additionally, while laboratory controlled experiments allows the maintenance of a constant abiotic conditions, it is expected that in nature, fluctuations in abiotic conditions are more common. Since both spatial structure and abiotic fluctuations can significantly influence community structure and ecological interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> it was possible that our observations may not hold true in nature. Hence, we investigated whether the findings of increased antibiotic resistance upon introduction of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> in complex soil communities, in lab conditions can also be reproduced in natural soil environment. Interestingly, similar to the outcomes from the experiments performed in liquid medium in lab conditions, introduction of natural isolate of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> in soil pockets in natural locations also results in increased frequency of resistant isolates. Overall, samples with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> contained 0.186 % percent resistant isolates relative to 0.005 % percent in the samples where <italic>M. xanthus</italic> was not inoculated. Combined with the first set of results which showed correlation between abundance of resistance and presence of <italic>M. xanthus,</italic> these results demonstrate that in nature <italic>M. xanthus</italic> strongly modulates abundance of antibiotic resistant microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, paired-sample t-test for differences between arcsine square root transformed frequency of resistant microbes when soil communities were cocultured with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and control p &lt; <italic>2.2e<sup>-16</sup></italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Our results demonstrate that both in lab as well as natural conditions, resistance to clinically used antibiotics is enriched in the presence of <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> First, we observed that <italic>M. xanthus</italic> associated soil communities harbor significantly higher frequency of antibiotic resistant isolates relative to the communities that seem to be not associated with <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Next, we demonstrated that introduction of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> in soil communities in lab as well as in natural conditions results in enrichment of antibiotic resistant isolates. Contrary to our expectations, antibiotic resistant isolates were not enriched directly by the presence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> within the communities. Instead, the changes in the microbial communities detected in our study were manifested by death of <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Taken together, we demonstrate that death of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> population, can result in the enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Further, the death of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> populations can be the result of the lifecycle of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> in which majority of the cells die during starvation induced fruiting body development, possibly explaining the reason for enrichment of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in the presence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> in natural communities. Significantly, our result demonstrates the correlation between presence of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the nature and explains the reason behind it.</p><p id="P19">The increased frequency of resistant isolates is most likely because of the enrichment of pre-existing resistant bacteria in the soil communities and not a result of de-novo evolution of resistance. This is because, all the soil samples used in our study exhibited antibiotic resistance even before the start of the co-inoculation experiments with <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Enrichment in frequencies of antibiotic resistant bacteria in these communities can either result from the ability of the resistant isolates to grow in the toxic environment or by simply persisting in that environment, while the abundance of the sensitive isolates declines. This is also evident in the metagenome analysis which revealed presence of genetic determinants previously reported to be responsible for antibiotic resistance. Moreover, the experiments were conducted for a total duration of six days, which is a relatively shorter time span for de-novo evolution of resistance against variety of antibiotics to emerge and to raise to the frequencies observed in our experiments.</p><p id="P20">Our experiments were conducted using natural soil communities, which might explain large differences in the outcomes of the experiments. Further, we primarily report increased abundance of antibiotic resistant isolates among culturable microbes. Therefore, it is important to be cautious and refrain from extrapolating the results to complete microbial communities where unculturable microbes are a dominant fraction. However, the metagenome analysis does reveal that the observations are likely to be true for overall microbiome which includes unculturable majority. Importantly, since most bacterial pathogens are culturable microbes that grow on heterotrophic proteinaceous medium lend importance to the findings reported here, even if the effects shown here are limited to culturable heterotrophic microbial diversity.</p><p id="P21">Death of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells is responsible for the changes in the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Important aspect of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> biology, i.e., formation multicellular spore filled fruiting bodies upon starvation is associated with death of majority of the population of <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Analysis of the sporulation efficiency of natural isolates of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> revealed that the highest sporulation efficiency among natural isolates was approximately ten percent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, at least ninety percent of vegetative cells in a population die during starvation induced development, and only minority become spores. Results presented in this manuscript demonstrate that the diffusible substances released during the fruiting body formation results in the enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus, we predict that in nature too, death of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> because of feast and famine cycles that drive growth and fruiting body development of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> respectively, will result in the enrichment of antibiotic resistant microbes.</p><p id="P22">Although, we show that it is indeed the lysate of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> that enriches resistance in prey, the precise mechanism or the active molecules that are primarily responsible for this environmental toxification are yet to be identified. Previously, analysis of the genome of lab strain of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> reveled presence of 19 biosynthetic clusters that are predicted to be involved in the synthesis of diffusible antimicrobial substances including antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate that with respect to the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> associated soil communities are different from the ones that were not associated with <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> suggesting that in nature <italic>M. xanthus</italic> has a long-term influence on local microbial community dynamics. Therefore, a detailed study to identify the nature of diffusible substances involved will be crucial for two reasons. First, understanding of the mechanisms driving community structure in the presence of <italic>M. xanthus.</italic> Second, to decipher the molecular basis for the observations reported in this manuscript.</p><p id="P23">Spread and abundance of antibiotic resistance has been primarily linked to the anthropogenic activities. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that resistance alleles can evolve even in the absence of antibiotics in the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Though our results do not demonstrate the evolution of antibiotic resistance, they demonstrate the possibility that microbial interactions can influence resistance in natural communities. Recently it was demonstrated that social interactions can modulate mechanisms and rate of emergence of antibiotic resistance in the presence of antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. These results demonstrated that obligate dependencies could reduce rate of emergence of resistance in cooperative populations. On the contrary, our results strengthen the possibility that microbes such as <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and other antimicrobial producers might accelerate the evolution of resistance in complex natural communities. Further, metagenome analysis in the past has also suggested that eukaryotic predators might also influence the abundance of antibiotic resistance bacteria, but it is unclear whether the predators themselves are the causal agents or it is in fact the bacterial interactions that drive the changes in the frequency of resistant isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we call for a broader investigation which will increase our awareness of the influence of microbial interaction dynamics on the ecology and evolution of resistance mechanisms. These studies are crucial for the overall understanding of the spread of antibiotic resistance in nature, and especially in pristine environments.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Strains and culture condition</title><p id="P24"><italic>M. xanthus</italic> isolate S2, S3 and CVH1 were isolated from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus using methods described in Kraemer &amp; Velicer, 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

The complete content of each flask was plated in CTT soft agar with Rifampicin (5 μg/mL, MP Biochemicals) in eight 150 mm plates, respectively. The plates were incubated for two weeks, and the eight Rifampicin resistant colonies were picked. Resistance to antibiotics can impart some cost of resistance and hence influence the growth with respect to the parental strain. Hence, the growth neutrality of the Rifampicin resistant strains was tested by growing both the parental (S3 strain) and Rifampicin resistant (S3 Rif strains) in CTT liquid till mid-log phase, adjusting their density to 5x10<sup>9</sup> cells/mL and spotting 10 μL of this density adjusted cultures on 20 mL CTT hard agar (1.5 % bacto agar) in 90 mm plates. The relative swarms of the strains on agar beds were recorded as a parameter of determining their respective growth. The relative growth of the resistant strain was to that of its parent stain was estimated by taking a ration of their swarm on CTT hard agar. For further experiments, S3Rif4 strain was selected since the relative growth of this strain was statistically indistinguishable from its parent strain (Data not shown here).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Estimation of antibiotic resistance frequency</title><p id="P28">To estimate frequency of resistant isolates samples were dilution plated on antibiotic free 0.1x TSA (Tryptic Soy Broth, HiMedia + 0.5 % Agar-Agar, Qualigens) media and on 0.1x TSA media with one antibiotic for which the resistance frequency was to be estimated.
