To dampen GPCR mediated inflammatory processes, several inhibitors targeting the receptors and/or their down-stream signals, have been developed. Potent and selective inhibitors for Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G proteins are available, but potent and specific inhibitors of Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins are lacking. Recently, Larixol, a compound extracted from the root of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic>, was shown to abolish human neutrophil functions induced by <italic>N</italic>-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), an agonist recognized by formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) which couple to Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins. The inhibitory effect was suggested to be due to interference with/inhibition of signals transmitted by βγ complexes of the Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins coupled to FPR1. In this study, we applied Larixol, obtained from two different commercial sources, to determine the receptor- and G protein- selectivity of this compound in human neutrophils. However, our data show that Larixol not only lacks inhibitory effect on neutrophil responses mediated through FPR1, but also on responses mediated through FPR2, a Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCR closely related to FPR1. Furthermore, Larixol did not display any features as a selective inhibitor of neutrophil responses mediated through the Gα<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs for platelet activating factor and ATP. Hence, our results imply that the inhibitory effects described for the root extract of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic> are not mediated by Larixol and that the search for a selective inhibitor of G protein dependent signals generated by Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled neutrophil GPCRs must continue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>G protein-coupled receptors</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>G protein inhibitors</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>NADPH-oxidase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of plasma membrane receptors in the human genome and include more than 800 different receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. To date, around 35% of all drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) act through GPCRs and ligands targeting GPCRs as well as reagents that regulate GPCR mediated responses are extensively exploited as novel drug candidates for various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. All members of the GPCR family have seven transmembrane-spanning α-helices that connect three intracellular loops and the C-terminal tail to three extracellular loops and the N-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The cellular activities regulated by the GPCRs are initiated by binding of an agonist to the so called orthosteric recognition cavity exposed on the surface of the cells expressing the receptor, and this binding structurally changes the receptor parts that couple to a signaling heterotrimeric G protein localized on the intracellular side of the membrane. The signal transduction upon agonist binding to the GPCRs is initiated by an activation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex (comprising two subunits, an subunit and a heterodimeric βγ subunit) and a dissociation of the GTP/GDP binding β/γ protein dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The human genome encodes for several different G protein subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] comprising 16 different α subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], five different β subunit from subtypes and 12 different γ subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] which basically all can couple to each other leading to a large variety of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Lately, the functional outcome of an activated GPCR based on its coupling to diverse β and γ subunits (which are tightly associated and form a β/γ protein dimer) has started to gain attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. However, the GPCRs are primarily classified based on their coupling to the more extensively studied subunits, which based on containing heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Yet, it should be mentioned that most data that has defined a similarities classifies GPCRs as coupled to either a Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>12/13</sub>, Gα<sub>q</sub> or Gα<sub>i</sub> containing heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Yet, it should be mentioned that most data that has defined a specific GPCRs’ coupling to either of the four classes of the heterotrimeric G proteins have been performed using cells that overexpress an exclusive GPCR that is combined with distinctive G proteins. This is primarily due to that the different signaling G proteins are very similar which makes it hard to perform such studies in naïve cells. In addition, the signaling similarity between different G proteins has also made it difficult to design/find selective inhibitors for a specific G protein which has led to that the identification of the signaling G protein coupled to a GPCRs expressed in naïve cells have been (and still is) challenging.</p><p id="P3">The available tool compounds used to identify the signaling G protein in naïve cells have for long been the toxins from the bacteria termed <italic>Vibro cholera</italic> (cholera toxin; inhibits Gα<sub>s</sub> containing G proteins) and <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (pertussis toxin; inhibits Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins). However, even though pertussis troxin is the best-established tool to inhibit Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], it has some limitations including some Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit regarding GPCRs expressed by human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Novel, selective, and potent G protein inhibitors have thus been eagerly awaited and among the different G proteins, specific Gα<sub>q</sub> subunit independent effects in a variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], requirement of long incubation times (≥ 1.5 hours) with human neutrophils for the inhibition to occur and doubtful specificity for inhibition of only the Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit and not the G depsipeptide inhibitors are now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. These have successfully been used to characterize G protein profiles for many GPCRs expressed in several different cells including human neutrophils. Based on the Gα<sub>q</sub> depsipeptide inhibitors it has become obvious that some neutrophil expressed GPCRs such as the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are, as expected, insensitive to Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibition whereas signaling through other receptors such as the PAF receptor (PAFR, the receptor for platelet activating factor [PAF]) and the purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub> (P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, the receptor for ATP), are hindered by Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibition, strongly suggesting that they couple to Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Recently, a diterpene extract from the root of plant termed <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic> was shown to inhibit neutrophil functions induced by the prototype neutrophil chemotactic peptide <italic>N</italic>-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), recognized by formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). The active compound in the inhibiting root extract was identified as Larixol (chemical structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) and the inhibition was suggested to be achieved through an effect on the interaction between the inhibitor and the heterodimeric βγ protein dimer of the Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G protein coupled to FPR1. Accordingly, the βγ subunit inhibitor present in the root of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic>, was shown to inhibit various fMLF mediated human neutrophil functions including the FPR1 mediated rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and activation of the superoxide anion generating NADPH-oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, as no data on the receptor/G protein selectivity were presented in their study, we aimed to characterize the inhibitory effects of Larixol on human neutrophil GPCR signaling by including Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled FPR1 and the closely related FPR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]), as well as the two Gα<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs (the PAFR and P2Y<sub>2</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Accordingly, we determined the inhibitory effects of Larixol on the response induced in human neutrophils by agonists specific for these GPCRs with focus on the agonist induced rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the production of superoxide anions generated by the NADPH-oxidase. However, our results do not reveal any GPCR/G protein selectivity of Larixol or display any evidence that the compound is an inhibitor of fMLF-mediated neutrophil functions as the presence of Larixol (obtained from two different commercial sources) did not display any inhibitory effect on human neutrophil responses mediated by activation of either of the two Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled FPRs (FPR1 or FPR2) expressed in human neutrophils.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="P4">Cytiva Ficoll-Paque™ Plus Media (#17-1440-03) was purchased from Fischer Scientific (Gothenburg, Sweden) and RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red (#11835030) was from Gibco (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden).

In summary, these data show that in contrast to what has been shown for Larixol extracted from the root of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], synthetic Larixol does not exhibit any inhibitory effect on the fMLF-induced NADPH-oxidase activity.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>3.3</label><title>Natural Larixol lacks inhibitory effect on the FPR1 and FPR2 mediated superoxide anion production</title><p id="P14">The published results, showing that Larixol inhibits Gα<sub>i</sub> protein signaling, were obtained using an extract from the roots of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Our results described above, showing that Larixol has no effect on GPCR signaling in neutrophils, were obtained with a synthetic compound. To determine the importance of the origin of the compound, we included a commercially available natural Larixol in our study.

The mechanism of action for this inhibitory effect was suggested to occur by blockage of G protein signaling through <italic>i)</italic> a direct interaction between the activated βγ complex associated with the Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit that together comprise the heterotrimeric G protein coupled FPR1 and <italic>ii)</italic> an indirect effect on selected FPR1 down-stream signaling kinases and enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In this study, we set out to characterize the GPCR selectivity of the inhibitory effects of Larixol in human neutrophils and to analyze the potential of the compound to act as a novel inhibitor of Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled human neutrophil expressed GPCRs in general. To do this we applied two commercially available variants of Larixol, one synthetic variant and one variant isolated from the turpentine oil of <italic>Larix sp</italic>. We then followed the methods described in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and pre-incubated isolated human neutrophils with Larixol (≥ 2 µM, for a minimum of three minutes at 37°C) prior to stimulation with different GPCR selective agonists and analysis of Larixol’s inhibitory effect on the transient rise in intracellular calcium ions and production of NADPH-oxidase derived superoxide anions. For thorough characterization of Larixol’s inhibitory effect we specifically choose four agonists that either selectively activates two different human neutrophil expressed Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs or two different human neutrophil expressed Gα<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Hence, the peptides fMLF and WKYMVM were used for activation of the Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled (pertussis toxin sensitive) FPR1 and FPR2, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], whereas PAF and ATP were used for activation of the Gα<sub>q</sub> coupled (YM-254890 sensitive) PAFR and the P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, respectively (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]). However, despite incubating neutrophils with up to 10 µM Larixol for ten minutes at 37°C prior to stimulation (the highest concentration and longest incubation time described for inhibition of fMLF mediated responses in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]) and stimulating neutrophils with a lower concentration of fMLF for the measurement of the transient rise in intracellular calcium ions (10 nM, instead of 100 nM as used in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]) our data did not reveal any inhibitory effect on the fMLF-induced human neutrophil responses. Furthermore, as our data also showed that Larixol was without effect on the human neutrophil responses induced by WKYMVM, our results strongly imply that Larixol is not a general inhibitor of Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled human neutrophil GPCRs. Moreover, our results also imply that Larixol is not a general inhibitor of Gα<sub>q</sub> coupled neutrophil expressed GPCRs, as the compound only had a minor inhibitory effect on the increase in intracellular calcium ions when induced by PAF but not by ATP and as Larixol had no effect on the NADPH-oxidase activity induced by PAF but showed a minor potentiating effect of this response when induced by ATP.</p><p id="P17">That is, we could not repeat the data by Liao <italic>et al</italic> showing an inhibitory effect on fMLF-induced neutrophil responses when using Larixol obtained as a diterpene extract from the root of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic>, a flowering plant that is native on a chain of islands southwest of Japan down to Taiwan. Based on the fact that the two commercially available sources of Larixol used in this study had a solvent purity &gt; 95 % and lacked effects on the fMLF-induced neutrophil signaling/function, it is reasonable to assume that the extract of Larixol used by Liao <italic>et al</italic> not only contains Larixol but also other compounds that might be responsible for the demonstrated inhibitory effects in their study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, this is hard to decipher as <italic>i)</italic> the exact purity of Larixol in the extract used by Liao <italic>et al</italic> is not specified, <italic>ii)</italic> the researchers responsible for the study do not have the extract used in the study in sufficient amounts to provide to other researchers and <italic>iii)</italic> as we have not been able to find a commercial source of Larixol extracted from the root of <italic>Euphorbia formosana</italic>. It should be noted that some of the researchers involved in the work that described Larixol as an inhibitor of fMLF-induced neutrophil functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] also has shown that fMLF-induced neutrophil functions can be inhibited by another compound (2’,3-dihydroxy-5-methoxybiphenyl [RIR-2]) extracted from the root of the Asian plant termed <italic>Rhaphiolepis indica</italic> (L.) Lindl. <italic>ex</italic> Ker var<italic>. tashiroi</italic> Hayata <italic>ex</italic> Matsum. &amp; Hayata (Rosaceae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Similar to the described mechanism of action for Larixol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], the inhibitory effect of RIR- 2 was suggested to be due to interference with/inhibition of signals generated by parts of the βγ complexes of the Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins coupled to FPR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Yet, it awaits to be shown if commercially available RIR-2 demonstrates a similar inhibitory effect.</p><p id="P18">The most commonly used and best-established inhibitor to date for determination of if a GPCR is coupled to Gα<sub>i</sub> is pertussis toxin (an exotoxin produced by the bacterium <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Pertussis toxin comprises six subunits, one pentameric cell-binding subunit and one catalytic subunit and is taken up by cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis upon binding to sialylated glucoconjugates on the plasma membrane. The exact endosomal route of pertussis toxin from the endosome to the cytosol is not known, but well in the cytosol pertussis toxin inactivates Gα<sub>i</sub> subunits through ADP-ribosylation resulting in that Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs uncouples from the Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit and thereby the signal transduction down-stream the receptor becomes disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, determination of if a GPCR is coupled to Gα<sub>i</sub> using pertussis toxin has certain limitations including some Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit independent effects such as enhancement of immune responses (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]) and doubtful specificity for inhibition of only the Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit regarding GPCRs expressed by human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. We and others have previously shown that, as expected, treatment of human neutrophils with pertussis toxin for ≥ 1.5 hours inhibits signaling/functions mediated by activation of FPR1 or FPR2 with fMLF or coupled PAFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The large similarities between the G proteins makes it hard to design/find inhibitors that selectively blocks signaling down-stream of receptors expressed in naïve cells. Although research to find new inhibitors is ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], the tools that are currently available are limited and every attempt to find new tool compounds is much appreciated by the research community. However, the results in this study together with our previous results in which we showed that a presumed Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibiting pepducin (P4Pal<sub>10</sub>, shown to inhibit responses mediated by several cell line expressed Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]), WKYMVM, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. However, when it comes to human neutrophils the G protein selectivity of pertussis toxin has been put into question as pertussis toxin treatment also induce inhibition of the Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled GPCRs (PAFR and/or P2Y<sub>2</sub>R) expressed by human neutrophils and monocytes but instead acts as a selective inhibitor of Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled FPR2 mediated responses in these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] clearly show that investigations of the precise mechanism and selectivity for a G protein as well as for selected GPCRs are required when new tool compounds targeting a specific Gα subunit are introduced.</p><p id="P19">The fact that specific Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitors recently have become available and demonstrated as very useful tool compounds for determination of if a GPCR is coupled to Gα<sub>q</sub>, has reduced the need α<sub>q</sub> does not inhibit G for new tool compounds for G selective compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P20">As the Gα<sub>q</sub> subunit family has been reported to play an important role in several immune system functions and comprise the largest and most diverse class of the four Gα subunit classes (Gα<sub>i</sub>12/13, Gα<sub>q</sub> or Gα<sub>i</sub>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], specific inhibitors of G containing G proteins are eagerly awaited. The exact pharmacological approach for design of such inhibitors has several challenging obstacles (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]) but the results presented in this study
