Through a clinically-focused lens, we combine single-nuclei RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and micro-focus computed tomography to elucidate the anatomy and transcriptional landscape of the human fetal ovary across key developmental timepoints (Carnegie Stage 22 until 20 weeks post conception). We show the marked growth and distinct morphological changes within the fetal ovary at the critical timepoint of germ cell expansion, and demonstrate that the fetal ovary becomes more transcriptomically distinct from the testis with age. We describe novel ovary developmental pathways, relating to neuroendocrine signalling, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial networks, piRNA processes, and inflammasome regulation. We define transcriptional regulators and candidate genes for meiosis within the developing ovary. Together, this work advances our fundamental understanding of human ovary development and clinical ovarian insufficiency phenotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In humans, testes or ovaries develop from the bipotential gonad at around 42 days post conception (dpc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. It is well established that testis determination is driven by expression of the male-typical testis-determining factor, <italic>SRY</italic>, at this timepoint, leading to upregulation of <italic>SOX9</italic> and a cascade of downstream pro-testis pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast to this, an “ovary-determining factor” similar to SRY has not been identified, and for many years ovary development was considered a largely “passive” process occurring in the absence of SRY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. A key differentiating feature between ovary and testis development are the biological processes of germ cell expansion and meiotic entry that occur in the fetal ovary. These primordial follicles – representing an individual’s entire ovarian reserve and the germ cell pool for the next generation – are suspended in meiosis I until puberty many years later. The advent of high throughput transcriptomic approaches has begun to characterize ovary development and its key biological processes in previously unparalleled detail, revealing the process to be multigenic, complex and, still, only partially understood.</p><p id="P3">Initial microarray studies of gene transcription in developing mouse gonads were first reported at scale in 2007 and introduced the concept that a similar number of genes were differentially expressed in the ovary compared to the testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Many of these genes were proposed to antagonize testis development or were involved in meiosis. Analysis of developing human gonad tissue eventually followed. An array-based RNA-sequencing atlas confirmed that the human fetal ovary had a discrete transcriptomic signature with clearly upregulated ovary-enriched genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Some of these had known roles in the developing ovary, such as <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>POU5F1</italic> (OCT3/4), whereas the roles of others remained elusive. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed little further insight with most genes not annotated to known biological functions.</p><p id="P4">More recently, a bulk RNA-sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) study of human developing gonadal tissue between 6 and 17 weeks post conception (wpc) demonstrated several expected features, such as marked upregulation of meiotic transcripts, but also some novel findings, such as an enrichment of non-coding RNAs and genes with no clear link to ovary development (e.g., neuropeptide <italic>TAC1</italic> and neurexin <italic>NRXN3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. A limited number of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have recently built upon these foundations to demonstrate important cell-cell interactions, ovary developmental pathways, and gonadal somatic and germ cells crosstalk (such as FGF9-FGFR2 and PROS1-TYRO3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. New technologies have facilitated further multi-modal -omic analyses; particularly, the integration of single cell ATAC-sequencing (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing) with single-cell data has elucidated novel post-transcriptional regulatory layers in the developing ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Lastly, larger-scale analyses involving multiple species demonstrate <italic>human-specific</italic> aspects of gonadal development; for example, the observation that expression of <italic>KLF4, ELF3</italic>, and <italic>ZNF581</italic> is highly specific to the human germ cell specification programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the potential limitations of applying animal RNA-seq data to humans and the importance of studying human gonadal tissue where possible.</p><p id="P5">Using bulk and single-cell technologies in isolation to assess transcriptomic expression in tissues has limitations. Single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) provides granular transcriptomic detail, localizes gene expression to individual cell populations, and reconstructs cellular differentiation networks <italic>in silico</italic>. However, sensitivity can be low and only a proportion of the transcriptome may be captured. Bulk RNA-seq captures a higher proportion of transcriptomic activity, but sensitivity is also compromised in that low-level expression from small but important cell populations can be lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, while large-scale RNA sequencing atlases provide vital information about transcriptional landscapes, the potential clinical impact of these findings is not always explored. If the genetic mechanisms that span a female reproductive lifecourse from fetal life to adulthood are disrupted, ovarian dysfunction can result. This manifests in a range of clinical phenotypes including ovarian insufficiency occurring in isolation (Primary Ovarian Insufficiency, POI), as a feature of an extra-ovarian syndrome (e.g., Perrault Syndrome), or as part of a Difference of Sex Development (DSD) (e.g., aromatase [<italic>CYP19A1</italic>] deficiency). POI affects up to 1% of women and results in infertility, a need for lifelong hormone replacement therapy, and medical co-morbidities including cardiovascular and bone health consequences. DSD is less common and represents several conditions diagnosed at different timepoints across the reproductive lifecourse. Next generation sequencing approaches have increased the genetic diagnostic yield in reproductive disorders – for example, a genetic cause is identified in over 20% of women with POI and 30% of those with DSD, although most remain unexplained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A granular understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the genetically heterogenous condition of ovarian insufficiency is key for an individualized approach to clinical management and reproductive counseling. Further, this knowledge may be harnessed to develop novel fertility preservation techniques, particularly if the pre-symptomatic period is exploited before complete loss of ovary function.</p><p id="P6">Here, we combine snRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets to provide insight into the anatomy and transcriptional landscape of the developing human fetal ovary across a critical time period, uniquely doing so through a clinically-focused lens.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The ovary undergoes marked morphological changes during fetal development</title><p id="P7">In order to characterize changes in human ovary morphology between Carnegie Stage (CS) 22/23 (8wpc) and 20wpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), detailed measurements of ovary size were coupled with micro-focused computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis of anatomical location of the ovary in the developing female fetus, and with high resolution micro-CT-generated images of ovarian surface anatomy.</p><p id="P8">Fetal ovary growth curves (n=27 samples) were generated that showed substantial changes in size across this critical time period, with the most marked increase in weight and length from 17wpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The fetal ovary also undergoes distinct anatomical changes, as shown by coronal and axial micro-CT images of four ovaries <italic>in situ</italic> between 12wpc and 19wpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). These images demonstrate the anterior and lateral migration of both ovaries within the abdomen in early development, from their early location on the posterior abdominal wall near the adrenogonadal primordium to a more lateral position in the developing pelvic cavity. By 20wpc, micro-CT clearly shows that the ovary has a distinct blood supply entering the hilum and is in close apposition to the developing fimbriae of the Fallopian tube, as is typical of adult anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The fetal ovary and testis become transcriptomically distinct with age</title><p id="P9">In order to define transcriptomic changes over time, bulk RNA-seq was undertaken using a total of 47 embryonic/fetal organs at four developmental stages (CS22-23 (7.5 to 8 wpc); 9-10wpc; 11-12wpc; 15-16wpc). This included 19 ovaries (46,XX; n=5 biological replicates at each of CS22/23, 9/10wpc, and 11/12wpc; n=4 replicates at 15/16wpc); 20 testes (46,XY; n=5 replicates at each of the four developmental stages); and eight 46,XX control tissues (two different tissue samples per development stage, including spleen, skin, kidney, muscle, stomach, lung, and pancreas) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The selection of control tissue ensured a mix across endo-, meso-, and ectoderm cell lineages, and at similar stages of development.</p><p id="P10">Gene expression profiles between the three groups – ovary, testis, and control – were compared using principal component analysis (PCA) and by generating heatmaps and cluster dendrograms. Samples clearly clustered together according to developmental stage and tissue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). PCA analysis demonstrated that the testis and ovary are more similar to one another than to corresponding control tissue, particularly at earlier developmental stages, and adopt a divergent transcriptomic profile with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Differential gene expression analyses across all developmental timepoints were performed to identify positively and negatively differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between all 1) ovary <italic>versus (v)</italic> testis samples; 2) ovary <italic>v</italic> control samples; 3) testis <italic>v</italic> ovary samples; and 4) testis <italic>v</italic> control samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 2-5</xref>). Overlaying highly DEGs (log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;2, p.adj&lt;0.05) within these analyses revealed ovary-specific (positively DEGs in the ovary <italic>v</italic> control <underline>or</underline> ovary <italic>v</italic> testis datasets); testis-specific (positively DEGs in the testis <italic>v</italic> control <underline>or</underline> testis <italic>v</italic> ovary datasets); and gonad-specific (positively DEGs in the ovary <underline>and</underline> testis within the four analyses) factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). A subset of “highly ovary-specific” genes (n=228) was compiled from genes differentially expressed in both the ovary <italic>v</italic> control <underline>and</underline> ovary <italic>v</italic> testis analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Four time-specific differential gene expression analyses were also performed between ovary <italic>v</italic> testis samples at CS22/23, 9/10wpc, 11/12wpc, and 15/16wpc, and between ovary samples at CS22/23 and 15/16wpc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 7-11</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Globally, the ovary and testis had distinct transcriptomic signatures with increasing divergence in gene expression patterns over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). Indeed, more DEGs were seen in the developing ovary compared to testis, both globally and at individual developmental stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Transcripts of long non-coding RNA genes (lncRNAs) were also captured. Notably, there were significantly more differentially expressed non-coding RNA transcripts in the ovary compared to both testis and control samples (log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;2, p.adj&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Of the 200 non-coding transcripts positively differentially expressed in the ovary compared to either control or testis, 65.7% (n=135) were ovary-specific and 19.5% (n=39) were highly ovary-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 13</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs in the ovary compared to controls (n=1229; log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;2; p.adj&lt;0.05) demonstrated an enrichment of gene ontology terms related to meiosis, gametogenesis, and/or oogenesis (n=122 genes; 9.9% of total DEGs) as well as an enrichment of genes relating to neuroactive signaling (n=55 genes; 4.5% of total; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>); steroid hormone metabolism (n=55 genes; 4.5% of total); and piwi RNA (piRNA) processing (n=28 genes; 2.3% of total) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Enrichment analysis of DEGs in the ovary compared to testis showed a similar enrichment of genes relating to meiosis (n=61 genes; 9.7% of total DEGs) and neuroactive signalling, neurotransmitter development, and/or neural development (n=101; 16.0% of total DEGs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The highly ovary-specific geneset (n=288) was analysed separately and was found to be particularly enriched for meiosis genes (n=29; 10.1% of total geneset); G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling (n=18; 6.3% of total DEGs); neuroactive signalling (n=9; 4.1% of total DEGs); and steroid hormone biosynthesis (n=8; 2.8% of total DEGs).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Combining bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq provides novel insight into ovary development</title><p id="P14">To link the findings in bulk RNA-seq time series analysis to individual cell types, snRNA-seq was undertaken at a critical stage of ovary development: the onset of meiosis.</p><p id="P15">For this analysis, snRNA-seq profiled a total of 10,291 cells from one 46,XX 12wpc and one 46,XX 13wpc fetal ovary (quality control data: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) and yielded a UMAP projection of the snRNA-seq transcriptome of the peri-meiotic ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Cell annotation was assigned using established and recently identified markers in previous single-cell sequencing analyses of gonadal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 14</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The bulk RNA sequencing and single-nuclei data were then used to localize key DEGs of interest to cell population and developmental stage. To validate this approach, the datasets were first used to explore genes with established function in ovarian development. Germ cell markers (<italic>DDX4, SYCP1, STRA8, MEIOC, DAZL)</italic> and granulosa cell markers (<italic>GATA4, KITLG, NR2F2, UPK3B, IRX3)</italic> were expressed in the expected cell subpopulations and at predicted developmental timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Next, the single-nuclei data were used to explore highly differentially expressed ovary-specific genes discovered in the bulk RNA-seq dataset (log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;2.5) that had no, or limited, reported associations with ovary development. Several potentially novel patterns emerged.</p><p id="P16">Firstly, a high number of DEGs with acknowledged roles in male gonadal and germ cell development, but with little previously described roles in the ovary, were identified. For example, <italic>FKBP6</italic>, the FK506 binding protein, has an essential role in male fertility and meiosis, but no acknowledged role in female gametogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>FKBP6</italic> was highly differentially expressed in the ovary compared to controls (log<sub>2</sub>FC 7.67) and testis (log<sub>2</sub>FC 2.55) in this analysis. <italic>FKBP6</italic> had higher expression at female meiosis and localized to fetal germ cells (FGC) and oogonia cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). In the testis, <italic>FKBP6</italic> is required for piRNA metabolism and normal pachytene progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Here, gene expression within the developing ovary was found to be particularly enriched for piRNA-related genes. Thus, <italic>FKBP6</italic>, possibly within piRNA networks, may have a role in female as well as male meiosis.</p><p id="P17"><italic>MAGE</italic> genes (melanoma antigen genes) are members of the cancer-testis family classically associated with spermatogonia development where they protect the male germline against environmental stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>MAGE</italic> genes have little known function in female tissues and are not expressed in the adult ovary in the Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, <italic>MAGEA1</italic> has been associated with proliferating germ cells in the developing ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In our dataset, <italic>MAGEA1</italic> was differentially expressed in the ovary compared to control tissue (log<sub>2</sub>FC 2.77). Other <italic>MAGE</italic> genes were very highly differentially expressed in the ovary; for example, <italic>MAGEB2, MAGEC1, MAGEA10</italic>, and <italic>MAGEB1</italic>, all X chromosome genes, were among the top 50 differentially expressed genes in the ovary compared to controls (log<sub>2</sub>FC 9.82, log<sub>2</sub>FC 9.70, and log<sub>2</sub>FC 8.66, respectively) and <italic>MAGEA10</italic> was one of the most highly ovary-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). Although overall counts were modest, the expression of these genes increased at meiosis and clustered to developing germ cells in snRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). These data suggest an unexplored function for the <italic>MAGE</italic> gene family during germ cell development in the fetal ovary.</p><p id="P18">Highly differentially expressed genes with no known role in gonadal development were also identified. For example, <italic>CRYM</italic>, a highly-specific ovary gene here (ovary <italic>v</italic> testis log<sub>2</sub>FC 4.93; ovary <italic>v</italic> control log<sub>2</sub>FC 4.91), has no previously described function in ovarian development but is known to modulate thyroid hormone receptor activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thyroid hormone has been proposed to regulate steroidogenesis in the developing granulosa cell in response to gonadotropins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>; here <italic>THRA</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>THRB</italic>, localised to pre-granulosa cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In these data, <italic>CRYM</italic> clearly localized to the pre-granulosa cell clusters and was highly expressed from 9/10 weeks onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>CYP19A1</italic>, encoding aromatase (an enzyme essential for estrogen biosynthesis and folliculogenesis), was another highly ovary-specific gene in our dataset (ovary <italic>v</italic> testis log<sub>2</sub>FC 4.13; ovary <italic>v</italic> control log<sub>2</sub>FC 4.05). <italic>CYP19A1</italic> is known to be expressed from granulosa cells; interestingly, here, it was mostly expressed from oogonia cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). This posits a potential role for crosstalk between pre-granulosa cell and oogonia populations in the earliest stages of folliculogenesis in fetal life.</p><p id="P19">Another highly expressed gene in the ovary across multiple analyses was <italic>NLRP7</italic>, a modulator of cellular inflammation with no recognised role in human ovary development (ovary <italic>v</italic> testis log<sub>2</sub>FC 3.16; ovary <italic>v</italic> control log<sub>2</sub>FC 9.56). Expression was most marked at meiosis and localized to all primordial germ cell (PGC), FGC, and oogonia cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c, Figure 3e</xref>).

We show the antero-lateral movement of ovaries in the fetal abdomen throughout the second trimester and, using high resolution surface micro-CT imaging, demonstrate that by 20wpc the human ovary has a complex structure with hilar vascularization and close apposition to the fimbriae of the oviduct (Fallopian tube), which has already adopted mature anatomical features by this stage. We show marked growth and weight of the developing ovary from 16wpc onwards, corresponding with the massive germ cell expansion and meiosis occurring at this time. We advance our understanding of germ cell development, an ovary developmental timepoint essential for its later maintenance and function: by 20-22wpc, the ovaries of 46,XX fetuses have the maximum number of oogonia (approximately 7,000,000) they will hold during their entire reproductive lifetime, representative of their lifetime ovarian reserve. Disruption of this critical timepoint results in insufficient germ cell expansion and/or accelerated apoptosis of this ovarian reserve, resulting in the fewer germ cells at birth, smaller ovaries macroscopically, and the clinical phenotype of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).</p><p id="P30">We then used a series of transcriptomic approaches to show that the fetal ovary has a clear transcriptomic blueprint across all developmental timepoints defined by thousands of differentially expressed protein-coding genes as well as non-coding transcripts. Indeed, the fetal ovary has more differentially expressed genes at the developmental timepoints studied than the testes, firmly rejecting the concept of ovary development being a “default” pathway.

Micro-CT scans were carried out using a Nikon XTH225 ST scanner (Nikon Metrology, Tring, UK) with the following factors: Tungsten target, X-ray energy 100-110 kV, current 46-60 μA (power 6.6 Watts), exposure time 1420-2000 ms, one frame per 3141 projections, detector gain 24 dB, scan duration 75 minutes. Modified Feldkamp filtered back projection algorithms were used for reconstructions within proprietary software (CTPro3D; Nikon Metrology) and post-processed was undertaken using VG StudioMAX (Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) to create the images at 3.78-4.77 μm isotropic voxel sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Bulk RNA-sequencing</title><sec id="S18"><title>RNA extraction</title><p id="P39">RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN N.V.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, tissues frozen at -70 degrees were homogenized using an electronic pestle (Kimble, New Jersey) and the lysate was transferred to an AllPrep DNA spin column placed in a 2ml collection tube. This was centrifuged for 30 seconds at 8000g and 250μl 100% ethanol was added to the flow-through and pipette mixed. Following this, 700μl of the sample was transferred to a RNeasy spin column and centrifuged for 15 seconds at 8000g. The flow-through was transferred to a 2ml collection tube and 700μl of Buffer RW1 added. A 15 second centrifugation followed at 8000g to wash the spin column membrane. Next, 500μl of Buffer RPE was added to the RNeasy spin column and centrifuged for 15 seconds. The flow-through was discarded and 500μl of Buffer RPE again added followed by a longer two-minute centrifugation at 8000g. Extracted RNA was diluted in 30μL of nuclease-free water applied directly to the spin column membrane. RNA concentration and 260/280 ratios were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Witec, Littau, Switzerland). The minimum amount of RNA required for sequencing was 50ng with a 260/280 ratio of &gt;2.0.

All samples and reagents were kept on wet ice or at 4°C throughout. In brief, tissue samples were diced using a scalpel into approximately 1mm<sup>3</sup> pieces. Samples were then dissociated in 300μL of Salty Ez10 Lysis Buffer supplemented with 0.2-0.5U/μL of RNase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) using a 2ml Kimble douncer (Sigma-Aldrich) (10 strokes with loose pestle and 10 strokes with tight pestle) to achieve single nuclei suspensions. An extra 700μl of chilled Salty Ez10 Lysis Buffer supplemented with 0.2-0.5U/μl of RNase inhibitor was added to the samples and gently pipette mixed. Samples were incubated on ice for five minutes and slowly pipette mixed on 2-3 occasions during incubation. A MACS 70μm filter (Miltenyi Biotec) was placed in a 50ml Falcon tube on ice. The single nuclei suspension was transferred to the filter and then the filtrate transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf). Nuclei were centrifuged at four degrees at 500g for five minutes. The supernatant was removed to leave a pellet. Salty Ez10 Lysis Buffer was added (1ml) and the pellet resuspended gently before a further five-minute incubation on ice and five-minute centrifugation as before. The supernatant was removed, 500μl of Wash and Resuspension Buffer 2 (WRB2) added without disturbing the pellet, and the sample left to sit on ice for five minutes before being gently resuspended.

Following this, 31.8μl of MasterMix was added to an 8-tube PCR strip on ice. The Chromium Next Gel bead in EMulsion (GEM) Chip G was assembled as per instructions. Based on total cells/μl in each sample, the 10X Genomics Cell Suspension Volume Calculator table was used to calculate the ratio of nuclease-free water: single nuclei suspension to add to row 1 of the chip. Gel Beads were dispensed into the row 2. Partitioning Oil (45μl per sample) was dispensed into row 3. 10,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium Next GEM Chip G (10X Genomics).

From this mixture, 125μl was discarded from the bottom of the tube. Dynabeads Cleanup Mix was then prepared (1X: 182μl Cleanup Buffer, 8μl DynaBeads MyOne SILANE, 5μl Reducing Agent B, 5μl Nuclease-Free Water) and 200μl of this solution added to each sample and pipette mixed ten times followed by a ten-minute incubation. The samples were then placed on a magnetic separator (10X Genomics, Chromium™ Controller Accessory Kit) until the solution cleared. Supernatant was removed and 300μl of ethanol added to the pellet while on the magnet. After 30 seconds, this ethanol was removed and the sample centrifuged briefly and air dried for one minute. Elution Solution 1 (35.5μl) was then added to the sample, pipette mixed, and incubated for two minutes at room temperature. The solution (35μl) was then transferred to a new PCR strip for cDNA amplification.

The sample was then transferred to a pre-cooled thermal cycler (four degrees) and run as per protocol for 35 minutes. Double-sided size selection followed: 30μl of SPRIselect (0.6X) reagent was added to each sample, mixed, and incubated for five minutes at room temperature. Samples were placed on the magnet until the solution cleared. Then, 75μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new PCR strip and 10μl SPRIselect (0.8X) added to each sample.
