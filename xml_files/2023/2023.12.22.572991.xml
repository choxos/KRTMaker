However, the control of living systems outside of their native environments is often challenging. Here, we engineered a photosynthetic living material for dual CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration by immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms within a printable polymeric network. The carbon concentrating mechanism of the cyanobacteria enabled accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> within the cell, resulting in biomass production. Additionally, the metabolic production of OH<sup>-</sup> ions in the surrounding medium created an environment for the formation of insoluble carbonates via microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Digital design and fabrication of the living material ensured sufficient access to light and nutrient transport of the encapsulated cyanobacteria, which were essential for long-term viability (more than one year) as well as efficient photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. The photosynthetic living materials sequestered approximately 2.5 mg of CO<sub>2</sub> per gram of hydrogel material over 30 days via dual carbon sequestration, with 2.2 ± 0.9 mg stored as insoluble carbonates. Over an extended incubation period of 400 days, the living materials sequestered 26 ± 7 mg of CO<sub>2</sub> per gram of hydrogel material in the form of stable minerals. These findings highlight the potential of photosynthetic living materials for scalable carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral infrastructure, and green building materials. The simplicity of maintenance, coupled with its scalability nature, suggests broad applications of photosynthetic living materials as a complementary strategy to mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>living materials</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration</kwd><kwd>3D printing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biological ecosystems, such as forests, aquatic systems, and wetlands, offer efficient pathways for carbon sequestration (storing carbon in a carbon pool) and conversion into carbon-based materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism of many photosynthetic microorganisms accumulates CO<sub>2</sub> within the cell body up to 1000-fold above ambient levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Subsequently, concentrated carbon can be fixed in the form of biomass generated during growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to biomass production, microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) in certain species can sequester CO<sub>2</sub> irreversibly in the form of inorganic carbonate precipitates. MICP proceeds via multiple metabolic pathways, including ureolysis, sulfate reduction, and denitrification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In some organisms, MICP can occur as a direct by-product of photosynthesis, whereby the inorganic precipitates effectively act as an additional carbon sink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, enabling dual carbon sequestration. In this context, immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms, such as algae and cyanobacteria, within a support matrix may provide an approach to drive biological CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration in the form of engineered photosynthetic living materials via dual carbon sequestration.</p><p id="P4">To date, engineered living materials have primarily been used for applications in biomedicine, sustainable materials production, and as living building materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. For example, MICP has been exploited, primarily via ureolysis, to mechanically reinforce living materials based on the in situ formation of a stiff mineral phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Robust composites were produced via biomineralization using ureolytic MICP within a cellulose matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Similarly, precipitates deposited in porous materials filled cracks and improved mechanical properties of composite building structures as well as consolidated soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Ureolytic MICP is attractive due to its short incubation period (typically 1-4 days), resistance to contamination, and rapid biomineralization; however, it poses substantial environmental concerns due to the associated production of large amounts (1-2 equimolar) of ammonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Further, ureolytic MICP requires a constant supply of urea and only proceeds in a narrow range of environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These challenges restrict the use of ureolytic MICP for long-term CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Many of these limitations can be addressed with photosynthetic MICP, which requires no additional feedstocks and produces no toxic by-products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Recently, photosynthetic MICP was used to design living building materials that mineralized over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.

Cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. strain PCC 7002 (herein referred to as PCC 7002) was chosen for this work as it possesses many prominent advantages. This strain can synthesize complex carbohydrates using light, inorganic nutrients found in seawater, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as the main carbon source. Further, PCC 7002 is capable of photosynthetic MICP, exhibits a fast doubling time (∼2.6 h under optimal conditions), and tolerates variations in light intensity and osmotic pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

Dual CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration proceeds via both reversible biomass accumulation and irreversible mineral precipitation. For carbon concentration to occur, CO<sub>2</sub> from the surrounding environment dissolves in aqueous solutions and forms bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) that are then transported to the bacterial carboxysome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Here, carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the carboxysome converts the bicarbonate species into a hydroxyl ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub>. The OH<sup>-</sup> is excreted to the exterior of the bacterium and the CO<sub>2</sub> is fixed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) during photosynthesis into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, which is enzymatically converted into sugars that support cell growth and biomass production. Due to the metabolic production of OH<sup>-</sup>, the local pH value of the local medium surrounding the bacteria increases. This increase in pH, combined with negatively charged extracellular polysaccharides on the bacterial membrane, creates a favorable environment for the nucleation and formation of insoluble carbonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In the presence of divalent cations, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the medium is consumed and fixed irreversibly into calcium or magnesium carbonates. Chemical equilibrium then favors the dissolution of additional atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into the culture medium, continuously driving the dual carbon sink.</p><p id="P7">Cyanobacteria PCC 7002 was encapsulated in a hydrogel matrix to fabricate photosynthetic living materials capable of dual carbon sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). A synthetic polymeric hydrogel based upon Pluronic F127 (F127) was chosen for the encapsulation of cyanobacteria due to its bioinert nature and its processing versatility. F127-based hydrogels have been used in the design of engineered living materials due to the facile diffusion of most small molecules through it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Functionalized F127-bis urethane methacrylate (F127-BUM) can be photo-cross-linked either post-printing or processed directly via light-based additive manufacturing for long-term structural stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). In order to structure the photosynthetic living materials using digital fabrication, we designed a bioink (13.2 wt% F127 and 7.3 wt% F127-BUM) that maintained high viability of encapsulated PCC 7002 and printability via direct ink writing and light-based additive manufacturing. Rationally designed hydrogel network allows the access of light into the scaffold, thereby enabling homogeneous bacteria growth throughout the entire structure.</p><p id="P8">Bioink transparency is required for efficient light transmission to drive photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Light attenuation due to absorption and scattering within the bioink is one of the main challenges to overcome during cultivation of encapsulated photosynthetic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The F127-based hydrogel transmitted light (76 ± 3%) over the entire visible wavelength range (400–750 nm); the BG11-ASNIII medium used to culture PCC 7002 had 95 ± 4% transmittance in the same range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).

After 10 days of incubation samples exhibited visible clusters of PCC 7002 cells as well as many individual cells throughout the volume of the hydrogel matrix. The number of clusters and individual cells increased with time. The change in pH of the culture medium was attributed to carbonic anhydrase activity in the carboxysome of the bacterial cells. Using HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as a substrate, carbonic anhydrase generates equimolar amounts of OH<sup>-</sup> ions, which are excreted into the surrounding medium, and CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, which are integrated into bacterial metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. As the medium was changed every 5 days, the cumulative amount of OH<sup>-</sup> ions was reflected in the pH increase of the medium from the initial pH value of 6.5. The cumulative OH<sup>-</sup> ion production served as a surrogate measure of carbonic anhydrase activity and CO<sub>2</sub> integration into biomass <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Between days 5 and 10, the pH of the biotic samples increased to 9.5, corresponding to approximately three orders of magnitude increase in OH<sup>-</sup> concentration. In each subsequent 5-day interval, the pH increased by 1.8–2.9 with an average of more than two orders of magnitude increase in OH<sup>-</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6a</xref>). The cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered was calculated based on the pH change of the medium (<bold>calculations in the Supplementary Information, CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration by biomass growth (pH change) in living materials</bold>). Over the first 15 days the cumulative amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered per gram of living material was 3.3 μmol (0.15 mg) and reached a value of 7 μmol (0.31 mg) by the end of the 30-day experiment, an increase that reflects CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration corresponding to biomass accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).

This prolonged viability of the photosynthetic living materials showed that dual carbon sequestration can take place beyond 30 days, especially within rationally designed 3D structures.</p><p id="P18">To demonstrate the scalable production of photosynthetic living materials, direct ink writing was used to print similar lattice structures at a larger scale. A body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure (unit cell length l = 5 mm, strut diameter d = 0.12 mm) was printed. The structure passively perfused medium to the top surface while only partially immersed in BG11-ASNIII medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>). After 60 days of incubation, the lattice was thermally decomposed (T = 600 °C). The remaining carbonate precipitates after thermal decomposition retained the shape of the porous lattice structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>), indicating that carbon sequestration was homogeneous throughout the structure despite being partially immersed in medium.</p><p id="P19">This living material also has the potential to be applied on existing surfaces as coatings for dual carbon sequestration.

The diverse functionality of microorganisms has enabled the design and application of engineered living materials in various fields. For instance, bacteria-based biosensors are used to detect target molecules, such as glucose or specific pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Living skin patches adopt skin microbiomes to control bacterial outgrowth on the wounded area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

Living materials have also been used to replace conventionally pollution-intensive processes, such as applications in the energy industry, the production of textiles or structural materials, due to their inherent bioremediation abilities, especially through the carbon sequestration capabilities of certain microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Building on these concepts, we engineered printable photosynthetic living materials that were capable of carbon sequestration through biomass accumulation and inorganic carbonate precipitation. To enhance the carbon sequestration potential of our photosynthetic living material, we used different additive manufacturing approaches to design biomimetic porous structures that drew upon principles outlined by cellular fluidics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Tailoring construct geometry via additive manufacturing enabled our photosynthetic living structures to survive beyond one year while continuously undergoing dual carbon sinking. Throughout the incubation period of 400 days, our photosynthetic living material continuously performed dual carbon sequestration, with most of the sequestered carbon stored in the stable mineral form. The total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered through mineral formation after 400 days was 26 ± 7 mg per gram of photosynthetic living material. This amounts to approximately 12 times more than the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered through mineral formation during our 30-day experiments (2.2 ± 0.9 mg per gram of living material). With minimum requirements of sunlight and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, our photosynthetic living materials showed a consistent carbon sequestration efficiency throughout the entire incubation period, and demonstrated the potential of using natural carbon sequestration processes at scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">As a comparison of the efficiency of this living approach, similar CO<sub>2</sub> capture initiatives via chemical mineralization, such as carbonating recycled concrete aggregates, have been able to sequester CO<sub>2</sub> at a quantity of 6.7 mg per gram of recycled concrete aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Thus, our first-generation photosynthetic living material (26 ± 7 mg of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration per gram of living material) may be competitive with industrial chemical mineralization process. Moreover, the carbon sequestration capacity of our photosynthetic living materials is not limited by the availability of essential chemicals, such as Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> availability in recycled concrete aggregates. Comparatively, CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration via chemical and biological mineralization is less efficient than carbon capture and storage (CCS); however, CCS requires a concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> source as well as controlled temperature and pressure to operate. Our photosynthetic living materials function at ambient conditions with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as the sole carbon source, which highlights the ability to use photosynthetic living materials as a complementary approach in a more distributed manner.</p><p id="P23">Implementing photosynthetic living materials in broad application still requires improved usability and upscaling of the material production. This can be achieved by taken advantage of recent advances in biofabrication for the creation of larger scale porous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> or granular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> structures. In addition, methods to engineer optical structures at scale for efficient light harnessing, may further improve efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Photosynthetic living materials also hold promise for future applications as surface coatings for green building materials or bioreactors in commercial-scale sequestration plants, enabling bioremediation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and supporting the realization of carbon-neutral to carbon negative infrastructure. Their simple requirements and easy maintenance also enable possible installation in various environments, ranging from urban to rural landscapes, for long-term and sustainable CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. To further enhance the efficiency of the system, we foresee the possibilities to genetically modify or select microorganisms or microorganism consortia with higher photosynthetic rates.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P24">We have introduced a new cyanobacteria-laden photosynthetic living material for dual carbon sequestration, achieved through the combination of simultaneous biomass generation and the formation of insoluble carbonate precipitates. The photosynthetic living materials performed dual carbon sequestration over an extended life of up to one year with light and atmospheric carbon as its energy and carbon source. The base formulation of this living material enabled processing via direct ink writing as well as light based additive manufacturing. As a result, the final design of living structures was tailored for enhanced carbon sinking via increased surface area and porosity. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal control provided by 3D printing allows scale up for potential applications in disparate fields, such as civil engineering and architecture.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S10"><title>Bacteria culture and encapsulation</title><p id="P25">The cyanobacteria <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp.

Biomass accumulation was enabled by carbon utilization via carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalysis of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Scale bar, 100 μm. <bold>c</bold>) In addition to biomass accumulation, carbon sequestration in the form of CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitates was visualized by alizarin red staining of the biotic samples over 30 days.

The cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration by biotic samples was reflected by the difference in normalized dry mass between biotic and abiotic samples.
