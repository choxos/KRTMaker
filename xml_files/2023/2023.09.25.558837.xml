The latter two activities comprise an unconventional mechanism for initiating viral RNA 5′-cap formation, while the role of NMPylation is unclear. The structural mechanisms for these diverse enzymatic activities have not been properly delineated. Here we determine high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of catalytic intermediates for the NMPylation and deRNAylation/capping reactions, revealing diverse nucleotide binding poses and divalent metal ion coordination sites to promote its repertoire of activities. The deRNAylation/capping structure explains why GDP is a preferred substrate for the capping reaction over GTP. Altogether, these findings enhance our understanding of the promiscuous coronaviral NiRAN domain, a therapeutic target, and provide an accurate structural platform for drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NiRAN domain</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>capping</kwd><kwd>mRNA cap</kwd><kwd>RNAylation</kwd><kwd>deRNAylation</kwd><kwd>NMPylation</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Nidovirales</italic> are an order of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that includes the Coronavirus (CoV) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, etiological agents responsible for major and deadly zoonotic events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

The NiRAN domain was initially identified in equine arterivirus (EAV) as a Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleotidyltransferase.

In a unique two-step mechanism, the NiRAN domain catalyzes the transfer of a 5′-triphosphorylated RNA (pppRNA) to the N-terminus of nsp9, forming a covalent RNA-nsp9 intermediated in a process termed RNAylation.

We used a UTP analog with a nonhydrolyzable α-β-phosphate bond (UMPCPP) to visualize a structure of the nsp9-RTC poised for UMPylation of the nsp9 N-terminus at 2.9 Å nominal resolution (~2.8 Å local resolution in the NiRAN active site).

We used a slowly reacting GDP analog (GDP-β-S) to visualize structures of the RNA-nsp9-RTC poised for deRNAylation and GDP transfer at 3.0 Å nominal resolution (~2.8 Å local resolution in the NiRAN active site). Our results illustrate why GDP is a strongly preferred substrate for the NiRAN GDP-transferase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

We used a UTP analog with a nonhydrolyzable α-β-phosphate bond {uridine-5′-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate (UMPCPP)} to capture a pre-catalytic intermediate of NiRAN-mediate nsp9 UMPylation [nsp9-RTC(UMPCPP)] and determined a cryo-EM structure to 2.9 Å nominal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1, Table S1</xref>). We call this complex UMP-i, for UMPylation intermediate. In UMP-i, nsp9 docks into the NiRAN domain with the conserved nsp9-GxxxG helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>), binding a conserved hydrophobic patch on nsp12. The five N-terminal residues of nsp9 extend through a deep groove on the NiRAN domain surface, terminating with the nsp9 N-terminal Asn (N1) deep in the NiRAN active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>). The eponymous glycines of the nsp9 GxxxG helix, G100 and G104, are two of six residues in the helix to form a series of hydrophobic interactions with the NiRAN domain.</p><p id="P8">Nsp9 can dimerize in solution, and nsp9 crystallizes as a dimer with the GxxxG helix at the dimer interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Mutations in conserved residues of the nsp9 GxxxG helix disrupt nsp9 dimerization in solution, and these same mutations result in loss of viral fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

The nsp9 N-terminus is positioned for catalysis by a hydrogen bond (H-bond) between the sidechain of nsp9 N1 and the sidechain of nsp12 N39, and the interface continues with a H-bonding network between nsp9 N2, E3 and L4 and nsp12 Y38, Y728, and R733 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>).

Due to the importance of this motif in facilitating nsp9 binding and other NiRAN domain functions, we call these conserved nsp9-palm residues the <bold>N</bold> iRAN-associated <bold>Palm</bold> (NPalm) motif. Despite the absolute conservation of nsp9 E3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>), the sidechain does not appear to play a role in binding nsp12, suggesting a potential role in other nsp9 functions.</p><p id="P10">Within the NiRAN domain active site pocket, the UMPCPP is positioned in a ‘base-up’ pose, distinct from previously observed ‘base-out’ or ‘base-in’ NiRAN NTP binding poses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, with its α-phosphate positioned for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Structural modeling indicates that base-in binding of GTP in the NiRAN G-site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> would sterically clash with the base-up NMPylation pose, explaining the lower efficiency of GMPylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>).

The NiRAN-mediated RNAylation and deRNAylation reactions are inefficient <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> compared to NMPylation. We hypothesized that RNAylation and/or deRNAylation may be facilitated by secondary structure in the substrate RNA. To test this hypothesis, we examined three 5′-triphosphorylated model RNAs based on the 5′-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), an unstructured 10mer, a 20mer, and a 33mer comprising the entire 5′ UTR through the conserved stem-loop 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The 20mer RNA is predicted to form a stable hairpin not found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> but could represent a nascent RNA intermediate structure. Monitoring the time-course of NiRAN-mediated nsp9 RNAylation with each pppRNA revealed a slight preference for the shorter, unstructured 10mer pppRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3B and S3C</xref>). To test the effect of RNA secondary structure on the deRNAylation/capping reaction, we purified the three different RNAylated-nsp9 species and evaluated NiRAN-mediated RNA capping efficiencies using GDP as a substrate. The efficiency and rate of the deRNAylation/capping reaction was not affected by RNA length or secondary structure propensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3D and S3E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">DeRNAylation of RNA-nsp9 has been previously demonstrated with both GDP and GTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. As observed by Park et al. (2022), the NiRAN domain strongly prefers GDP over GTP for 20mer RNA-nsp9 deRNAylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). The efficiency of a deRNAylation reaction with GTP was restored by the addition of a stoichiometric amount of the nsp13 helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>), indicating that the NTPase activity of nsp13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> can convert the GTP pool into mostly GDP for efficient GDP-PRNTase activity.

After initial steps of processing, the consensus map exhibited features indicative of structural heterogeneity. To improve the maps in the area of interest, we constructed a soft mask encompassing the NiRAN domain and nsp9 and used masked classification with signal subtraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> to identify six conformational states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Two of the states (C00 and C02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>) had very poor or no density for nsp9 and were not further processed. C01 contained strong cryo-EM density for RNAylated-nsp9 resolving the entire 20mer length of the nsp9-linked RNA with the predicted stem-loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), but the GDP-βS substrate was unable to bind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). The remaining classes revealed conformational mobility of nsp9 in its binding to nsp12. C03 and C05 were similar to C04 (except for motion in nsp9) but the maps in the NiRAN active site were inferior to C04. Therefore, our further analysis focused on C01 and C04 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The C04 class contained strong cryo-EM density for RNAylated-nsp9 and the GDP-βS (we designate this structure GDP-Cap-i; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and S3C, Table S1). The nominal resolution of the structure was 3.0 Å, with local features in the NiRAN active site resolved to 2.8-2.9 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4F</xref>). In GDP-Cap-i, RNA-nsp9 docks into the NiRAN domain with the same interface as the UMP-i structure, with the GxxxG helix forming an extensive interface with nsp12 and the N-terminus of nsp9 loaded into the NiRAN active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). The first nucleotide of the nsp9-linked RNA (A1) was well resolved, binding in the same base-up pose as the UMPCPP of UMP-i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Like the UMPCPP, the A1 base interacts with NPalm residue N713 and forms a direct and a water-mediated interaction with D711 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Deeper in the NiRAN active site, the GDP-βS binds in the G-site in the base-in pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), with the guanine base recognized by the same conserved NiRAN residues an in the GTP-bound NiRAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

It is likely critical for catalyzing the deRNAylation/capping activity. There were no sites with the appropriate cryo-EM density and coordination geometry for a second Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion, which would normally stabilize the leaving group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>; leaving group stabilization may not be required for this reaction since the leaving group is the protein nsp9.</p><p id="P16">The second analyzed class, C01 (nominal resolution 3.1 Å; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>), contained strong cryo-EM density for RNAylated-nsp9, but here the entire 20mer length of the nsp9-linked RNA, including the predicted stem-loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>) was resolved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5A and S5B</xref>). We term this structure 20mer-Stem-Loop (20mer-SL). The 5′- and 3′-ends of the SL-RNA interact with the surface of the NiRAN and NPalm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). To accommodate the positioning of the SL, the four 5′-nucleotides of the nsp9-linked RNA (A1-U2-U3-A4) are constrained in a sharp turn, causing a shift in the position of the nsp9-linked A1 and the ordering of the U2-phosphate, introducing a severe clash with the β-phosphate of the GDP (modeled from the GDP-Cap-i structure; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>).
