While vaccination is essential for mitigating disease impact, these viruses evolve to evade vaccine immunity through changes in the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. In this study, we identified immune escape mutation in an H9N2 virus resulting from pressure exerted by homologous chicken antisera. The immune-escape variant acquired an amino acid substitution, replacing glycine (G) with glutamic acid (E) at position 149 in the HA protein. The G149E mutant virus lost the ability to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, while still maintaining replication comparable to the wild-type virus in chicken embryos and cells. This led to the hypothesis that the G149E substitution, leading to a shift from a neutral to a negative charge polarity at HA position 149, might be crucial for the optimal interaction between the virus and receptors on erythrocytes. Investigation indicated that agglutination could be restored by substituting E to positively charged amino acids histidine (H), arginine (R) or lysine (K). These findings suggest that the H9N2 virus may be likely acquire the G149E mutation under immune pressure in nature. This mutation poses challenges to vaccination and surveillance efforts as it partially evades immune protection and is not easily detectable by conventional haemagglutination assays. This underscores the intricate interplay between antigenic variation and viral traits, emphasising the critical need for ongoing surveillance and research to effectively mitigate the risks associated with avian influenza H9N2 viruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Avian Influenza viruses (AIVs) belong to <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, which are segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses. AIVs pose a major threat to global food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and can cause zoonotic infection in humans, and are considered viruses with pandemic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). H9N2 is one of the widely prevalent AIV subtypes in poultry and remains enzootic in many countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). H9N2 AIVs are classified as low pathogenicity in chickens compared to the high pathogenicity subtypes (polybasic site containing H5 and H7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In recent years, H9N2 viruses have acquired genetic changes that increase their systemic tropism, resulting in severe morbidity and increased mortality rate (up to 60%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Additionally, H9N2-infected chickens experience greater morbidity and mortality due to secondary bacterial infections or co-infections with other avian viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The transmission of H9N2 AIVs occurs through respiratory droplets and fomites, including feed and water contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Recent studies indicate that the contemporary H9N2 AIVs prevalent in poultry have acquired genetic changes in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, which have widened viral receptor binding affinity to both avian and human cell surface receptors and enhanced zoonotic risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This has been supported by the highest reported human infections (&gt;60) in the past three years in regions where H9N2 is endemic in poultry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). H9N2 viruses are also very efficient in donating internal gene segments to other AIVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). This genetic reassortment mechanism has led to the emergence of several highly zoonotic AIVs, including H5N1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), H7N9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), H10N8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), H5N6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and H3N8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The hyper-prevalence of H9N2 results in huge economic losses in many countries, which has led the governments to adopt vaccination programs administering adjuvanted, inactivated virus vaccines. The neutralizing antibodies generated against the virus’s hemagglutinin antigen following vaccination or infection directly inhibit the virus’s attachment to the target receptor molecules present on the host cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Thus, to overcome antibody-based neutralisation, the virus evolves using an immune escape mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This has led to the emergence of immune escape variants that carry amino acid changes in their HA genes. The genotypic changes often lead to viral phenotypic change, such as infectivity, replication efficiency, viral fusion, thermal stability, receptor binding, and/or hemagglutination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to closely monitor virus evolution to identify emerging variants in the field. Haemagglutination assay is routinely used as a detection method for virus isolation from field samples and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay are widely used for antigenic characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In recent years antigenic changes in human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses failed to agglutinate erythrocytes, which caused the viruses are undetectable by haemagglutination assay and HI assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). It is possible that such failure of detection occurs in other influenza subtypes. This will pose challenges to virus isolation and antigenic characterization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we conducted an immune escape experiment to identify mutants of the H9N2 strain (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008, hereafter referred to as wt-UDL-01/08) that can overcome the neutralizing activity of antibodies in the sera from vaccinated chickens. We successfully identified an immune escape variant carrying the G149E substitution in the HA gene. Interestingly, this G149E mutant (hereafter referred as mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus) was unable to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. Through this analysis, we sought to define the underlying mechanisms that potentially contribute to the loss of agglutination activity observed in this mutant. Our findings from this investigation provide valuable insights into the risks of epizootic and zoonotic threats posed by emerging H9N2 variants that may lack agglutination activity and persist undetected in the global poultry population, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring efforts to safeguard public health and the poultry industry.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The G149E mutation on the H9HA of the wt-UDL-01/08 virus results in a loss of agglutination of chicken erythrocytes</title><p id="P6">We conducted immune escape experiments (manuscript is in preparation) and identified G149E substitution in HA (based on mature H9 peptide numbering) that lacked haemagglutination activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). While there have been reports describing human influenza viruses that could not agglutinate chicken red blood cells (cRBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), we were unable to find any previous reports on loss of agglutination activity in H9N2 strains. The propagation of this mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus in embryonated chicken eggs showed 10-fold higher end-point titres compared to the progenitor wt-UDL-01/08 virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Altogether, the results suggests that despite a higher PFU/ml virus input of mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus, we were still unable to detect the HA activity, indicating that the G149E mutation in H9HA in UDL-01/08 virus results in the loss its haemagglutination activity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The G149E mutant virus showed reduced antigenic cross-reactivity against the wt-UDL-01/08 virus</title><p id="P7">To evaluate whether the G149E mutation in the H9HA altered the antigenic properties of the wt-UDL-01/08 virus, we performed a microneutralization (MNT) assay using polyclonal antisera (post-vaccination) raised against the wt-UDL-01/08 virus in a group of five chickens. The mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus showed up to a two-fold reduction in MNT titers compared to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The observed reduction in MNT titers in serum samples was statistically significant (P&lt; 0.0039). Suggesting that the emergence of variants with G149E mutations may also compromise the effectiveness of vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Loss of chicken erythrocytes agglutination is a strain specific phenomenon</title><p id="P8">To investigate the loss of agglutination to cRBCs with the G149E mutation is specific to UDL-01/08 or universal for other H9N2 lineages, we generated two additional mutant viruses harbouring G149E mutation in their HA genes. One mutant G149E-A/Ck/Vietnam/315/2015 virus (G149E-VN/315/15), representing the BJ/94 lineage, predominant in China and Vietnam, and the other mutant G149E-A/Env/Bangladesh/26218/2015 (G149E-BD/26218/15) representing the same G1 lineage as UDL1/08. Both H9N2 strains (G149E-VN/315/15 and G149E-BD/26218/15) with G149E mutation showed comparable haemagglutination activity in comparison to corresponding wild-type (wt) viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the loss of haemagglutination activity by G149E mutation in the HA is not consistently observed across all strains of H9N2 viruses, including within the G1 lineage.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The specific composition of the Receptor Binding Site (RBS) in HA genes is critical for haemagglutination activity of H9N2 viruses</title><p id="P9">The receptor binding site (RBS) of HA is comprised of three secondary structure elements: the 130-loop, the 190-helix, and the 220-loop. The RBS is mainly involved in receptor binding activity, binding to sialic acid receptor on cells of target tissues, including cRBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). As we observed, the G149E mutation in the wt-UDL-01/08 virus abolished agglutination activity, but the same mutation had no effect on the agglutination activity of the other two H9N2 viruses, VN/315/15 and BD/26218/15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we analysed molecular differences in the RBS between wt-UDL-01/08 and wt-BD/26218/15 viruses, which are both G1 lineage. Six amino acids differences were identified, three of which are located in the 190-helix and the other three amino acids are within the 220-loop at the RBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To further analyse the key residues responsible for the agglutination activity of the wt-UDL-01/08 virus, we generated two variants of the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus. These variants contained either the 190-helix or 220-loop of the RBS from the BD/26218/15-like virus. The haemagglutination assays of these viruses showed that when we substituted three amino acid residues (G215D, L216Q, I217T) from the 220-loop of the BD/26218/15 virus into the G149E-UDL-1/08 mutant virus, it regained its haemagglutination activity. However, the G149E-UDL-1/08 mutant containing the 190-helix similar to the BD/26218/15 virus did not regain the ability of haemagglutination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). These results suggest that, when combined with the G149E mutation, the composition of the 220 loop in the wt-UDL-01/08 virus contributes to the loss of its haemagglutination activity.</p><p id="P11">To further validate the significance of each of these residues in contributing to the agglutination activity of H9N2 viruses, we generated additional mutants of G149E-UDL-01/08 virus containing G215D, L216Q, or I217T substitutions. Through haemagglutination assays, we confirmed that amino acids D, Q or T at positions 215, 216, and 217 in the HA of H9N2 viruses play a crucial role in maintaining the haemagglutination activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The polarity of the amino acid at position 149 in the H9 haemagglutinin regulates the virus haemagglutination activity</title><p id="P12">Sialic acid, and in particular sulphated sialylated glycans that are the preferential receptor for H9N2 viruses such as UDL-01/08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and negatively charged. We have previously found receptor avidity of H9N2 viruses to sulphated receptors correlate crudely with net charge of the HA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We hypothesised that changes in the amino acid composition at position 149 might be linked to alterations in the HA charge, crucial for maintaining an optimal interaction between the virus and the cellular receptor on RBCs. This balance is likely critical for viral haemagglutination activity. To determine whether a shift in the polarity of the amino acid at position 149 is associated with a loss of haemagglutination activity, we generated mutant UDL-01/08 viruses carrying either positively charged (G149K, G149R, and G149H) or negatively charged (G149D) residues at HA position 149. The mutant viruses with amino acid "D" at residue 149 in the HA showed no haemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes, similar to G149E. Conversely, the mutants carrying positively charged amino acids "K, R, or H" at HA position 149 retained their haemagglutination activity. Interestingly, the polarity shift did not impact the replication profiles of these mutant viruses. The mutant virus containing the negatively charged amino acid (G149D) that lost its haemagglutination activity not only retained its replication fitness but also exhibited a more than two-fold increase in virus end point titres when propagated in embryonated chicken eggs compared to the mutants with positively charged amino acids (G149K, G149R, and G149H) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). These findings suggest that positive polarity at the HA residue 149 is crucial for the agglutination of chicken erythrocytes by the H9N2 wt-UDL-01/08 virus.</p><p id="P13">The HA structure prediction analysis also showed that substitution of amino acid from “G” to “E” at HA 149 position increase the negative charge distribution in and around the HA receptor binding site due to the introduction of the carboxyl group from glutamic acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Conversely, the HA with residues “K” at position 149 displays a reduction in negative charge distribution in the receptor binding site because the carboxyl group from glutamic acid is replaced by an amino group from lysine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). This overall change in charge distribution in the vicinity of the receptor binding site may explain the distinct phenotypic changes between the G149E and G149K viruses as depicted in our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The G149E mutant virus retained stability following multiple passage and with multiple H9N2 genetic backgrounds</title><p id="P14">Prior studies have noted that evolutionary changes in the HA that enable immune evasion are often followed by compensatory changes in HA or NA which restore the fitness cost that may have been incurred by the initial substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). To verify the stability of the G149E substitution, the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus and the wt-UDL-01/08 virus, which served as a control, were passaged five times in embryonated chicken eggs. After each passage, the HA and NA coding regions of the progeny viruses were sequenced. The results revealed no additional synonymous or non-synonymous mutations, thereby validating that the G149E substitution maintained its stability within the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus throughout all five passages.</p><p id="P15">To further assess the compatibility of the G149E substitution in the HA of various H9N2 viruses, two distantly related H9N2 viruses (Viet/315/2015 HA and BD/26218/2015) containing the G149E substitution were generated using reverse genetics (RG) approach. Both viruses were successfully rescued on the first attempt. These mutant viruses demonstrated that the replication competence in embryonated eggs were similar to their wt counterparts. Additionally, sequence analysis confirmed that no substitutions had occurred in the HA and NA coding regions of these rescued viruses (data not shown). This suggests that the G149E substitution can maintain its fitness across different strains of H9N2 viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The G149E mutant virus showed reduced receptor binding avidity for both the avian-like <bold><sub>α</sub></bold>2,3-linked sialic acid analogue and human-like <bold><sub>α</sub></bold>2,6-linked sialic acid analogue</title><p id="P16">Changes in amino acid residues within or near the RBS can modulate the H9N2 virus’s receptor binding preferences, thereby influencing virus attachment and entry into host cells during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).

Compared to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus, the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus exhibited a 10-fold decrease in binding to the avian-like receptor Neu5Ac α-2,3Gal β1-4(6-HSO<sub>3</sub>) GlcNAc (3SLN(6su)). Furthermore, the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus lost any detectable binding to human-like receptor analogue α2,6-sialyllactosamine (6SLN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Two additional mutants, G149D and G149K, were included as controls. These contained negatively and positively charged amino acids at the HA 149 position, respectively. The replication efficiency of all three mutant viruses in MDCK cells was similar to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus up to 12 hours. However, the mutant virus with the G149D mutation replicated at a significantly higher rate, showing 1.8-fold increase in viral titres compared to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus at 24 hours post-infection (hpi). At 48 hpi post-infection, the viral titres of both mutant viruses with a negatively charged amino acid at HA position 149 (G149E and G149D) was also significantly higher (2 and 2.6-fold respectively) compared to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus. In contrast, the mutant virus with the positively charged amino acid (G149K) in the HA replicated at a notably reduced rate, and its viral titres were comparatively lower at the same time points. Beyond 48 hpi, a consistent differential replication trend persisted between the viruses carrying the negatively charged and the positively charged amino acids at HA position 149. However, the differences in viral titres at this time point were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The analysis of replication competency of these mutant viruses in CKCs also revealed that the mutant virus with the positively charged amino acid K at position 149 (G149K) in the HA showed replication patterns similar to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus at all post-infection time points in CKCs. The mutant virus with the negatively charged amino acid D or E at position 149 (G149D, G149E) in the HA replicated at higher rate with approximately 10-fold increase in viral titre compared to both the wt-UDL-01/08 virus and the mutant virus with the positively charged residue G149K at HA across all time points from 12 to 72 hrs post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The impact of G149E mutation in the HA on H9N2 virus replication competency in chicken embryos was also analysed. Ten-day old hens’s embryos were inoculated with 100 PFU of the wt-UDL-01/08 virus or mutant viruses carrying G149E, G149D, or G149K mutations. After 48 hours, the viral titres were determined using the plaque assay. The results revealed that both the G149E and G149D mutant viruses replicated to levels comparable to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus (∼ 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/ml), reflecting patterns observed in CKCs. In contrast, the G149K mutant replicated significantly lower than both the wt-UDL-01/08 virus and the mutants with the G149E and G149D substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Altogether, the results conclude that the mutant viruses with negatively charged residues D or E at the HA position 149 exhibited replication fitness comparable to or greater than the wt-UDL-01/08 virus.

Mutant viruses with negatively charged amino acid mutations (G149E and G149D) in the HA produced larger plaques compared to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus. In contrast, the mutant virus with the positively charged amino acid substitution (G149K) produced plaques with similar size with the wt-UDL-01/08 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The data suggests that the negatively charged amino acid at position 149 likely facilitates optimal virus-host cell surface interactions, allowing efficient cell-to-cell spread. On the other hand, a positive charge potentially leads to a strong attraction with cell surface receptors, restricting the formation of smaller plaques. Notably, the variations in plaque size and morphology did not correlate with the virus replication efficiency in MDCK cells. Altogether, this suggests that mutations at position 149 in the HA influence the biological properties of the H9N2 virus on multiple levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">AIVs acquire mutations to maintain their fitness within the target host species.

Haemagglutinin assays revealed that the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus lost its ability to agglutinate chicken RBCs. Since the haemagglutination assays and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are employed as diagnostic tools for H9N2 virus surveillance and antigenic characterisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>),the emergence of variants with G149E substitution potentially compromise the effectiveness of these assays for both surveillance and diagnostic purposes. The loss of haemagglutination activity due to mutations in viral HA of other influenza virus subtypes, such as human influenza A (H1N1) and (H3N2) viruses, has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In H1N1 influenza virus, the substitution at position 225 (G225D) was responsible for the loss of haemagglutination activity, while in H3N2 virus, an amino acid change from Glu to Asp at position 190 (E190D) had the same effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).The viral surface glycoprotein HA is able to bind to the sialic acid receptor molecules present on host cells surface is governed by electrostatic interactions. Changes in amino acid polarity (neutral, negative or positive) due to mutations alter the overall electrostatic balance, disrupting viral binding affinity to the receptors on cell surface. The loss of agglutination in the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus was due to the substitution of amino acid G to E at position 149. Amino acid G is a neutral (non-polar) residue, whereas amino acid E has negative polarity. Thus, the G149E substitution resulted in a change in polarity from neutral to negative, might be critical for the virus’s ability to bind to RBCs and cause agglutination. To test this hypothesis, we generated mutant viruses with changes at position 149, replacing amino acid G with either negatively charged amino acid D or positively charged amino acids K, R or H. The results provided clear evidence that, like the negatively charged amino acid D substitution, the impact was similarly significant to the G149E substitution of mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus. Negatively charged amino acid at position 149 possibly altered the electrostatic balance between the virus and RBC interaction, resulting in a loss of virus agglutination activity. Other studies have also reported similar observations, where the substitution of a negatively charged amino acid from G to D and E to D affected the RBCs agglutination activity of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). On the other hand, all mutant viruses carrying positively charged amino acids (K/R/H) at position 149 retained haemagglutination activity.</p><p id="P23">To demonstrate the function of amino acid polarity at position 149 in contribution to receptor binding affinity, we modelled different sequences of wt-UDL-01/08 HA with amino acids G, E or K at position 149 using SWISS-MODEL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org">http://swissmodel.expasy.org</ext-link>). The charge distribution of all single amino acid substitutions at position 149 (G, E or K) were mapped onto H9HA structure using PyMOL software. The charge distribution difference in RBS of H9HA highlighted that change of amino acid from G to E increased negative charge distribution in and around the RBS, specially towards the 190-helix. While amino acid substitution from G to K at the same position increased positive charge distribution within and near RBS. The change in charge distribution in RBS has the most apparent effect on the binding of the ligand to the pocket of RBS. Positively charged RBS anchors to sialic acid molecules with greater strength, while negatively charged RBS does not bind with the same strength. In agreement with charge distribution differences, receptor binding results showed that the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus carrying G149E mutation in HA decreased (&gt; 10-fold) in 3SLN(6su) (sulfated variant of the classical avian-like receptor analogue) binding, while lost binding to 6SLN (human-like receptor analogue) binding compared to wt-UDL-01/08 virus. This demonstrated that charge of RBS correlates well with receptor binding and therefore, this may be the one of the reasons why HA of the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus carrying G149E mutation does not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. Further dissection of RBS of H9HA of H9N2 viruses indicated that 220-loop of RBS is involved in agglutination of chicken erythrocytes and residues at 215, 216 and 217 in 220-loop of RBS of H9HA of wt-UDL-01/08 virus is equally important for agglutination of chicken erythrocytes. More importantly, the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus produced comparable progeny viruses to the wt-UDL-01/08 virus in mammalian and avian cells with larger plaque size compared to wt-UDL-01/08 virus.</p><p id="P24">The key point regarding the G149E mutation in the H9HA protein is that the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus maintained stability without acquiring any additional compensatory substitutions in the HA or NA glycoproteins, even after being propagated multiple times in chicken embryos. Additionally, the introduction of the G149E mutation into two distantly related H9N2 viruses confirmed that the G149E substitution can maintained its fitness across different strains of H9N2 viruses. The observed data suggest that H9N2 viruses can potentially acquire the G149E mutation in the field, giving them the capability to cause sustained infections in poultry flocks. Given the proven genetic reassortment capability of H9N2 with other AIVs, the persistence of such viruses which are not detectable in the environment using routine assays might increase the likelihood of them donating their internal gene segments to other viruses. This could, in turn, enhance the zoonotic potential of the recipient AIV subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus had reduced antigenic cross-reactivity with the polyclonal antisera raised against the wt-UDL 01/08 virus. This suggested that the 149 position is a critical antigenic site in the HA of H9N2 viruses. Published data further indicate that mutations at the H9HA residue 149 decrease the HI titers of anti-H9HA monoclonal antibodies, confirming that this residue likely defines the antigenic site of H9N2 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Since the prevention and control of H9N2 infections in poultry in endemic regions are based on vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), viruses with G149E mutations can potentially evade the immunity administrated with current vaccines. Moreover, the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus cannot be detected by routine haemagglutination assays employed in surveillance programs, particularly in resource-limited laboratories, since qPCR detection is more costly. Therefore, the emergence of the mutant G149E-UDL-01/08 virus may poses a continued threat to poultry and a risk of zoonotic infections.</p><p id="P26">The results conclude that both the haemagglutination assays and HI assays are essential for avian influenza surveillance and for characterising the antigenic properties of the HA protein, especially when selecting vaccine seeds in resource-limited laboratories. The emergence of variants in the field with G149E mutations suggests that they might not be neutralized by the immunity conferred by current vaccines and may also evade detection by ongoing surveillance programs. Consequently, these mutants could remain undetected in the field, potentially giving rise to novel viruses by donating their internal gene segments, which can lead to new phenotypic traits with zoonotic or pandemic potential. This highlights the urgent need for continuous monitoring of H9N2 and co-circulating subtypes in avian populations.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="P27">All the procedures involving embryonated eggs were carried out in strict accordance with the guidance and regulations of United Kingdom Home Office regulations under project licence number P68D44CF4.

vaccines, diagnostics, and risk assessment. In this study, we identified an H9N2 virus antibody escape mutant with G149E mutation in the haemagglutinin that had lost the ability to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, while retaining infectivity and replication fitness. The lack of haemagglutination activity potentially negatively impacts routine surveillance and commonly used diagnostics such as haemagglutination assay or haemagglutination inhibition assay. Therefore, it is urgent to develop and adopt alternative methods for viral detection. Difficult to detect variants potentially that are not compatible with common surveillance techniques could circulate remain silent while reassort with other influenza viruses, which posing unpredictable risks to animal and human health. This research helps us better understand avian influenza, leading to improved disease control, diagnostics, and risk assessment to protect both animals and humans.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Microneutralization (MNT) titre change of G149E-UDL-01/08 mutant virus against post-vaccination chicken sera raised against wt-UDL-01/08 viruses.</title><p>MNT assays were carried out with a panel of 5 post-vaccinated chicken antisera raised against the wt-UDL-01/08 virus and each dot represents the MNT titre from an individual chicken serum sample.
