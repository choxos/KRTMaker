Dense anatomical connectivity with hippocampal, brainstem, and thalamic structures, positions them as a focal point for the integration of movement-related and spatial information that is extended to the anterior thalamic nuclei and beyond to cortex. While their anatomical connectivity has been well-studied, much less is known about the physiological properties of the medial MBs, particularly in freely moving animals. We therefore carried out a comprehensive characterization of medial MB electrophysiology across arousal states by concurrently recording from the medial MB and the CA1 field of the hippocampus. In agreement with previous studies, we found medial MB neurons to have firing rates modulated by running speed and angular head velocity, as well as theta-entrained firing. We extended the characterization of MB neuron electrophysiology in three key ways: 1) we identified a subset of neurons (25%) that exhibit dominant bursting activity; 2) we show that ~30% of theta-entrained neurons exhibit robust theta cycle skipping, a firing characteristic that implicates them in a network for prospective coding of position; 3) A considerable proportion of medial MB units show sharp wave-ripple (SWR) responsive firing (~37%). The functional heterogeneity of MB electrophysiology reinforces their role as an integrative node for mnemonic processing and identifies potential roles for the MBs in memory consolidation through propagation of SWR-responsive activity to the anterior thalamus and prospective coding in the form of theta-cycle skipping.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The medial mammillary bodies (MB) were one of the earliest regions associated with amnesia and play an important role in the formation of complex spatial memories, via their indirect influence on hippocampo-cortical networks (2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dillingham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zakowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dillingham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">McNaughton and Vann, 2022</xref>). While we have a detailed knowledge of the anatomical connectivity of the medial MBs, our knowledge of the electrophysiological profiles of the medial MBs in behaving animals is relatively limited. While a few studies have been carried out on <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alonso and Llinas, 1992</xref>), or in anesthetized and/or head-fixed animals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kirk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kocsis and Vertes, 1997</xref>) there is very little published data from awake, behaving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sharp and Turner-Williams, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P3">From these previous studies, we know that cells in the medial MBs show complex endogenous bursting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alonso and Llinas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>) and that a large proportion of neurons have spike discharges that are significantly phase-entrained to theta band oscillations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bland et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, firing rates of medial MB units have been reported to be highly correlated with both running speed and angular head velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sharp and Turner-Williams, 2005</xref>). While, historically, the medial MBs have been considered simply a relay of hippocampal theta, the emerging picture appears more complex, with evidence suggesting a bi-directional influence between the hippocampus and medial MBs. Lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sharp and Koester, 2008</xref>) or inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zakowski et al., 2017</xref>) of the mammillary bodies, or lesions of their primary efferent pathway, the mammillothalamic tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dillingham et al., 2019</xref>), alter the temporal dynamics of hippocampal processing, e.g., through attenuation of theta-band oscillatory frequency, highlighting the downstream impact of the MBs.</p><p id="P4">The present study sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of the electrophysiological properties of the medial MBs, extending beyond previous work by recording from greater numbers of neurons and, importantly, recording across different arousal states. A secondary goal was to assess the relationship between MB activity and hippocampal ripple-band activity. The medial MBs receive a dense input from the subiculum, via the postcommissural fornix, and the MB-projecting neurons in the subiculum are strongly modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kitanishi et al., 2021</xref>). The prediction, therefore, is that MB activity will also be related to hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events. Given the strong links between the propagation of ripple activity, and memory, this may be an additional mechanism via which the extended hippocampal-mammillary network supports long-term memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics</title><p id="P5">All experimental procedures were in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines, the EU directive 2010/63/EU, as well as the Cardiff University Biological Standards Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Animals</title><p id="P6">Eight male Lister-Hooded rats were used (Envigo, UK), weighing ~300-350g at the time of surgery and behaviorally naïve. Prior to surgery, rats were group housed. Following surgery, implanted rats were housed singly (GR1800 double-decker cages; Techniplast, Kettering, UK) except for ~1 hour daily, supervised socialization. Animals were maintained under diurnal light conditions (14 h light/10 h dark) with free access to water and environmental enrichment. When required, animals were food-deprived to no less than 85% of their free feeding weight to promote reward-based exploration.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Electrode implantation</title><p id="P7">All surgeries were performed under an isoflurane-oxygen mixture (induction 5%, maintenance 2%–2.5% isoflurane) during the light phase of a 12 h, day/night cycle. Once anesthetized, animals were positioned in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). The skull was exposed and cleaned before 6-9 screws were secured and cemented to the skull. Craniotomies were made before careful removal of the dura and subsequent implantation of electrodes in positions corresponding to the following coordinates (mm from bregma unless stated): (CA1: AP: −3.8, ML: ±3.3, DV: −1.9 from top of cortex 4.4, ML: ±0.8, DV: −8.0 from top of cortex with a 4° angle toward the midline). Rats were implanted with 8 tetrodes (17 μm tungsten; California Fine Wire) into CA1, spanning approximately 1.4mm in the axial plane, and 4 octrodes (12 μm; California Fine Wire) into the mammillary bodies. Prior to implantation, electrodes were loaded into custom-made microdrives (Axona Ltd., St Albans) that allow for independent adjustment of electrode depth during recordings. Electrodes were then gold-plated (Gold plating solution; Neuralynx) to an impedance of ~200-400kΩ using the open-source Tetroplater (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MatsumotoJ/Tetroplater">https://github.com/MatsumotoJ/Tetroplater</ext-link>). Once lowered to the desired depth, a warmed paraffin/mineral oil (1:4) suspension, or synthetic dura (Dura-Gel; Cambridge Neurotech, Cambridge, UK) was applied to the dural surface and allowed to solidify or set, respectively. Drives were then secured in place with bone cement (Zimmer-Biomet; Swindon, UK). The scalp was then sutured around the drive. Post-surgery, animals were rehydrated with a subcutaneous 5–10ml injection of 4% glucose saline and given postoperative analgesia (0.06 ml, 5 mg/ml meloxicam, Boehringer Ingelheim).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Behavior</title><p id="P8">Recordings were performed in a custom-made circular track arena (diameter 1.3 m) with a central sleep box (0.4 x 0.4 m). For awake (AWK) recordings, animals were trained to run outwardly around the track by accessing a small quantity of 50% water/condensed milk (by triggering one of two motion detectors positioned at 180° to one another) and returning to retrieve an experimenter-placed Cheerio (Nestle) reward at the start location. For sleep recordings, i.e., slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), animals were placed in a central sleep box with bedding and access to <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Recordings</title><p id="P9">Recordings were performed during the light phase of a 12 h, day/night cycle following a postsurgery recovery period of no less than 8–10 days. Recordings were conducted using the DacqUSB acquisition system (Axona Ltd., St. Albans UK). Signals were amplified between 6000x and 12000x and bandpass filtered between 0.38 and 7 KHz for single unit detection. Spike detection and unit sorting was performed based on tetrode configuration of electrodes to remove duplicates within octrode recordings; units that shared &gt;5% common spike times were identified and the cluster with the lower spike rate was discorded. Additionally, units with a firing rate of &lt; 1 Hz were discarded. Local field potentials were sampled at a frequency of 4.8 kHz and downsampled to 2.4 KHz for all subsequent analyses. Automated spike sorting was performed using KlustaKwik (version 0.3.0: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kadir et al., 2014</xref>) and manual verification and adjustment was performed using Tint (Axona Ltd., St Albans, UK).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Perfusion/histology</title><p id="P10">At the end of experiments, animals were given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, Euthatal, Rhone Merieux) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 m PBS followed by 2.5% PFA in 0.1 m PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in 2.5% PFA before being transferred to 20% sucrose in 0.1M PBS for approximately 24 hours.

Power spectra were normalized to account for differences in electrode impedance by the integral of the power in the spectrum. Optimal LFP channels for use in analyses across a given session was chosen based on a combination of the spectral power in the theta band (4-12 Hz) during AWK recordings (MB and HPC), as well as the number of SWRs recorded during sleep recordings in the same recording day (HPC only).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Granger Causality</title><p id="P13">In order to estimate the strength and directionality of information transfer between the medial MB, and the hippocampal LFP, we employed the MVGC toolbox, which utilises the Weiner-Granger causality method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barnett and Seth, 2014</xref>). This method assesses the degree to which the information content in one time domain signal predicts another in the frequency domain using autoregessive models. Local field potentials from both brain regoins were input as unfiltered signals, downsampled to a sampling frequency of 120 Hz. The model order was determined using the Levinson-Wiggins-Robinson algorithm and a maximum model order was defined as 50 sample points and the optimal order was defined using the Baysien Information Criterion (BIC).

A theta/delta ratio for each time window was calculated using a peak detection algorithm on a smoothed (moving-average) of the maximum-normalized and squared signal of the spectrum. A global (whole recording) manual threshold based on visual classification was used to achieve optimal separation of AWK and NREM states (a lower than threshold TD ratio was classified as NREM and higher than threshold, AWK). Similarly, REM states were identified using the theta/delta ratio, with a speed threshold of 4 cm/s set to separate REM and AWK states.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Sharp Wave Ripple Detection</title><p id="P15">Candidate SWRs were detected using peak detection threshold of the mean plus four standard deviations of the 150-250Hz bandpass-filtered SWS-indexed hippocampal LFP signal, with a minimum inter-peak time period of 200 ms. From ripple triggered averages of candidate SWR times (20 ms), the number of oscillations above the standard deviation threshold were counted and SWR events were considered valid if there were at least 5 oscillations above threshold within a 20 ms window surrounding the putative event.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>REM-SWS Comparisons</title><p id="P16">To assess changes in firing activity during different sleep states, REM and SWS epochs were first defined. REM events, identified as timepoints with high theta/delta power ratios and sub-threshold (&lt;4 cm/s) movement speeds, were concatenated to define single REM epochs if there were fewer than 60 s between REM events. SWS epochs were defined similarly; SWS intervals were concatenated to form SWS epochs if there were fewer than 60 s between SWS events. For each day where there were identifiable REM epochs of over 30 s duration, the REM epoch with the longest duration and with neighboring SWS epochs was selected for analysis. Mean firing rates were calculated for MB and putative HPC pyramidal cells during REM and the neighboring SWS epochs.

Positional information was resampled to 2.4 KHz and smoothed using a moving average filter across 100 ms windows. Spike rates were calculated for 1 cm/s bins (range 1-60 cm/s). Speed bins were included only if the range had been sampled for a minimum of 1 s within the recording session. Spike counts per cycle were calculated by first detecting the peaks of 4-12 Hz bandpass filtered hippocampal LFP. The integer rounded mean running speed of each theta cycle and the number of spikes for each corresponding cycle were calculated, allowing the mean average number of spikes per cycle in each speed bin (1-60 cm/s) to be determined. To assess the relationship between phase preference and running speed, speed values for each spike were calculated by finding the spike triggered average of the running speed (200 ms windows). Spike phase values were calculated through piecewise cubic polynominal interpolation of phase angle values of the hippocampal LFP. Mean resultant vector lengths (MRV; square root of the sum of the sin and cosine components of the phase values) of phase values from each valid speed bin were calculated. For each unit, the relationship between firing rate and running speed was assessed using linear regression. Where significant relationships between running speed and firing rate were observed, likelihood ratio tests were implemented to determine whether the inclusion of a quadratic term in nested models significantly improved the model fit (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Waveform</title><p id="P20">Waveforms were extracted for each unit (50 bins of 0.04ms) from the recording channel with the largest mean peak waveform amplitude. Waveforms were normalized by peak firing amplitude and any inverted waveforms were excluded from analysis. Putative hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal neurons were identified through KMeans clustering of the first two principal components of hippocampal unit mean normalized waveforms and the z-score of their mean firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">English et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nitzan et al., 2020</xref>). Putative interneurons were excluded from subsequent analysis. Waveform asymmetry was defined as the difference between the minimum amplitudes before and after the peak. Waveform peak-trough width was defined as the number of bins between the peak and the minimum amplitude after the peak. Peak-trough width and asymmetry measures were compared between MBs and HPC using MANOVA and post-hoc one-way ANOVAs.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Angular Head Velocity</title><p id="P21">Angular head velocity (AHV) was calculated as the first derivative of head direction based on the first five minutes of each central sleep box recording. AHV calculations were based on recordings of quiet wakefulness in the sleep box, rather than the circular track, to remove the potential confound of running speed-dependent changes in firing rate derived from changes in heading direction that naturally occur when running in a circle. First, head direction (HD) was derived from the X and Y coordinates of one small and one large LED cluster that were mounted on the headstage. Head direction data were resampled to 1KHz and smoothed using a moving average filter across 100 ms windows. To obtain corresponding AHV values, a moving window (400 ms) surrounding each sample was indexed and the linear slopes (AHV values) were calculated. AHV values were assigned to 0.1 radians/s bins within a range of ±5 radians/s; bins with less than 1 s of occupancy were discarded. Firing rates within each bin were then calculated and tuning curves were generated for each unit. For each tuning curve, linear regressions were performed, separately, on clockwise (-5 to 0 radians/s), and counterclockwise (0-5 radians/s) head movements. A shuffling procedure was then performed, in which spike trains were circularly shifted (500 iterations) by randomly generated values between 20-100 s. Thresholds were then calculated from distributions of the estimates derived from linear regression of the shuffled-generated tuning curves. A unit was considered to be significantly AHV modulated if the estimate generated from non-shuffled data was greater than the upper bound (99% confidence interval) of the shuffle distribution (clockwise movement), or lower than the 1% confidence interval of the shuffle distribution for counterclockwise head movements.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Theta Rhythmicity/Phase</title><p id="P22">The theta index of a unit, as defined by the ratio of the power of the autocorrelogram within 1 Hz of the theta peak and the power within the entire spectrum of the autocorrelogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Climer et al., 2015</xref>), provides a measure of the degree to which a unit engages in theta rhythmic firing. To assess theta cycle phase preference, a Hilbert transformation was applied to the 4-12 Hz bandpassed filtered (3<sup>rd</sup> order Butterworth) hippocampal LFP. Spike phase values were calculated through piecewise cubic polynomial interpolation of the LFP instantaneous phase values. To classify units as phase entrained, phase tuning curves were generated from circularly shifted spike trains (1000 iterations, shifted by a random value between –5 and 5 s). The mean resultant vector (MRV) length was calculated for the shuffled and non-shuffled data and a unit was classified as significantly phase entrained if the non-shuffled MRV was greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution of MRVs based on shuffled spike trains.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Burstiness</title><p id="P23">The burst probability for each unit was calculated as the number of bursts divided by the sum of the number of bursts and spikes in the session. Burst detection was performed according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oosterhof and Oosterhof (2013)</xref>. Bursts were defined as complexes with a minimum of 3 spikes, with a maximum ISI to start a putative burst of 6 ms, and a maximum continuing ISI of 8 ms. Medial MB units were classified as dominant bursting (DB) or sparsely bursting (SB) based on the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Simonnet and Brecht (2019)</xref>. Specifically, principal component analyses were performed on the probability normalized log ISI histograms (logISI; 0.001-10 s), and the first 20 ms from the central peak of the autocorrelograms for each unit. Ward’s hierarchical clustering method was subsequently performed on the first principal component of the autocorrelation and the first to third principal components of the logISIs. Principal component inclusion was based on the variance explained and the visual inspection of population logISIs and autocorrelations when sorted by PCA score.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>SWR-Responsive Activity</title><p id="P24">To assess the degree to which medial MB unit firing was positively-, negatively-, or unmodulated by hippocampal SWRs, spikes within ±500 ms of each SWR were summed to generate peri-SWR time histograms (PSTH) for each MB, or HPC unit. To determine the significance of responsive firing, PSTHs were generated from shuffled datasets in which ripple event times were circularly shifted (1000 iterations) by a random set value of between –5, and +5 s. An SWR responsiveness index (SWR RI) was calculated for each true PSTH by subtracting the mean firing rate from a 250 ms window around the shifted event time from the same period of each actual PSTHs. From each shuffled PSTH, the mean firing rate within the same window of the remaining 999 shuffled PSTHs were subtracted to generate a normal distribution of SWR responsiveness indices. The values of the SWR responsiveness indices of the non-shuffled PSTHs were compared with respect to the 5th and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the shuffled distribution in order to assess the likelihood that the observed peri-SWR firing could happen by chance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P25">Statistical analyses were performed either in R Statistics (version 4.3.1; provided in the public domain by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; R Development Core Team, 2009, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>), in MATLAB (version 2022a; The MathWorks), or in python (version 3.6.6 – using the packages <italic>pingouin</italic> and <italic>statsmodels</italic>). For within unit analyses of firing rate correlates of movement, i.e., running speed and angular head velocity, linear models were fitted. For analyses in which parameters were compared between assigned groups, e.g., DB vs SB, a random term (1|subject ID) was included in linear mixed effects models to account for the assignment of units to different animal subjects.

Employing the same terminology as that used by Simmonet and Brecht in the subiculum, clustering of MB units identified two distinct groups: sparsely bursting units (SB; 409/543 units; 75.3%), and dominantly bursting units (DB; 134/543 units; 24.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To determine the effectiveness of this classification, a comparison of unit burst probability between the clusters revealed that DB units had a significantly higher propensity to burst (difference in burst probability: 0.07±0.002, t = 24.10, Chi = 408.84, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), while firing rates were also significantly higher in the DB group (difference between DB and SB: 20.94±1.12 Hz, t = 18.62, Chi = 268.92, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Furthermore, visual inspection of the logISIs of DB and SB clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; black and red, respectively) showed a LogISI peak in the DB cluster, spanning ~2-15ms that was largely absent in the SB cluster, reflecting the short latency between spikes within a burst event.

Of these 80 putative theta-skipping medial MB units, 20 (25%) were also classified as DB units, which was representative of the proportion of DB units within the total medial MB population. To investigate the occurrence of theta cycle skipping DB unit firing, we calculated log inter-burst interval (LogIBI) histograms for all DB-classified medial MB units. Across all DB units, the mean LogIBI histogram had two dominant peaks, the first within typical theta range (6-12 Hz) and a second at approximately half this frequency (4-6 Hz).

With this in mind, we next sought to ascertain whether medial MB unit activity changes with respect to HPC SWRs during SWS. Medial MB spike-triggered averages of the hippocampal LFP during SWS revealed, in many cases, putative SWR events. The same analysis applied to the medial MB LFP showed that putative hippocampal SWRs were often associated with corresponding low frequency events in the medial MB LFP. To address whether these were, in fact, hippocampal SWRs, and medial MB response events, respectively, we next detected HPC ripple events (150-250 Hz) in the hippocampal LFP. Ripple event-triggered averages of the hippocampal LFP provided validation of our ripple-detection approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>; red trace), with the mean average across animals showing a characteristic SWR shape. The same approach with the medial MB LFP showed that the mean response event waveform, i.e., a putative medial MB response event was remarkably consistent between animals.

In the present study, we classified over 500 medial MB units and found the physiological characteristics, and relative proportions of cells, to be in line with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sharp and Turner-Williams, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P47">However, in addition to cells showing running speed related firing, angular head velocity, theta firing rhythmicity and theta phase preference, we report, for the first time in awake rodents, complex bursting activity and cycle skipping firing/bursting in medial MB spike trains. By recording from the medial MB across the sleep wake cycle, we found that across theta dominant states (AWK/REM), theta-related characteristics, i.e., phase preference and theta rhythmicity in spike trains of units, were largely conserved, and the bursting characteristics of cells was consistent across states, including slow-wave sleep (SWS). Finally, we report that a proportion of medial MB (37%) units exhibit hippocampal sharp wave ripple (SWR)-responsive firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P48">We found similar proportions of units with running-speed dependent firing (62.8%) to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sharp and Turner-Williams (2005</xref>; 57.9%). However, we found fewer units to be positively correlated (67% vs ~90%) and, while Sharp and Turner-Williams found speed-dependent firing in the medial MB to be linear, we found that the fit of 33.4% of units was significantly improved by inclusion of a quadratic term. A non-linear fit suggests that firing rates plateau at modest speeds in these units, similar to the saturating speed cells reported in the medial entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hinman et al., 2016</xref>). The discrepancy in findings is likely due to the speed correlations being assessed over a shorter range in the Sharp and Turner-Williams study (0-40 cm/s) making the saturation in firing rate less apparent. As a population, the running speed-responsive firing properties of medial MB units share a number of characteristics with those reported in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hinman et al., 2016</xref>) and anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lomi et al., 2023</xref>), i.e., in proportions of units that show either linear, or saturating speed relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). How the speed signal in the medial MBs contributes to the greater speed-dependent circuitry is unclear; the MBs might passively relay the speed signal from the hippocampal formation to the anterior thalamic nuclei. However, given that the medial MBs also receive vestibular inputs via the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Irle et al., 1984</xref>), they may have a role in integrating movement-related information with theta frequency.</p><p id="P49">Approximately a quarter of medial MB units (24.7%) were found to have dominant bursting (DB) characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), and the propensity for DB neurons to burst was remarkably consistent across arousal states. The majority of these bursting units also conjointly fired in relation to speed, angular velocity and/or theta. This bursting activity may be particularly important for the synchronization of activity within the medial MBs and may result in an enhanced, more reliable transmission of information to the anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lisman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Csicsvari et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zeldenrust et al., 2018</xref>). Spike trains can also be segregated into single spike and bursting activity, facilitating the transfer of two different information streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oswald et al., 2004</xref>). The presence of such bursting activity in the medial MBs raises the question of whether the medial MBs might act to segregate spatial, motor, and theta-related information, transmitting this information to the anterior thalamic nuclei through parallel information streams, or whether this bursting activity acts to ensure the stability of transfer of particularly salient information during mnemonic processing.</p><p id="P50">The medial MBs receive input from theta-dominant structures, i.e., the HPC (subiculum), the VTg, and septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dillingham et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these inputs, we found a large proportion of medial MB units (~50%) that exhibit rhythmic firing at theta-frequencies with a broad distribution of preferred theta phases, which aligns with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kocsis and Vertes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sharp and Turner-Williams, 2005</xref>). However, we also observed theta cycle-skipping firing in the medial MBs. While theta cycle-skipping unit activity has been reported in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Harris et al., 2003</xref>), parahippocampal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deshmukh et al., 2010</xref>), prefrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tang et al., 2021</xref>), and nucleus reuniens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jankowski et al., 2014</xref>), it has not previously been reported in the medial MBs. Across these different regions, theta-skipping cells have been linked to the representation of different environments and different future trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jezek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Robinson and Brandon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of theta cycle skipping units implicates the medial MBs as a node in this prospective coding network. Given the importance of the medial MBs for spatial working memory and the acquisition of spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Santin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Vann and Aggleton, 2003</xref>), it will be important to assess how theta-cycle skipping in the medial MBs contributes to these functions.</p><p id="P51">Our interest in physiological changes in the medial MBs across the sleep-wake cycle was driven primarily by recent, complementary findings on subicular-medial MB projections: 1. subicular-medial MB units show SWR-dependent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kitanishi et al., 2021</xref>); 2. VGLUT2 subicular neurons send SWR information to the retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nitzan et al., 2020</xref>); and 3, this VGLUT2 subicular-retrosplenial projection sends collaterals to the medial MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kinnavane et al., 2018</xref>). Our finding, that a considerable proportion of medial MB units (~37%) increased their firing rate around hippocampal SWR events, supports the idea that subicular projections to the medial MBs carry SWR-related information during SWS. An interesting aspect of SWR-responsive firing in the medial MBs was the combined contribution of both dominant bursting and sparsely bursting units, suggesting that the two primary efferent targets of the medial MBs, the anterior thalamus, and VTg, may be receiving multiple SWR-related information streams. Ripple-correlated bursting activity within the medial MBs, rather than isolated spikes, might also suggest that SWR-responsive activity in the medial MBs is modifying rather than simply relaying hippocampal information. As well as showing that nearly all medial MB-projecting units from the subiculum exhibit strongly SWR-responsive firing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kitanishi et al (2021)</xref> showed that anteroventral thalamic nucleus-projecting subiculum neurons showed reduced, weak, or non-SWR-responsive firing. Anterior thalamic neurons do, however, show SWR-coupled activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Viejo and Peyrache, 2020</xref>); the possibility exists, therefore, that propagation of hippocampal SWR-information to the anterior thalamus is dependent on the subiculum-medial MB pathway. Indeed, the medial MBs, which receive at least some of the same SWR-related input as the retrosplenial cortex, are well-placed to influence the temporal coupling of hippocampal SWRs, thalamo-cortical spindles, and delta waves in the cortex. The nesting of these events during SWS is associated with improved consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), and induction of spindles through optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (with which anterior thalamic nuclei share connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lozsádi, 1995</xref>), improves hippocampal-dependent consolidation by increasing frequency of coupling of these events in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>). Like the medial MB, another major hippocampal output target, the lateral septum (LS), contains a high number of SWR-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wirtshafter and Wilson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tingley and Buzsaki, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Howe and Blair, 2022</xref>). In the medial MBs, high frequency (100-250 Hz) SWR response events were temporally correlated with hippocampal SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>); In the LS, high frequency events, were often synchronized with SWRs but were also observed independently of HPC, and stimulation of GABAergic LS neurons elicited high frequency events locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tingley and Buzsaki, 2020</xref>). Unlike the LS, medial MB neurons are uniformly excitatory but in the absence of GABAergic neurons locally within the medial MBs, high frequency oscillations could feasibly be generated through recruitment of GABAergic VTg neurons via mammillothalamic axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hayakawa and Zyo, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Umaba et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P52">A second reason for assessing sleep-cycle dependent changes, was that firing rates in VTg have been reported to increase dramatically during REM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bassant and Poindessous-Jazat, 2001</xref>) compared to during wakefulness. Given that the medial MBs have dense reciprocal connections with VTg, we were interested to see if medial MB unit firing showed similar characteristics. Our observations of firing rate changes across the sleep-cycle found the contrary. Medial MB units exhibited a small but significant reduction in firing rates during REM sleep when compared to AWK. This reduction in firing rate may reflect increased inhibition from GABAergic VTg inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bassant and Poindessous-Jazat, 2001</xref>), alternatively, given that a large proportion of medial MB units exhibit motion-responsive firing (e.g. running speed and AHV), it is possible that it reflects the absence of vestibular and motion-related input during sleep. However, we also reported a greater reduction in MB unit firing rates during SWS sleep than REM sleep, thus reduction in motility alone cannot explain the extent of the changes in MB firing rates across sleep states. The modulation of MB firing rates across sleep states is in stark contrast to the relative stability of HPC PYR rates across sleep states. Sleep-state related changes in synchrony also differed between medial MBs and PYR units, with medial MB units maintaining synchrony across sleep state transitions, while PYR ensembles desynchronized during REM. Taken together with our findings that medial MB units maintain their theta phase preference during REM and exhibit phase-entrainment to the down-state of slow waves during SWS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), it is possible that MB units are entrained to the dominant oscillatory frequency across sleep states, and changes in firing rates across sleep reflect those frequencies that define REM, and SWS. When considering that a significant proportion of MB units exhibit SWR-mediated increases in firing, the overall reduction of medial MB firing rates during SWS may provide a mechanism that reduces background activity to, in effect, amplify SWR events to the ATN. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the size and location of the medial MBs, very few <italic>in vivo</italic> recording studies have focused on this region, in freely moving animals. The present study both consolidates and extends current knowledge showing how the physiological properties in the medial MBs may support their role in complex memory formation. The physiological characteristics of the medial MBs largely reflect their dominant hippocampal inputs. Strikingly, a majority of neurons exhibit conjugate firing properties, e.g., a combined running speed, angular head velocity, bursting, theta rhythmicity representation, suggesting that unlike the parallel lateral MB pathway, in which the degree of complexity in neuron representations increases from the bottom-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dillingham and Vann, 2019</xref>), the medial MBs are involved in higher order processing. Further functional heterogeneity is demonstrated by the varied responses of medial MB units to hippocampal SWR events, as well as widespread theta cycle-skipping activity. These combined properties point towards an active role of medial MBs in the formation of complex spatial memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">McNaughton and Vann, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship awarded to SDV (WT212273/Z/18).

Statement</title></caption><p>While the medial mammillary bodies (MBs) are important for memory, it is still not clear how they support memory formation. Through conjoint medial MB and hippocampal recordings across different arousal states we identified a population of medial MB units with diverse and often conjunctive physiological properties, including theta-entrained cells, cells modulated by running speed and angular head velocity, complex bursting, theta cycle skipping activity, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripple-responsive firing. These properties likely support a role for the medial MBs in mnemonic processing, enabling the integration of separate sensory streams and the propagation of information to the thalamus.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Local field potential (LFP) characteristics of the mammillary bodies (MB) from conjoint hippocampal (HPC), and medial MB recordings.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Histological reconstructions of the MB electrode tracks (red lines).
