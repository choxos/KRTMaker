However, the orchestration of these reprogramming events by maternal factors deposited in the oocyte is not yet entirely understood. We and others have recently shown that epigenetic modifiers such as SMARCA5 (the main ATPase in ISWI complexes) can initiate the ZGA transcriptional programme <italic>in vitro</italic>. So far, the role of SMARCA5 in ZGA <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been addressed, as constitutive knock-out mice lacking SMARCA5 are not viable. We have overcome this limitation by using the targeted protein-depletion system Trim Away to degrade SMARCA5 in early zygotes. We further harnessed the power of single cell multi-omics (scNMT-seq) and showed that in the absence of SMARCA5, major ZGA genes fail to be upregulated at the two-cell stage. This is explained by the lower accessibility and disrupted nucleosome positioning at their promoters and distal regulatory regions, compared to wild-type embryos. In contrast, we show that global chromatin accessibility at the two-cell stage is higher in SMARCA5 depleted embryos compared to control embryos, and this is accompanied by other global structural changes involving heterochromatic regions. Our results show that SMARCA5 has a global regulatory role at the two-cell stage, which includes the control of ZGA gene promoters and distal regulatory regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Smarca5</kwd><kwd>zygotic genome activation</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodelling</kwd><kwd>mouse embryo</kwd><kwd>nucleosomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The journey of all new mammalian organisms starts with the moment of fertilisation and the formation of a one-cell embryo (zygote), containing haploid maternal and paternal nuclei (pronuclei). At this stage, the two pronuclei need to undergo epigenetic reprogramming in order to be able to give rise to a totipotent zygote, as part of the complex maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2018</xref>). In mouse embryos, the first transcriptional events take place in the zygote, followed by a major transcriptional burst at the two-cell stage (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abe et al., 2018</xref>; K. -i. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Abe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>). This genome awakening event is known as zygotic genome activation (ZGA), comprising the minor and the major ZGA in the zygote and the two-cell stage, respectively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To study early developmental processes such as ZGA <italic>in vitro,</italic> stem cell model systems have been used. So called mouse 2C-like cells (2CLCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>) and human 8C-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Taubenschmid-Stowers et al., 2022</xref>) exist among embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that transcriptionally and epigenetically resemble ZGA stage embryos. 2CLCs have been widely used to identify candidate regulators of genome activation in a high-throughput way <italic>in vitro</italic> and one such screen identified the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 as an inducer of ZGA-like transcription in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alda-Catalinas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Rodriguez-Terrones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). SMARCA5 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 5, or Snf2h) is the main ATPase in ISWI complexes that slide histones along the DNA double strand and act as a ruler for nucleosome positioning and distribution. SMARCA5 deficient ESCs are viable, however CTCF binding was disturbed in those cells and differentiation impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barisic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Wiechens et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">SMARCA5 plays a crucial role during oocyte development, and it is deposited in the mature oocytes both as protein and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). It has been shown to be lethal during peri-implantation in mice in various studies: <italic>Smarca5</italic> knockout embryos fail to develop normal inner cell mass (ICM) structures in blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Stopka &amp; Skoultchi, 2003</xref>) and <italic>Smarca5</italic> siRNA-mediated knockdown embryos fail to develop past the 8-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Torres-Padilla &amp; Zernicka-Goetz, 2006</xref>) or morula to blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, absence of SMARCA5 in oocytes leads to metaphase II (MII) stage defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and this made it difficult to study the role of (maternally deposited) SMARCA5 in zygotes and early embryos.</p><p id="P5">We asked if maternal SMARCA5 is required for mouse ZGA <italic>in vivo,</italic> and for this we used maternal knockout mouse models and the Trim-Away protein degradation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clift et al., 2017</xref>) in combination with single-cell nucleosome, methylation, and transcription sequencing (scNMT-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Clark et al., 2018</xref>) to assess the gene expression and epigenetic changes in SMARCA5 depleted embryos. We found that SMARCA5 deficient embryos fail to express two-cell specific transcripts and endogenous retroviral elements and thus established a requirement for SMARCA5 in mouse ZGA <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further discovered that chromatin at putative regulatory regions (which we defined as open chromatin regions in the two-cell stage embryos that are not promoters) and at ZGA gene promoters in two-cell embryos (but not other promoters) fail to open locally in absence of SMARCA5. These changes are opposite to the increased global chromatin accessibility induced by the absence of SMARCA5. Moreover, heterochromatin regions around nucleolus precursor bodies that require SMARCA5 fail to organise correctly in the two-cell stage embryos, as observed by the mislocalization of HP1-β.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Maternally deposited SMARCA5 is crucial for preimplantation development beyond the two-cell stage</title><p id="P6">We first assessed the presence of SMARCA5 in wild-type (CB57L/6) embryos by immunofluorescence and confirmed its nuclear localisation in oocytes and throughout preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). In order to test if maternally deposited SMARCA5 is required for mouse ZGA, we used <italic>Smarca5</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Smarca5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) in which exon 5 of the gene is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2019</xref>).

We confirmed the absence of SMARCA5 in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes derived from <italic>Smarca5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> females by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">It was previously reported that oocytes from <italic>Smarca5<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Zp3-Cre</italic> females fail to undergo proper oocyte maturation and do not reach the meiotic stage II (MII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, when we crossed <italic>Smarca5<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Zp3-Cre</italic> females with wild-type C57BL/6 males, we unexpectedly recovered some two-cell stage embryos at E1.5. The number of embryos was significantly reduced when compared to wild-type <italic>Smarca5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). By immunofluorescence, we observed that the recovered heterozygous embryos (<italic>Smarca5 matKO</italic>) lacked SMARCA5 at the two-cell stage, suggesting that in the absence of maternally deposited SMARCA5, the paternal allele also failed to be expressed at the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, the transposable element MERVL, a prominent ZGA-marker, was not detected in heterozygous embryos from maternal knockout females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This shows that major ZGA markers are not properly expressed in absence of maternal SMARCA5. Additionally, heterozygous <italic>Smarca5</italic> matKO embryos did not progress past the two-cell stage <italic>in vitro</italic>, while wild-type embryos at day E2.5 progressed to the morula (16-cell) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results suggest that absence of maternal SMARCA5 in oocytes and early embryos is incompatible with ZGA protein marker expression and preimplantation development past the two-cell stage.</p><p id="P8">To assess if gene expression coupled with epigenetic changes in <italic>Smarca5</italic> maternal knockout embryos were causing the developmental arrest, we performed single-embryo NMT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Clark et al., 2018</xref>), which provides simultaneous transcription, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility data from the same embryo. We collected late two-cell stage embryos, and assessed the expression of major ZGA genes using a gene list that was compiled from several mouse preimplantation RNA-seq data sets (K.-I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). We concluded that major ZGA genes failed to be upregulated at the two-cell stage in the absence of maternal SMARCA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Similarly, and consistent with the immunofluorescence results, <italic>MERVL</italic> transcripts levels are markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Differential expression analysis between WT and matKO two-cell stage embryos and showed that the majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) have lower levels in the absence of SMARCA5 (2030 genes out of 2420) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), and only a few have higher levels. The downregulated DEGs (or genes that failed to be upregulated, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) are typically expressed for the first time at the two-cell stage in wild-type embryos, a pattern characteristic of major ZGA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>, right boxplots) and enriched for cellular processes like ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing which are relevant for ZGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref> top). The upregulated DEGs (or genes that fail to be downregulated, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) are typically not expressed at high levels in the two-cell stage embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref> bottom). Altogether, these results demonstrate that in absence of maternal SMARCA5, the expression of major ZGA genes and transposons such as MERVL is impaired in mouse two-cell stage embryos.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Removal of maternally deposited SMARCA5 in zygotes impairs major ZGA</title><p id="P9">As the observed developmental failure of <italic>Smarca5 matKO</italic> embryos could be a consequence of the oocyte maturation phenotype previously described in <italic>Smarca5<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Zp3-Cre</italic> females and not its direct involvement in ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), we decided to remove maternal SMARCA5 protein exclusively after fertilisation in wild-type zygotes that have already undergone normal oocyte development. To achieve this, we adopted Trim-Away, an antibody mediated targeted protein degradation system in early zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clift et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In order to first validate the efficiency of Trim-Away in our hands, we depleted EG5, a motor protein that is involved in mitotic spindle assembly and has been previously shown to be degradable by Trim-Away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>) in MII oocytes and early zygotes. Following microinjections of anti-EG5 together with the mCherry-Trim21 mRNA, we indeed observed loss of EG5, as well as failure of the formation of the mitotic spindle and absence of alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clift et al., 2017</xref>). As a second control, we validated the specificity of the anti-SMARCA5 antibody in <italic>Smarca5</italic> knockout mouse embryonic stem cells (<italic>Smarca5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs), and showed absence of any nonspecific immunofluorescence signal. This confirmed that the anti-SMARCA5 antibody we decided to use will most likely not have off-target effects on other proteins in our Trim-Away experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To specifically degrade SMARCA5 in early embryos, we injected anti-SMARCA5 (or IgG control) antibody together with mCherry-Trim21 mRNA into early wild-type C57BL/6 zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We assessed the degradation efficiency at 7 h (late zygotes) and 28 h (late two-cell stage embryos) post-injection by immunofluorescence. We observed that SMARCA5 protein was not detectable in the late zygotic pronuclei of anti-SMARCA5 injected embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>) and was still absent in nuclei of two-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Notably, MERVL protein was significantly reduced in the absence of SMARCA5 at the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). In all our experiments, we observed a positive correlation between SMARCA5 levels and the levels of MERVL in Trim-Away embryos (both IgG and anti-SMARCA5 injected) and an inverse correlation between mCherry and SMARCA5 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>) which confirmed that the Trim-away system was successfully deployed (i. e. high levels of mCherry tagging TRIM21 protein will rapidly degrade SMARCA5 in those embryos).</p><p id="P12">The above results suggest that the ZGA associated transposon MERVL fails to be upregulated upon successful degradation of SMARCA5 protein in wild-type embryos. However, while these initial results were similar to the ones observed in <italic>Smarca5</italic> maternal knockout embryos, the developmental potential of anti-SMARCA5 injected embryos seemed only mildly affected, with no significant differences in survival rates between control and SMARCA5 depleted embryos up to blastocyst stage development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To further characterise the molecular consequences of SMARCA5 removal, and assess gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, NMT-seq libraries were generated from late two-cell stage Trim-Away and control embryos 24-28 h post injection. Analysing RNA-seq data from these embryos, we found that major ZGA genes and <italic>MERVL</italic> transcripts failed to be upregulated in the absence of SMARCA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A, B</xref>). Furthermore, DEG analysis identified ~1300 transcripts that failed to be upregulated upon SMARCA5 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), including genes characteristic of wild-type two-cell stage ZGA embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, bottom right boxplot</xref>). As these two-cell stage and major ZGA specific genes seemed dependent on SMARCA5 in our experiments, they will be further referred to as “SMARCA5-dependent ZGA genes”.</p><p id="P14">Reassuringly, there was a substantial overlap between genes that failed to be upregulated in SMARCA5 Trim-Away and <italic>Smarca5</italic> matKO embryos. GO term analysis revealed pathways including ‘Ribosome biogenesis’ and ‘RNA processing’, which are characteristic of major ZGA gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In addition, differential expression analysis identified ~500 genes (compiled from all three replicates) that failed to be downregulated in the absence of SMARCA5 compared to control IgG-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These transcripts are normally present in wild-type embryos at the zygote stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, top right boxplot), indicating that they could be maternal deposits or zygotic transcripts that fail to be removed. Thus, while Trim-Away mediated depletion of SMARCA5 after fertilisation did not recapitulate the developmental phenotype observed in the <italic>Smarca5</italic> maternal knockout embryos, both displayed very similar effects on impaired two-cell stage gene expression. This indicates that SMARCA5 is required for major ZGA transcription in mouse embryos, and not just for oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Absence of zygotic SMARCA5 alters accessibility and nucleosome phasing around ZGA gene promoters and enhancers</title><p id="P16">In order to investigate the molecular details and causes of ZGA impairment (while avoiding potential confounding effects from defective oocyte maturation) we focused on SMARCA5 Trim-Away embryos to assess the effects of its removal at the chromatin level. The main function of SMARCA5 in ISWI complexes is to slide nucleosomes along the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abdulhay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barisic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Wiechens et al., 2016</xref>), it acts as a nucleosome ruler, and locally and globally regulates chromatin accessibility. We thus hypothesised that changes in ZGA transcription may be caused by altered accessibility or nucleosome positioning around major ZGA genes. To test this, we analysed accessibility data of the generated single-embryo NMT-seq samples from SMARCA5 Trim-Away two-cell embryos.</p><p id="P17">Notably, we found that transcriptional start sites (TSS) at promoters of SMARCA5-dependent ZGA genes showed lower local accessibility in absence of SMARCA5 as compared to control IgG-injected and wild-type embryos (after background correction; subtraction of median global accessibility) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). TSS at promoters of SMARCA5 independent genes (control promoters), on the other hand, showed no difference between SMARCA5 depleted and control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). SMARCA5 independent gene TSS (controls) are generally less accessible than SMARCA5-dependent ZGA in wild-type embryos at the two-cell stage. In addition, the nucleosome phasing around TSS of major ZGA genes is mildly disturbed in the absence of SMARCA5, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>, based on the different pattern of small peaks following the large accessible TSS peak (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>, non-normalized).</p><p id="P18">We further examined putative distal regulatory regions that controlled major ZGA genes. These regions were previously identified based on ATAC-seq peaks at the two-cell stage in mice and analysed in SMARCA5 depleted embryos (see Wu et. al., 2016). These distal regulatory elements also showed lower accessibility in the absence of SMARCA5 compared to control embryos, and a slight change in the nucleosome positioning (the small peaks around the centre of the regulatory regions shows a different pattern from the one in control embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). This shows that SMARCA5 is involved in opening of major ZGA gene promoters and distal regulatory regions in mouse two-cell embryos.</p><p id="P19">In mESC, absence of SMARCA5 has been reported to affect nucleosome phasing around certain transcription factor bindings sites, one of them being CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barisic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Wiechens et al, 2016</xref>). We saw a similar effect in the two-cell stage embryos lacking SMARCA5, with disrupted nucleosome phasing around CTCF binding motifs.

The chromatin structure in preimplantation embryos is highly dynamic, with a wide range of changes taking place immediately after fertilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Probst &amp; Almouzni, 2011</xref>). The number of nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs) increases in the two-cell stage embryos compared to the zygote, and they are surrounded by “rings” of constitutive heterochromatin, particularly major and minor satellites, marked by HP1-β (Lachner et al., 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Probst et al., 2007</xref>).

Using HP1-β immunofluorescence, we observed structural differences of heterochromatin regions in the nuclei of SMARCA5 deficient embryos as compared to wild-type ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). These include a higher number of NPBs in <italic>Smarca5 matKO</italic> embryos, which are, however, smaller in size and contain less HP1-β than NPBs in wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B – 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12A</xref>).

In addition, we used a targeted protein degradation system to deplete SMARCA5 in wild-type zygotes (SMARCA5 Trim-Away) to show that maternal SMARCA5 is required for mouse ZGA.</p><p id="P26"><italic>Smarca5</italic> conditional knockout female mice were previously reported to be sterile, due to an oocyte maturation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, we recovered a low number of fertilised zygotes and two-cell stage <italic>Smarca5</italic> maternal knockout embryos, which arrested at the two-cell stage, while showing a failure to express major ZGA genes. The observed differences between our study and Zhang et al. could be due to differences in mouse strains or numbers of females used in the study.</p><p id="P27">To separate the oocyte maturation phenotype from the embryonic phenotype, we adopted the powerful and versatile Trim-Away technology to deplete the chromatin remodeler exclusively after fertilisation in wild-type zygotes. Similar to the maternal knockout embryos, Trim-Away SMARCA5 depleted embryos fail to properly transcribe major ZGA genes. While the major ZGA defect was more severe and consistent among individual <italic>Smarca5</italic> matKO embryos, following Trim-Away we observed a more variable phenotype between replicates and individual embryos throughout our results. This variability is likely caused by differences in the system’s efficiency and reproducibility (introduced by injection efficiency, antibody batch used, and the actual stage of the zygote at the time of injection). Moreover, the variability observed in the Trim-Away embryos can explain the overall lower magnitude of major ZGA gene expression changes, and the reduced impact on the developmental phenotype of these embryos, when compared to their maternal KO counterparts. Using both systems, we concluded that <italic>Smarca5</italic> is a maternal effect gene, as its absence is detrimental for major ZGA and potentially for embryonic development past the two-cell stage.</p><p id="P28">We further observed that promoters and distal regulatory elements of SMARCA5-dependent ZGA genes failed to open their chromatin in the absence of the chromatin remodeler, suggesting that SMARCA5 specifically increases their accessibility, possibly through local binding. However, based on the global increase in accessibility observed across experiments and conditions in absence of normalisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>), an alternative explanation could be that the SMARCA5-dependent ZGA promoters are as open as in the control embryos, but on the background of a much more globally accessible chromatin landscape that fails to compact in the absence of SMARCA5. Thus, the transcription activation failure of these ZGA genes could be explained either by a direct local role of SMARCA5 at their promoters, or by an indirect global role, which could imply the redistribution of the transcriptional machinery to other regions of the genome (which is overall more accessible in SMARCA5’s absence). A combination of both scenarios might also be possible.</p><p id="P29">The aberrant enrichment of maternal and minor ZGA transcripts at the two-cell stage in the absence of SMARCA5 is an indication that the embryos fail to efficiently transition from maternal to embryonic control.

A similar effect was previously reported upon the removal of other maternal effect genes, such as STELLA/PGC7/DPPA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), RNF114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), or YAP1 and TEAD4 (Q.

However, as the Trim-Away system is transient and the SMARCA5 protein levels could have been restored after the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Israel et al., 2019</xref>), we cannot fully exclude that SMARCA5 is transcribed again and contributes to the later stages of preimplantation development. Moreover, it has been previously reported that even if transcription is transiently inhibited at the two-cell stage by a Polymerase II inhibitor, some embryos can still develop to morulae and even blastocyst stages (K.-I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abe et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the fact that the embryos in our Trim-Away experiments developed to the morula stage does not entirely exclude the possibility that the ZGA genes transcription at the two-cell stage was affected.</p><p id="P31">Overall, the above results reveal that SMARCA5 is a key regulator of the activation of the genome in two-cell stage embryos <italic>in vivo</italic>, as was hypothesised following the results from the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screen in mESCs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alda-Catalinas et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We propose a dual role for maternal SMARCA5 in mouse preimplantation development and ZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).

After the addition of 11 μl of 2Å~ KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (7958927001, Roche) and 1 μl of 2 mM ISPCR primers (Picelli et al. 2013), the samples were amplified under the following conditions: 98°C for 3 min, 15 cycles of 98°C for 15 s, 67°C for 20 s, 72°C for 6 min and finally 72°C for 5 min. The resulting DNA was purified (Ampure Beads, Beckman Coulter) and eluted in 20 μl nuclease-free water. Libraries were prepared from 100-400 pg of cDNA using Nextera XT Kit (Illumina), as per the manufacturer’s instructions but with one-fifth volumes for each sample.</p><p id="P52">scNOME-seq libraries: The cell lysate containing the genomic DNA, was purified with a 0.8:1 volumetric ratio of Ampure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter), washed twice in 80% EtOH and eluted into 10 μl of nuclease-free water. Bisulfite conversion was carried out using EZ Methylation Direct MagBead kit (Zymo) using half of the volumes recommended in the manufacturers’ protocol, for 3 h, at 64°C, followed by desulphonation and purification. Converted DNA was eluted in 40 μl of first strand synthesis mastermix [1 Å~ Blue Buffer (Enzymatics), 0.4 mM dNTP mix (Roche), 0.4μM 6NF oligo (IDT)]. On the thermocycler, the DNA was heated to 65 °C for 3 min and immediately cooled on ice, to allow the addition of 50 U of Klenow exo- (Enzymatics), and from 4°C slowly ramping up to 37 °C, incubated for 30 min. This was repeated 4 more times, but following the initial incubation at 65°C, 2.5 μl of reaction mixture prepared in advance was added at every round: 1Å~ Blue buffer, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 10 mM 6NF oligo and 50 U Klenow exo- (Enzymatics). After the first-strand synthesis, 40 U of Exonuclease I (NEB, M0568) was added and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1h, and purified using a 0.75:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads. A mix containing 50 μl of second strand mastermix [1Å~ Blue Buffer (Enzymatics), 0.4 mM dNTP mix (Roche), 0.4 μM 6NF oligo (IDT)] was used to resuspend the purified products, which were then heated at 98 °C for 2 min and cooled on ice. 50 U of Klenow exo- (Enzymatics) was added, and the plate was incubated on a thermocycler, slowly ramping up the temperature from 4°C until 37°C, where it was kept for 90 min. The obtained second strand products were purified using a 0.8:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads. The PCR mastermix (50 μl) containing 1Å~ KAPA HiFi Readymix, 0.2 μM PE1.0 primer, 0.2 μM iTAG index primer, was used to elute the products. In order to amplify the final scBS-seq library, the reaction was cycled for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 14 cycles of 80 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 65°C, 30 sec at 72°C, and extended for 5 min at 72°C. The samples were then pooled (5 μl of each sample), and the PCR reaction components were removed by a sequential purification using 0.7:1 and 0.8:1 volumetric ratio of AMPure XP beads to reaction volume.</p><p id="P53">The quality and concentration of all final libraries was checked using a Bioanalyzer device (Agilent). The multiplexed scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced at 75 bp paired-end on the Illumina NextSeq500 MidOutput and the multiplexed single-cell bisulfite and NOME-seq libraries were sequenced at 100 bp paired-end on the Illumina HiSeq2500 Rapid Run platform.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>scRNA-seq (from single embryo NMT-seq) data processing and analysis</title><p id="P54">Raw FastQ files were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.5, Cutadapt v2.3) and mapped to the mouse GRCm38 genome assembly using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) (D. Kim et al., 2015), with the options –dta –no-softclip –no-mixed –no-discordant. Only the reads that had MAPQ scores of 20 and above were retained.</p><p id="P55">The mapped data was imported intoSeqMonk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>) and the outlier samples (&gt; 15% mitochondrial reads, &lt; 25% genes) discarded. Gene expression was quantified using the RNA sequencing quantitation pipeline (mRNA probes, correcting for the total number of sequences in the dataset, and generating log transformed values (log 2 RPM)). Differential expression analysis between wild-type and maternal KO embryos or Trim-Away SMARCA5 depleted embryos was performed using DESeq2 (with multiple test correction, p &lt;0.05) and Intensity Difference (with multiple test correction, p &lt;0.05), followed by the intersection of the two.</p><p id="P56">Repeat elements expression levels (MERVL, LINE1) were measured by quantitating the individual instances of these repeats in the genome, and only uniquely mapped instances were counted (Read count quantitation pipeline, normalised to the total number of sequences in the dataset, log transformed (log2 RPM)). For data visualisation, plots were either directly generated in SeqMonk, or the data was exported and the final plots generated in R.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>NOME-seq (from single embryo NMT-seq) data processing and analysis</title><p id="P57">FastQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore (v0.6.5, default parameters) and mapped to the mouse GRCm38 genome assembly using Bismark (v0.23.1) (Krueger &amp; Andrews, 2011), with the additional --NOMe option in the coverage2cytosine script and –CX for the methylation extraction and coverage2cytosine processes. This produced separate report files: CpG files containing only A–C–G and T–C–G positions and GpC files containing only G–C–A, G–C–C and G–C–T positions. On average, more than 33% of C in a CpG context and more than 4.5% of C in a GpC context were methylated, as we would expect from this type of data for quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Clark et al., 2018</xref>). These CpG and GpC report files were imported into SeqMonk for data analysis.</p><p id="P58">DNA methylation: For DNA methylation analysis, data was quantitated using the bisulfite methylation over features SeqMonk pipeline, over non-overlapping windows containing 100 CpGs, spanning the entire genome, calculating the percentage methylation for each base (C) and averages these for each measured window. The windows were measured only if they had at least 10 observations (10 CpG sites out of 100, that were covered by at least 1 read). Because of the data sparsity, the analysis was carried out in pseudo-bulk, merging the data from individual embryos belonging to the same replicate and condition. On average 140,000 windows were measured for each pseudo-bulked sample. The same 100 CpG windows were used to assess the methylation status of different genomic features overlapping these windows (e.g. promoters and CpG islands). Differential methylation analysis was done in SeqMonk using the proportion based statistical test Chi-Square (with multiple test corrections, p&lt; 0.05) together with EdgeR (p&lt;0.05).</p><p id="P59">Accessibility data: Since the levels of C methylation in the GpC context is the read-out for accessibility, the analysis is similar to the one carried out on conventional CpG methylation. GpC data was quantitated using the Bisulfite Methylation over features pipeline, over 200 GpC (global accessibility) or 300 GpC (differentially accessible regions) containing windows, spanning the entire genome. The windows containing less than 10 observations (covered GpC sites, by at least 1 read) per window were filtered out, and coverage outliers (&gt; 100 RPM) in any sample were excluded. Due to data sparsity, datasets from individual embryos were merged according to their replicate and condition, and the rest of the analysis was carried out in pseudo-bulk. For the evaluation of accessibility at specific regions, only the 200 GpC windows that overlapped the genomic features of interest (promoters, distal regulatory regions) were considered.</p><p id="P60">For the nucleosome occupancy analysis at promoters, 50 bp probes (windows) were generated across regions 1 kb upstream and downstream of all gene start sites and quantitated using the bisulfite methylation pipeline (with minimum 1 GpC covered by at least 1 read).</p><p id="P61">For nucleosome occupancy at distal regulatory regions, the 50 bp probes were made across the 3 kb surrounding the centre of promoter distal ATAC-seq peaks, previously defined from a published mouse preimplantation ATAC-seq dataset (J. Wu et al., 2016a). For phasing around the CTCF motifs (HOMER motifs), the 50 bp probes were made across 2 kb from the centre of the motif.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Other software for figure generation</title><p id="P62">All the plots in this manuscript were generated in RStudio and SeqMonk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>).

Experimental design of Trim-Away. Zygotes collected from wild-type female mice (C57BL/6J) are microinjected with mCherry-Trim21 mRNA and the anti-SMARCA5 antibody. Once the TRIM21 protein is translated it recognises the Fc-region of the antibody which is already bound to its target, and the whole complex (Trim21-antibody-protein) will be degraded. Following injection, the embryos are cultured for assessment of their developmental potential, immunofluorescence stainings and single embryo NMT-seq.</p><p>B.

Proposed model for the 2 main functions of SMARCA5 in two-cell stage embryos during ZGA. As a regulator of a proportion of ZGA genes (SMARCA5-dependent ZGA genes), SMARCA5 opens up the cromating at their TSS, and also contributes to the nucleosome phasing around this regions, allowing the transcriptional machinery to transcribe these genes. The second role is global, as SMARCA5 seems to be involved in the organisation and reconfiguration of heterochromatic regions in the early embryos.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192580-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
