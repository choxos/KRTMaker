However, 8% of mushroom body Kenyon cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> receive predominantly visual input, and their tuning and function are poorly understood. Here, we use the FlyWire adult whole-brain connectome to identify inputs to visual Kenyon cells. The types of visual neurons we identify are similar across hemispheres and connectomes with certain inputs highly overrepresented. Many visual projection neurons presynaptic to Kenyon cells receive input from large swathes of visual space, while local visual interneurons, providing smaller fractions of input, receive more spatially restricted signals that may be tuned to specific features of the visual scene. Like olfactory Kenyon cells, visual Kenyon cells receive sparse inputs from different combinations of visual channels, including inputs from multiple optic lobe neuropils. The sets of inputs to individual visual Kenyon cells are consistent with random sampling of available inputs. These connectivity patterns suggest that visual coding in the mushroom body, like olfactory coding, is sparse, distributed, and combinatorial. However, the expansion coding properties appear different, with a specific repertoire of visual inputs projecting onto a relatively small number of visual Kenyon cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">In expansion layers, large populations of neurons with shared or similar developmental identity receive inputs from neurons carrying diverse sensory signals. Prominent examples include the lophotrochozoan parallel lobe system and chordate cerebellum, hippocampus, pallium, and cortex. A well-studied example is the mushroom body of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where ~2000 intrinsic neurons, called Kenyon cells, link sensory representations to proximate events via dopamine-mediated synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The mushroom body is thought to have evolved as an olfactory structure, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, more than 90% of Kenyon cells receive predominantly olfactory input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, 8% of Kenyon cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> receive mainly visual inputs, and radical expansions of the visual mushroom body have occurred independently in several arthropod clades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Flies have two subsets of visual Kenyon cells. KCγ-d cells (KCγ-d’s) are the first Kenyon cells to be generated in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. They receive olfactory input in the larval mushroom body, but re-wire during metamorphosis to innervate the ventral accessory calyx (vACA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In the adult, they have been shown to receive direct input from the medulla through the VPN-MB1 and VPN-MB2 visual projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and the accessory medulla through aMe12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. KCαβ-p cells (KCαβ-p’s) are born during pupal stages, before olfactory αβ cells, and innervate the dorsal accessory calyx (dACA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. They have been shown to receive indirect visual input through local visual interneurons (LVINs) processing signals from the lobula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These experimental observations were augmented by a description of the repertoire of visual interneurons providing inputs to the mushroom body in the hemibrain connectome dataset, which highlighted the previously unexpected extent of visual projections to this area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The visual system of the fruit fly is composed of four main neuropils: the lamina, the medulla, the lobula and the lobula plate. The accessory medulla is a lesser known small optic lobe neuropil, tucked between the medulla and the lobula, where the extraocular photoreceptors of the Hofbauer–Buchner “eyelet” send their axons. aMe neurons receive direct input from retinal photoreceptor cells as well as from eyelet photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Clock neurons also innervate the accessory medulla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The role of the accessory medulla has not been investigated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but in other insect species it has been implicated in entrainment of the circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While analyses of the hemibrain connectome were able to identify visual interneurons providing input to the mushroom body and found that visual projection neurons (VPNs) from the medulla, lobula and aMe innervate the calyx, the identity of these VPNs could not be determined due to the lack of comprehensive reconstruction of the optic lobe neuropils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, olfactory Kenyon cells have between 3 and 10 large, claw-shaped dendrites that each receive input from a single, multisynaptic “bouton” deriving from cholinergic olfactory projection neurons in the antennal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Individual Kenyon cells only spike when multiple of their inputs are active. They thus form a sparse, combinatorial code for chemical features of odor space that improves stimulus discriminability as compared to the antennal lobe representation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast to the well-studied olfactory representation, it is still unclear what kind of visual information is conveyed to the MB, how visual information is encoded in Kenyon cells, and what this information is used for. Whereas blue versus green color learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and context generalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> have been shown to specifically require the mushroom body, multiple visual learning paradigms, such as place learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and pattern recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, have been shown to rely on the central complex (CX). In terms of multisensory learning, which has been established in the context of memory enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and transfer between olfaction and vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, the association between olfactory and visual information has been suggested to rely on the mushroom body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The mushroom body has been shown to be required for learning of color associations in honeybees, learning of spatial associations in cockroaches, and navigation in ants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, we use the FlyWire adult whole brain electron microscopy connectome to describe the repertoires of inputs to individual visual Kenyon cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous reports, direct VPNs dominate input to KCγ-d cells, while indirect visual input via LVINs dominates input to KCαβ-p cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We focus our analysis on KCγ-d’s and find that individual Kenyon cells can receive inputs from mixtures of presynaptic partners, including from both VPNs and LVINs and from multiple optic lobe neuropils. Many KC-projecting VPNs receive input from large swathes of visual space, while some KC-projecting LVINs receive more spatially restricted signals across visual space, a wiring logic that would provide Kenyon cells with both information about full-field conditions of the environment and translational invariance for a limited number of specific visual features. Previous work found that aMe12 accessory medulla neurons provide input to visual Kenyon cells, and we find that inputs from this small neuropil are prominent overall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, providing a potential link between the circadian system and the MB. We find that like olfactory Kenyon cells, visual Kenyon cells receive sparse inputs, from 1-7 neurons each. Finally, we compare the input patterns to individual Kenyon cells between hemispheres and to a random model; input patterns vary across hemispheres in this brain and are consistent with a random sampling of available inputs, but certain inputs are highly overrepresented compared to others in both hemispheres. These connectivity patterns suggest that on the one hand, visual coding in the mushroom body, like olfactory coding, is sparse, distributed, and combinatorial. On the other hand, the expansion coding properties appear different, as a specific repertoire of visual input types project onto a relatively small number of visual Kenyon cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Visual projection neurons dominate input to the ventral accessory calyx, and local visual interneurons to the dorsal accessory calyx</title><p id="P9">Sensory information is conveyed to the dendrites of Kenyon cells in the mushroom body calyces. The main calyx contains the dendrites of olfactory Kenyon cells, representing 90% of the total population. Previous connectomics analyses in the hemibrain dataset revealed that other sensory streams make connections in accessory calyces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Visual inputs segregate into two streams of information that target KCγ-d cells (KCγ-d’s) in the ventral accessory calyx and KCαβ-p cells (KCαβ-p’s) in the dorsal accessory calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Each population receives both direct and indirect inputs (through LVINs) from VPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the hemibrain dataset, the proportion of direct vs. indirect inputs was shown to be different in the two accessory calyces: The ventral pathway is enriched in direct VPNs whereas the dorsal pathway is enriched in indirect connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">In the FlyWire reconstruction, we observe 147 and 148 KCγ-d cells on the left and right respectively; and 67 versus 61 KCαβ-p’s. As in the hemibrain dataset, VPNs make up the majority of visual input onto KCγ-d’s (49 of 74 presynaptic partners, 75% of input synapses), while LVINs constitute about a third of the inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Another prominent input to the KCγ-d population is the large inhibitory neuron APL, which makes on average 16 and 10 synapses per KCγ-d in the left and right hemispheres respectively (comparable to the average number of synapses APL makes onto each KCγ-m). In contrast to a previous observation that KCγ-d’s do not have clawed dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we observe KCγ-d’s that make bouton-claw and <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with incoming VPNs and LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For KCαβ-p’s, LVINs dominate the information flow (62.5% of presynaptic partners/84% of synapses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Few inputs are shared between KCγ-d’s and KCαβ-p’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). A ranking of VPNs and LVINs in terms of total synapse numbers made onto KCγ-d’s shows that while VPNs are the main inputs, several LVINs are among the highest connected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In the dorsal pathway to KCαβ-p’s, LVINs constitute the bulk of the inputs but several VPNs are intermingled among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). As LVINs are potential nodes for multisensory integration, receiving not only visual information through indirect VPNs but also information from other sensory modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, the dorsal and ventral pathways likely contribute differently to visual vs. multimodal mushroom body functions. While we expect the indirect and potentially multimodal inputs to KCαβ-p’s will be very interesting for future study, we elected here to focus subsequent analyses on the more numerous KCγ-d’s, as their receipt of strong, direct VPN inputs allows us to infer their visual tuning.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Direct visual inputs to the ventral accessory calyx derive from all optic lobe neuropils</title><p id="P12">We identified 49 VPNs that form connections of at least 5 synapses onto KCγ-d’s in the left hemisphere of the FlyWire dataset. 18 of these derive from the medulla (44% of synapses), 18 from the lobula (26.4% of synapses) and 13 from the accessory medulla (29.5% of synapses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Like olfactory projection neurons, all direct VPNs are predicted to be cholinergic, and therefore excitatory. None of the VPNs connecting to the vACA have assigned functions. In order to classify them further, we used both anatomy and connectivity to cluster these VPNs into putative cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). Among the 18 medulla VPNs, most are singlets: They do not cluster with any other MB-projecting visual neurons and appear only once in each hemisphere. The one exception is a cluster comprising three neurons (ME.PLP.36, ME.PLP.42 and ME.1557). Like medulla VPNs, most of the 18 lobula VPNs are singlets, though LO.SCL.7 and LO.SLP.12 form a cluster. In contrast, aMe VPNs providing input to the left vACA can be classified into just four cell types, aMe12, aMe20 or aMe26_L and aMe26_R. There are 4 aMe12s on each side of the brain, and KCγ-d’s contact all 8 individual neurons (7 with more than 5 synapses, 1 with fewer). KCγ-d’s contact 5/6 aMe26 neurons in the brain. There is only one aMe20 in each hemisphere. Therefore, KCγ-d’s contact most individual members of these cell types. aMe12 neurons receive direct input from photoreceptor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and thus their inputs to Kenyon cells are of the same circuit depth as olfactory projection neurons inputs, i.e. two synapses from the periphery. Most other paths to KCγ-d’s appear to be three or more synapses from the periphery.</p><p id="P13">Generally, there is a clear absence of retinotopic columnar cell types among VPNs contacting the vACA. They are all large field neurons and many of them have dendrites restricted to the ventral part of the medulla. All medulla and lobula neurons are ipsilaterally connected. aMe12 and aMe26_R are the only direct VPNs connected both ipsi- and contralaterally. The top types of VPNs from each neuropil dominate synaptic input to KCγ-d’s overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). As we will describe further below, these types dominate mushroom body inputs more prominently than do top olfactory types. We ranked VPN types by the sum of synapses they make onto KCγ-d’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Neurons from all three visual neuropils are among the top 5 input types, suggesting that signals from each neuropil are likely to have a strong influence on KCγ-d activity. The strongest connected neurons also are the ones that contact the most Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As can be seen in the neuronal skeletons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, every VPN innervating the mushroom body calyx also projects to other regions of the brain. Their processes in the central brain make a large number of connections with other nearby regions such as the PLP or SLP, indicating that the signals they carry are used not only in the mushroom body in the context of learning and memory but also in other brain areas for other purposes. Similarly, uniglomerular olfactory projections that provide input to the mushroom body extend a second axonal branch to the lateral horn where they regulate innate behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LVIN inputs to the ventral accessory calyx provide structured visual inputs</title><p id="P15">In addition to direct VPNs, KCγ-d’s also receive visual inputs indirectly through LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, C</xref>). These are central brain interneurons with no arborizations in the optic lobe but that themselves receive inputs from VPNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We have identified 25 LVINs in the left hemisphere of the FlyWire reconstruction that make 5 or more synapses with KCγ-d’s, corresponding to 21 cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The highest connected LVIN, PLP095 (PLP.78 in Flywire), makes 438 synapses with a total of 24 KCγ-d’s, while the median LVIN makes 11 synapses across 2 KCγ-d’s. 19 of the LVINs are predicted to be cholinergic (i.e. excitatory) while 5 are predicted to be GABA/glutamatergic (inhibitory) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These neurons also receive diverse inputs from other central brain neurons, including multiglomerular PNs, making these potential nodes of multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Each LVIN gets inputs from multiple VPNs and the same VPN can make connections with multiple LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). We have identified 226 “indirect” VPN inputs that make 5 or more synapses with KCγ-d-connected LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, F</xref>). A striking finding is that among them, we find repeated 36 out of the 49 direct VPNs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In particular, all three direct aMe types connect with KCγ-d’s both directly and indirectly through LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Additional aMe neurons (aMe3, aMe5, aMe19a and aMe25) are included in the indirect pathway. A small number of lobula plate neurons and ocellar neurons also provide inputs to LVINs. Despite not being represented in the direct VPN class, several types of small-field neurons whose dendrites tile the extent of the medulla/lobula, such as lobula columnar neurons (LCs) or medulla columnar neurons (MCs), provide inputs to LVINs contacting KCγ-d’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, Figure3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1A</xref>). When only inspecting neurons that make ≥5 synapses, we noticed that not all members of an LC or MC cell type are connected to an LVIN, giving rise to a seemingly random salt and pepper organization of receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1B, C</xref>). However when removing the synapse threshold, 49 out of 52 LC15, for instance, are connected to KCγ-d-projecting LVINs, encompassing the extent of the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1B, D</xref>). This is also true of LC24 where 53/62 neurons are connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1C, D</xref>). In the case of MC62, although removing the threshold does include additional neurons, they are all restricted to the ventral half of the medulla, leaving out the MC62s that occupy the dorsal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1E-G</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The connectivity matrix of VPN inputs onto vACA-projecting LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) highlights interesting properties. The connectivity appears highly structured; certain VPN cell types make connections with few and particular LVINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, F</xref>). For instance, each individual neuron in the lobula columnar LC15 subtype only connects to either or both PVLP.SCL.2 (PLP009 in hemibrain) and PVLP.SLP.13 (SLP306 in hemibrain), and each of these two LVINs primarily receive inputs from this cell type and not from other VPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, F</xref>). A similar situation exists in the case of MC62s: 97% of individual neurons of this type connect strongly to the LVIN PLP251, and 7% also connect to either PLP231 or PLP120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, F</xref>). In contrast to the LVINs downstream of LC15 that mostly receive input from LC15, the LVIN PLP251 also receives inputs from 19 other VPN types. In order to test for structure in these connectivity patterns in a more systematic way, we performed principal components analysis on the VPN-LVIN connectivity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We found that some principal components accounted for additional structure when compared to shuffled matrices preserving VPN connection probabilities and the number of inputs to each LVIN, demonstrating that these connections are inconsistent with a random model. The structured connectivity between VPNs and LVINs makes important predictions in terms of the degree of translational invariance that such a system might afford (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Receptive fields of neurons providing inputs to KCγ-d’s</title><p id="P18">Some of the most distinctive features of visual neurons are the extent and location of their processes in the optic lobe neuropil they innervate. These are related to their receptive field size and position in the field of view of the animal. We used a newly developed ‘eye-map’, that allows the prediction of the receptive field of optic lobe neurons given the extent and location of their processes to extract receptive field size and position, to quantify these properties and relate them to their connectivity with KCγ-d’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We first applied this methodology to direct and indirect VPNs from each neuropil to describe their individual receptive field properties and then extended our analysis to predict the visual receptive fields of individual KCγ-d’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, Figure 4</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We found that for direct VPNs, especially in the case of medulla VPNs but also to a certain extent for aMe and lobula VPNs, the neurons that have the largest receptive fields are the ones that are the most strongly connected with KCγ-d’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C, Figure 4</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>). This property holds to a lesser extent for indirect VPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, right). We next computed the location of the centroid of the receptive field of each VPN and plotted them on the eye map, as viewed by the left eye of the animal, weighted by the number of connections made by each VPN onto Kenyon cells (for direct VPNs) or by each VPN onto LVINs (for indirect VPNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, left; weight is indicated by size of the dot). We found that highly connected direct medulla VPNs preferentially represent the ventral part of the field of view of the fly, whereas highly connected direct lobula VPNs represent the dorsal part. Indirect lobula and medulla VPNs do not show this dorso-ventral distinction. Indirect aMe VPNs, however, preferentially represent the dorsal half of the field of view. We also noticed a slight rostral shift of lobula VPN centroids as compared to medulla VPNs, though this may reflect a technical limitation of the prediction tool. These properties are also apparent when overlaying the receptive fields of direct and indirect VPNs, separated between the three neuropils and weighted by the number of connections made by each VPN onto Kenyon cells or LVINs (shading) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next we used these data to derive the putative receptive field of single KCγ-d’s by linearly combining incident VPN and LVIN receptive fields and weighting by synaptic count. We show representative examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>. Overall, each KCγ-d samples most of the field of view of the animal and receives information from different parts of the visual field from different neuropils. The small size of the indirect VPN receptive fields is clearly apparent in some of these examples. The indirect receptive field composite images are combinations of LVIN receptive fields. From this analysis we conclude that each KCγ-d receives non-stereotyped visual information, made up of combinations of VPNs, with direct VPNs encompassing larger parts of the field of view and indirect VPNs smaller parts of the field.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Individual KCγ-d’s select inputs randomly from a precise set of visual neurons with heterogeneous weights</title><p id="P21">We next extended our analysis of the sets of inputs onto individual KCγ-d’s to the whole population. We generated a matrix of connections onto each individual Kenyon cell in order to assess whether KCγ-d’s receive labeled line, mixed, or randomized inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Individual KCγ-d’s received 1-7 visual inputs each, with a median of 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Five identified KCγ-d’s did not receive any inputs from VPNs or LVINs, and instead received input from olfactory PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This median of 3 visual inputs per KCγ-d is slightly lower than the median 5-6 inputs received by olfactory Kenyon cells in general, and less than the 4-8 inputs that their closest developmental sisters, olfactory KCγ-main, receive in this brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We next analyzed the origin of inputs onto each cell (medulla, lobula, accessory medula or LVIN). Strikingly, all distributions of inputs were possible, from KCγ-d’s receiving pure input from one neuropil to every mixture in between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Next, we asked whether specific inputs converged onto specific KCγ-d’s by clustering KCγ-d’s according to the inputs they received (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1C</xref>). We did not see evidence of sorting or convergence in this data: KCγ-d’s did not fall into obvious groups and knowing one input to a particular KCγ-d was not informative about other inputs. Hierarchical clustering performed on the matrix of connections onto KCγ-d’s did not reveal any apparent structure, similar to the same procedure applied to KCγ-m’s which receive distributed, combinatorial input from uniglomerular olfactory projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1B-D</xref>). This contrasts with hierarchical clustering of inputs to individual olfactory projection neurons, which each receive convergent and deterministic input from dedicated olfactory sensory neurons in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">A variety of methods have demonstrated the inputs to olfactory Kenyon cells in the adult are largely consistent with random sampling of locally available olfactory projection neuron boutons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. To further test for structure in the visual inputs to KCγ-d’s, we examined the spectrum of the principal component eigenvalues of the Kenyon cell input covariance matrix, as has been done previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-G</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Comparing this spectrum to randomly shuffled controls provides a sensitive measure of whether particular patterns of input are overrepresented across the Kenyon cell population. We found no difference between the spectrum obtained from the EM reconstruction and shuffled spectra, consistent with random sampling of visual inputs. However, we find that the inputs to visual KCγ-d’s are more skewed toward the top few input types than are olfactory inputs to Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1E</xref>). To quantify this observation, we computed the predicted dimension of the visual input currents received by KCγ-d’s, as quantified by the participation ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and compared it to that of the olfactory inputs to KCγ-m’s. The participation ratio was lower in the case of visual connectivity compared to olfactory connectivity (visual: PR=9.1, olfactory: PR=15.4) despite the greater number of visual input channels, suggesting that visual inputs are dominated by a small number of input dimensions.</p><p id="P24">Nearly all uniglomerular olfactory projection neurons target the olfactory calyx with a probability of forming connections onto Kenyon cells that depends on glomerular and Kenyon cell types consistently across individuals within a species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. VPNs and LVINs are far more developmentally diverse than are olfactory projection neurons, and the neurons we identify projecting to the left vACA in FlyWire are only a tiny fraction of all VPNs (49 out of 3933 total left VPNs, ~1.2%). To ask if the same VPN and LVIN sets target the vACA between hemispheres, i.e. if this aspect of development is predictable, we generated a map of visual inputs to KCγ-d in the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The top inputs to left and right hemispheres were the same, and neurons identified as KCγ-d inputs on only one hemisphere were of low rank in the hemisphere where they did connect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Nevertheless, for 30/154 cell types that provided at least five synapses to the vACA in one hemisphere, we found that the paired cell type in the other hemisphere provided no calyx input even with the synapse threshold removed. These cells may be a source of inter-hemisphere or inter-individual variation in learnable visual signals.</p><p id="P25">To examine whether there is stereotypy in the specific combinations of these inputs that KCγ-d’s in the left and right hemispheres sample, we asked whether there is an overrepresentation of left-right KCγ-d pairs that receive input from homologous visual inputs, as was previously done for olfactory inputs to larval KCγ-d’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Of 147 KCγ-d cells in the left hemisphere, only 15 found a cell on the right hemisphere that received an identical set of visual inputs, no more than expected from shuffled connectivity matrices in which Kenyon cells in each hemisphere sample their inputs independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The principal component eigenvalues for the combined left-right input connectivity matrix also were not significantly different from those of shuffled models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Finally, to examine inter-individual variability, we repeated these analyses for homologous neurons identified in the hemibrain dataset. We used NBLAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> to query the morphology of each VPN and LVIN in our dataset against all neurons in the hemibrain volume (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> and results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). Briefly, NBLAST is an algorithm that measures the similarity of two neuron structures, assigning them a similarity score between 0 and 1 (0=different neurons, 1=identical). We found confident matches in the hemibrain for 66% of VPN/LVINs in our dataset. These represent pairs of neurons with NBLAST scores greater than 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that the number of synapses formed by VPNs and LVINs onto KCγ-d’s are highly correlated across the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). As expected, principal components analysis found no evidence for stereotypy in these connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). In conclusion, our analyses suggest that the connectivity between LVINs/VPNs and KCγ-d’s is consistent with random sampling, but strongly biased toward specific input cell types which account for large proportions of visual information flow to these Kenyon cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S9"><title>Striking heterogeneity in the visual inputs to the mushroom body</title><p id="P27">The insect mushroom body has long been studied for its role in chemosensory perception and associative odor learning, and as such the underlying circuits are well-described anatomically and functionally. Here we add to the rich knowledge of mushroom body olfactory coding by providing the first complete anatomic description of an alternate sensory pathway to the adult mushroom bodies. Using the FlyWire electron microscopy reconstruction of the entire female adult fly brain, we have described all direct and indirect visual inputs (mono- and disynaptic connections) from the optic lobes to the ventral accessory calyx. By comparing the architectures of the olfactory and visual mushroom body circuits we highlight potential areas of functional similarity and difference.</p><p id="P28">Indeed, there are similarities between the olfactory and visual mushroom body circuits, including the distributed and random sampling of sensory inputs by Kenyon cells. Dissimilarities are most obvious at the level of cellular diversity and hint at possible functional differences in the way sensory modalities are used in the mushroom body during perception and learning. The olfactory projection neurons connected to the mushroom body receive inputs from the antennal lobe and are thus all positioned one synapse from the periphery. Olfactory projection neurons are born from dedicated stem cells and follow conserved tracts from the antennal lobe to the mushroom body calyx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. In contrast, the visual PNs that we have described here originate from multiple optic lobe neuropils. While the aMe12 neurons receive direct input from photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, medulla and lobula VPNs as well as LVINs are all at various depths of visual processing. Furthermore, single visual Kenyon cells can receive inputs from diverse mixtures of VPNs and LVINs; as a result, single visual Kenyon cells integrate visual information from various stages of visual processing. This anatomic arrangement differs from a model proposed in bees, that optic lobe sources would be sorted into different calyx regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">VPNs make up a majority of the direct inputs to KCγ-d’s; however, about a quarter of the synapses to KCγ-d’s (and the majority of synapses to KCαβ-p’s) are from LVINs that provide indirect visual input to the mushroom body. Many of the LVINs were first described by Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and here we identified the full repertoire of VPNs that are routed to the mushroom body via LVINs. LVINs integrate inputs from a large and diverse array of VPNs, especially when compared to VPNs that serve as direct inputs to Kenyon cells. For example, in the left hemisphere alone there are 49 VPNs that connect directly with KCγ-d’s and 190 additional VPNs whose signals are routed to KCγ-d’s via LVINs. Interestingly, 36/49 direct VPNs synapse with an LVIN, taking an indirect route to the mushroom body as well. The dual visual input from direct and indirect sources raises an interesting question about the functional role of each pathway type, and why most direct VPNs are also processed in parallel via the indirect pathway. Nevertheless, it is clear from an anatomic perspective that the LVINs are integrators of visual input, and in the future it will be interesting to further explore their functional role in visual processing.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>What are Kenyon cells “seeing” and what are they using it for?</title><p id="P30">The similarity between the top VPN inputs to left and right hemispheres in the FlyWire dataset, as well as their similarity with VPNs in hemibrain, suggests that specific visual information is selected to be conveyed to the MB. Unfortunately, the great majority of the VPNs in question have not been studied, making it difficult to assign functions. Their anatomical characteristics however provide some indications as to stimulus preference. Many of the direct VPNs that we describe here sample broadly across the visual field, supporting the notion that this circuit is adapted for processing general features of a visual scene (e.g. luminance or color) rather than for encoding precise spatiotemporal relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. An interesting example is that of large-field aMe neurons, which make up 29.5% of VPN synapses onto KCγ-d’s. While the role of aMe neurons has not been functionally determined, given their position as inputs to circadian neurons it is likely that they could provide context to the mushroom body with information related to the time of day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Despite the lack of overt spatial organization of the visual inputs in the mushroom body, there is precedent in other model systems for spatial encoding of stimuli in non-retinotopic circuits, which underscores the need for functional validation of these anatomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Experiments aimed at probing stimulus selectivity of VPNs and Kenyon cells will be necessary to clarify the stimulus space to which the mushroom body is tuned.</p><p id="P31">In contrast, LVIN inputs to KCγ-d’s process information from six kinds of lobular columnar (LC) neurons, amongst others. LCs are the main columnar output of the optic lobe, and are thought to each retinotopically encode different features of the visual scene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. For example, we have found that most members of the LC15 type, previously shown to respond specifically to long thin moving vertical bars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, make connections with 1-2 LVINs. This suggests that a subset of KCγ-d’s, receiving inputs from these particular LVINs, will respond to this particular stimulus, regardless of its location in the field of view of the animal. This convergent arrangement is ideal for providing translational invariance to stimuli in the mushroom body and therefore may contribute to visual learning about specific kinds of objects regardless of their spatial position.</p><p id="P32">KCγ-d’s could be neural substrates for either pure visual learning and/or provide context for olfactory learning. There is substantial evidence for the latter. For instance, when a visual stimulus is paired with an odor, flies memorize these multisensory cues at higher rates compared to when the visual or olfactory stimuli are presented alone, a phenomenon that relies on KCγ-d activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. This role in multisensory learning is further supported by anatomy. Indeed, in contrast to their separate inputs in the calyx, the axons of visual and olfactory Kenyon cells receive reinforcement from many common dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and synapse onto many common mushroom body output neurons (MBONs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Whereas most MBONs receive a large majority of olfactory inputs, reflecting the predominance of olfactory KCs, MBON19 and so-called “atypical” MBON27 and MBON33 receive a majority of their inputs from visual KCs, providing a potential substrate for a dedicated pathway for visual learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, so far, a role for the mushroom body in pure visual learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not clearly evident. In reinforcement paradigms where two color stimuli are presented and one is paired with either a reward or punishment, flies display a weak preference for either color in subsequent test trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. However, it is not clear whether the colors tested activate separate populations of VPNs and consequently different subsets of visual KCs. Few visual stimuli have been tested in pure visual learning, and since our analysis shows that very specific visual neural types make their way to the mushroom body calyx, it is possible that extending the type of visual stimuli tested in associative learning paradigms will reveal significant mushroom body dependent visual learning.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Kenyon cells sample randomly from precisely allocated presynaptic inputs</title><p id="P33">The ~2000 Kenyon cells in the main olfactory calyx connect randomly to the ~50 types of olfactory projection neuron inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. The distributed nature of these connections expands the possible number of odors that can be encoded by the mushroom body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As very different parameters compose a visual object vs. a smell (e.g. color, brightness, edges, line orientations, location, etc. versus molecular mixtures and concentrations), one may intuit that the encoding of a visual percept in the mushroom body would inherently require a different circuit configuration. Instead, we find from examining the visual mushroom body connectivity in multiple hemispheres that, like olfactory Kenyon cells, visual Kenyon cells randomly sample from incoming VPNs and LVINs. This is predictive of a scenario in which the combinatorial coding of visual signals is used to generate visual percepts, yet if and how this type of coding scheme could generate coherent representations of visual objects is still unclear.</p><p id="P34">While the manner in which Kenyon cells connect to VPNs is random, the subset of VPNs included in this circuit seems relatively deterministic. In FlyWire, there are 7,851 total neurons annotated as VPNs. We find that just 469 of these 7,851 are direct or indirect visual inputs to KCγ-d’s in left and right mushroom bodies. Among VPNs and LVINs connected directly to Kenyon cells, the top partners provide an outsized proportion of synaptic input, and the sharp differences in weights of these versus other inputs are consistent across hemispheres and brains. Much of this dominant input originates from accessory medulla neurons. The propensity for particular visual neurons to target the vACA, while others do not, suggests there are specific developmental instructions allowing these neurons to come into contact with KCγ-d’s; once they do, the Kenyon cells sample randomly among them, seemingly agnostic to further features of LVIN or VPN identity. The adult KCγ-d set that we analyze here are the very same neurons that receive randomized olfactory input in the early larva, as these neurons prune their dendrites during metamorphosis before forming new, visual connections that will be used in the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Though the random selection of inputs is a common feature of these cells across developmental time, their chosen partners switch from olfactory PNs for the larval circuit to this precise and diverse set of visual inputs for adulthood. What directs certain VPNs to synapse in the mushroom body and how Kenyon cells randomly select among these available partners will be interesting areas of future research.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Evolution of visual inputs to the mushroom body and visual learning</title><p id="P35">Across different insects, the size of the Kenyon cell repertoire and the balance of sensory modalities providing their input are highly divergent.

Therefore, the types of visual stimuli represented in the mushroom body, how visual percepts are encoded, and how these have been modified during evolution are unknown.</p><p id="P36">We show here that in flies, the mushroom body receives very specific channels of visual information: In the 80% of KCγ-d-inputs provided by VPNs, neurons representing full-field signals are prominent, while the 20% of inputs from LVINs include neurons representing small objects or specific kinds of motion. Among the insects with impressive visually-mediated behaviors there is a paucity of information about the exact neuron types and connectivities that link the optic lobes to the mushroom bodies, though elaboration of visual Kenyon cell number in bees is proposed to occur together with re-routing of small-field visual signals to the mushroom body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. However, the overrepresentation of large-field inputs versus small-field inputs to the visual mushroom body that we observe in flies could be conserved across insects, and simply be mapped onto 500 times more visual Kenyon cells in Hymenopterans.

If we removed the synapse threshold, we were able to find the match for 15 of these 45 neurons in the opposing hemisphere. Following the process described above, we obtained 124 neurons with direct inputs to KCγ-d’s across both hemispheres with putative matches in the opposite hemisphere. Since mirror twins were more ambiguous in the case of neurons within the same type class with very similar morphologies (e.g. aMe12), we condensed the matrix by cell type in some cases by averaging connectivity across direct VPNs and LVINs of the same morphological class.</p><p id="P49">To measure the extent of structure or randomness to the connectivity of direct VPNs and LVINs onto KCγ-d’s between hemispheres, we first counted the pairs of KCγ-d’s across hemispheres that received the same pattern of direct VPN and LVIN input (similar to analysis done in Eichler et al., 2017). Specifically, we counted how many KCγ-d’s in the left hemisphere had an identical pattern of input to a KCγ-d in the right hemisphere; the total number of possible matches was 147, the number of KCγ-d’s in the left hemisphere. Matches between hemispheres involving KCγ-d’s receiving 0 inputs from our subsets of left-right matched VPNs and LVINs were not counted. We then compared the number of such matches we observed in the FlyWire dataset to the number of matches observed after shuffling both the left and right connectivity matrices while preserving VPN and LVIN connection probabilities and the number of inputs to each KCγ-d (1000 shuffled models were used; see Models of random connectivity).</p><p id="P50">We then used PCA to recover structure in direct VPN and LVIN connectivity to KCγ-d’s after concatenating left and right connectivity matrices. We compared this structure to that obtained with random and stereotyped models of connectivity. For the random model, we shuffled connectivity across both hemispheres. In the stereotyped model, connectivity was shuffled in a randomly selected hemisphere and copied to the remaining hemisphere to generate identical but random connectivity in each hemisphere. In both models, shuffling was done preserving input connectivity distribution and the number of inputs sampled by each KCγ-d (see Models of random connectivity).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Estimating receptive fields of direct and indirect VPNs</title><p id="P51">Only visual projection neurons with optic lobe processes in the left hemisphere were considered for receptive field analyses. Columnar markers (759 in total) as identified in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> were used. Since most medulla VPNs considered in this study arborize between layers M6 and M8, we used M5 column markers that were previously identified through the reconstruction of Mi1 processes in layer M5. Lobular column markers were obtained by extension of the medulla column map to the lobula from interpolating the positions of 63 reconstructed TmY5a neurons, as described in Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Each columnar marker was mapped to an ommatidial viewing angle, directional vectors that were represented by points on a unit sphere (the “eyemap”).</p><p id="P52">To estimate the receptive field of each VPN, we used morphological information available in the Flywire dataset to compute dendritic proximity to ommatidial columns within a specific distance threshold. We then computed the convex hull that encompassed this subset of ommatidial columns. A suitable threshold was set separately for lobular and medullar neurons by annotating receptive field edges by hand (visually selecting ommatidial columns) for a subset of ground truth neurons and choosing the threshold that maximized overlap between hand-drawn receptive fields and estimated receptive fields.</p><p id="P53">For all figures depicting receptive fields, a 2D Mollweide projection was used to portray the viewing directions of the ommatidial columns comprising the VPN’s estimated receptive field.

We then used the transforms and brain templates available in navis-flybrains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup> to transform these FlyWire meshes to the hemibrain brain template (specifically the ‘JRC2018F’ template). As the FAFB brain was inverted during image acquisition, this transform aligned Flywire neurons from the left hemisphere with hemibrain neurons from the right hemisphere.</p><p id="P55">NBLAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> was used to query our subset of FlyWire neurons against all available neurons in the hemibrain dataset. The mean of the forward and reverse score was considered to obtain raw scores for each query-target pair. Each FlyWire neuron was paired with its highest scoring hemibrain match; in cases where two FlyWire neurons paired with the hemibrain neuron, the match with the stronger score was retained and the remaining neuron was paired with its next best NBLAST match. This process was repeated until a one-to-one mapping was obtained.</p><p id="P56">To probe if VPN/LVIN to KCγ-d connectivity was random between the two connectomes we used PCA to extract structure in an aggregated connectivity matrix containing direct VPN/LVIN to KCγ-d connectivity from one hemisphere of FlyWire and one hemisphere of hemibrain. Using a similar approach to the analysis comparing left and right hemisphere connectivity (see Comparing visual input organization to KCγ-d’s between left and right hemispheres), we compared the observed structure with a random model shuffling connectivity across both connectomes. In the stereotyped model, connectivity was shuffled in one of the connectomes and copied to the remaining hemisphere to generate identical but random connectivity in each hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Random models of VPN/LVIN-KC connectivity</title><p id="P57">To determine if there was any structure in connectivity that wasn’t accounted for by the non-uniform distribution of input connection probabilities or the non-uniform number of inputs to each output neuron, we used a shuffle procedure where the connection probabilities of inputs and the number of inputs to each postsynaptic output were fixed. PCA was used to extract correlations in connectivity matrices such as VPN connectivity to LVINs or direct VPN/LVIN connectivity to KCγ-d’s. The fractions of variance explained by the top components were compared with those obtained with a set of randomly generated connectivity matrices using this shuffle procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

The resulting connectivity matrix was then binarized so that every neuron-neuron contact with ≥5 synapses was set to 1 and any contact of 0-4 synapses was set to 0. The binarized matrix was plotted using the standard R heatmap() function, which also hierarchically clustered the rows and columns based on the similarity of their synaptic partners.
