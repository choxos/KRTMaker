This raises the question whether prion-specific pathologies arise also extraneurally. Here we sequenced mRNA transcripts in skeletal muscle, spleen and blood of prion-inoculated mice at eight timepoints during disease progression. We detected gene-expression changes in all three organs, with skeletal muscle showing the most consistent alterations. The glutamate-ammonia ligase (<italic>GLUL</italic>) gene exhibited uniform upregulation in skeletal muscles of mice infected with three distinct scrapie prion strains (RML, ME7, and 22L) and in victims of human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. <italic>GLUL</italic> dysregulation was accompanied by changes in glutamate/glutamine metabolism, leading to reduced glutamate levels in skeletal muscle. None of these changes were observed in skeletal muscle of humans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting that they are specific to prion diseases. These findings reveal an unexpected metabolic dimension of prion infections and point to a potential role for GLUL dysregulation in the glutamate/glutamine metabolism in prion-affected skeletal muscle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">Prions are infectious protein aggregates that cause neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Prions multiplicate through the seeded conversion of the physiological cellular prion protein PrP<sup>C</sup> into a misfolded, aggregated conformer termed PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). PrP<sup>C</sup> is expressed not only in the nervous system but also in the skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in lymphoreticular tissue and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Prions can be present in the blood, where they bind to plasminogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Blood is a documented route of infection and remains a challenge for transfusion medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Prions can enter the body through the gastrointestinal system and accumulate in lymphoid tissue, leading to neuroinvasion via peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In variant CJD (vCJD), PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is prominent in spleen, muscle, retina, blood vessels, skin, liver, kidney, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Skeletal muscles of patients with acquired and sporadic CJD show PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposits in peripheral nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Thus, while the most visible toxicity of prion diseases (PrDs) occurs in the brain, there is increasing evidence of peripheral manifestations which may be relevant to disease symptoms.</p><p id="P8">Growing evidence indicates that gene-expression changes in extraneural tissues, including blood, spleen, and skeletal muscle, can serve as markers of neurodegenerative disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). RNA sequencing of whole blood in Parkinson’s disease uncovered early immune cell changes and distinct gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). A recent study linked exaggerated type I myofiber grouping in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) to altered gene expression in muscle, suggesting significant neuromuscular junction involvement and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Analogously, differential expression of muscle-specific genes was found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, suggesting muscle-level changes alongside neural degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Lymphoid tissue also accumulates prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and may experience molecular changes with diagnostic and prognostic potential.</p><p id="P9">Here we have conducted transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing analyses on blood, skeletal muscle, and spleen of mice after intracerebral exposure to prions and in autoptic skeletal muscle of humans diagnosed with sporadic CJD. We found that glutamate-ammonia ligase (<italic>GLUL</italic>) is uniquely upregulated in skeletal muscle of prion-infected mice and humans, but not in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The pronounced increase of GLUL in prion-infected skeletal muscle, a distinctive feature not seen in ALS, AD, or DLB, underscores a unique aspect of prion diseases. This finding, in conjunction with observed reductions in glutamate levels in both animal models and human cases of prion infection, suggests a disruption in glutamate/glutamine metabolism in skeletal muscles as the disease progresses. This points to a prion-specific muscular pathophysiology diverging from other neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptional derangement in skeletal muscle during prion disease progression</title><p id="P10">For this study, we used a previously established cohort of wild-type 2-month old C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) which we had injected intracerebrally (i.c.) with scrapie prions (6<sup>th</sup> consecutive mouse-to-mouse passage of mouse-adapted Rocky Mountain Laboratory sheep scrapie prions, abbreviated as RML6). For control, we injected non-infectious brain homogenate (NBH). Spleen, hindlimb skeletal muscle and blood were collected during necropsy at 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 weeks-post-inoculation (wpi) as well as at the terminal stage of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We stratified our collective into three categories: early stage (4 and 8 wpi), pre-symptomatic stage (12, 14, 16 wpi) and symptomatic stage (18, 20, wpi and terminal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as transcripts with absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change |log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt; 0.5 and p-value &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Transcriptional changes in blood were inhomogeneous during disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), possibly because peripheral blood may undergo changes in its cellular composition during infection or inflammation. Nevertheless, in both early timepoints DEGs associated with blood coagulation and hemostasis were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1-2</xref>). During the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages we did not identify any overlapping changes in blood. In contrast, major transcriptional changes in the spleen were found in terminal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Except for <italic>Pcdh18</italic>, which was significantly altered in both early stage timepoints, there was no overlap between DEGs in blood and spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Compared to other analyzed organs, the number of DEGs in skeletal muscle remained relatively constant throughout the course of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, this consistent pattern was punctuated by recurrent up- or downregulation of specific genes at distinct disease stages. During the presymptomatic stage a single gene, <italic>Adh1</italic>, displayed upregulation, whereas the symptomatic stage featured elevated expression of <italic>Mir8114</italic>, <italic>Glul</italic>, and <italic>Pik3r1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). To allow for interactive exploration of the results described in this study and for integration with our previously reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), we constructed a searchable database of gene expression profiles from brain and extraneural organs available for visualization and download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fgcz-shiny.uzh.ch/priontranscriptomics/">https://fgcz-shiny.uzh.ch/priontranscriptomics/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Consistently altered gene modules in skeletal muscle during prion disease progression</title><p id="P13">WGCNA (Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis) identifies modules of highly correlated genes, which helps detecting coordinated changes in gene expression. We utilized WGCNA in conjunction with differential expression (DE) analysis to deduce organ-specific gene co-expression networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). To summarize the gene-expression levels of individual network modules, we calculated module eigengenes (MEs) representing the first principal component of each module. We identified 25 and 13 modules in blood and spleen, respectively, but we did not find any significant differences between the MEs of these modules in the two study groups across all three disease time stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Conversely, in the muscle co-expression network, two of 39 modules (“orange” and “darkgreen”) showed significant differences in MEs between NBH controls and prions throughout disease progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). The “orange” module (163 genes) was upregulated, while the “darkgreen” module (198 genes) was downregulated as the disease advanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To better understand these pathophysiological events, we identified genes exhibiting the most notable and consistent expression changes throughout the disease progression within each module of interest. Hub genes were defined by module membership (MM) which is a measure of the correlation between the expression pattern of a given gene and the overall expression pattern of all the genes within the module. Additionally, we derived a gene significance score from p-values obtained using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)—a tool for identifying expression changes in RNA-seq data—across time stages. Strikingly, the gene significance score was found to be highly correlated (orange module R = 0.81; and darkgreen module R = 0.7) with module membership (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The convergence of two different methods on the same set of genes provides evidence for the robustness of hub gene detection. The top 20 hub genes for orange and darkgreen module are labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Validation cohort confirms robustness of hub genes for muscle co-expression network in prion-infected mice</title><p id="P15">To test the reliability and validity of our findings, we investigated a validation cohort comprising samples from each time stage. We first asked whether the muscle co-expression network modules in the main cohort were preserved in the validation cohort. All modules (except for the “plum”, “orangered3”, and “brown” modules) showed high preservation with a z-summary statistic &gt;1.96 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). We then calculated the ME for each sample in the validation cohort using the same gene module assignment as in the main cohort. Again, the “orange” and “darkgreen” modules were the most affected, exhibiting significant ME differences between RML6 and NBH at both presymptomatic and symptomatic stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, the trend of ME changes was already evident in the early stage and consistent with the trend observed in the main cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To further validate our results, we identified hub genes for the validation cohort using MM values that correlated with those of the main cohort (orange module R = 0.55; darkgreen module R = 0.5). The overlapping hub genes between the two cohorts are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>. The high correlation indicates that the hub genes identified in the main cohort were robust and reliable in the validation cohort as well. These findings reinforce the idea that the identified hub genes are biologically significant, offering insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Upregulation of glutamate-ammonia ligase in skeletal muscles of prion-diseased humans and mice</title><p id="P17">To test whether our findings apply to human prion diseases, we performed RNA sequencing on skeletal muscles of sCJD patients (n = 6). For control, we used skeletal muscles of subjects without clinical or pathological diagnosis of neurodegeneration matched for age, gender, and specimen age (n = 4) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref> for clinical details). The total RNA extracted from the Psoas major muscle exhibited significant degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). However, principal component analysis highlighted grouping of sCJD and control tissues in two distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Based on |log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt; 0.5 and FDR &lt; 0.05 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for details), we identified a total of 365 DEGs, of which 258 were protein-coding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then compared the DEGs from sCJD samples with hub genes from the two mouse cohorts, and found only one overlapping gene, glutamate ammonia-ligase (<italic>GLUL</italic>)<italic>,</italic> which was significantly upregulated in human and mouse samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). We further validated the upregulation of GLUL at the protein level using Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P19">While examining post-mortem muscle samples from human patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (sCJD), we found numerous changes in gene expression that differed from those observed in mouse models. These differences might have only become apparent during the late stages of the disease, where nonspecific changes, possibly influenced by factors like prolonged immobilization, are more likely to occur. However, our analysis of mouse models provides strong evidence that GLUL correlates with the disease process at earlier stages.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>GLUL is upregulated in mice infected with a variety of prion strains</title><p id="P20">Prion strains are infectious isolates exhibiting distinct biological properties, such as tissue tropism, incubation time, and neuropathological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Different prion strains may elicit different transcriptional responses in their hosts. To determine whether <italic>Glul</italic> alterations are a common feature across prion strains, we tested whether <italic>Glul</italic> is changed in mice infected with a panel of mouse-adapted prion strains. To this end, we intracerebrally injected an additional cohort of C57BL/6 mice with ME7, 22L, RML6, and NBH, and collected hindlimb skeletal muscle at different time points (8 wpi, 16 wpi and terminal) corresponding to each of the three aforementioned disease stages.</p><p id="P21">At 8 wpi, <italic>Glul</italic> RNA and protein levels were not altered in both ME7 and 22L strains. At the protein level, the most substantial upregulation was found in RML6-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A-C</xref>). The delayed <italic>Glul</italic> upregulation in mice inoculated with the ME7 and 22L strains may be related to differences in disease onset, as RML6 induced disease more quickly than ME7 and 22L. <italic>Glul</italic> expression was significantly altered at both the RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) and protein level in RML6 and ME7 strains, while only at RNA level in 22L strain at 16 wpi. In terminally sick mice, both RNA and protein level of Glul were upregulated in all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A-C</xref>). These results suggest that Glul upregulation is a universal feature across various prion diseases, highlighting its potential role in the underlying pathophysiological processes of these conditions. Such a consistent pattern of dysregulation suggests that glutamate ammonia ligase may influence disease progression and clinical manifestations in prion-affected individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>GLUL upregulation is specific to prion diseases</title><p id="P22">To further investigate the disease specificity of <italic>Glul</italic> dysregulation, we examined its protein levels in hindlimb skeletal muscles of mouse models for ALS, AD, and DLB. Interestingly, Glul did not exhibit upregulation in these models. The confinement of Glul upregulation to prion diseases points to specific pathogenetic mechanisms that do not occur in other types of neurodegenerations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5C, D</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we extended our investigation to skeletal muscle necropsies from patients with familial ALS, FTD (Frontotemporal Dementia), AD, and DLB. Again, GLUL protein levels were unaltered in AD, DLB and FTD, highlighting its distinct role in prion diseases compared to other neurodegenerative conditions. Notably, GLUL protein levels were significantly downregulated in all three individuals affected by ALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Glutamate-glutamine biosynthesis in muscle is affected during prion disease progression</title><p id="P23">Glul catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to glutamine, whereas glutaminase carries out the opposite process. Given the increased <italic>Glul</italic> expression in skeletal muscle during prion disease progression, we investigated whether this metabolic pathway was affected. We measured glutaminase, glutamate and glutamine levels in muscle lysates from C57BL/6 mice inoculated with ME7, 22L and RML6 brain homogenates, as well as NBH for control. At the early disease stage, there were no significant alterations in the levels of glutamate and glutamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6A, E</xref>), even in RML6-infected animals, despite the increased expression levels of Glul. This might be attributable to a compensatory effect of glutaminase upregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5A-B</xref>) which may maintain glutamate homeostasis and offset the increased expression of Glul. Notably, we observed an increase in the expression of Glul at 16 wpi (two weeks prior to the onset of clinical signs of prion disease). Despite the Glul upregulation, the balance of glutamate and glutamine was maintained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6A; E</xref>), as well as glutaminase levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5A, B</xref>), pointing to a metabolic ability restoring the levels of glutamate consumed by Glul upregulation. At the terminal stage of the disease, the levels of glutamate were conspicuously reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>), plausibly due to a significant upregulation of Glul. However, the levels of glutamine and glutaminase were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6E; Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Glutamate reduction was also detected in muscle necropsies of sCJD patients versus age- and sex-matched controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>) despite unchanged glutamine levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6F</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We then examined the levels of glutaminase, glutamate, and glutamine in skeletal muscles of aged mouse models for AD, DLB, and ALS. Unlike in prion diseases, we found no significant alterations in glutaminase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5C, E</xref>), glutamate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6C</xref>), and glutamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6G</xref>) levels in these neurodegenerative disorders. This highlights the specificity of the observed metabolic changes in prion diseases. We then evaluated glutamate and glutamine levels in skeletal muscles of human AD, DLB, ALS and FTD cases. Our results revealed a reduction in glutamate levels solely in the context of ALS, mirroring the observed trend in prion diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6, D and H</xref>). However, it is important to note that while GLUL expression was downregulated in ALS, it was upregulated in prion diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Transcriptional changes observed in the early phases of prion disease offer valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanisms at play in extraneural organs. These alterations in gene expression not only enhance our understanding of the disease’s progression but also underscore the systemic nature of prion diseases (PrDs), revealing critical aspects of their pathology beyond the central nervous system. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of extraneural organs known to harbor prions. We hypothesized that the presence of prions in these organs could result in changes to RNA processing, or modifications to the abundance of specific transcripts. By examining multiple timestages throughout the progression of the disease in prion-inoculated mice, this investigation provides insights into the pathological processes preceding the onset of clinical symptoms. The selection of timestages was based on a recent study where authors defined disease stages based on clinically relevant EEG (electroencephalography): recordings between NBH and RML mice groups began to diverge at 10 wpi and became significantly different at 18 wpi marking the beginning of clinical onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Other authors defined symptomatic stage as the period from 18 wpi to terminal stage based on motor function impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Significant changes in gene expression were observed in all three organs. In the spleen, major transcriptional alterations were detected only at the terminal stage of the disease, which suggests a slower accumulation rate of prions in lymphatic tissue following intracerebral inoculation compared to ingestion or intraperitoneal inoculation. Conversely, blood samples displayed upregulation of numerous transcripts during the early stages of prion exposure, of which a significant fraction was related to hemostasis.</p><p id="P27">Gene-expression changes were detected in both blood and spleen but were not consistent across all timepoints. However, the transcriptome of skeletal muscle showed consistent alterations throughout the disease progression. Using WGCNA, we identified two primary gene subsets in skeletal muscle exhibiting progressive changes that became evident in the early stage of disease. Validation of these findings in an independent cohort of mice, in which sequencing libraries were prepared several months after RNA extraction from snap-frozen skeletal muscles by a different researcher, enhances the robustness of the results. This validation underscores the consistency of the findings even in the face of significant technical variability introduced by the procedures. These results have potential applications in monitoring disease progression following therapeutics administration, in conjunction with molecular and behavioral assessments for evaluating treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We evaluated the relevance of our findings in humans by conducting RNA sequencing on skeletal muscle samples obtained from individuals with sCJD and control individuals without neurological impairments. While we were unable to confidently evaluate the level of preservation of mouse and human muscle gene-expression networks, we found little overlap between the joint set of hub genes identified across two mouse cohorts and human DEGs. There may be various reasons for this discrepancy, including genetic differences between mice and humans resulting in varying biological responses to similar diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Additionally, different conditions were employed to process the human samples and decontaminate them from prions, which may have influenced the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Variations in disease stage or severity, as well as differences in the tissue types analyzed (hindlimb muscle in animals vs. psoas muscle in humans), could have also played a role in the observed differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Finally, there may be underlying differences in the disease biology between humans and mice that are not yet fully understood or characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Despite the abovementioned limitations in translating mouse findings to human ones, we found that <italic>GLUL</italic>, which was a strong hub gene in the upregulated “orange” module in the mouse study, was significantly upregulated in human sCJD samples, as confirmed at the protein level by Western Blot analysis. Hence, the consistent upregulation of GLUL may be indicative of its significant role in the pathophysiology of human prion diseases, potentially contributing to the progression of the disease, especially in its early stages. GLUL is a glutamate-ammonia ligase that catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia in an ATP-dependent reaction.</p><p id="P29">There is some evidence that <italic>GLUL</italic> expression in the brain is not altered in PrDs. <italic>Glul</italic> mRNA levels were unchanged in the brains of mice infected with prions compared to uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Another recent study found that <italic>GLUL</italic> expression was also unchanged in the brains of patients with sCJD compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Therefore, the alterations in glutamate/glutamine metabolism in prion-infected brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) that were proposed to contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions, are unlikely to stem from any changes in brain-resident GLUL. Instead, <italic>Glul</italic> expression was consistently upregulated in the skeletal muscles of animals throughout the disease, and this finding was present after infection with multiple prion strains. This suggests that <italic>GLUL</italic> may also be upregulated before the clinical onset of human PrDs. The identification of a common pathological phenotype among these diseases would be a significant finding, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms specific to these conditions at early stages. It is important to note that this phenomenon appears to be unique to these diseases and does not occur in other common neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS, AD, or DLB; interestingly, GLUL protein levels were consistently found to be downregulated in human ALS. This distinct pattern underscores the unique role of GLUL in the pathophysiology of prion diseases, differentiating them from other neurodegenerative conditions in terms of their molecular and cellular mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">We hypothesized that the upregulation of GLUL protein in skeletal muscle may be linked to a metabolic dysfunction in the glutamate-glutamine pathway. Prior research had shown the direct influence of glutamine levels on the expression of <italic>GLUL</italic> in skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Building upon this finding, it is plausible to speculate that a potential systemic deficit in glutamine levels might contribute to the observed upregulation of <italic>GLUL</italic> in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle exerts a pivotal role in glutamine storage, production, and release into the bloodstream. This hypothesis gains further support from the significant reduction in glutamate levels observed, which could be attributed to the heightened activity of GLUL in response to altered glutamine availability. This was unexpected as previous studies had reported increased levels of glutamate and glutamine in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The regulation of glutamate and glutamine metabolism in skeletal muscle differs from that in the brain, and the upregulation of <italic>GLUL</italic> in skeletal muscle may have a distinct role in the pathology of prion disease. In contrast, the absence of such <italic>GLUL</italic> upregulation in other NDDs might signify a distinct metabolic response. The lack of compensatory <italic>GLUL</italic> expression could contribute to the sustained alterations in glutamine and glutamate levels seen in those conditions. Therefore, the specific association between <italic>GLUL</italic> upregulation and prion diseases suggests a unique interplay between glutamine/glutamate metabolism and disease progression, setting prion diseases apart from other NDDs. Finally, extraneural GLUL measurements may represent an accessible biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of experimental antiprion therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Animals</title><p id="P31">Prion-inoculated and control-injected mice were regularly monitored for the development of clinical signs, according to well-established procedures using humane termination criteria.

Although prions are well-known for their relative resistance to PK digestion, prion infectivity largely depends on PK-sensitive oligomers. Indeed, prolonged PK digestion reduces prion titers by a factor of &gt;10<sup>6</sup>, but residual PK-resistant material may still be infectious. In a second step, TRIzol reagent solution was added to the lysate (it contains Gdn-SCN and phenol, which inactivate RNases and disaggregate prions) and kept overnight at 4°C. Gdn-SCN is a chaotropic salt which rapidly denatures proteins and abolishes the infectivity of prion disease inoculum. At high concentrations, guanidine salts disaggregate PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> fibrils, eliminate PK resistance and abolish PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion, meaning that any PK-resistant material that survived the digestion step would be expected to be inactivated at this stage of the protocol. 0.2 ml of ultrapure phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was added to the samples, followed by strong shaking and incubation at room temperature for 5 mins. Centrifugation step at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C generated two phases.
