Spike protein subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 induce VAERD in hamsters, where aluminum adjuvants promote a Th2-biased immune response, leading to increased type 2 pulmonary inflammation in animals with breakthrough infections. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential risks and the underlying mechanisms of VAERD, we immunized ACE2-humanized mice with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein adjuvanted with aluminum and CpG-ODN. Subsequently, we exposed them to increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2 to establish a breakthrough infection. The vaccine elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses, reduced viral titers, and enhanced host survival. However, following a breakthrough infection, vaccinated animals exhibited severe pulmonary immunopathology, characterized by a significant perivascular infiltration of eosinophils and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, along with increased expression of Th2/Th17 cytokines. Intracellular flow cytometric analysis revealed a systemic Th17 inflammatory response, particularly pronounced in the lungs. Our data demonstrate that aluminum/CpG adjuvants induce strong antibody and Th1-associated immunity against COVID-19 but also prime a robust Th2/Th17 inflammatory response, which may contribute to the rapid onset of T cell-mediated pulmonary immunopathology following a breakthrough infection. These findings underscore the necessity for further research to unravel the complexities of VAERD in COVID-19 and to enhance vaccine formulations for broad protection and maximum safety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Spike Protein Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Breakthrough Infection</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary Immunopathology</kwd><kwd>Eosinophil</kwd><kwd>Th2</kwd><kwd>Th17</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES</kwd><kwd>Immunology and Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has stimulated global efforts of vaccine development and administration. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has been used as a primary vaccine antigen, given its dominant role in mediating SARS-associated coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Spike-based vaccines are safe and effective in reducing severe COVID-19 (see Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>)). However, protective immunity elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccines may wane rapidly, leading to a rapid decrease in protective effectiveness within six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In addition, due to the active evolution of SARS-CoV-2, new variants of concern can gain the ability to evade prior immunity, notably neutralizing antibodies, via selection against the immune epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Under such circumstances, breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals could occur fairly soon after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), independent of demographic factors or comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases (VAERD) can occur in vaccinated individuals during breakthrough infections. It is well documented in humans that formalin-inactivated Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccines could cause lung eosinophilia, leading to enhanced respiratory diseases in infants and young children during breakthrough RSV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). While VAERD has not been reported in humans following COVID-19 breakthrough infections, in animal models, SARS-associated coronavirus vaccines have been shown to enhance type 2 immunopathology (IL-4/5/13 and eosinophils) in the lung following breakthrough infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This has been reported in multiple animal species including mice, hamsters, ferrets and non-human primates, and even more concerning, with multiple vaccine types including inactivated vaccine, virus-like particle vaccine containing multiple virus proteins, Spike-expressing viral vector vaccine, and Spike protein subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Although adjuvants are not required for the development of SARS-associated coronavirus VAERD in animals, aluminum-based (Alum) adjuvants can aggravate the observed vaccine-associated Th2-biased pulmonary immunopathology for Spike protein subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Alum-based adjuvants predominantly skew towards Th2 effector cell differentiation and a strong humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>); they are also the most widely used adjuvants in human vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), a soluble Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand, can increase both cellular and humoral immunity, particularly with strong Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In aged BALB/c mice, the combination of Alum and CpG has been used in COVID-19 subunit vaccines containing Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) as antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Compared to Alum or CpG alone, the combination of both adjuvants enhanced host protection against a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). It is however unclear whether this combined adjuvant strategy is safe and effective in humans.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we investigated safety and efficacy of a Spike protein subunit vaccine adjuvanted with Alum and CpG in an ACE2-humanized mouse model, along with the human isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). As expected, vaccination with Spike protein in combination with Alum + CpG adjuvant induced robust neutralizing antibody production, Th1 effector cells, and Spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, in the face of breakthrough infections, despite a significant reduction of mortality and lung viral load, vaccinated mice suffered substantial pulmonary immunopathology. As previously reported, the observed lung pathology is associated with eosinophilia and enhanced Th2 effector immunity. To our surprise, we also observed a substantial systemic Th17 response, most prominently in the lung. Our results reveal the predominant Th17-associated inflammatory response in ACE2-humanized mice, following COVID-19 vaccination and breakthrough infection. This model may be used to investigate COVID-19 vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Protective effects of Spike vaccination in breakthrough infection in ACE2-humanized mice</title><p id="P5">To further investigate the protective and immunopathogenic effects of vaccine-induced host immunity in COVID-19 vaccination in a humanized animal model, we immunized K18-hACE2 mice intramuscularly with a prime-boost regimen with 5 μg per dose of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mixed with Alum and CpG adjuvants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Following vaccination, to simulate breakthrough infection we infected animals with increasing dosages of virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). ELISA and neutralization assays on post-vaccination but pre-exposure sera verified that our SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein vaccination induced high levels of Spike-specific IgG (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) and high titers of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Spike-protein vaccination provided protection by preventing severe morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Notably, while the vaccination protected against the infection by reducing the overall viral loads in the lungs, the two-dose virus exposure allowed the establishment of a breakthrough infection in the vaccinated animals (~10<sup>12</sup> versus ~10<sup>8</sup> genome copies/gram lung tissue, comparing un-vaccinated versus vaccinated animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Type 2 pulmonary immunopathology following Spike vaccination and breakthrough infection</title><p id="P6">Despite a significantly improved survival rate, vaccinated animals appeared distressed assuming a hunched posture, exhibiting reluctance to move and lethargy. Histological staining of the lung sections revealed that the breakthrough infections caused a significant level of interstitial pneumonia comparable to that observed in the un-vaccinated and infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E &amp; F</xref>). Moreover, breakthrough infections in vaccinated animals resulted in elevated levels of perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, as compared to the lungs of the un-vaccinated and infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E &amp; F</xref>). The observed severe immunopathology in vaccinated mice following breakthrough infections was associated with significant increase in the abundance of goblet cells and increased counts of perivascular eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E &amp; F</xref>). Flow cytometric analyses of cells recovered from the lungs further revealed significant accumulation of eosinophils and IgE-bound basophils/mast cells in the vaccinated mice with breakthrough infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A &amp; B</xref>). We also noticed that, prior to infection, vaccination with Spike protein in Alum and CpG adjuvants was sufficient in inducing high levels of IgE production detected in the sera collected 7 days post the vaccine boost (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Also, we detected a trend of higher levels of Spikespecific IgE production in the vaccinated mice (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). On the other hand, the increased numbers of interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells in the lungs following SARS-CoV-2 infection were not affected by vaccination, while the infection-driven neutrophil enrichment in the lung was significantly reduced by vaccination, though not to levels comparable to those observed in un-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), our results show that immunization with Spike protein followed by a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a type 2-associate inflammatory response, prominently eosinophilia in the lung, which leads to vaccine-associated respiratory pathology in animal models of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Massive lung infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following Spike protein vaccination and breakthrough infection</title><p id="P7">We investigated the effects of Spike vaccination on lymphocytes in the lungs of the mice with breakthrough infections by flow cytometric analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

However, following infection, the numbers of NK cells, <italic>invariant</italic> NKT cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs substantially increased, with no significant differences between un-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, we observed significantly enhanced lung infiltration of B cells, γδ T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the vaccinated and infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), with the lung-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells representing the most abundant lymphocyte population in the vaccinated animals with a breakthrough infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). To further determine the histological locations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, we subjected lung tissue sections to immunohistochemical analysis, and observed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells throughout the lung tissue sections with a perivascular enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

To further compare the levels of other T helper subtype-associated cytokine production, we quantified the levels of gene expression of cytokines associated with different T helper cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), including <italic>Ifng</italic> (Th1), <italic>Il4/Il13</italic> (Th2), <italic>Il17a</italic> (Th17), <italic>Il21</italic> (Tfh), <italic>Csf2</italic> (encodes GM-CSF), and <italic>Il10</italic> (Regulatory T cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

To confirm this hypothesis, we stimulated cells recovered from the lung, draining lymph node of the vaccinated site, and the spleen with a cell stimulation cocktail (containing PMA, Ionomycin, and Brefeldin A), and performed intracellular cytokine staining for Th1 effector-associated cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α), Th2-associated cytokine (IL-4), and Th17 cytokine (IL-17A). We found that the percentage of cells expressing Th1, Th2 or Th17 cytokines were all significantly higher in the lungs and draining lymph nodes of the vaccinated and infected group compared to mice under any of the other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A &amp; B</xref>). Strikingly, the increase of Th17 cell numbers in the vaccinated and infected animals appeared to be systemic, as it was highly significant in cells recovered from the spleen of the mice with VAERD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A &amp; B</xref>, Spleen panels). Note that the number of γδ T cells was also significantly elevated in the vaccinated and infected mice compared to all other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Considering that γδ T cells are capable producers of IL-17 which can initiate a Th17 inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), we analyzed the production of different Th cell-associated cytokines in lung γδ T cells as well. However, we did not find evidence of VAERD-associated patterns of cytokine production by the γδ T cells (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Our results suggested that the COVID-19 VAERD observed in the ACE2-humanized mouse model is associated with enhanced local Th1, Th2 and Th17 inflammatory responses, as well as systemic Th17-associated inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P10">It is undeniable that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-based vaccination is safe and effective in preventing severe and fatal COVID-19. Immunization against Spike protein using mRNA, viral vector-based or protein subunit vaccines can elicit protective immunity and prevent severe COVID-19 illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Our results further support the global consensus on the protective effects of vaccines. However, while COVID-19 vaccines have been successful in reducing the severity of the disease, additional efforts are needed to enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of COVID-19 vaccination and the potential risks associated with breakthrough infections, especially concerning the emergence of VAERD. Multiple studies in different animals models of SARS-associated coronaviral infections reported that VAERD is associated with a Th2-biased inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Here we systematically investigated the potential risks and underlying mechanisms of immunopathogenesis of VAERD in COVID-19 breakthrough infections. Using an ACE2-humanized mouse model of COVID-19, we observed a similar Th2-associated lung immunopathology following Spike immunization and SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. Furthermore, our results suggest a prominent role of Th17 inflammatory response in correlation with severe COVID-19 VAERD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a prominent Th17 inflammatory response in VAERD in animal models of SARS-associated coronaviral infections.</p><p id="P11">An increased production of Th1-associated cytokines (e.g. IFN-g) is correlated with reduction in COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and vaccine-induced Th1 cell responses correlate with the protective effects of the current mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). CpG ODNs that can stimulate TLR9 and trigger strong Th1 type immunity have been considered as adjuvants for vaccinations against viral and bacterial infections, as well as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Classic Alum adjuvants are the first licensed and most widely used vaccine adjuvants. Alum adjuvants can prime a Th2-biased T cell differentiation and promote humoral responses which provide effective protective immunity against many pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, in severe coronavirus diseases in humans, Th2 cytokine polarization has been associated with disease severity and increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Additionally, Th2-skewing vaccination has consistently been linked to type 2 inflammatory immunity, notably eosinophilia, in cases of VAERD in animal models of coronaviral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In mouse models of allergic airway inflammation, where ovalbumin (OVA) is used to sensitize mice towards airway hypersensitivity upon respiratory exposure to OVA, Alum has been shown to induce a Th2-biased immunity accompanied by the induction of IgE and eosinophils. Interestingly, the effects of Alum in the OVA model could be reverted to basal levels by co-administration of CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Similarly, the inclusion of Th1-skewing adjuvants in SARS-CoV-1 inactivated or Spike protein subunit vaccines attenuated the eosinophilic respiratory inflammatory responses during infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Surprisingly, in SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunization followed by breakthrough infections, we observed elevated levels of lung immunopathology, eosinophilia, IgE, and Th2 responses, even if CpG and Alum were both used in vaccination. Moreover, we observed a systemic Th17 proinflammatory response. This is likely due to the intrinsic antigenic properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. For example, the lethal Th2-associated immunopathology following SARS-CoV-1 Spike immunization and viral infection can be induced by certain regions of the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein such as S<sub>597-603</sub> (LYQDVNC, an epitope downstream of the C terminus of the RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which is identical to SARS-CoV-2 S<sub>611-617</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Since antibodies to this peptide have been shown to cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection in SARS-CoV-1, it is predicted that SARS-CoV-2 S<sub>611-617</sub> may be involved in vaccine-associated enhanced pathology during infections through type 2 inflammation and potentially ADE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). It is possible that other regions in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are associated with a Th17 cell priming under the Alum/CpG combined adjuvant condition.</p><p id="P12">The induction of a systemic Th17 inflammatory response during breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly concerning. IL-17 exhibits multifaceted functions during viral infections. For example, during influenza infection, on one hand IL-17 promotes antiviral immunity and protects the hosts from severe viral disease, while on the other hand it contributes to the pathogenesis of immunopathology, lung injury, and post influenza superinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). While the potential protective role of IL-17 in COVID-19 is unclear, there are documented associations between high IL-17 levels and COVID-19 pathogenesis. In severe COVID-19 patients, there are elevated levels of serum IL-17A and circulating Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). High serum levels of IL-17 were also observed in long-COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). IL-17 can not only cause skin and lung tissue inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), but also induces mucus production and goblet cell metaplasia in lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). IL-17 and neutrophils are also linked to thrombus formation in acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Combined with TNF-a, IL-17A moderates thrombus growth on endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In mouse models, IL-17A promotes deep vein thrombosis by enhancing platelet activation/aggregation, neutrophil infiltration, and endothelial cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). These features of Th17-associated inflammatory diseases should be considered in the analysis of potential COVID vaccine-associated adverse effects.</p><p id="P13">In conclusion, this research underscores the complexity of COVID-19 vaccination and the need for a comprehensive understanding of vaccine-induced immune responses. While vaccines remain a vital tool in combating pandemics, the potential for VAERD highlights the importance of ongoing research, surveillance, and careful vaccine development to achieve broad protection and maximal safety.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice</title><p id="P14">B6.

Serum, spleen, lung and mediastinal lymph nodes were collected.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Serum neutralizing antibody titration</title><p id="P16">Calu-3 cells (ATCC; HTB-55) (1x10<sup>5</sup>/well in 50 μL) were seeded in 96-well plates, followed by incubation in 37 °C, with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 6-12 h later, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020; 1000 PFU). Titrated sera were mixed with virus in 50 μL and incubated in 37 °C for 30 minutes, and then applied to the seeded cells. Forty hours post infection, supernatant was removed, and cells were incubated with 60 μL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (25200072; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 2-3 mins, followed by the addition of 120 μL of 6% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS. Cells were then transferred to V-bottom plates and fixed overnight. Fixed cells were then permeabilized and stained (using BioLegend Buffer 421002) for intracellular SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein using a monoclonal Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-N antibody (kind gift from Dr. Yongjun Guan). Flow cytometric data was acquired with an automatic plate reader system (CytoFlex, Beckman Coulter, Inc.), and analyzed using FlowJo Software (version 10.1, FlowJo, LLC). Percentages of infection and dilution factors were used for nonlinear regression to calculate for doses for 50% inhibition (ID50) indicated by the dilution factors in Prism 9.3.1 (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p id="P17">The post-caval lobe of the lung was weighed and homogenized in 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) using a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen). RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ LS Reagent (Invitrogen) and cDNA was generated using Protoscript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR using the 2019-nCoV RUO Kit (IDTDNA, # 10006713). To quantify viral genome copies, quantitative PCR (qPCR) Extraction Control from Heat-Inactivated SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, # NR-52347) was used to generate the standard curve, which was used for calculating the genome copies per gram in the lung samples. To quantify cytokine gene transcript levels, “Best Coverage” gene probes for mouse Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), Ifng (Mm01168134_m1), Il4 (Mm00445259_m1), Il13 (Mm00434204_m1), Il17a (Mm00439618_m1), Il21 (Mm00517640_m1), Gmcsf (Mm01290062_m1), and Il10 (Mm01288386_m1) (Applied Biosystems TaqMan Assays) were used as per manufacturer’s instructions. Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated by normalizing cytokine gene values to the internal loading control Gapdh, and normalized against the average of cytokine levels in the control (un-immunized, un-infected).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P18">Sections of the lung were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 72 hours and subsequently processed and embedded in paraffin following standard procedures.

Following automated deparaffinization, tissue sections were subjected to automated heat-induced epitope retrieval using a ready-to-use EDTA-based solution (pH 9.0; Leica Biosystems) for 20 min at 100°C. Subsequently, endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 mins, followed by incubation with a recombinant rabbit anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone EPR19514; Abcam) diluted 1:4,000 in a ready-to-use antibody diluent (Leica Biosystems) for 30 mins at room temperature. Sections were then washed and stained with a polymer-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP for 8 mins, followed by incubation with HRP substrate for 10 mins, at room temperature. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min and slides were finally mounted with Micromount (Leica Biosystems).</p><p id="P20">Scoring of stained tissue sections was based on a cumulative score (maximum attainable score of 17) derived from 5 specific histologic features evaluated in 5 random 20 x fields following the scoring rubrics shown in <italic>SI Appendix</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

statement</title></caption><p>This research investigates the safety and efficacy of a Spike protein subunit vaccine adjuvanted with Alum and CpG in an ACE2-humanized mouse model, simulating SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. The study reveals that despite robust protection against severe COVID-19, vaccinated mice exhibit substantial pulmonary immunopathology, including eosinophilia and enhanced Th2 effector immunity, following breakthrough infections. Surprisingly, the study also uncovers a significant systemic Th17 inflammatory response in vaccinated mice. This research sheds light on the potential risks associated with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections and the need for a comprehensive understanding of vaccine-induced immune responses, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research, surveillance, and careful vaccine development for both protection and safety in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Protective effects and VAERD in hACE2 transgenic mice following SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein vaccination and breakthrough infection.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic of experimental design.
