However, even highly homogenous tumors may display variability in their aggressiveness, and how immunologic-factors impinge on their aggressiveness remains understudied. Here we studied the mechanisms responsible for the immune-escape of murine tumors with low ITH. We compared the temporal growth of homogeneous, genetically-similar single-cell clones that are rejected vs. those that are not-rejected after transplantation <italic>in-vivo</italic> using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping. Non-rejected clones showed high infiltration of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs), lower T-cell infiltration, and increased T-cell exhaustion compared to rejected clones. Comparative analysis of rejection-associated gene expression programs, combined with <italic>in-vivo</italic> CRISPR knockout screens of candidate mediators, identified <italic>Mif</italic> (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) as a regulator of immune rejection. <italic>Mif</italic> knockout led to smaller tumors and reversed non-rejection-associated immune composition, particularly, leading to the reduction of immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration. Finally, we validated these results in melanoma patient data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Tumors with low intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), as determined by the number of clones comprising the tumor and the level of genomic clonal divergence, have been associated with improved survival and better responses to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Some factors underlying this correlation are known, but key aspects that explain the properties of ITH remain undetermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that patients bearing low ITH tumors who suffer from aggressive disease show large variability in survival rates, suggesting that factors beyond ITH dictate disease course and tumor aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To elucidate the mechanisms that underlie clinical correlations and study the impact of ITH on immune-mediated tumor growth, we established a novel experimental system. This system builds on an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model, from Wolf et al., and allowed us to assess the effect of ITH independent of tumor mutational burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Using this model, we hypothesized that we could investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for aggressive tumor behavior in low ITH patients. Indeed, we were able to compare tumors that are rejected and non-rejected while controlling for low ITH levels and differences in somatic variations.</p><p id="P5">We utilized this model system to comprehensively compare the transcriptomic state of tumor and immune cells from rejected and non-rejected tumors across several sequential time points during tumor evolution. Notably, we found that aggressive tumors showed specific immune phenotypes, including tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration, that adversely affected anti-tumor responses. Immune cell populations infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to have pro-tumorigenic effects by modulating T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Indeed, TAMs are known for their many contributions to such immune suppression, including direct inhibition of the cytotoxic T cell response, neoangiogenesis, secretion of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, and induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In addition, TAM infiltration is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression in several cancer types including melanoma, pancreatic, breast, and bladder cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), in line with our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse data.</p><p id="P6">Analysis of gene expression time series data revealed <italic>Mif</italic> expression as a central non-genetic factor that affected the TME and dictated tumor growth in mice, which was subsequently validated in patient data. Indeed, previous reports have associated <italic>Mif</italic> upregulation with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Yet, its contribution to tumor aggressiveness is understudied. Our unique experimental system that isolated ITH from its complex context allowed the evaluation of MIF’s role in shaping the suppressive TME in a homogenous, low ITH tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, our analysis suggests a means of potentially improving immunotherapeutic outcomes for patients bearing low ITH tumors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Survival time is variable in patients with low levels of ITH</title><p id="P7">Previous studies have suggested that melanoma patients with low ITH exhibit improved survival compared to patients with high ITH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, analyzing the survival time of melanoma patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) partitioned according to high/low ITH levels revealed higher complexity. Although we found that the low ITH patients have significantly higher survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, Wilcoxon’s test, p=0.014) compared to high ITH, the distribution of survival times in low ITH patients is quite wide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, interquartile range of 2,587 days for low ITH patients vs 1,452 days for high ITH patients). A different quantification of the TCGA survival data showed that 40% of the low ITH patients exhibit a poor outcome, with lower survival time than high ITH patients. These findings indicate that there is considerable variance in the response of low ITH patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, low ITH patients showed significantly higher survival time when characterized by a high T cell cytolytic scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these data motivated us to study factors that could contribute to immune and survival variability.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>An <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model to identify factors that influence tumor aggressiveness in a low ITH setting</title><p id="P8">To examine factors that may play a role in tumor escape from immune surveillance, we established an experimental <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model that would allow us to identify novel factors that contribute to tumor aggressiveness in low ITH tumors. To this end, we utilized the mouse model previously established in Wolf. et al, in which B2905, a mouse melanoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), was exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation to increase ITH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). From this heterogeneous parental line, we generated 40 homogeneous single-cell-derived clones (SCCs). SCCs were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES), and analysis of the mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) verified that the clones harbored a narrow clonal VAF distribution with the fraction of clonal SNVs ranging from 0.835 to 0.949 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Using this data we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the heterogeneous UVB cell line, which yielded a phylogenetic tree with eight terminal branches (TBs), numbered TB-1 to TB-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then placed the 40 SCCs on the various terminal branches of the tree, based on their sequence similarity. TBs were represented by clusters of 2 to 11 SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We focused on TB-3, represented by six SCCs that shared clonal and sub-clonal mutations, with an overall genetic similarity above 80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Nevertheless, when inoculated into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, these SCCs exhibited very different growth phenotypes. Although five out of the six SCCs showed robust growth; two were rejected (SCC 31 and SCC 40) within 16 to 20 days post inoculation, while three were non-rejected (SCC 32, SCC 35, and SCC 37), growing aggressively and able to escape immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). VAF values of the rejected and non-rejected clones were similar, demonstrating that the reason for the opposite growth phenotypes was not clonality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test whether remission of the rejected SCCs was dependent on the immune system, tumor volume was monitored after inoculation of rejected clones (SCC 31 and SCC 40) into NOD SCID gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice. In the absence of a fully functioning immune system, all SCCs were able to grow and form tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that tumor rejection was indeed mediated by the immune system. Assessment of the MHC class I and II surface levels using flow cytometry validated that the aggressive phenotype was also not due to MHC class I downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Analysis of WES data identified a single missense mutation in the gene Or13a22 (S5N) shared between the two rejected SCCs. No mutations were shared between the non-rejected SCCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), suggesting that any differences between rejected and non-rejected clones were likely due to non-genetic mechanisms, including first and foremost differentially expressed genes, and pathways in the tumor cells themselves, or in the TME.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>High TAM infiltration, low T cell frequency, and increased T cell exhaustion are associated with more aggressive tumor growth in low ITH tumors</title><p id="P10">To identify immune-specific cellular and transcriptional variation that may underlie the differential growth aggressiveness between highly clonal tumors, each SCC was inoculated separately into immunocompetent mice and the tumors were harvested at sequential time points (days 6, 10, and 16 post-inoculation for both groups, as well as day 20 post-inoculation for the non-rejected group). We then extracted and dissociated the tumors, and performed bulk RNA sequencing on these tumors, as well as on samples of the SCC cell lines representing day 0. Gene expression levels were compared between the SCC groups to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways. PCA analysis revealed three well-defined clusters of expression patterns, corresponding to (a) samples from SCCs grown <italic>in vitro</italic> from day 0, (b) samples from the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumors of the non-rejected clones, and (c) samples from the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumors of the rejected clones, together establishing that the gene expression differences are only evident <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). When comparing these groups, we found that the rejected tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> showed significantly increased T cell function and T cell infiltration signature scores compared to the non-rejected tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>), as computed using the previously described Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) computational framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In addition, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed sets of genes between the rejected and non-rejected groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>). The expression of genes encoding IFNγ signaling pathway components, including <italic>Camk2a</italic>, <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Ifngr</italic>, <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Jak1</italic>, and <italic>Jak2</italic>, was consistently enriched in the rejected clones, both in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). IFNγ plays a central role in anti-tumor immunity by upregulating MHC-I expression and inducing the immunoproteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This pathway affects the response of melanoma patients and may thereby contribute to the observed rejection phenotype.</p><p id="P11">To fully decipher the differences in the tumor microenvironment of the rejected and non-rejected SCCs, we next performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumors harvested from mice transplanted with these SCCs at the same time points (days 0, 6, 10, 16, and 20 post-inoculation). Integration of cells from all tumors and time points revealed signatures of several major cell types, including a dominant population of tumor and stromal cells expressing Vimentin (<italic>Vim</italic>), <italic>Cd81</italic>, and <italic>Pcbp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). We were also able to capture the immune compartment, which included adaptive immune cells such as T cells (<italic>Cd3e</italic>, <italic>Cd3g</italic>) and natural killer (NK) cells (<italic>Nkg7</italic>, <italic>Gzma</italic>), along with myeloid populations of monocytes (<italic>Cd14</italic>, <italic>Fcgr1</italic>), macrophages (<italic>Cd74</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>), and dendritic cells (DCs; <italic>H2-Eb1</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">By comparing the rejected and non-rejected SCCs, we observed a higher proportion of macrophages in the non-rejected clones, especially at day 10 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). To further investigate the differential composition of the immune microenvironment between rejected and non-rejected tumors, we re-clustered cells in the immune compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). This analysis enabled a finer resolution of the T cell compartment, separating T cells into cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<italic>Nkg7</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic>), CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<italic>Foxp3</italic>, <italic>Ctla4</italic>), conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Rora</italic>), and proliferating T cells (<italic>Mki67</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Comparison of T cell populations from the non-rejected versus rejected tumors revealed a significantly decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> and conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency, and a higher exhaustion phenotype in the non-rejected tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, we separated macrophages into resting and proliferating populations based on the expression of <italic>Mki67</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2C, E</xref>). Both macrophage populations accounted for a significantly higher fraction of the immune compartment in non-rejected tumors compared to rejected tumors at day 10 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, the proliferating macrophages were present at higher frequencies in the non-rejected tumors as early as day 6, suggesting that the TME of non-rejected SCCs induces the proliferation of macrophages shortly after tumor formation, which leads to the accumulation of macrophages in the tumor. A similar analysis of myeloid cells also showed an enrichment of macrophages in non-rejected SCCs at significant levels on days 6 and 10 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). When we specifically analyzed CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and macrophages, we were able to identify six clusters, two of which (clusters 2 and 5) were found to be significantly enriched in the non-rejected tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). These two clusters were characterized by a high M2 pro-tumorigenic score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), as well as high expression of <italic>C1qa</italic>, <italic>C1qb</italic>, <italic>C1qc</italic>, and <italic>Apoe</italic> which are known to be associated with M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). These data further strengthen our observation that the non-rejected tumors are associated with relatively high numbers of pro-tumorigenic macrophages compared to rejected SCC-derived tumors.</p><p id="P13">Opal multiplexed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of the rejected and non-rejected tumors ten days post-inoculation validated the scRNA-seq results, showing significantly higher CD206<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup> pro-tumorigenic macrophages and lower CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-E</xref>). Importantly, a T cell suppression assay, which assesses T cell proliferation, established that co-culturing non-rejected SCC tumor-derived macrophages with CFSE-labeled CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from naïve mouse spleens inhibited T cells from proliferating. Furthermore, it significantly decreased their cytotoxic activity, manifested by significantly lower levels of IFNγ secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). This data corroborates the role of macrophages that infiltrate highly aggressive tumors in suppressing T cell function, ultimately leading to tumor immune escape.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increased <italic>Mif</italic> levels lead to aggressive tumor growth of low ITH tumors</title><p id="P14">We next sought to identify tumor-intrinsic factors that may contribute to the dramatic differences seen in the immune cell composition of non-rejected (derived from SCC 32, SCC 35, and SCC 37) vs. rejected (derived from SCC 31 and SCC 40) tumors. Although all tumor populations shared a core identity, reflected in expression of specific genes such as <italic>Vim</italic>, <italic>Gpx4</italic>, and <italic>Pcbp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), we identified numerous transcriptional differences between the aggressive and non-aggressive tumors. First, we performed differential expression analysis between the tumor compartment of non-rejected and rejected clones at each time point (0, 6, 10, and 16 days post-inoculation) separately. In total, we observed 128 differential genes at day 0 (101 up in non-rejected, 27 up in rejected), 282 genes at day 6 (123 non-rejected, 159 rejected), 169 genes at day 10 (79 non-rejected, 90 rejected), and 204 genes at day 16 (100 non-rejected, 104 rejected; fold change &gt;1.5; Bonferroni-corrected p-value &lt;0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). To investigate whether there are shared transcriptional programs between individual clones that control tumor aggressiveness, we identified a core set of genes that were upregulated in either all rejected or all non-rejected clones for each time point. This revealed 4, 11, and 13 core genes that were overexpressed in both rejected clones at days 0, 6, and 10, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, we identified 29, 13, and 11 core non-rejection genes at days 0, 6, and 10, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Of note, we observed that at day 0, all non-rejected clones expressed higher levels of calreticulin (<italic>Calr</italic>), protein isomerase <italic>Pdia3</italic>, and members of the S100 protein family (<italic>S100a4</italic>, <italic>S100a6</italic>), which have been associated with tumor progression and increased metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Next, we identified genes that were consistently differentially expressed between rejected and non-rejected SCCs across time points. This analysis revealed 78 genes that were upregulated by rejected clones at two or more time points, including the arginine metabolism enzyme <italic>Ass1</italic>, whose expression has been linked to tumor suppression and better prognosis of patients with breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Among the non-rejected tumor clones, we found 91 genes to be upregulated at two or more time points, including Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (<italic>Mif</italic>), <italic>Lgals1</italic>, and <italic>S100a11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since these genes displayed consistent upregulation in non-rejected SCCs longitudinally, we hypothesized that they could be factors that mediate tumor aggressiveness.</p><p id="P15">To narrow down the list and rationally choose the best targets for further exploration, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen, which allowed us to examine which genes may be required for immune evasion. To this end, we created a pooled CRISPR sgRNA library targeting 200 genes that were differentially expressed in the non-rejected tumors at day 0, 6, 10, or 16 post-inoculation. We also included 5 non-targeting control guides and a set of 3 depletion and 2 enrichment control genes, including <italic>Cd47</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic>, respectively, based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We then transduced the non-rejected SCC 35 cell line with the sgRNA library and Cas9 using selective CRISPR antigen removal (SCAR) lentiviral vectors in order to induce per-cell knock-outs <italic>in vitro</italic>, while avoiding immune-mediated rejection of CRISPR/Cas9 components <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The edited SCC35 cell lines were then split into 3 replicates at day 0 and sequenced to verify high sgRNA recovery rates, which ranged from 93.5%-95.6% of the original guide library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). These input pools were then inoculated into immunocompetent mice, after which the tumors were harvested, dissociated, and subjected to sgRNA sequencing 20 days post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). At day 20, we recovered between 40.6%-73.6% of sgRNAs in the pooled library, which was lower than in the input library at day 0, likely reflective of <italic>in vivo</italic> selection pressures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). By comparing this final sgRNA library to the input library sequenced at day 0 and assessing guide enrichment/depletion using a negative binomial model (<bold>Methods</bold>), we identified 451 significantly depleted and 397 enriched guides, and 33 significantly depleted genes and 38 enriched genes (FDR-adjusted p-value &lt;0.05, absolute log fold change &gt;1). We first analyzed screen controls and found that all 4 guides targeting the enrichment control <italic>Pten</italic> were enriched at day 20 in both replicates M4 and M5 (4/4 guides significantly enriched at adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 in M4; 2/4 guides significant in M5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 4C, D</xref>). Furthermore, the depletion control <italic>Cd47</italic> was depleted in all replicates at the guide level (4/4 guides depleted in M3; 4/4 in M4; 3/4 in M5) and gene level (adjusted p-value 0.000171 in M4), suggesting that the results of our pooled screen recapitulated known effects of gene knockouts on tumor aggressiveness. Indeed, the most strongly depleted guide in the entire CRISPR screen for replicates M4 and M5 was Cd47_g2 (M4: log fold change -8.12, FDR-adjusted p-value 0.02; M5: log fold change -8.11, FDR-adjusted p-value 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">One of the next most strongly depleted hits was a guide targeting Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (<italic>Mif</italic>), (Mif_g2; M4: log fold change -6.31, FDR-adjusted p-value 0.05; M5: log fold change -6.24, FDR-adjusted p-value 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), a gene whose expression was also consistently enriched in non-rejected clones longitudinally from days 0 to 10 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Mif</italic> was significantly depleted at the gene level in replicate M4 (median log fold change -2.5, FDR-adjusted p-value 0.0099). MIF is a secreted protein that binds to the CD74 receptor, which is highly expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Given that MIF is secreted by the tumor cells in the TME, we hypothesized that it may recruit CD74<sup>+</sup> monocytes and promote their differentiation into pro-tumorigenic macrophages. This would then contribute to an immunosuppressive environment and cause tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with the increased infiltration of TAMs with a high M2 score and high expression levels of the <italic>C1q</italic> and <italic>Apoe</italic> genes in the non-rejected tumors observed by scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-I</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To assess the relevance of our mouse findings to human melanoma, we computed the correlation between <italic>MIF</italic> expression and tumor aggressiveness in de-convolved-by-cell-type gene expression in TCGA melanoma patient datasets, which was generated via the application of CODEFACS to the TCGA bulk expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).

After integrating data from all time points and clones, we observed that the broad cell types recapitulated those from scRNA-seq of the rejected vs. non-rejected SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Namely, we captured a large population of tumor/stromal cells, while the immune compartment was composed of macrophages, monocytes, DCs, NK cells, and T cells in both resting and proliferating states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>Mif</italic> expression was indeed lower among tumor cells in <italic>Mif</italic> KO clones compared to control clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next, we examined TAMs in <italic>Mif</italic> KO clone-derived tumors and observed decreased infiltration compared to the controls (average frequencies of TAM1/2 at day 6: 2.0%<italic>Mif</italic> KO, 5.9% control, Wilcoxon p-value 0.0043; day 10: 4.7%<italic>Mif</italic> KO, 6.8% control.

To further characterize the differences in T cell infiltration induced by the <italic>Mif</italic> KO, we re-clustered the T cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 5E</xref>). This analysis enabled the separation of T cells into a naïve/memory cluster characterized by the expression of <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>Tcf7</italic>, and two clusters of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated by <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 5E, F</xref>).

Additionally, we captured a cluster of T cells that expressed high levels of interferon-stimulated genes such as <italic>Ifit1</italic> and <italic>Isg15</italic>.

This approach provided the opportunity to perform a comparative analysis of rejection-associated gene expression signatures, accompanied by <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR knockout screens of promising candidate regulators of tumor aggressiveness, measuring their influence on anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth. Our findings in mice suggest that, in melanoma, an important determinant of an aggressive growth phenotype in low ITH tumors is <italic>Mif</italic> expression in tumor cells, whose activity is associated with increased TAM frequency and decreased cytotoxic T cell infiltration into TME.</p><p id="P23">The infiltrating TAMs are characterized by a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, manifested by a high M2 score and elevated expression of <italic>C1qa</italic>, <italic>C1qb</italic>, and <italic>C1qc</italic>, which encode subunits of the C1q component of the complement system, along with <italic>Apoe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

Validation of this finding using IHC staining provided further information regarding the spatial location of these TAMs, which infiltrate the tumor core and comprise high levels of CD206<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup> macrophages. These results corroborate previous reports that such macrophages are frequently found in patients bearing aggressive tumors and are associated with poor survival in various cancers, including melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Indeed, patient data analysis shows that higher TAM infiltration is associated with worse prognosis for various cancers, further supporting this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Furthermore, high TAM infiltration has been reported to be accompanied by increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion and increased presence of Tregs in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).

These CD74<sup>+</sup> macrophages, differentiate into TAMs and exhibit an M2 signature. These M2 macrophages, in turn, reduce CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration into the tumor. The total outcome is weaker anti-tumor immunity, manifested by dampening of TIL cytotoxicity, effector cytokine secretion, proliferation, and a high T cell exhaustion signature. In contrast, highly homogeneous tumors that harbor reduced <italic>Mif</italic> expression also have low presence of macrophages, and specifically those in a proliferative state. In addition, a significantly lower TAM presence in the tumor leads to enhanced CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration into the tumor and elevated effector cytokines, enhancing the ability of the immune system to reject the tumor.</p><p id="P28">Although high <italic>MIF</italic> expression has previously been associated with a more robust immunosuppression phenotype, increased tumor growth, and poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), its association with worse prognosis has not always been clear cut, as there have been cases where it was shown to be associated with better prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Our focus in this study on highly homogeneous tumors, and our establishment of an experimental model that emphasizes the use of SCC-derived, highly clonal tumors, enabled us to identify <italic>Mif</italic> as a consistent and robust biomarker for tumor aggressiveness. Indeed, our <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen was based on a heterogeneous system where we assessed a pool of targets in parallel. This may explain our ability to identify <italic>Mif</italic> as a target. Our follow up, single <italic>Mif</italic> KO functional data, supports this hypothesis as in this case we observed a clear-cut phenotype. It may therefore be the case that, <italic>Mif</italic>, like many additional targets, was missed in previous CRISPR screens due to the tumors’ heterogeneous nature, as well as the fact that the impact of secreted factors is masked by other cells in the screen, and their results are diluted.</p><p id="P29">Our findings show the value in evaluating mechanisms of resistance in a highly homogeneous system.

Lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher) was used as the transfection reagent. The virus was collected at 48 and 72 hrs post-transfection, then filtered via a 0.45 uM filtration unit (Millipore). The filtered virus was concentrated using the LentiX concentrator (Takara) at 1500 x g for 45 min. The concentrated supernatant was subsequently aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80C until use.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Generation of CRISPR-edited cell lines</title><p id="P43">Edited SCC lines were generated following the protocol as described by Lane-Reticker et al, 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In brief, plated SCCs were infected with pSCAR-Cas9-Blast-GFP lentivirus along with 4 ug/ml of polybrene. The transduction rate was determined by flow analysis of the GFP marker after 48 h. Once the transduction rate was confirmed to be sufficient, edited cells were selected with blasticidin for 6 days or until Cas9-expressing cells were greater than 90% of the population. Cas9-expressing cells were then infected with lentivirus for the pSCAR library and underwent selection with puromycin after 48 h. Cells were selected for 10 days or until edited cells were greater than or equal to 90% of the population. After 10 days, cells were infected twice with IDLV-Cre lentivirus in media with polybrene. Using the same process as the other lentivirus infections, cells were monitored for 10 days via flow cytometry for the loss of mKate2 and GFP. After 10 days, greater than 90% of the population was double-negative for fluorescent reporters.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Tumor inoculation for <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR experiments</title><p id="P44">CRISPR-edited SCC cells were collected and then washed in PBS. 0.5 million cells in 100 μl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of C57BL/6 mouse (one tumor per mouse) and measured every 3 days starting 6 days post-injection. 20 days after injection, tumors were collected, weighed, and then minced into small pieces.

We used the offline TIDEpy package with default normalization and parameters. TIDE was initially used to predict immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy response via computing two different scores for each sample: a T cell “dysfunction” score and a T cell “exclusion” score. In principle, these scores can be used to reflect anti-tumor immune function and we used TIDE for this alternative purpose. The T cell infiltration score we described in this study is the negative of the “exclusion” score from TIDE. The “dysfunction” score from TIDE is higher in ICB responders and thus appears to be a misnomer since this score positively correlates with T cell function. Therefore, we call it the T cell function score in this study. The differences in these scores between the rejected and non-rejected clones were tested with a linear model at each time point; the tests were conducted using nested design models taking into consideration replicated samples of each clone.
