Reference bias in RNA-Seq analysis has yet to be explored in complex polyploid genomes despite evidence that they are often a complex mosaic of wild relative introgressions, which introduce blocks of highly divergent genes. Here we use hexaploid wheat as a model complex polyploid, using both simulated and experimental data to show that RNA-Seq alignment in wheat suffers from widespread reference bias which is largely driven by divergent introgressed genes. This leads to underestimation of gene expression and incorrect assessment of homoeologue expression balance. By incorporating gene models from ten wheat genome assemblies into a pantranscriptome reference, we present a novel method to reduce reference bias, which can be readily scaled to capture more variation as new genome and transcriptome data becomes available.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Quantification of gene expression using RNA-Seq is a fundamental technique in genomics research. It has been employed in numerous publications across a range of biological systems to identify candidate genes underlying traits of interest, uncover transcriptional pathways and networks, and investigate hypotheses relating to gene and transcriptional evolution and adaptation. In RNA-Seq experiments, mRNA, which represents a snapshot of the expression of each gene at the time of sampling, is extracted from the biological sample, converted to cDNA, and sequenced. The number of resulting RNA-Seq reads deriving from each gene/transcript are quantified, with the number of reads proportional to the level of expression of that gene/transcript. Quantifying the expression level of each transcript and/or gene typically involves alignment of sequencing reads to the reference genome or transcriptome of the sequenced species using spliced alignment tools such as HISAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] or pseudoalignment tools such as kallisto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and Salmon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Despite these tools typically being developed and benchmarked with human data, they are widely used across numerous biological systems, often without consideration for how they will behave with specific challenges the genomes of different species present.</p><p id="P3">Making meaningful inferences from RNA-Seq data relies upon the accuracy of alignment and quantification; downstream analyses and subsequent interpretation assumes that the estimated gene expression reflects actual gene expression in the biological samples. However, nucleotide variation in the coding region of genes between the sequenced sample and the reference genome/transcriptome leads to errors in read assignment during the alignment/pseudoalignment step. Some reads may be unassigned, while others may be assigned to the wrong locus. This source of error is widely known as reference bias as transcripts derived from alleles present in the reference sequence will be quantified more accurately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The impact of reference bias in RNA-Seq analysis hasn’t been assessed in complex polyploid genomes such as wheat despite these genomes having characteristics that may increase the extent and degree of reference bias relative to species with simpler genomes. Polyploidisation increases the number of alleles per gene, typically resulting in a pair of alleles, known as homoeologues, in each subgenome; however, subsequent gene duplications or deletions can change the relative copy number of homoeologues between the subgenomes. As RNA-Seq reads are derived from all subgenomes at once, read assignment must be able to distinguish reads deriving from homoeologues. Accurate discrimination of wheat homoeologue RNA-Seq reads has been demonstrated with both pseudoalignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] (99.9% accuracy) and alignment-based (98% accuracy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] methods when mapping reads back to the genome from which they derived. However, when mapping reads from a different genotype, unequal divergence between homoeologues relative to the reference genome may compromise the accuracy of the expression balance estimation between homoeologues.</p><p id="P5">Introgression events, the introduction of genetic material from one species to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], are common among plants; in fact, its frequency is thought to be higher in plants than in animals, due to higher rates of interspecific hybridisation success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Additionally, introgression is commonly used to introduce genetic variation for crop improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated how common introgressions are in wheat accessions with some accessions being comprised of up to 34% introgressed material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The production of chromosome-level genome assemblies of modern elite wheat cultivars confirmed this, revealing introgressions from wild and domesticated relatives, including species outside of the <italic>Triticum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops</italic> genera, present in one or multiple cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. These introgressions introduce greater sequence divergence between varieties than observed between varieties at non-introgressed regions; this increased divergence likely leads to an increased proportion of reads that are unable to be assigned correctly.</p><p id="P6">Using simulated and experimentally-generated RNA-Seq data, we identify non-trivial levels of reference bias in RNA-Seq mapping in wheat which can largely be attributed to introgressions. This leads to incorrect estimates of relative expression between homoeologues and incorrectly called differences in expression between cultivars. By constructing a pantranscriptome reference composed of Chinese Spring transcripts and transcripts from the wheat pangenome assemblies, we demonstrate how reference bias caused by divergent alleles can be reduced.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reference bias in wheat is driven by divergent genes introduced via introgressions and results in underestimation of gene expression</title><p id="P7">To explore the impact of reference bias on the quantification of gene expression in wheat, we simulated 1000 read pairs from each high-confidence (HC) gene in Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.1 and the nine chromosome-level genome assemblies produced from the wheat pangenome project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] if the longest transcript of the gene is at least 500bp. These reads were pseudoaligned or aligned to the Chinese Spring reference transcriptome or genome using kallisto or STAR, respectively. These algorithms represent pseudoalignment and alignment-based methods and are among the most commonly used tools for RNA-Seq quantification in the wheat community.</p><p id="P8">Mapping Chinese Spring reads to Chinese Spring, hereafter referred to as self-mapping, yields very accurate estimates of gene expression, with kallisto slightly outperforming STAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Using kallisto, 88401/88443 (99.95%) of genes were correctly quantified (between 500 and 1500 read pairs). 32 genes were underestimated (&lt; 500 read pairs) and 10 genes were overestimated (&gt; 1500 read pairs). Using STAR, 87689/88443 (99.15%) were correctly quantified with 504 and 250 genes underestimated and overestimated, respectively.</p><p id="P9">Mapping reads generated from the other cultivars to Chinese Spring, hereafter called cross-mapping, yielded much less accurate estimation of gene expression with a skew towards underestimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The percentage of genes correctly quantified ranged from 55773/63001 (88.53%) for Lancer, with 5700 (9.05%) and 1528 (2.43%) under and overestimated, respectively, to 58468/64077 (91.2%) for Norin61, with 2527 (3.94%) and 3082 (4.81%) genes under and overestimated, respectively. For cross-mapping, unlike self-mapping, STAR appears to perform better than kallisto; the proportion of correctly quantified genes ranged from 58390/63001 (92.68%) for Lancer, with 3916 and 695 under and overestimated, respectively, to 59648 (93.1%) for Norin61, with 2450 and 1979 genes under and overestimated, respectively.</p><p id="P10">To explore the effect of reference bias on the quantification of homoeologue expression balance, we calculated the proportion of triads belonging to each category that defines a different state of relative homoeologue expression. As reads were simulated evenly across genes, all triads should be classified as balanced; therefore, triads classified as imbalanced (one or two homoeologues with expression greater than the other(s)) are considered incorrectly classified. The percentage of correctly classified triads varies between 80.97% (Lancer) and 93.84% (Norin61) using kallisto and between 90.23% (Lancer) and 96.12% (Norin61) using STAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Across the cultivars, triads incorrectly classified as suppressed, where one homoeologue is estimated to be expressed less than the others, were far more common than triads incorrectly classified as dominant, where one homoeologue is estimated to be expressed more highly than the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This reflects how the reference bias leads to more underestimated than overestimated genes.</p><p id="P11">To explore the extent of errors when comparing two cultivars mapped to a common reference, we compared the estimated expression of Lancer and Jagger genes, whose simulated reads were both aligned to Chinese Spring using STAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Genes with read counts &gt; 1.5x or &lt; 1/1.5x compared to the other cultivar were classified as incorrectly quantified. Using STAR, 4791/60338 (7.94%) genes were incorrectly quantified between the two cultivars; of these genes, 2747 and 2044 genes had a lower read count in Lancer and Jagger, respectively.</p><p id="P12">We observed a clear overlap between clusters of incorrectly quantified genes and regions of divergence between the cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), identified by blocks of reduced CDS nucleotide identity between pairs of orthologues between Lancer and Jagger. Such gene-level divergence is indicative of introgressed material; indeed, several of these blocks correspond to previously characterised introgressions and likely additional introgressions that are yet to be characterised. These introgressions include (coordinates based on Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0): <italic>Aegilops ventricosa</italic> introgression in Jagger (chr2A:1-24643290) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]; <italic>Triticum timopheevii</italic> introgression in Lancer (chr2B:89506326-756157100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]; <italic>Aegilops comosa</italic> introgression in Jagger (chr2D:570141481-613325841) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]; and a <italic>Thinopyrum ponticum</italic> introgression in Lancer (chr3D:591971000-615552423) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. 1173/3054 (61.59%) of introgressed genes were incorrectly quantified between the two cultivars, compared to 2910/57284 (5.24%) non-introgressed genes incorrectly quantified (chisq. p &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Genes with an introgressed copy in Lancer tend to be underestimated in Lancer and genes with an introgressed copy in Jagger tend to be underestimated in Jagger.</p><p id="P13">In further support of CDS divergence being a predominant contributing factor to incorrect quantification, we found that incorrectly quantified genes have a mean CDS identity between orthologue pairs of 97.3% compared to a mean of 99.9% for genes correctly quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16; 95% confidence interval ranges from 2.45 to 2.63). The percentage of genes incorrectly quantified ranges from 83.2% for genes with &lt;96% CDS identity between orthologues to just 2.9% for genes with &gt;=99% identity between orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reducing reference bias by constructing a pantranscriptome reference</title><p id="P14">The wheat pangenome project generated chromosome-level de novo assembled genomes for 9 wheat cultivars in addition to the reference cultivar Chinese Spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. These include numerous introgressions that are the predominant source of reference bias we observe. High-quality gene annotations for these genome assemblies have been produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. We constructed a pantranscriptome reference by adding in transcripts from the pangenome cultivars to the set of Chinese Spring transcripts if the gene existed in a 1-to-1 relationship with a gene from Chinese Spring. 80211 Chinese Spring genes had at least one 1-to-1 orthologue in another cultivar, while 59639 Chinese Spring genes had a 1-to-1 orthologue in all nine other cultivars (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) based on OrthoFinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] orthogroup assignments. This pantranscriptome reference was used as the transcriptome reference for kallisto pseudoalignment. After pseudoalignment, read counts and TPMs were summed across all transcripts corresponding to a given Chinese Spring gene. Kallisto splits read counts evenly across transcripts with an identical match so redundancy of transcripts does not cause problematic multi-mapping; all transcripts corresponding to a gene can thus be added.</p><p id="P15">To ensure using this pantranscriptome reference doesn’t introduce any additional mapping errors from adding redundant transcripts, we compared quantified expression counts between four difference references: Chinese Spring, the pantranscriptome reference, Chinese Spring plus Landmark, and the pantranscriptome reference minus Landmark. The simulated reads from Landmark were used for pseudoalignment. The pantranscriptome reference performed the best, with 97.53% of genes correctly quantified. Chinese Spring plus Landmark transcripts was very similar, with 97.50% of genes correctly quantified. This demonstrates that adding redundant transcripts and summing the read counts doesn’t introduce errors in the kallisto mapping. Using the pantranscriptome reference without Landmark transcripts resulted in slightly lower level of correct quantification, with 96.84% correctly quantified. The difference is likely due to uniquely introgressed genes in Landmark that are not present in the other cultivars. However, due to many introgressed genes being common between cultivars, it still performed much better than just using Chinese Spring, which had 91.43% genes correctly quantified.</p><p id="P16">Using the pantranscriptome reference instead of Chinese Spring to quantify expression from the simulated RNA-Seq reads resulted in much more accurate quantification for genes that were previously underestimated when cross-mapping, removing nearly all gene counts below 1000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). There was little change in the number of genes overquantified when cross-mapping and little difference in the distribution of read counts when self-mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The distribution of read counts shows that for Lancer, the most error prone cultivar, the number of genes correctly quantified increased from 58390/63001 (92.68%) using STAR to 61352/63001 (97.38%) using the pantranscriptome reference. Using the pantranscriptome reference, only 2 genes remained quantified below 500 read pairs compared to 3916 genes when using the Chinese Spring reference. The number of triads correctly assigned to the balanced expression category also greatly increased when using the pantranscriptome reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). All cross-mapped cultivars had at least 99.89% triads correctly assigned as balanced; this compares to between 80.97% and 93.84% using kallisto, and between 90.23% to 96.12% using STAR to align to Chinese Spring.</p><p id="P17">Comparing Jagger and Lancer as before, this approach reduced the number of genes incorrectly quantified in one cultivar from 5049/60338 (8.96%) to 617 (1.02%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Only 23 genes (0.0381%) remain incorrectly quantified due to underestimation in one cultivar compared to 4882 (8.90%) when aligned to Chinese Spring using STAR. Almost all the remaining error in both cross-mapped read counts and incorrectly quantified genes between cultivars is due to overestimation of gene expression, likely caused by copy number variation or presence/absence variation between cultivars, as opposed to divergence between orthologous gene models.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Exploring reference bias caused by introgressions in experimentally-generated RNA-Seq data</title><p id="P18">Simulated RNA-Seq data is unlikely to capture the complete picture of a real experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. While our simulations highlight theoretical errors, it is important to assess how reference bias impacts published findings and how using the pantranscriptome reference corrects errors in real data. We reanalysed the data from He <italic>et al</italic>. (2022), in which RNA-Seq data from 198 diverse wheat accessions, alongside enrichment capture paired-end DNA reads was used to uncover eQTLs linked with homoeologue expression bias and variation in important productivity traits. Crucially for our work, they identified a set of genes whose expression exhibited negative correlation with its homoeologue across the panel. A subset of accessions possessed lowly expressed alleles in one of the homoeologues and the presence of the lowly expressed alleles was linked to various important productivity traits. This set contains 59 genes to which we have added <italic>ELF3-D1</italic>. While <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> didn’t fall into the set of very negatively correlated 59 genes, it was used as case example due to its agronomic significance. Also, it still did show a negative correlation with its B homoeologue, with this expression bias associated with agronomic traits. This set of 60 genes is hereafter referred to as genes showing lack of expression correlation.</p><p id="P19">Firstly, to identify potential introgressed regions within these accessions, we mapped the enrichment capture paired-end DNA reads to Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0 and for each 1Mbp genomic window, calculated the mapping coverage deviation between each line and the median for that window across the accessions. Windows with a coverage deviation value significantly below 1 in an accession were labelled as possessing an introgression or deletion. The genes showing lack of expression correlation identified by He et al. (2022) are enriched in genomic windows identified introgressed or deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), with 78.2% of these genes in a genomic window identified as introgressed or deleted in 30 or more accessions. This compares to the rest of the genes in the genome, of which only 12.3% are found in a genomic window identified as introgressed or deleted in 30 or more accessions.</p><p id="P20">To explore the impact of the pantranscriptome reference on estimated expression, we pseudoaligned the leaf RNA-Seq data from the 198 wheat accessions to both Chinese Spring and to the pantranscriptome reference. Kallisto was used for aligning to Chinese Spring instead of STAR for consistency with (He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022). 42/60 (70%) of genes showing lack of expression correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3c</xref>) have, in 25 or more accessions, an estimated expression less than half when mapping to Chinese Spring compared to when mapping to the pantranscriptome reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). These are likely introgressed genes whose expression is underestimated when using Chinese Spring as the reference. 7/60 (11.7%) of the genes have, in 25 or more accessions, an estimated expression more than double when mapping to Chinese Spring compared to when mapping to the pantranscriptome reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">While this shows that using Chinese Spring as the reference leads to underestimation of many of these genes, it is important to look at the impact of this on the calculated correlation between homoeologues that led to them being classified as genes of interest by He et al. (2022). We found that the SCC score between homoeologues from this set was - 0.0990 when using the Chinese Spring reference and 0.407 using the pantranscriptome reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16; 95% confidence interval ranges from -0.603 to - 0.410). Even though this SCC value remains lower than the mean SCC (∼0.8) reported for the entire set of homoeologues (He et al., 2022), it indicates that the usage of pantranscriptome as reference increases expression correlation estimates between homoeologues compared to single reference estimates.</p><p id="P22">Several regions of coverage deviation overlap precisely with characterised introgressions from cultivars in the wheat pangenome. One such introgression is at the end of chr1D (484,302,410bp-495,453,186bp, based on RefSeq v1.0 coordinates), present unbroken in 53/198 (26.8%) accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) and shared with cultivars Jagger and Cadenza from the wheat pangenome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). We looked at this introgression as its size is invariable between accessions. Additionally, this region was highlighted in He et al. (2022) as it contains 6 of the genes showing lack of expression correlation, including <italic>ELF3-D1</italic>, which was used as a case example due to its role in heading date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. (He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022) suggest this is a terminal deletion; however, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], identified that the terminal region, including <italic>ELF3-D1</italic>, is introgressed in Cadenza and Jagger, deriving from either <italic>Triticum timopheevii</italic> or <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic>, based on the <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> gene model possessing an intronic deletion shared with both of these species. We can exclude <italic>Ae. speltoides</italic> as the donor species as protein alignments between the Jagger introgression and <italic>Ae. speltoides</italic> proteins showed a median protein identity of just 91.6%. As <italic>T. timopheevii</italic> does not have a genome assembly available, we can’t confirm it is the donor; however, the mapping profile of <italic>T. timopheevii</italic> reads to the Jagger genome assembly suggest it is a likely match (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). As we can’t be certain about the donor species, we will hereafter refer to this introgression as the chr1D introgression.</p><p id="P23">We compared the mean expression of genes from the chr1D introgression across accessions that possess the introgression to their 1-to-1 wheat orthologue across the accessions lacking the introgression. When using the Chinese Spring reference, the introgressed genes appear to be less expressed than their wheat orthologues; however, when using the pantranscriptome reference, no significant difference in expression was found between the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Earlier, using simulated data, we demonstrated that reference bias can lead to incorrect assignment of expression balance across triads. To examine this phenomenon in real data, we examined the estimated expression across triads within the chr1D introgression that are also in the set of genes showing lack of expression correlation identified by He et al. (2022). When the RNA-Seq reads are pseudoaligned to Chinese Spring, in lines with the chr1D introgression, <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> appears to be lowly expressed and the expression of <italic>ELF3-B1</italic> appears slightly elevated compared to accessions without the chr1D introgression. However, when mapped to the pantranscriptome reference, the expression of <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> and <italic>ELF3-B1</italic> in accessions with the chr1D introgression appears very similar to that in accessions without the chr1D introgression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). The CDS sequence for <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> from the introgression shares 97% sequence identity with <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> in Chinese Spring, 97.56% identity with <italic>ELF3-A1</italic> and 97.8% identity with <italic>ELF3-B1</italic>. The high divergence of <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> from the introgression and <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> from Chinese Spring and the greater similarity between <italic>ELF3-D1</italic> from the introgression with <italic>ELF3-B1</italic> from Chinese Spring explains how most reads were unable to be assigned, yet some were incorrectly assigned to the <italic>ELF3-B1</italic>, hence the slight increase in estimated expression of <italic>ELF3-B1</italic> when using the Chinese Spring reference. The five other genes showing lack of expression correlation within the chr1D introgression also showed reduced homoeologue imbalance using the pantranscriptome reference and expression level in line with accessions without the chr1D introgression, in which the triad does not contain an introgressed D homoeologue. Four of these genes also showed a slight decrease in estimated expression in the B homoeologue when mapping to the pantranscriptome reference, supporting the idea that false mapping from the introgressed gene to its homoeologue will be driving false negative correlation scores in addition to artificially low expression of the introgressed homoeologue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">In the emerging era of plant pangenomics, chromosome-level assemblies are being generated for an increasing number of cultivars/accessions, which will facilitate a shift away from reference genome-centric methods. Here we have demonstrated the importance of utilising these resources effectively for RNA-Seq analyses in wheat to reduce reference bias.</p><sec id="S7"><title>RNA-Seq reference bias in wheat</title><p id="P26">Quantification of gene expression from RNA-Seq reads in wheat is very accurate when the matching reference genome for the sample is available. However, cross-mapping RNA-Seq reads leads to detectable levels of reference bias. This was seen both at the individual gene level and also when assigning triads to categories of homoeologue expression balance. A major cause of this bias appears to be introgressions of diverged haplotypes of genes from wheat’s wild and domesticated relatives. In some cases, references bias within introgressions could be severe enough to have a strong impact on downstream analyses and conclusion drawn based on these analyses. This analysis was conducted on wheat but other species with substantial introgressed content and/or polyploid genomes may suffer from the same problem. Similar analyses on other species may thus provide value for their respective communities.</p><p id="P27">Kallisto performed better for self-mapping but when cross-mapping, STAR was better able to deal with divergence between genes, although was far from resolving the issue of reference bias. Similar limitations of alignment-free methods have been previously discussed; for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] demonstrated that kallisto performs poorly for lowly expressed genes and for RNA reads with biological variation compared to the reference.</p><p id="P28">A future exploration of the impact of reference bias on differential expression calls in wheat will be useful. Reference bias may have little impact on differential expression between conditions or across tissues within a single genotype, as, even if incorrectly quantified, the ratio of estimated expression between conditions/tissues should remain very similar regardless of reference. However, this needs to be assessed formally. If interested in homoeologue expression balance, however, unequal divergence of homoeologues relative to the reference will lead to incorrect findings. Reference bias also makes complex patterns more difficult to discern. For example, in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], we demonstrated how the rhythmicity of <italic>ELF3-1D</italic> and <italic>SIG3-1D</italic> in a Cadenza timecourse RNA-Seq dataset was difficult to ascertain as the reads mapped so poorly to Chinese Spring. However, when using adding in the introgression to the reference, the reads mapped more correctly, and the rhythmicity could be accurately assessed.</p><p id="P29">Matching a sample to a more appropriate reference genome will become increasingly possible as genome assemblies for more wheat accessions become available. However, analyses involving two or more accessions require a common reference genome to which the RNA-Seq reads can be aligned. In this situation, or when the appropriate genome assembly is not available for within-accession analyses, it is important to exercise caution and check whether introgressed genes might be impacting conclusions drawn. In the long-term, it is important to work towards overcoming this issue of introgression-induced reference bias by implementing novel methodology.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Using a pantranscriptome reference to reduce reference bias</title><p id="P30">Previous work has shown the benefit of using enhanced references or individualised references as targets for RNA-Seq mapping. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] constructed an enhanced reference genome for human by including alternative allele segments at known polymorphic loci. Other publications have reported mapping to individualised genomes/transcriptomes by updating the reference with SNPs, INDELs and/or splice sites for each individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Working with a multi-parent mouse population, Munger et al., 2014, found that mapping to individualised genomes increased the accuracy of eQTL assignment from 88.2% to 98.3% and corrected false-positive linkage signals. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] constructed a pan-human consensus genome by calculating the consensus allele for each variant; this significantly improved the accuracy of RNA-Seq mapping when compared to the reference genome.</p><p id="P31">Our approach follows in this vein. However, individualised genomes or consensus genomes are not suitable for wheat as the degree of divergence introduced by introgressions prohibits the accurate genotyping necessary for creating said genomes. Instead, we built a pantranscriptome reference, that includes alternative transcripts from other wheat cultivars in the Chinese Spring reference transcriptome. The low resource requirements of kallisto regardless of reference size enables a highly scalable approach as more genome and transcriptome data are generated, while still running in a fraction of the time that alignment-based tools take to align to one reference genome.</p><p id="P32">The pantranscriptome reference corrects almost all expression values underestimated for genes belonging to an introgression present in the assembled pangenome cultivars and in a 1-to-1 relationship with a Chinese Spring gene. However, this approach does currently have limitations. The pantranscriptome reference will not currently contain all introgressions present across wheat accessions. As more genomes and/or transcriptomes are sequenced, transcripts can be added to the pantranscriptome reference to broaden the scope of genetic variation covered. This may lead to a saturation point at which most of the commonly segregating variation is captured within the reference and it can be considered complete for most use cases. This approach also only addresses errors caused by divergent genes and not those caused by copy number variation. Developing a way to overcome this limitation may prove very useful but is challenging because it requires resolving complex orthologue and paralogue relationships, and it is unclear how novel genes and genes with varying copy number between cultivars should be represented in the transcriptome reference.</p><p id="P33">Different solutions entirely to the problem of RNA-Seq reference bias in wheat may emerge as being superior. For example, the field of graph genomes is developing rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], including methods to align RNA-Seq reads to a graph genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, graphs for genomes as large and as complex as wheat are yet to be created successfully. It is also a much heavier-weight solution compared to the pantranscriptome pseudoalignment approach. At the very least, our approach provides a temporary way to improve the accuracy of RNA-Seq alignment, particularly for those genes comprising the core genome. With further development and the incorporation of new data, it may evolve into an alternative, more lightweight approach to emerging graph-based methods.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Examining reference bias in experimentally-generated RNA-Seq data</title><p id="P34">Using the valuable dataset generated by He et al. (2022), we were able to show that reference bias is present in experimentally-generated datasets as well as simulated datasets. The diverse nature of the wheat accessions sequenced may have made this work particularly prone to the effects of reference bias; after all, we demonstrated that divergent regions, likely introgressions, are abundant across the accessions. However, the ubiquity of introgressions is not exclusive to this set of accessions as introgressions are common across most wheat germplasm, including Elite cultivars. Indeed, wheat accessions containing diverse introgressions are very important in wheat research as it may be the source of beneficial variation for breeders, not to mention sources of insight into the evolution of wheat genomes.</p><p id="P35">The homoeologous sets of genes showing lack of expression correlation identified in He et al. (2022) were enriched in genomic regions identified as introgressed or deleted in many of the accessions with 78.2% falling in such regions. We also showed that most of these genes had much higher expression when using the pantranscriptome reference instead of the Chinese Spring reference. Using the pantranscriptome reference also increased the SCC scores calculated between homoeologue pairs. These findings may alter the interpretation of why these genes are associated with productivity traits. While some of these triads may still exhibit genuine dysregulation of homoeologues and homoeologue dosage effects, it is likely that, for at least some of these genes, variation in the gene sequence itself is underlying this trait variation, rather than alteration of expression dosage between homoeologues. This also has implications for the evolutionary and selection mechanisms implicated in controlling these traits.</p><p id="P36">To more precisely examine how the quantification of introgressed genes changes with the reference used, we focused on genes in the chr1D introgression due to its presence in around a quarter of the accessions and constant size across accessions possessing it. We showed that when using Chinese Spring as the reference, it appears as though introgressed genes are less expressed than the wheat orthologues they replaced. However, when using the pantranscriptome reference, which contains the introgressed gene models as the pangenome cultivar Jagger also contains this introgression, there is no significant difference between the expression of these genes. Correcting the quantification of these genes also altered the estimated expression balance across triads in which the D homoeologue is introgressed by raising the estimated expression of the D homoeologue. This has implications for any RNA-Seq studies using wheat accessions containing introgressions, and also more specifically for studies looking at the expression of introgressed genes and what mechanisms underlie the phenotype they confer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Read simulation, alignment, and quantification</title><p id="P37">Reads were simulated from the longest transcript from each HC gene in Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0 (with RefSeq v1.1 annotation) and the nine pseudomolecule genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] if the transcript &gt;= 500bp.
