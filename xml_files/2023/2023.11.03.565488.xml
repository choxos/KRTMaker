Prokaryotic SMC Wadjet (JET) complexes limit the spread of circular plasmids through DNA cleavage; yet the mechanisms for target recognition are unresolved. We show that artificial DNA circularization renders linear DNA susceptible to JET cleavage. Unlike free DNA, JET cleaves immobilized plasmid DNA at a specific site, the plasmid-anchoring point, showing that the anchor hinders DNA extrusion but not DNA cleavage implying that residual unextruded DNA is cleaved. Structures of plasmid-bound JetABC reveal two presumably stalled SMC motor units that are drastically rearranged from the resting state, together entrapping a U-shaped DNA segment, which is further converted to kinked V-shaped cleavage substrate by JetD nuclease binding. Our findings uncover mechanical bending of residual unextruded DNA as principle for non-self DNA recognition and molecular signature for plasmid cleavage. We elucidate key elements of SMC loop extrusion including motor directionality and the structure of a DNA-holding state.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SMC complexes</kwd><kwd>bacterial immunity</kwd><kwd>defense system</kwd><kwd>DNA loop extrusion</kwd><kwd>Wadjet</kwd><kwd>JetABCD</kwd><kwd>MksBEFG</kwd><kwd>MukBEF</kwd><kwd>Toprim</kwd><kwd>plasmid restriction</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>MRN</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">SMC complexes represent ATP-powered DNA motors that fold DNA segments of megabase size through loop extrusion. They play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including chromosome segregation during cell division (condensin and cohesin in eukaryotes, Smc-ScpAB, MukBEF, and MksBEF in prokaryotes), the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and recombination (cohesin and Smc5/6 in eukaryotes) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. More recently, emerging evidence suggests that SMC-based complexes are also involved in cellular defence against invasive or selfish genetic elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In prokaryotes, the JET complex (short for Wadjet, JetABCD) is a sequence-independent anti-plasmid nuclease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, while the human Smc5/6 complex functions as a viral restriction factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the role of loop extrusion in DNA immune sensing remains unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The process of DNA loop extrusion by the eukaryotic SMC complexes has been observed directly by single-molecule experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. For bacterial Smc-ScpAB complexes, loop extrusion has been inferred from and characterized through chromosome conformation capture-type experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Yet, the molecular mechanism and structural basis of SMC loop extrusion remain enigmatic and subject to debate, resulting in a range of proposed models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The determination of structures of SMC motors bound to physiological DNA substrates represents a crucial goal but also a significant challenge.</p><p id="P3">The multi-subunit SMC complexes are comprised of an SMC protein dimer (JetC in JET), a kleisin subunit (JetA), and accessory KITE (JetB) or HAWK proteins. SMC proteins feature a long coiled coil “arm” that harbors a “hinge” dimerization domain at one end and an ATP binding cassette “head” domain at the other. Connecting the two SMC proteins, the kleisin subunit forms the distinctive elongated tripartite ring structure that enables stable chromosome binding through DNA entrapment. Upon ATP binding/sandwiching, the head domains engage with each other, disrupting the alignment of SMC arms and facilitating DNA clamping. This process likely involves the capture of a looped DNA segment between the SMC arms by exposing a head-DNA binding surface. The kleisin-associated KITE or HAWK subunits contribute to DNA clamping/segment capture by associating with both DNA and the SMC proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. ATP hydrolysis is thought to reset the complex into a “DNA holding” configuration where the heads are juxtaposed and the arms are closed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This pentameric assembly likely constitutes the minimal unit for DNA translocation, here referred to as the “motor unit” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Certain SMC complexes form stable dimers (i.e. dimers of the pentameric motor unit) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In case of the JET complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), dimerization is facilitated by homotypic interactions between amino-terminal kleisin JetA sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The JetD subunit is exclusive to the JET family of SMC complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. JetD encompasses rigidly connected amino-terminal arm and CAP domains (denoted as “aCAP”), as well as a flexibly connected carboxy-terminal Toprim domain. This configuration bears similarities to a subunit of an archaeal type II DNA topoisomerase (topoisomerase VI) and the meiotic recombination initiator Spo11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. JetD serves the nucleolytic function of the JET complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, JetD remains inactive in isolation; likely DNA restriction necessitates the alleviation of JetD autoinhibition by JetABC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">JET systems exhibit a specific capacity to restrict smaller (&lt;80-100 kb) circular DNA molecules through DNA cleavage, independently of DNA sequence and helical topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This requires ATP, functional JetC ATPase, and JetD nuclease, giving rise to linear products with some variability in the nature of the DNA ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The precise mechanism underlying plasmid restriction by the JET complex remains elusive. It is plausible that the JetABC motors employ a DNA extrusion reaction to discern DNA topology and size <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This raises the intriguing question of how the activation of the JetD executor might be coupled to any JetABC DNA extrusion activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the way the JET DNA motor (or any SMC DNA motor) might navigate DNA-bound proteins, referred to as “roadblocks”, is unclear. Single-molecule experiments have suggested that SMC complexes possess the capability to bypass substantial roadblocks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, challenging the notion that DNA entrapment maintain SMC complexes stably associated with DNA and translocating in a directional manner.</p><p id="P5">Here, we explore the molecular and structural mechanisms governing DNA recognition and cleavage by a type I <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JET nuclease complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We show that circular DNA substrates with a single large roadblock prompt the JET nuclease to cleave in proximity to the anchoring point. Conversely, substrates with two large roadblocks impede cleavage, collectively indicating that JET is unable to bypass larger roadblocks and underscoring the necessity for extruding most of the plasmid DNA, albeit not all, prior to initiating cleavage. Through cryo-EM analyses, we unveil the structures of both JetABC and nuclease-defective JetABCD bound to plasmid DNA. These structures reveal configurations of the JET nuclease that are competent for cleavage, featuring an alternative SMC dimer arrangement and a tightly bound DNA U turn. These characteristics appear to arise from DNA motor stalling on the diminishing section of the plasmid DNA. A JetD dimer binds to JetABC-bent DNA and introduces a kink prior to DNA cleavage. In summary, our findings strongly support a model in which JET motors actively survey DNA molecules through loop extrusion to selectively target and restrict smaller circular plasmids.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>JET cleavage of linear DNA upon artificial circularization</title><p id="P6">Linear DNA molecules exhibit resistance to cleavage by JET <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We wondered whether the JET nuclease detects the absence of DNA ends in circular DNA or senses the continuity of its DNA double helix. We asked whether linear DNA becomes susceptible to cleavage when its DNA ends are masked or when they are artificially linked together to form pseudo-circular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We employed the binding of streptavidin tetramers to biotin-labeled DNA molecules, which were generated by PCR using 5’ biotinylated oligonucleotide primers. A related approach has recently shown that the endonuclease Rad50/Mre11 (MR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>) recognizes DNA ends even in instances where they are masked, but not when they are linked together to create pseudo-circular DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Incubation of double biotin-labelled DNA molecules with streptavidin generated a mixture of DNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). Most species originating from double-biotin DNA exhibited resistance to RecBCD due to double end masking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). However, only a singular species exhibited resistance to the MR nuclease, which corresponded to monomeric pseudo-circular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Remarkably, while JET nuclease was incapable of cleaving linear DNA even when both ends were concealed, it efficiently cleaved the pseudo-circular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) at largely random positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). This unequivocally demonstrates that the JET nuclease senses the circular nature of DNA rather than the mere absence of free DNA ends. Species that evaded MR were targets of JET action, and conversely, species that resisted JET were sensitive to MR. Accordingly, dual treatment with MR and JET led to the transformation of all DNA species into short DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These outcomes strongly suggest that the JET nuclease surveys the target DNA to ascertain DNA (pseudo-) circularity prior to triggering DNA cleavage. Conversely, connecting the two DNA ends at a larger distance (via binding to a large polystyrene bead) did not render DNA susceptible to JET cleavage, despite becoming protected from MR-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This implies that a continuous DNA translocation track is required for recognition by the JET nuclease.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>JET cleavage at the DNA anchoring sites of large roadblocks</title><p id="P7">The above results indicate that JET activity is robust even when the double-stranded DNA contains structural perturbations (in the form of streptavidin-biotin junctions), as long as DNA retains its (pseudo-) circular nature. Similar outcomes were observed for circular DNA substrates harboring interruptions in the form of a 10 nt single-stranded DNA flap or a 68 nt single-stranded DNA gap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D-E</xref>). We wondered whether larger obstacles on DNA would hinder DNA cleavage by representing impassable barriers for plasmid DNA extrusion. Our initial approach involved utilizing streptavidin-biotin linkage to tether plasmid DNA to large spherical polystyrene beads (dynabeads; 2.8 μm in diameter). We observed minimal effects on DNA cleavage (and mild effects on cleavage site distribution) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A-D</xref>), potentially indicating that JET was able to bypass even substantial roadblocks as recently suggested by single-molecule imaging work on other SMC complexes (that also employed non-covalent DNA-bead attachments) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, it is conceivable that the slight effects observed here, as well as in the single-molecule work, arose from transient leakage of DNA from the beads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Indeed, we observed low but noticeable release of biotin-DNA from the beads during the experiments, which was strongly influenced by the biotin moiety’s position and DNA’s shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To firmly rule out this possibility, we established a more rigorous approach that exploits SNAP-tag technology to establish an uninterrupted covalent link between dynabeads and DNA (modified with SNAP-ligand benzylguanine, BG using a gap-filling approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A</xref> and S4A-C, see Methods). We found that a large fraction of DNA circles was cleaved by JET nuclease, even when covalently linked to dynabeads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This observation confirms that the presence of a large roadblock does not necessarily halt DNA cleavage by JET. Notably, subsequent treatment with the single-cutting restriction enzyme ScaI resulted in distinct bands instead of a smear, indicating JET cleavage occurred at specific positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The position of DNA cleavage corresponded with the position of the SNAP-bead anchor indicating that it occurred at or in very close proximity to the roadblock anchor. Unlike the outcomes from the biotin-streptavidin experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>), no DNA smearing was observed in this case, strongly suggesting that all cleavage by JET happened near the anchor point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, when utilizing a smaller roadblock, SNAP-tag not chemically tethered to dynabeads, a pattern of random DNA cleavage was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>). This contrast implies that the JET nuclease can efficiently navigate through smaller (∼10 nm range) DNA roadblocks that remain continuously attached to DNA but not when the roadblocks are significantly larger (within the micrometer range). If large roadblocks indeed block DNA extrusion but not DNA cleavage, then complete extrusion cannot be a prerequisite for DNA cleavage, suggesting that cleavage occurs on a (residual) unextruded segment of the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Consistent with this notion, we observed a marked reduction in the cleavage of plasmids harboring two SNAP ligands for bead anchoring, even when subjected to extended periods of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E</xref>). We note that a pool of DNA remained susceptible to cleavage even at earlier reaction times, possibly emerging from DNA with only a single covalent link to dynabeads owing to incomplete (SNAP or epoxy) coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E</xref>). A likely interpretation is that a double roadblock prevents JetABCD motor units from converging on the plasmid DNA, thus impeding DNA cleavage. In the same vein, we found that catenated DNA circles, generated through site-specific recombinationfrom a precursor plasmid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, were efficiently cleaved by JET nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this case, the complete extrusion of a given DNA circle is expected to be inhibited by the presence of the interlinking DNA molecule. We propose that the interlinked DNA (just like the anchor for a single bead roadblock) is accommodated together with the unextruded DNA in a cleavage-proficient JET structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cryo-EM structure of plasmid-bound JetABC</title><p id="P10">To visualize how the DNA motor units may converge on plasmid DNA, we performed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Initially, we excluded the nuclease subunit JetD and incubated JetABC with plasmid DNA (pDonor, 1.8 kb) for 10 minutes at room temperature in the presence of ATP prior to grid freezing. This is expected to provide sufficient time for DNA sensing by JET and its priming for cleavage (given that JetABC concentration, rather than JetD, is rate-limiting for cleavage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>). This approach yielded a structure of the dimeric core of plasmid-borne JetABC, with an overall resolution of 4.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, Methods). As with the previously reported “resting state” structure (lacking DNA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, certain segments, namely the more distal regions of the JetC arms and the hinge, were not resolved in our map, likely due to inherent flexibility (attempts at local refinement were not successful, see Methods). The resulting map revealed a novel JetABC dimer geometry that is strikingly distinct from the resting state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, as well as from the MukBEF complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This altered geometry originates from a distinct configuration of the JetA kleisin dimer, which we discuss further below using a higher-resolution structure and a corresponding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6-8</xref>). Remarkably, we find that both DNA motor units engage with a tightly bent U-shaped DNA molecule with a ∼60 bp DNA half circle at its center. This looping is apparently not resulting from DNA binding to a curved surface, but rather emerges from external mechanical constraints imposed upon the DNA double helix by the adjacent JetABC dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). How the constraints are generated is not immediately clear, but DNA pulling by JET DNA motor activity seems like the most plausible scenario.</p><p id="P11">Each motor unit entraps the plasmid DNA molecule in the JetA kleisin compartment. The JetB KITE dimer engages with DNA in a manner analogous to the DNA clamping state seen in MukBEF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, the DNA does not traverse between the SMC arms as is the case in the DNA clamping/DNA segment capture state, revealing a “DNA holding” SMC configuration as previously inferred from cysteine cross-linking experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). We note that in a structural model (described further below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6-7</xref>) several positively charged residues of JetB are close to the DNA phosphodiester backbone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9A</xref>), mutation of which abolished plasmid restriction activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9C</xref>), suggesting that they are important for DNA sensing or processing. The structure represents a “post-hydrolysis” configuration as previously reported for the resting state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8C</xref>). In this configuration, the ADP-bound heads are juxtaposed yet not engaged, while the arms are closed. This configuration implies that the SMC compartment is devoid of DNA, altogether providing strong evidence for genuine topological DNA entrapment. Stable DNA entrapment offers a plausible explanation for the observed difficulty in bypassing large roadblocks.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cryo-EM analysis of nuclease-defective JetABCD* on extruded plasmid DNA</title><p id="P12">The DNA visible in the JetABC-DNA structure corresponds to either a small DNA loop captured during initial DNA loading before loop extrusion, or to the final stages of loop extrusion, representing the diminished unextruded segment of plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To discriminate between these scenarios and to ascertain whether this novel JetABC motor arrangement is indeed primed for plasmid DNA cleavage, we also imaged JetABC in presence of a cleavage-deficient mutant of JetD (E248A, hereafter denoted JetD*) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We obtained a 3D reconstruction of a plasmid-borne JetABCD* complex at 4.35 Å after performing 3D variability analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, see Methods). While the architecture of the plasmid-bound JetABC dimer core and its DNA association remained virtually unchanged, the DNA connecting the motor units now exhibited a close association with a JetD* dimer and an altered shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The previously continuously bent U-shaped DNA configuration is now transformed into a kinked V-shaped conformation. The structure likely represents a “cleavage-competent” state of the JET nuclease (further discussed below). We further improved the resolution of a JetABCD* core structure to 4.2 Å by enforcing C2 symmetry during non-uniform refinement with a mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6, Table S1</xref>, see Methods).

We then built a model of the plasmid-bound JetABCD* core from this map using a published structure of the resting state (PDB:8AS8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>) and structure predictions as starting material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Transition from resting to cleavage-competent state</title><p id="P13">Comparing the model depicting the plasmid-borne, cleavage-competent JetABCD* structure with that of the JetABC resting state reveals multiple similarities and striking differences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A-B</xref>). The JetC dimers adopt analogous conformations with heads juxtaposed and arms closed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8C</xref>). Likewise, the JetB dimer remains essentially unchanged, albeit shifted from the side of the JetC heads in the resting state towards their tops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A-B</xref>). However, the way the kleisin JetA dimer brings together the two JetC motor units is clearly altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8D-J</xref>). The alterations originate from the folding and interactions of the amino-terminal sequences of kleisin JetA (“JetA-N”): changing both its dimerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8D-G</xref>) as well as its association with the JetC head-proximal arm, known as the “neck” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8H-I</xref>). JetA-N harbors an amino-terminal winged-helix domain (“nWHD”) followed by a helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A-B,D</xref>). Together these domains form a compact dimer in the resting state that connects the two motor units into a V-shaped geometry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the cleavage-competent state, the JetA-N dimer is more open resulting in an almost I-shaped motor unit configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A-B</xref>). While the nWHD dimer mostly retains its shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8F</xref>), the helical bundles dissociate and reposition in the cleavage-competent state (moving from the top to the sides of the nWHD dimer; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8D-E</xref>). The repositioned helical bundle associates with the JetC neck (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8I</xref>). Concomitantly, a segment of the helical bundle—unstructured in the resting state—folds into an alpha helix that also contacts the JetC arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8G</xref>). Both the substantial DNA bending and the unfolding of the compact JetA-N dimer are potentially energetically unfavorable changes. The driving force behind these structural changes is not immediately apparent. To explore whether the cleavage-competent state emerges upon contact with plasmid DNA also in solution, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> site-specific cross-linking of JetA and JetC proteins using engineered cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10</xref>). Based on the available structural models, we selected a residue in JetA, namely E229, that is in close proximity to JetC(L267) in the resting state (Cα-Cα 5.9 Å), and to JetC(E840) in the cleavage-competent state (Cα-Cα 7.8 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Substitution of these residues to cysteines did not markedly impede JetABCD activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10A</xref>). Furthermore, the JetA subunit was fused with an amino-terminal HaloTag to allow quantification of cross-linked products by in-gel fluorescence detection. Employing bismaleimidoethane (BMOE) cross-linking, we readily detected the JetA-JetC contact in the resting state using the designated reporter cysteines. In contrast, cross-linking involving reporter cysteines for the contact in the cleavage-competent state yielded minimal signal, if any, unless ATP and plasmid DNA were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with the cryo-EM analysis, addition of JetD was neither required nor detrimental for the detection of the JetA-JetC contact in the cleavage-competent state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10B</xref>). We conclude that this contact is indeed formed during JetABCD action on plasmid DNA. Whether the contact is formed exclusively in the cleavage-competent state or also during initial stages of DNA sensing and extrusion remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The DNA-bound JetD nuclease dimer in the cleavage-competent state</title><p id="P14">Finally, we also produced a local map of the JetD* dimer in the JetABCD*-DNA complex with improved interpretability—mainly within the Toprim domain—by local refinement after local 3D variability analysis around JetD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11A-B</xref>; Methods). We observed two main types of architectures, one with a JetD dimer symmetrically attaching to the two κ-JetC proteins—that we describe in more detail here—and another less-well-resolved asymmetric JetD map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>). In the two architectures (for symmetric JetD see EMDB:18208 and EMDB:18209), JetABC does not noticeably deviate from the core structure described above (EMDB:18201). We then placed two aCAP domains and a Toprim domain dimer (obtained from AlphaFold2) by rigid-body fitting into the symmetric map of plasmid-bound JetABCD* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also incorporated segments of DNA by flexible fitting into the map. While DNA is surrounded by proteins, some parts are exposed to the surface and may thus accommodate the roadblock anchors described above. The central cavity may harbor another DNA double helix, explaining cleavage of catenated DNA circles.</p><p id="P15">We observe that the JetD* dimer encompasses the entire length of the DNA connecting the motor units and establishes attachment through the aCAP domains to the larynx of the JetC heads (specifically, to the two κ-JetC heads which are bound to carboxy-terminal sequences of kleisin JetA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This interaction is facilitated by a hydrophobic pocket present in JetD aCAP, where the JetC residue F919 inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9B</xref>). Notably, perturbing this interface by mutating JetC(F919) or key residues in the JetD pocket to glutamate renders the JET nuclease inactive <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9C</xref>), supporting its physiological relevance. Both the aCAP and Toprim domains align with the DNA, wrapping around the DNA double helix. In contrast to the continuous bending of DNA observed in the absence of JetD*, the DNA in this configuration exhibits a pronounced kink at its midpoint. This kink closely corresponds to where the putative nuclease active site is located on the Toprim domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A, C</xref>). The DNA double helix putatively undergoes this deformation through the combined efforts exerted by the JetABC DNA motors and the JetD nuclease. The deformation may prepare DNA for fitting into the nuclease active site prior to cleavage. The putative active site residues on the pair of Toprim domains are positioned at a small distance apart (JetD E248 Cα-Cα ∼30 Å), likely explaining the short overhangs (1-4 bs) observed in JET-cleaved DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The variability in overhang lengths is possibly explained by DNA flexibility.</p><p id="P16">We next superposed the JetD* dimer model derived from fitting into the locally refined map (described above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) with available structures of JetD obtained for two other organisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The geometry of the JetD* dimer in plasmid-borne JetABCD* was markedly different from the “closed”, likely autoinhibited, form of an isolated JetD dimer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the published “open” conformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the aCAP domains are also angled slightly more openly, when compared to the cleavage-competent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is either attributed to different protein origin or, more interestingly, the interaction of the JetD dimer with the JetABC motor units in the cleavage-competent state, possibly with the JetD dimer angle being determined by the aCAP domain binding to the JetC larynx. The geometry of the JetD dimer may also be influenced by the mechanically deformed DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A, C-D</xref>). Notably, rather than passing on top of the Toprim domains and between the aCAP domains of a JetD dimer as proposed before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, our structure illustrates that the DNA aligns itself along the V-shaped JetD dimer with the extended shared surface stabilizing the contact. This alignment requires considerable DNA deformations including DNA kinking at the mid-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A, C</xref>) likely facilitating DNA access to active site residues. It remains to be elucidated whether such DNA deformations are also needed for accessing the active site of other JET nucleases and the more distantly related Toprim-containing enzymes topoisomerase VI and Spo11 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11C</xref>).

Intriguingly, in Top2, a yeast DNA topoisomerase II (which harbor a Toprim but no arm domain), the G-segment DNA is also strongly bent with the help of Toprim domains (although DNA curvature relative to the Toprim domains is distinct from the one observed in JET) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. DNA bending could thus be a more general feature for the control of Toprim-containing enzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Here we discuss insights into how a bacterial defense system recognizes and neutralizes potentially harmful DNA elements using loop extrusion, a process that otherwise contributes to chromosome folding. We present a model for plasmid restriction by JET nuclease, based on the near-complete extrusion of plasmid DNA followed by bending and cleavage of the residual unextruded segment (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, we reveal the directionality of SMC translocation, the structure of a DNA holding state as well as blockage of translocation by DNA roadblocks putatively through topological DNA entrapment. Collectively, these findings provide robust support for a DNA segment capture-type model for SMC translocation and loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S10"><title>The JET nuclease</title><p id="P18">The JET system directly recognizes the (pseudo-) circular nature of DNA, probably achieved through the coordinated translocation of oppositely oriented DNA motors along the DNA double helix. This translocation process ultimately extrudes nearly all the DNA culminating in the motors stalling against each other and triggering a transition into the cleavage-competent state. JetD recognizes this cleavage-competent state through direct interactions with the I-shaped motor dimer and with the unextruded U-shaped DNA. The reliance on these two features, both exclusively generated by motor stalling, serves to ensure nuclease activation exclusively on plasmid DNA. However, we note that we cannot rule out that the I-shaped motor dimer might already form earlier, during DNA extrusion, and therefore potentially even on non-plasmid DNA. In principle, encounters between two JET complexes loaded onto a given DNA molecule could also lead to the stalling of motor units. However, such encounters are unlikely to generate the same DNA-motor geometry and are thus expected to fail to activate the JET nuclease function.</p><p id="P19">MukBEF also forms an I-shaped motor dimer with the helical bundle of kleisin associating with the SMC subunit as here observed for the cleavage-competent state of JET <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8J</xref>). However, in MukBEF, the kleisin helical bundle together with the nWHD display a compact fold, bearing resemblance to the JET resting state. This implies that the dimer geometry of MukBEF contains features of both the JET resting and cleavage-competent states. A configuration with yet another variation in kleisin-SMC contacts (denoted as unclamped state) has been observed in JET when bound to a short linear DNA molecule <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This DNA is localized on ATP-engaged heads, but the KITE dimer is not clamping the DNA and the kleisin N-gate seems open—disconnected from the SMC neck (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>). The role of such an alternative configuration of JET remains to be determined; it could be related to DNA loading or translocation.</p><p id="P20">When a motor unit encounters a roadblock, it stalls until the second motor unit arrives at the same roadblock position to generate a cleavage-competent state together with the roadblock anchor. The cleavage of the diminishing unextruded segment of plasmid DNA provides an explanation for the observation that roadblocks hinder DNA extrusion yet do not obstruct DNA cleavage, as long as the roadblock can be accommodated within the cleavage-competent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This feature may be biologically relevant for example in helping to prevent the emergence of JET resistance by plasmids featuring DNA roadblocks.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>SMC DNA loop extrusion</title><p id="P21">We present here the structures of the JET nuclease bound to plasmid DNA, unveiling a number of striking features, one of which is the trapped, tight DNA loop connecting two motor units. Although it cannot be ruled out that this configuration is a byproduct of an intricate DNA loading reaction, the fact that the JetD nuclease subunit binds directly to this DNA loop supports the notion that these structures represent a “cleavage-competent” state. This state in all likelihood emerges following circular DNA scanning facilitated by loop extrusion. Accordingly, we can infer the direction of SMC DNA translocation from this structure directly. Taking the JetB KITE dimer as a reference point, we deduce that the DNA emerging from the JetB nWHD dimer corresponds to the “upstream” unextruded DNA, while the cWHD dimer connects to the “DNA loop” representing most of plasmid DNA that has already been extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This corresponds to what has been proposed for the segment capture model and also for the related hold-and-feed model when translating from the KITE to the HAWK subunits which support DNA clamping in cohesin and condensin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Curiously, this conclusion contradicts what has been inferred from a cohesin-CTCF-DNA co-structure established on a short linear DNA substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Given the substantial and likely variably-sized SMC translocation steps, it is somewhat unexpected that the DNA U turn linking the two SMC motor units—presumably generated through loop extrusion— exhibits a rather consistent length which enables particle averaging. Our presumption is that the size of this U turn is influenced more by mechanical constraints that accumulate during the final stages of loop extrusion, rather than the sum of all translocation steps culminating in extrusion completion. The question of whether SMC complexes can bypass large DNA roadblocks is disputed. Some SMC complexes (such as cohesin and condensin) have been reported to exhibit relatively efficient bypass of non-covalently anchored roadblocks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> in vitro. A more physiological roadblock, a dense Rap1-DNA array, however efficiently blocks condensin translocation with blockage putatively supporting telomere functions <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In our findings, the most plausible explanation is that the JET SMC motor units either cannot bypass or can only inefficiently bypass roadblocks much larger than the dimensions of the complexes themselves. This observation fits well with the cryo-EM structures that indicate topological DNA entrapment, as continuous DNA entrapment would hinder the bypass of large roadblocks. It remains to be fully ascertained whether other SMC complexes, especially those featuring HAWK and larger kleisin subunits, have evolved improved abilities to navigate such roadblocks. However, evidence for stalling of KITE- as well as HAWK-SMC complexes by roadblocks on chromosomes has been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Transient DNA leakage with non-covalent anchoring thus remains a valid alternative explanation for the roadblock bypass observed in single-molecule imaging experiments at this juncture.</p><p id="P23">Whether the dimer geometry observed in the cleavage-competent state is compatible with DNA extrusion is doubtful as the motors are stacked against each other in this state. The DNA clamped by one motor unit were to clash with the other motor unit. Conceivably, an alternative dimer geometry (MukBEF-like or resting state-like) may promote loop extrusion and convert into the cleavage-competent state only upon completion of DNA extrusion. Regardless of dimer geometry, the cleavage-competent state provides key insights into the DNA-motor configuration for a given motor unit. As detailed earlier, the cleavage-competent state harbors motor units with DNA clamped by the JetB KITE dimer onto their SMC heads, held within the kleisin compartment, but not within the SMC compartment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is distinct from the ATP-bound DNA clamping state—such as observed in the case of MukBEF. Instead, it corresponds to a post-hydrolysis ADP-bound DNA holding state as proposed in the DNA segment capture (and related) model(s) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> while none of the other models for SMC loop extrusion postulated such a state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The notion that ADP persists on SMC heads following ATP hydrolysis until the transition into the DNA holding state is complete, as implied by our structures, moreover, provides a rationale for the avoidance of premature ATP engagement. This safeguard mechanism may help prevent unproductive cycles of ATP hydrolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. If so, a dedicated mechanism for timely release of ADP may exist. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ADP accumulating at artificially high levels (through hydrolysis of ATP) during grid preparation led to the ADP occupancy. It will be fascinating to further explore the interconversion of the different states through hydrolysis and binding of ATP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Protein purification</title><sec id="S14"><title>Purification and reconstitution of JetABCD</title><p id="P24">JetABC was purified similarly as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, with the following modifications.

We note that a population of BG-DNA circles migrated slower than closed covalent circles (ccc) — likely, these open covalent circles (occ) were generated by DNA strand breakage during prolonged treatment for DNA anchoring. We adopted a gap-filling approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> to generate covalently closed 2.9 kb DNA circles containing one or two SNAP ligands, benzylguanine groups (BG), attached to selected thymidine nucleobases (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A, S4A</xref>).
