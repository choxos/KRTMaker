Basigin exists as part of one or more multiprotein complexes, most notably through interaction with the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. However, the potential requirement for basigin association with MCT1 and the wider role of basigin host membrane context and lateral protein associations during merozoite invasion has not been established.

Merozoite invasion of reticulocytes is unaffected by disruption of basigin MCT1 interaction and by removal or replacement of the basigin transmembrane helix. Therefore, presentation of the basigin ectodomain at the red blood cell surface, independent of its native association with MCT1 or other interactions mediated by the transmembrane domain, is sufficient to facilitate merozoite invasion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Malaria, a disease caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites imposes an enormous global economic and health burden with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Every year it is responsible for more than 200 million clinical cases accounting for over half a million deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Central to the pathogenesis of this disease is the intricate process of red blood cell invasion by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> merozoites, the invasive blood stage form of the parasite. Successful invasion is preceded by a series of specific molecular interactions between proteins on the surface of the parasite and host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Chief amongst these in respect of invasion by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the species responsible for the vast majority of fatalities, is basigin, host receptor for the merozoite surface protein PfRh5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Interaction between these proteins sets the stage for a cascade of events that lead to successful invasion including the release of rhoptry organelles and the establishment of a parasitophorous vacuole. Yet, whilst the strain transcendent essentiality of PfRh5-basigin binding for successful invasion is now well established, the precise role of this interaction in enabling invasion remains controversial and the bases for the selection of basigin as a key actor for such an essential process are unclear.</p><p id="P4">Basigin, a transmembrane glycoprotein present at around 3000 copies at the red blood cell surface, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] exists not in isolation within the membrane but as part of one or more multiprotein complexes, the most established of which is with the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].

This suggested a possible role for the lateral interactions of basigin in its native heteromeric complex within the red cell membrane during invasion.

Basigin-deficient reticulocytes exhibited no reduction in expression of other key host surface proteins known to play a role in malaria parasite invasion but were shown to be completely refractory to invasion by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, thus validating the substantial evidence base regarding the essentiality of this host receptor for successful merozoite invasion.</p><p id="P18">Basigin exists within many cell types, including human erythrocytes, as part of a heteromeric complex with the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. To assess the impact of basigin KO on expression of MCT1, basigin KO BEL-A cells were differentiated to reticulocytes and MCT1 surface expression assessed using a novel receptor-binding domain (RBD) derived from the HC2/HERV-T human endogenous retrovirus envelope protein sequence (GenBank access AB266802), which specifically binds exofacial determinants of MCT1 (METAFORA-biosystems). HERV-T envelope has been previously shown to use SLC16A1/MCT1 as receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) demonstrates that in the absence of basigin, reticulocyte surface expression of MCT1 is reduced by more than 80%. Thus, expression within a cellular context of these two proteins is tightly coupled, raising questions as to the contribution of the loss of MCT1 and/or the MCT1-basigin interaction for abrogated invasion in the absence of basigin. To assess the presence of basigin within the membrane in the absence of MCT1, BEL-A cells were nucleofected with Cas9:gRNA RNPs targeting the <italic>SLC16A1/MCT1</italic> gene, allowing for the generation of MCT1 KO reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These reticulocytes however were found to exhibit a 75% decrease in surface expression of BSG, illustrating co-dependence of these proteins on one another for expression. Since shRNA-mediated knockdown of BSG by just 50% reduces invasive susceptibility of reticulocytes by 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], invasion studies of these cells would not be informative about the putative involvement of MCT1 or its interaction with basigin in invasion.</p><p id="P19">Therefore, in order to explore the importance of the native membrane context of basigin for successful invasion and to uncouple presentation of the basigin extracellular domain (binding site for PfRh5) from the native interaction of this protein with MCT1, a more elaborate strategy was required. Hybrid versions of basigin were designed; specifically, two constructs in which the transmembrane (TM) helix that mediates interaction with MCT1, and the cytoplasmic domain of basigin were I) substituted with the TM and cytoplasmic tail of another erythroid membrane protein – Glycophorin C (BSG-GPC), or II) removed entirely by replacement with a GPI anchor sequence (BSG-GPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The rationale for these designs lies in the fact that neither should be capable of binding MCT1, yet each alters the native membrane context of the exposed basigin ectodomain differently. To validate the ability of these constructs to present at the cell surface, lentiviral transduction of the previously established clonal BSG KO BEL-A cell line was performed, cell surface presentation of the basigin extracellular domain of the BSG-GPC and BSG-GPI rescues was confirmed and FACS used to select a population with BSG surface expression matched to that of unedited expanding BEL-A controls. BSG KO cells lentivirally rescued with WT basigin (WT-BSG) served as a control.</p><p id="P20">BSG-GPI and BSG-GPC hybrid proteins were successfully trafficked to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The presence of Hoechst-negative enucleated reticulocytes within the differentiated population demonstrated that BEL-A cells expressing these hybrids in the absence of endogenous basigin can undergo terminal erythroid differentiation and generate reticulocytes that present the basigin extracellular domain at close to normal levels. Of note, expression of basigin on reticulocytes, which are larger than erythrocytes, is higher than that on erythrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and as such is not limiting for invasion in any of the reticulocyte subsets generated despite minor variations. Assessment of MCT1 expression in the corresponding populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>) demonstrates that the MCT1 loss accompanying BSG KO is only rescued by reintroduction of WT-BSG, as BSG-GPI and BSG-GPC hybrids both lack the TM domain crucial for this interaction. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to generate novel host cellular invasion models in which presentation of the PfRh5 binding site is uniquely uncoupled from the native interaction of BSG with MCT1. To assess the effect of expression of these hybrids has on expression and presentation of other host membrane proteins of interest, labelling with a panel of antibodies was performed and expression quantified by flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref> demonstrates no significant alterations in expression of band 3, GPA, GPC in reticulocytes rescued with BSG-GPI compared to unedited or WT rescue cells. Of these proteins, only GPC appears reduced in reticulocytes expressing BSG-GPC (suggestive of competition for membrane incorporation between endogenous GPC and the hybrid possessing its TM helix and cytoplasmic tail confirming altered membrane context compared to WT-BSG). CD55 is mildly reduced in BSG-GPI and GPC expressing cells whilst CD44 presentation as assessed with the BRIC222 antibody, (but not KZ1 or BRIC235 – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) appears to be variably increased in BSG KO reticulocytes, restored to endogenous presentation by WT BSG rescue but not by BSG-GPI or GPC, further indicative of disrupted native context of the hybrid proteins.</p><p id="P21">Having established the viability of reticulocytes with basigin uncoupled from MCT1, we sought to assess the susceptibility of these cells to invasion by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Generation of modified <italic>in vitro</italic> derived reticulocytes can be achieved through differentiation of both immortalised erythroblast cell lines such as BEL-A or of primary CD34<sup>+</sup> haematopoietic stem cells. Each system has its own respective advantages and disadvantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Efficiency of differentiation and high rates of enucleation of primary cells currently facilitate a much greater cost effective yield of leukofiltered reticulocytes, providing more material for experimentation, although this is countered by variable transduction efficiency and reduced control over rescue overexpression levels. Contrastingly BEL-A cells are readily transducible, can be FACS sorted to isolate populations entirely expressing a construct of interest at uniform levels and cryopreserved for repeated differentiation yet exhibit disrupted terminal differentiation with reduced enucleation efficiency compared to primary cells, limiting the yield of purifiable reticulocytes that can be obtained, particularly where cells may have been heavily manipulated.</p><p id="P22">We began by exploiting the primary cell system. CD34<sup>+</sup> cells 2 days post isolation were nucleofected with Crispr Cas9:gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes in order to knockout endogenous basigin. On Day 5, cells were sorted using FACS to isolate the knockout population and transduced on Day 6 with lentiviral particles for exogenous rescue with WT-BSG, BSG-GPI or BSG-GPC constructs. A proportion of cells were untransduced and served to enable validation that the basal population progresses to complete BSG KO reticulocytes that are refractory to invasion. Mixed erythroblast populations (comprising successfully transduced and untransduced cells) are expanded and differentiated according to previously established protocols and leukofiltered to remove nucleated cells and pyrenocytes on Day 21. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> provides a summary of the experimental procedure. Malaria parasite invasion assays were set up in 96 well plates by addition of MACS magnet purified 3D7 schizonts to 1x10<sup>6</sup> total reticulocytes per assay at a variety of starting parasitemias in triplicate. For each condition a heparin treated negative control was included to enable correction for spurious background events within the invasion gate upon assessment of invasion by flow cytometry. Assays post invasion were stained with SYBR green, fixed and labelled with anti-basigin antibody HIM6 and APC conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody labelling allows for discrimination of BSG KO reticulocytes from those expressing BSG constructs of interest. Successfully invaded reticulocytes within the respective populations can then be assessed within the same well based upon SYBR Green positivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> provides an illustrative example of this strategy from an experiment conducted with no FACS purification of BSG KO. Note robust levels of invasion in cells positive for BSG that is absent within the KO population, the accompanying heparin control enables identification and subtraction of background within the invasion gate. Application of this strategy allows for robust assessment of invasion even in the context of variable and/or low lentiviral transduction efficiencies inherent to work with primary erythroid cells.</p><p id="P23">
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> illustrates that using assays set up at a range of parasitemias invasion is absent or negligible within the BSG KO gated population yet robustly detected within populations in which the basigin extracellular domain is presented at the cell surface. Final parasitemias increase but do not plateau with increasing initial schizont levels excluding saturation effects that may mask impaired invasion phenotypes. Pooled invasion data from multiple experiments normalised to levels in reticulocytes derived from non-targeting control gRNA nucleofected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells demonstrates robust and similar levels of invasion in BSG KO cells rescued with WT-BSG, BSG-GPI and BSG-GPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the transmembrane domain of basigin and by extension its interaction with MCT1 is not required for successful mediation of merozoite invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with presentation of the extracellular domain alone within the membrane sufficient for invasion.</p><p id="P24">To provide confirmation of this striking result in another cell system, BEL-A cell lines expressing the WT, BSG-GPI and BSG-GPC constructs with 100% positivity were differentiated alongside BSG KO and unedited BEL-A controls. Despite low levels of enucleation within these lines we were able to scale up cultures to isolate leukofiltered BEL-A derived reticulocytes from each of the lines for limited invasion assays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> summarises data obtained by flow cytometry that recapitulates the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> with robust and similar levels of invasion observed in BSG KO cells rescued with BSG WT, BSG GPI or BSG GPC. Giemsa stained cytospin images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> provide visual confirmation of rings in each rescue population, whilst no rings are observed in BSG KO reticulocytes. These data confirm the conclusion that the transmembrane domain of basigin that mediates interaction with MCT1 is dispensable for invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Determination of the essentiality of the molecular interaction between merozoite PfRh5 and red blood cell basigin has proved to be a seminal discovery in malaria invasion research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], spawning an array of cell biological, structural and therapeutic development studies centred around this crucial interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Collective knowledge regarding the timing of this interaction within the coordinated invasion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the existence of PfRh5 as part of a larger multiprotein complex of parasite proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] and information regarding location of epitopes of invasion inhibitory antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] has burgeoned. However the mechanism by which PfRh5-basigin interaction facilitates downstream continuation of invasion remains a subject of controversy, whilst the evolutionary bases that presided to the specific targeting of basigin by the parasite for such an essential process and the downstream consequences within and beneath the host red blood cell membrane remain unclear.</p><p id="P26">Recently Jamwal et al. reported that recombinant PfRh5 binds to complexes of basigin-MCT1 and basigin-PMCA1/4 with greater affinity than basigin ectodomain alone and further demonstrated that growth inhibitory antibodies that do not disrupt binding of PfRh5 to recombinant basigin ectodomain do inhibit binding to basigin within either of these heteromeric complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These data suggest that the interaction between MCT1 (or other proteins that interact laterally via the transmembrane helix) and basigin may be important for invasion within a cellular context.</p><p id="P27">Whilst our data are not contradictory to these findings, indeed it seems likely that basigin presented within its native complex would interact preferentially compared to in isolation, we show that neither this increased affinity for PfRh5 binding, nor the presence of lateral interactions that require the transmembrane domain of basigin are functionally required for its facilitation of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> invasion.</p><p id="P28">The precise bases and molecular consequences of PfRh5 binding to basigin are a subject of debate. Blockade of this interaction by antibodies to either PfRh5 or basigin causes an arrest of invasion immediately prior to the formation of the tight junction, also preventing the appearance of the transient pulse of calcium at the merozoite erythrocyte interface that triggers or accompanies this process. PfRh5 exists as part of a pentameric PCRCR complex with other parasite proteins CyRPA, PfRipr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and more recently PfPTRAMP and PfCSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] shown to interact. PfRh5 and PfRipr have been proposed to insert into the membrane following conformational changes upon binding to basigin, facilitating formation of a pore that enables invading merozoites to inject components into the erythrocyte cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However the viability of this mechanism has recently been challenged, with locking disulphide bonds introduced into PfRh5 that prevent such necessary conformational changes failing to inhibit invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P29">Consequences of basigin binding by the merozoite within the host cell are also a subject of tremendous interest, phosphorylation of red blood cell cytoskeletal components in response to merozoite engagement with host receptors is widely believed to play a contributory role in facilitating tight junction formation and or parasite internalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Aniweh et al reported calcium influx and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components induced by basigin binding of recombinant PfRh5 alone, emphasising the importance of basigin dimerization for calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The means by which basigin facilitates intracellular signalling that modifies the host cell remains unclear, with our previous work demonstrating the dispensability of the cytoplasmic domain of basigin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] for invasion extended here to encompass the transmembrane domain, lateral interactions thereof and specific host membrane context.</p><p id="P30">The data we present here demonstrates the requirement solely for basigin ectodomain presentation within the host red blood cell membrane for its facilitation of successful invasion. These data challenge the hypothesis that the context and established TM mediated pre-existing host cell interactions of basigin are crucial to its role in invasion. One explanation for these data therefore is that basigin acts solely as a binding site and activation signal for parasite mediated processes such as rhoptry release that can occur irrespective of the local context of the PfRh5 engagement. However it should also be noted that irrespective of means and context of anchorage within the plasma membrane, the basigin ectodomain itself will still have the capacity and potential to interact with ectodomains of itself and other proteins on the host and merozoite surfaces. Interestingly, Yong et al recently reported the existence of a complex of basigin with CD44 and the beta adrenergic receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] (although neither protein was detected in detergent extracts of erythrocytes from a different study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]). They hypothesise that a pre-existing basigin associated complex containing CD44 and other host proteins undergoes increased protein assembly and recruitment that subsequently activates cAMP signalling via the beta adrenergic receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. One alternative host oriented hypothesis therefore is that host protein complexes assemble actively at the site of invasion (irrespective of pre-existing membrane context) around the basigin ectodomain-PfRh5 interaction in a process that is mediated or modulated by alterations to the extracellular domain alone upon engagement, or the result of proximal recruitment of host proteins that interface with the basigin extracellular domain by engagement of other host and parasite proteins by EBA and Rh proteins at this site. Identification of these recruited proteins and their role in invasion and merozoite internalisation will be important in future studies.</p><p id="P31">In summary, we present here data that establishes the dispensability of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of basigin together with interactions of this protein mediated via these regions for mediation of merozoite invasion by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Interaction of basigin with MCT1 is not a pre-requisite for invasion, whilst reduced levels of MCT1 does not inhibit invasion of reticulocytes. Invasion is able to proceed unimpeded by membrane relocalisation of basigin through substitution of its transmembrane helix or through alteration of membrane anchorage from transmembrane helix to GPI anchor, suggesting an intriguingly basal host membrane context independent role in facilitation of invasion. These data contribute to our evolving understanding of events, requirements and downstream consequences of the PfRh5-basigin interaction that is essential for invasion. Future investigation of induced assembly of host-parasite protein complexes at the site of tight junction formation and ongoing research to define conformational rearrangements and the nature of induced signalling that arises in both host and parasite will inform broad and varied efforts to disrupt this crucial step in invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190227-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d255aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Andrew Herman from the University of Bristol Faculty of Biomedical Sciences Flow Cytometry Facility for cell sorting support and Vincent Petit (Metafora Biosystems) for kind provision of HC2.RBD.rFC.
