This phenomenon occurs in all domains of life and is exacerbated at polyproline motifs. Such stalling can be eased by elongation factor P (EFP) in bacteria. We discovered a potential connection between horizontally transferred EFP variants and genomic signs of EFP dysfunction. Horizontal transfer of the <italic>efp</italic> gene has occurred several times throughout the bacterial tree of life, and such transfer events are associated with the loss of otherwise highly conserved polyproline motifs. In this study, we pinpoint cases of horizontal EFP transfer among a diverse set of bacterial genomes and examine the consequences of these events on genome evolution in the phyla Thermotogota and Planctomycetes. In these phyla, horizontal EFP transfer is not only associated with the loss of conserved polyproline motifs, but also with the loss of entire polyproline motif containing proteins, whose expression is likely dependent on EFP. In particular, three proteases (Lon, ClpC, and FtsH) and three tRNA synthetases (ValS, IleS1, IleS2) appear highly sensitive to EFP transfer. The conserved polyproline motifs within these proteins all reside within, or in close proximity to ATP binding regions, some of which have been shown to be crucial to their function. Our work shows that the horizontal transfer of EFP has left genomic traces that persist to this day. It also implies that the process of ‘domesticating’ a horizontally transferred <italic>efp</italic> gene can perturb the overall function of EFP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proline-rich regions are important for protein function. They are over-represented in protein domains that are important for interactions with other proteins and with nucleic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. They are also associated with high cellular complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, proline-rich regions cause a problem during mRNA translation that is universal to all domains of life. Due to its uniquely rigid structure, proline is the slowest amino acid to be incorporated into proteins during translation. Proline causes translating ribosomes to pause or “stall” on mRNA, which slows down protein synthesis. This problem is compounded when an amino acid sequence contains multiple adjacent prolines (polyproline motifs, ≥2P). The severity of this stalling is determined by several factors. They include the identity of the surrounding amino acids (particularly the two amino acids before and one after the prolines e.g., XXPPX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, the translation initiation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and the position of the polyproline motif within a protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Polyproline motifs can have a dramatic impact on translational rate in highly expressed proteins, where they cause ribosomal queuing, wreak havoc on translational efficiency, and unlink the coupling between transcription and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To mitigate this problem, species in all three domains of life encode proteins that minimize the impact of ribosomal stalling at polyproline motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In bacteria, this protein is called elongation factor P (EFP). EFP binds to the ribosome between the peptidyl-tRNA binding and tRNA-exiting sites. From here, EFP interacts with the peptidyl-transferase center, accelerating the formation of proline-proline bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In many species, EFP must be post-translationally modified to function properly. While several different types of modification are known, these modifications all reside at the same position within EFP—on an amino acid positioned at the tip of a conserved loop region in domain I of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In most Gammaproteobacteria, the modified amino acid is a lysine (L34). It is modified by β-(<italic>R</italic>)-lysylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> in chemical reactions that are catalyzed by the proteins EpmA and EpmB, as well as by a hydroxylation step of unknown function carried out by EpmC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In some Firmicutes the modified amino acid is also a lysine (L32, equivalent to L34 in <italic>E. coli</italic>), but it is modified by the attachment of a 5-aminopentanol group carried out in several steps by the proteins YmfI, YnbB, and GsaB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In Betaproteobacteria, the modified amino acid is an arginine (R32, equivalent to L34 in <italic>E. coli</italic>), which is rhamnosylated by the protein EarP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Some bacteria, such as the Actinobacteria, use an unmodified EFP that can be identified by the presence of a conserved proline loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Lastly, some species contain an EFP paralog of unknown function known as YeiP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. YeiP is most often found in genomes encoding an EpmAB type EFP and is common among Gammaproteobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Because EFP is important for efficient translation, loss of the <italic>efp</italic> gene can have dramatic phenotypic consequences. They include reduced growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, loss of motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, loss of virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, reduced antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and in the case of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, death. Many of these phenotypes are caused by the under-expression of proteins containing polyproline motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In some proteins, altering such motifs to reduce the severity of ribosomal stalling can ease EFP loss-of-function phenotypes. For example, swarming motility can be restored to <italic>Bacillus subtilis efp</italic> mutants by modifying a ribosomal stalling polyproline motif in the flagellar C-ring component FliY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In other proteins, polyproline motifs cannot be altered without substantial negative impacts on protein function. Examples include a polyproline motif within the glucose importer component EII<sup>Glc</sup> in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, which cannot be altered without inactivating the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and a proline triplet in valine tRNA synthetase that is crucial for efficient and accurate tRNA charging in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In other words, while some proteins can be modified to reduce their reliance on EFP, other proteins seem unavoidably dependent on EFP for normal expression.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we investigate a genomic mystery. In the course of a previous analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we discovered that some species within the bacterial phylum Planctomycetota do not encode a proline triplet in valine tRNA synthase that is crucial to the enzyme’s function and was thought to be universally conserved across all domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Where the valine tRNA synthases of all other known forms of life encode a ‘PPP’ motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, these species instead encode ‘PLP’. Pulling at this thread, we found that loss of this motif coincides with the appearance of a horizontally transferred EFP variant in these Planctomycete genomes. Relevant in this regard is that modifying polyproline motifs to reduce the severity of the ribosomal stall they cause during protein synthesis can restore normal expression in EFP deletion mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Taken together, these observations suggest a connection between the horizontal transfer of EFP and global EFP dysfunction. EFP transfer has been observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but never studied in detail. For example, the EarP type EFP is believed to have originated within the Betaproteobacteria, but is also sporadically present within some Gammaproteobacteria, Thermotogota, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, and Fusobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In the underlying transfer events, the proteins that post-translationally modify EFP are generally co-transferred together with the EFP-coding gene in a single operon. This supports previous speculations that different EFP ‘types’ co-evolve with their modification systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we examined how frequently horizontal transfer of EFP occurs within bacterial genomes. We find that horizontally transferred EFP does not often coexist with the ‘native’ ortholog, that is, the variant of EFP that existed within the recipient genome before the transfer. We also examined in more detail the genomes of species within two phyla that encode horizontally transferred EFP, the Planctomycetota and Thermotogota. In these species, horizontal transfer of EFP is consistently linked with loss of otherwise highly conserved polyproline motifs, such as the nearly universally conserved proline triplet in valine tRNA synthetase. Our work shows that the horizontal transfer of EFP is associated with proteome remodeling to alter polyproline motifs. In some species, this leads to the loss of entire proteins that appear dependent on EFP for proper expression. We show that these HGT events leave behind telltale genomic signatures and may have affected these species’ evolution, as many of these conserved polyproline motifs appear to be important for ATP binding and hydrolysis. These patterns of genome evolution suggest that horizontally transferred EFP and its modification systems interact with ‘native’ EFP with deleterious consequences.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genome dataset overview</title><p id="P7">Although EFP is an important protein in bacteria, as evidenced by its near universal conservation and the severe, detrimental effects of its loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, it has been studied in only a handful of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The phylogenetic diversity of these species is limited mostly to the Gammaproteobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In order to investigate horizontal transfer of EFP from a wider diversity of species than purely experimental methods allow, we first needed to characterize these proteins. Presently, there are five known types of EFP. They differ in the amino acid residing at the tip of the conserved loop region in domain I, and the post-translational modifications of this amino acid. As detailed further in the Methods section, these comprise the lysine-EpmAB type EFP, the lysine-YmfI type, the unmodified lysine proline loop type, the arginine-EarP type, and the unmodified arginine-YeiP type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We bioinformatically annotated all known EFPs within a dataset of more than 3000 bacterial species, comprising 35 phyla spread across 382 families. This procedure still left us with many ‘unknown’ EFP types—almost half of the genomes in our dataset (1606 genomes) encode an unknown type EFP.</p><p id="P8">To further characterize these unknown type EFP, we sorted all EFP sequences (3638 proteins) into ‘families’ using similarity network-based sequence homology clustering (<italic>Methods</italic>). In this process, we assigned protein sequences with ≥49% sequence identity and ≥80% sequence length alignment to the same family. We chose this threshold as a compromise between sorting known modification types into unique families and minimizing the number of families with few members due to poor representation of some clades in the dataset. This procedure left us with 15 EFP families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The largest of these families contained 2979 EFPs, including all lysine type EFPs—the EpmAB type (13.9%), the YmfI type (6%), the unmodified proline loop type (15.2%), and many EFPs of unknown modification (51%). The next largest families contained 299 EFPs primarily of the arginine-EarP modification type, and 265 EFPs of the arginine-YeiP type. The remaining families were unique to discrete phylogenetic clades. For example, we found the phyla Spirochaetota, Acidobacteriota, and Verrucomicrobiota to have particularly rich EFP diversity, encoding seven unique EFP types between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1 &amp; <italic>Supplemental results</italic></xref>).</p><p id="P9">We found that the vast majority of bacterial genomes (2910 genomes, or 88.8% of our dataset) contain just one copy of the <italic>efp</italic> gene. A small proportion encoded two copies of the <italic>efp</italic> gene (362 genomes, or 11.0%), and just one species encoded three copies (the Gammaproteobacteria <italic>Marinobacterium rhizophilum</italic>). When two <italic>efp</italic> genes are present in a genome they usually encode different amino acids at the tip of the conserved loop region (314 or 86.5% of genomes with two EFPs encode EFPs with different amino acids at this position). Furthermore, the two EFPs are usually quite distinct in sequence composition (In 301 or 83% of genomes encoding two EFPs these EFPs fall into different sequence cluster families). In those species encoding two <italic>efp</italic> genes, the identity of the pair is usually a lysine-EpmAB type EFP and an arginine-YeiP type EFP (256 genomes, or 70.7% of genomes encoding two EFP). This pairing is most common among the Gammaproteobacteria (245 genomes), but also occurs in the phyla Desulfobacterota (5 genomes) and Planctomycetota (6 genomes). We found several other combinations of EFP pairs, which are detailed in the <italic>Supplemental results</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Horizontal transfer of EFP</title><p id="P10">As a first pass at identifying horizontally transferred EFPs, we superimposed the bioinformatically inferred EFP modification types onto the phylogenetic tree of our bacterial species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Because EFP modification types evolved in distinct phylogenetic clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, this procedure can help identify EFP types that appear outside of the cluster where they originated. For example, the EarP rhamnose modification system originated within the Betaproteobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Any instances of the EarP type EFP residing outside this phylogenetic group therefore indicate HGT of <italic>efp</italic>. Using this approach, we identified 10 likely instances of EFP transfer, which are shown individually in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. They include 6 transfers of EpmAB type EFPs and 4 transfers of EarP type EFP. We see no evidence of transfer of the aminopentanol YmfI EFP type, perhaps because three separate genes are required for the synthesis and attachment of this modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We decided to investigate two instances of EFP transfer within the phyla Thermotogota and Planctomycetota further. We chose the Planctomycetota specifically because, as mentioned in the Introduction, they do not encode an otherwise universally conserved proline triplet in Valine tRNA synthetase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Otherwise, these phyla had sufficiently many genomes (&gt;20) to reliably identify HGT, and also comprise free-living bacteria unlikely to be undergoing genome degradation, a confounding phenomenon that could complicate our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EFP transfer leads to loss of conserved polyproline motifs in the phylum Thermotogota</title><p id="P11">The phylum Thermotogota consists of mostly thermophilic, fermentative anaerobes with a distinctive “toga”-shaped outer cell envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Members of the phylum are commonly found within hydrothermal vents, petroleum reservoirs, and hot springs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Our phylogenetic tree indicates that an <italic>efp</italic> gene may have been horizontally transferred into this phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, while the majority of Thermotogota species encode an EFP type of unknown modification which falls within the most common EFP family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Family 1, Figure S1</xref>), two species from the Petrotogaceae family (<italic>Geotoga petraeae</italic> and <italic>Oceanotoga teriensis</italic>) encode the EarP type EFP and its modification system EarP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1, Family 3</xref>). We used gene synteny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and gene-species tree phylogenetic distance comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>) to verify the exogenous origin of this EarP type EFP. These analyses showed that the gene synteny of the EarP type EFP is inconsistent with other members of the phylum (the conserved placement of EFP within an operon together with the genes <italic>pepP, yloU</italic>, and <italic>nusB</italic> is lost, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and that this EFP type is more sequence divergent from other Thermotogota EFPs than their shared phylogeny would predict (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). For example, the EarP type EFP of <italic>O. teriensis</italic> is more similar in sequence composition to EFPs from the Gammaproteobacteria family Burkholderiaceae (49.7% aa identity to <italic>P. granuli</italic> EFP<italic>)</italic> than to EFPs within its same phylogenetic family (39.5% aa identity to intrafamily member <italic>M. hydrogenitolerans</italic> EFP). Unexpectedly, these analyses uncovered a second case of EFP transfer within the same family. That is, species within the genera Petrotoga and Defluviitoga have also lost the conserved gene synteny present in all other Thermotogota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and as opposed to the preceding example, encode EFPs that are more similar in sequence to EFP from the Thermotogaceae family than their shared phylogeny would predict (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). For example, the EFP of <italic>Defluviitoga tunisiensis</italic> shares 75.1% aa identity to the EFP of <italic>Thermotoga</italic> sp. RQ7 of the Thermotogaceae family, yet this EFP shares only 61.1% aa identity to the EFP of intrafamily member <italic>M. hydrogenitolerans</italic>. It appears that species within the genera Petrotoga and Defluviitoga now encode an unknown type EFP that originated from a different family within Thermotogota, the Thermotogaceae.</p><p id="P12">To investigate the effect of horizontal transfer of EFP on polyproline motifs in the Thermotogota, we first clustered all proteins within the phylum into families based on amino acid sequence identity (<italic>Methods</italic>), then identified conserved polyproline motifs and polyproline motif-containing proteins within these families. We next performed phylogenetic ANOVAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> to test the null hypothesis that horizontal transfer of EFP is not associated with a loss of conserved polyproline motifs, or of the proteins which contain them, while taking the phylogeny of our species into consideration. We found that horizontal transfer of EFP is significantly associated with the loss of 11 polyproline motifs or polyproline motif-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Loss of entire polyproline motif-containing proteins may indicate that the polyproline motif is crucial to their function, as is the case for the polyproline motif in the glucose importer component EII<sup>Glc</sup> of <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Next, we examined the polyproline motif-containing proteins that were significantly associated with horizontal transfer of EFP within members of the Petrotogaceae. These proteins were functionally diverse. They include three ATP-dependent proteases (Lon, ClpC, FtsH), two enzymes related to metabolism (the tryptophan synthase beta chain TrpB, the trehalose synthase TreT), four poorly characterized proteins (the putative ATPase YcaJ, a cation efflux protein annotated as FAM556 by our amino acid sequence clustering (<italic>Methods</italic>), an uncharacterized B12-binding /radical SAM-type protein FAM304, an uncharacterized metalloprotease FAM437), and two proteins of varied functions (type IV pilus assembly protein PilC, RNA polymerase primary sigma factor RpoD). Many of the polyproline motifs these proteins contain are highly conserved among our 3000 bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For example, the polyproline motifs located within the bacterial proteases are generally highly conserved among bacteria—85.5%, 97.9%, and 98.8% of FtsH, ClpC, and Lon proteins contain polyproline motifs at these exact positions, respectively. This strong conservation implies that these polyproline motifs are important to their resident proteins and that these proteins likely depend on EFP for expression.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>EFP transfer leads to loss of conserved polyproline motifs in the phylum Planctomycetota</title><p id="P14">Next, we examined the suspected horizontal transfer of EFP and its effects on members of the phylum Planctomycetota. In the course of a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we discovered that the loss of a polyproline triplet in the protein Val tRNA synthetase, which is otherwise conserved across all three domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, coincided with a case of horizontally transferred EFP in this phylum. We wanted to find out if additional patterns of polyproline motif loss coincided with this event. The phylum Planctomycetota includes cosmopolitan species that can be found in soil, aquatic, and wastewater habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. These bacteria possess diverse cell structures and metabolism. Some species divide by budding, some have cytoplasmic compartments, some perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and many have complex life cycles featuring transitions between sessile and swimming states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our initial analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) indicated that Planctomycetota species have undergone at least three EFP transfer events. As a result, they now encode at least four distinct types of EFP, including EFP types with unknown modifications (likely the ‘native’ EFP types, which cluster into three distinct EFP families, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), EpmAB type EFP, EarP type EFP, and YeiP type EFP.</p><p id="P15">As before, we verified HGT events using gene synteny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) and phylogenetic distance comparisons between gene and species trees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). We found that members of the class Planctomycetes, including the families Planctomycetaceae, Pirellulaceae, and Thermoguttaceae, no longer encode the native EFP type present at the base of the Planctomycetes tree, and instead encode an EpmAB type EFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). This EFP type is distinct in sequence to all other types in the phylum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), and in most species is flanked by the EpmB gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). A different, EarP type EFP, is encoded by members of the genus Planctopirus, and is flanked by the EarP gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The final horizontally transferred EFP type, YeiP is encoded somewhat sporadically within the class Planctomycetes, including within the Pirellulaceae, Isosphaeraceae, and Thermoguttaceae families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with its identity as a “secondary” EFP subfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the YeiP type EFP is in all species paired with a non-YeiP type EFP.</p><p id="P16">Following the same procedure as for the phylum Thermotogota, we found that three polyproline motifs were significantly associated with horizontal transfer of EFP, but in two different subsets of the class Planctomycetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Additionally, all members of the class Planctomycetes lost the polyproline-motif containing protein isoleucine tRNA synthetase type 1, instead encoding isoleucine tRNA synthetase type 2.

Upon further examination, we discovered that each of these well-conserved polyproline motifs are located within the same PFAM domain (PF00004). This domain characterizes a diverse ATPase family associated with a broad range of cellular activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Within this domain, each polyproline motif is positioned within the ATP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Together, these observations suggest that these highly conserved polyproline motifs are important for ATP binding and hydrolysis in ATP-dependent proteases. Consequently, these proteins are prone to depend on EFP for proper expression.</p><p id="P19">The polyproline motifs within the three class I tRNA synthetases (ValS, IleS1, and IleS2) are the most strongly conserved in our wider 3000 species dataset. Specifically, 99.8% of ValS, 99.7% of IleS1, and 99.3% of IleS2 proteins have polyproline motifs in this position. Indeed, a previous study found that these polyproline motifs are invariant across all domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The ValS polyproline motif is encoded by all non-Planctomycetaceae species in our wider genome dataset, with only one exception, the Cyanobacterium <italic>Pseudanabaena sp</italic>. PCC 7367. However, all other available genomes from the Pseudanabaenaceae family encode the polyproline motif, meaning there are no additional genomes that can help validate the accuracy of this exception. Similar to the ATP-dependent proteases, the polyproline motif in ValS lies within the ATP binding region of this protein, near the His-Ile-Gly-His (“HIGH”) motif that is characteristic of this class of tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

The alteration of these highly conserved polyproline motifs, or the loss of the proteins containing them, coincides with EFP transfer in two independent phyla.

During the course of a previous analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we discovered hints of a connection between the horizontal transfer of <italic>efp</italic> and disruption of EFP activity through the loss of highly conserved polyproline motifs. In this work, we thoroughly investigate this connection, and study how EFP transfer may have affected modern-day bacterial species from a wider phylogenetic diversity than experimental methods allow. To this end, we first characterized EFP from a set of over 3000 bacterial genomes from 35 phyla. We found that horizontal transfer of the <italic>efp</italic> gene has occurred multiple times along the bacterial tree of life, with several cases of EarP type EFP and EpmAB type EFP found outside their clades of phylogenetic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We examined in more detail two phyla whose members contain horizontally transferred EFP, the Thermotogota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>) and the Planctomycetota (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3 &amp; S4</xref>) and found that EFP transfer is consistently associated with the loss of polyproline motifs and polyproline motif-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In particular, we found two groups of proteins which seem to be particularly sensitive to HGT of <italic>efp</italic>. These are the ATP dependent proteases Lon, ClpC, and FtsH, as well as the class I tRNA synthetases IleS (type 1 and 2) and ValS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We show that the position of the polyproline motifs within these proteins is highly conserved within the wider diversity of our 3000 bacterial species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). That is, 85.5-99.8% of these six proteins contain polyproline motifs in the same conserved positions. Additionally, these motifs are all within or in close proximity to ATP-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). While the polyproline motif within ValS is known to be crucial for proper ATP hydrolyzation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, the precise function of the other polyproline motifs have not been studied in detail.</p><p id="P22">Our observations suggest that genomes which encode horizontally transferred <italic>efp</italic> at one point experienced a disruption in global EFP activity. This disruption would have negatively impacted the expression of polyproline motif containing proteins, as has been shown experimentally in multiple species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To mitigate this disruption, some proteins seem to have lost highly conserved polyproline motifs, thereby severing their dependence on EFP for expression. In other proteins, like Lon protease, these highly conserved polyproline motifs may be critical to the function of the protein, leading instead to the loss of the entire protein. However, with only present-day genomes to work from, we can merely hypothesize what the cause of this disruption was. One possibility is that species within the Planctomycetota and Thermotogota first lost their ‘native’ form of EFP, which would make EFP transfer especially advantageous. While the present-day Thermotogota and Planctomycetota species which encode horizontally transferred versions of EFP no longer encode the EFP native to their phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>), it is relevant to note that we do find cases of horizontally transferred EFP coexisting with native EFP, albeit in only a small fraction of our overall dataset (8 genomes from the Desulfuromonadota, 3 genomes from the Chloroflexota, and 25 genomes from the Alphaproteobacteria). Additionally, EFP loss has not been observed in free-living organisms: EFP is universally conserved in bacteria, with the exception of a few endosymbiotic species undergoing genome degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. EFP loss can have stark consequences, as experimental EFP loss is known to be lethal in two species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and cause severe phenotypes in other tested species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Another possibility is that the transfer of an extraneous EFP and its modification system into the Thermotogota and Planctomycetota happened before any loss of native EFP. In this case, deleterious interactions between the native and horizontally transferred proteins may have perturbed the expression of EFP-dependent proteins. It is tempting to speculate that these perturbations arose from deleterious interactions between the horizontally transferred modification system and the native EFP. Different EFP types and their corresponding modification systems co-evolved, such that switching just the conserved, post-translationally modified amino acid of an EFP is not sufficient to switch its modification system<sub>14,16</sub>. For example, the function of an EarP-type EFP<sub>R32K</sub> from <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> cannot be rescued by expression of the EpmAB system from <italic>E. coli</italic>, and neither can the function of an EpmAB-type EFP<sub>K34R</sub> from <italic>E. coli</italic> be rescued by the expression of EarP from <italic>S. oneidensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, subjecting an EFP to a non-native post-translational modification can inhibit its function below that of the post-translationally unmodified state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. If a non-native modification system can modify and impair the function of the native EFP type, overall EFP function could be compromised, leading to the genome evolution patterns we observe. In support of this hypothesis, we note that the conserved positions within EFP that bear post-translational modifications in both the Thermotogota and the Planctomycetes are theoretically compatible with their horizontally transferred modification systems. That is to say, the native EFP within the Thermotogota is an arginine type EFP, and the horizontally transferred EarP modifies arginine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Likewise, the native EFP within the Planctomycetota fluctuates between a lysine and asparagine type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Family 11, Figure S1</xref>), and the horizontally transferred EpmAB system modifies lysine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Lastly, we note that our two focal phyla in which the horizontal transfer of <italic>efp</italic> occurred have very different lifestyles. The Petrotogaceae are fast-growing thermophiles with optimal growth temperatures between 45 - 60°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The Planctomycetota are mostly mesophilic and notoriously slow growing, with doubling times ranging from 6 hours to 1 month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In a previous study, we found that both slow-growing bacteria and thermophilic bacteria are enriched in polyproline motifs when compared to fast-growing mesophiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that this is because of lower selective pressures on translation speed in slow-growing organisms, which do not need to synthesize proteins rapidly, and the catalytic “boost” that thermophiles derive from high growth temperatures, which can lead to naturally higher rates of translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. If so, these two groups of organisms may be particularly well poised to endure disruptions in EFP function, which may give them sufficient time to adapt evolutionarily by altering polyproline motifs to make key proteins less EFP-dependent. Tentative support for this hypothesis comes from studies of the <italic>efp</italic> deletion mutant phenotype in <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The growth defect of these mutants is less severe when <italic>E. coli</italic> cells grow more slowly, indicating that dependence on EFP is strongest when protein expression and demand for translational efficiency is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.
