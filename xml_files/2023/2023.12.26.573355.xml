The origins of ROD likely lie with elevated uremic toxins and/or an altered hormonal profile but the cellular events responsible remain unclear. Here, we report that stalled mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in bones of a CKD-MBD mouse model, and also human CKD-MBD patients. RNA-seq analysis exposed an altered expression of genes associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial function in tibia of CKD-MBD mice. The accumulation of damaged osteocyte mitochondria and the expression of mitophagy regulators, p62/SQSTM1, ATG7 and LC3 was inconsistent with functional mitophagy, and in <italic>mito</italic>-QC reporter mice with CKD-MBD, there was a 2.3-fold increase in osteocyte mitolysosomes. Altered expression of mitophagy regulators in human CKD-MBD bones was also observed. To determine if uremic toxins were possibly responsible for these observations, indoxyl sulfate treatment of osteoblasts revealed mitochondria with distorted morphology and whose membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation were decreased, and oxygen-free radical production increased. The altered p62<bold>/</bold>SQSTM1 and LC3-II expression was consistent with impaired mitophagy machinery and the effects of indoxyl sulfate were reversible by rapamycin. In conclusion, mitolysosome accumulation from impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria may contribute to the skeletal complications, characteristic of ROD. Targeting mitochondria and the mitophagy process may therefore offer novel routes for intervention to preserve bone health in patients with ROD. Such approaches would be timely as our current armamentarium of anti-fracture medications has not been developed for, or adequately studied in, patients with severe CKD-MBD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P6"><fig id="F10" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS193136-f010"/></fig>

Through direct and indirect effects on bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts, this altered systemic milieu deregulates bone remodelling, mineral metabolism, and matrix mineralisation, leading to compromised bone formation and ectopic calcification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> The severe skeletal complications of CKD-MBD are numerous and, based on bone morphology, often classified into a wide spectrum of bone disorders generically referred to as renal osteodystrophy (ROD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Therapy often focuses on normalising defective bone remodelling, but despite this, ROD often results in bone fractures, negatively impacting life quality and the survival of renal patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">While most CKD-MBD studies have focused on the perturbation of mineral-regulating hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF23, and vitamin D,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> the complex bone-renal signalling pathways and cellular events they control during the development of ROD are unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognised that SHPT, particularly common in late-stage CKD-MBD, is associated with a net loss of bone mass despite an accelerating bone turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> This is a consequence of increased bone resorption by the osteoclast through the up-regulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and the suppression of the RANKL decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> Retention of protein-bound uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate in the circulation and organs of CKD patients can also affect bone quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Uremic toxins induce oxygen free radical production by mitochondria, and the resultant oxidative stress disrupts bone quantity and quality due to the unfavourable effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts and the mineralisation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Uremic toxins also reduce the number of osteoblast PTH receptors, and the resultant skeletal resistance to PTH is likely to explain the aberrant bone turnover rate during the early stages of CKD-MBD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">Our inadequate understanding of the cellular mechanisms implicated in the aetiology of renal bone disease, drove us to complete a series of studies aimed at providing insight into the mechanism(s) responsible.

Unexpectedly, CKD-MBD samples, which included samples collected between D5 and D35, were less heterogeneous than CTL samples (D0, D20, and D35), suggesting reduced bone cell activity. Principal component analyses (PCA) disclosed that the first two principal components (PC1 + PC2) explained 56.1% of the data variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P24">A gene-to-gene correlation network was generated with a Pearson correlation threshold (r ≥ 0.85) and a Markov clustering (MCL) inflation value of 1.6 was used to define relationships between genes.

The network included 3,455 nodes and 730,900 edges (links). Two distinct groups of nodes sharing the same correlation factor were selected for functional analysis. The top representative group (≥ 1.5-fold up-regulated, highlighted in orange) contained 411 transcripts whose expression was up-regulated in bones from CKD-MBD mice.

All other genes (highlighted in grey) identified within both groups were highly correlated and consistently down- or up-regulated across all time points (D5 to D35) of CKD-MBD mice but did not reach the 1.5-fold threshold. The smallest cluster size of the two-node algorithm was used to subdivide the network into discrete gene clusters that contained genes with similar biological functions and expression patterns over time.

There was a 2.3-fold increase in red puncta (mitolysosomes) in osteocytes situated within the cortical bone of CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a-c</xref>). The accumulation of osteocyte mitolysosomes in ROD could indicate either enhanced mitophagy activation or a blockage of downstream steps in the process of mitochondria removal. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria is more likely as this would be more harmful to bone than increased mitophagy. Interestingly, in bone of CKD-MBD mice, the dendritic processes radiating from the osteocyte cell body were reduced in number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S3</xref>). These reduced dendritic processes may impede the endoplasmic reticulum mediated removal of defective osteocyte mitochondria in ROD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Of note, increased mitolysosomes in CKD-MBD were not specific to bone as they were also observed in the renal tubules and glomeruli of CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>The expression of mitophagy regulatory proteins in osteocytes from CKD-MBD bone suggests a block in the clearance of damaged mitochondria</title><p id="P28">To identify the mechanisms leading to mitolysosome accumulation in ROD, the expression of established mitophagy regulators was analysed. The expression of PARKIN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes mitophagy by ubiquitinylation of substrates at the outer mitochondrial membrane was increased in cortical bone from CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a, b</xref>). The autophagic adaptor protein, p62 (sequestosome 1/SQSTM1) is a major LC3-II interacting protein and as a selective substrate it is normally degraded during autophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> However, no decrease in p62/SQSTM1 expression by western blotting was noted in bone from CKD-MBD mice, whereas by immunostaining the number of p62/SQSTM1 puncta/ osteocyte was increased in osteocytes of <italic>mito</italic>-QC CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4d-f</xref>). Also, the autophagy-related 7 (ATG7) protein, which increases during autophagy and drives the pivotal stages of classical degradative autophagy through the lipidation of LC3-I to LC3-II, was similarly expressed in bone from CTL and CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a, b</xref>). These latter observations are incongruous with increased mitophagy and suggest a block in the removal of damaged mitochondria via the autophagic machinery. An increase in osteocyte mitochondria number was confirmed using the mitochondrial marker TOM20, a subunit of the mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane complex, supporting the concept that mitochondria are not being cleared in ROD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a, b</xref>).

To examine this further, we treated murine primary osteoblasts with the uremic toxin, IS (0-2 mM) for 7 days, a treatment regimen that was not toxic to cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S5</xref>). Osteoblast mitochondrial ΔΨ was decreased by IS as evidenced by a reduction in mitotracker red uptake, which is dependent on ΔΨ, whereas IS treatment increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a-c</xref>). The morphology and distribution of osteoblast mitochondria were markedly affected by IS treatment. In CTL cells, the mitochondrial network appeared as long thread-like tubular structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, left panel, arrows), which contrasted with the IS-treated cells where the mitochondrial network was disintegrated and characterised by fragmented mitochondria with a swollen rounded morphology, collapsed around the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, right panel, arrowheads). Determination of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in control and IS-treated primary osteoblasts revealed that basal and maximum respiration and glycolysis capacity were decreased by IS, as was ATP production, max H<sup>+</sup> leak and non-respiratory OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a-c</xref>). These observations are in agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA-seq pathway analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>. Finally, the expression of p62<bold>/</bold>SQSTM1 was up-regulated by IS treatment in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the expression of PARKIN and autophagic marker LC3-II (generated in an ATG7-dependent manner) were downregulated by IS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Rapamycin rescues primary osteoblasts from the adverse effects of IS on mitochondrial morphology and clearance, ROS production and mitophagy</title><p id="P30">Rapamycin, a specific mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is a commonly used autophagy inducer that increases oxidative phosphorylation, decreases ROS production, and, by removing damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria it improves overall mitochondrial quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Cells (± IS; 2 mM) were treated with vehicle (control) or rapamycin (± Rapa; 75 nM) for 7 days, and the expression of mitophagy-associated proteins (PARKIN, LC3-II, and p62/SQSTM1) was determined. The reduction of PARKIN expression by IS was reversed by rapamycin, resulting in an increase in PARKIN expression in the IS + rapamycin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c, d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S6</xref>). Also, rapamycin (with or without IS) increased LC3-II expression and reversed the reduced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in IS-only treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c, d</xref>). Finally, rapamycin also partly reversed the IS-increased p62/SQSTM1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S7</xref>). We next determined whether the promotion of mitophagy by rapamycin could prevent or mitigate IS-induced mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction. The oxidative stress induced by IS was lowered by co-incubation with rapamycin. Furthermore, the ability of rapamycin to reactivate IS-suppressed mitophagy and efficiently remove damaged mitochondria resulted in the correction of the abnormal morphology and distribution of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e-f</xref>). These results imply that rapamycin was able to rescue cultured osteoblasts from the adverse effects of IS on mitochondria morphology and mitophagy removal.</p><p id="P31">To further investigate the role of LC3 in rapamycin’s ability to promote mitophagy and rescue the cells from IS challenge, we treated osteoblasts with trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a potent mitochondrial uncoupling agent that dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential and triggers mitophagy by recruiting PARKIN to damaged mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Following IS challenge, there was increased mitochondrial damage but fewer LC3 puncta cell. Rapamycin exposure enhanced LC3 recruitment to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9a, b</xref>, yellow puncta) in both control and IS-treated cells in the presence of FCCP. We hypothesise that FCCP may enhance the clearance of damaged mitochondria by triggering the expression of mitophagy signals (<italic>e.g</italic>., PARKIN) thus, recruiting rapamycin-induced LC3-II to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">It is well-established that CKD-MBD is associated with poor bone health, but many aspects of the pathophysiology remain unclear. Therefore, to obtain an improved understanding of the biological processes disrupted during the initiation and development of ROD, we completed an initial RNA-seq study on cortical bone from a rodent model of CKD-MBD. This approach identified a number of pathways and functions associated with bone metabolism/remodelling that were altered in the CKD-MBD mice. These included disordered osteoclast resorption and extracellular matrix structure and organisation, which are recognised to be involved in the aetiology of ROD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> However, altered osteoblast/osteocyte mitochondrial function has not previously been reported and warranted further study.</p><p id="P33">This is a novel observation in bone and is in keeping with previous reports in which mitochondria dysfunction has been associated with pre-CKD kidney diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Oxidative stress may be involved, but due to their many integrated functions in addition to their indispensability for cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, the precise nature of the mitochondrial insult remains obscure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Whilst the kidney is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high energy demands, mitochondria are also essential for maintaining bone homeostasis by controlling the balance between osteogenesis and bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Altered mitochondrial function, <italic>e.g</italic>., mitophagy, fusion, fission, and biogenesis, is associated with decreased bone mass, and mitophagy-focused studies have reported that irregular mitophagy via decreased PINK or PARKIN leads to impaired osteogenic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> Impaired autophagic flux noted in osteoblasts and osteocytes of ATG7 null mice may explain the observed lower bone mass, reduced remodelling, and fewer osteocyte projections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> Furthermore, accumulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in mice results in the premature onset of ageing-related phenotypes, including osteoporosis and vertebrae compression fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Corroborating clinical data is limited, but mitochondria point mutations, including the common m3234A&gt;G, are associated with decreased bone mass and strength, and severe osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> The causative insult(s) are likely to be complex, but oxidative stress stimulates osteoclast formation and inhibits osteoblast differentiation via increased sclerostin and the downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup></p><p id="P34">From the RNA-seq data of this study, we speculated that impaired mitophagy in CKD-MBD bones would lead to the retention of damaged mitochondria and could explain the decreased oxidative phosphorylation and contribute to the aetiology of ROD. However, the reduced mitophagy as implied by the RNA-seq data, is at odds with the increased PARKIN protein and mitolysosomes noted in the CKD-MBD <italic>mito</italic>-QC mice. An explanation for this apparent paradox is undoubtedly complex but may be based on the pretext that changes in gene function (protein levels) can be extrapolated from changes in transcript levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> Indeed, in the ageing murine kidney, mRNA transcript levels have been reported to be a poor proxy for protein abundance which may be a consequence of changes in translational efficiency and/or protein turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> This phenomenon is not uncommon in CKD and ageing animal studies focused on renal physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> This disconnect between transcript and protein levels was further emphasised when the expression of established mitophagy regulators in CKD-MBD bone was quantified by immunoblotting. In CKD-MBD mouse bone, increased TOM20 and the preservation of ATG7 and p62/SQSTM1 levels are inconsistent with their recognised role in the mitophagy process and are indicative of dysfunctional or blocked mitophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> While the presence of increased red mitolysosomes in the osteocytes of CKD-MBD bone implies increased mitophagy and high baseline turnover, this observation may be misleading due to slower degradation of mitolysosomes at the autophagosome stage. A compromised ability to efficiently and quickly remove damaged mitochondria as a consequence of dysfunctional mitophagy has been reported previously in a number of non-skeletal organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup></p><p id="P35">In an attempt to determine the driver for the altered mitophagy noted in our experimental ROD model, we focused on uremic toxins because of their known ability to damage mitochondria and impair autophagic flux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> The effects of IS on isolated osteoblasts were consistent with aberrant mitophagy (increased p62/SQSTM1 and decreased PARKIN and LC3-II), but the decreased PARKIN protein is at odds with what is noted in CKD-MBD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). This suggests that the effects of IS alone do not fully mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation where other serum factors altered in CKD-MBD may mitigate the actions of uremic toxins on the mitophagy process. Moreover, although mitochondrial damage was observed in IS-treated cells, there was less LC3 punctate/LC3-II within damaged mitochondria, implying reduced PARKIN to signal the autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figures 9a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a-b</xref>). However, as rapamycin reversed the effects of IS on PARKIN, LC3-II, p62/SQSTM1 and punctate LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8c-d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a-b</xref>, left panel), it raises rapamycin and other mitochondria-targeted approaches as a potential pharmacological intervention to manipulate mitochondrial function within cells and reduce CKD-related bone disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, is a drug clinically used for antifungal, immunosuppressive, and anti-tumour purposes; however, its application to augment mitophogy in the complex pathophysiology of ROD may be limited due to its harmful impact on bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup></p><p id="P36">We have speculated that the increased ROS production by mitochondria in bone cells in response to uremic toxins may underpin the altered mitophagy noted in this study.

Statement</title></caption><p>Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) remains the major skeletal complication of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). As a disease characterised by biochemical and hormone abnormalities, ROD is exacerbated by osteocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Advances in our understanding of the mitophagy pathway are vital to improving the clinical management of ROD. The dysregulation of mitophagy in murine and human CKD-MBD bone provided evidence of delayed clearance of damaged mitochondria, which was also observed in uremic toxin-treated-osteoblasts but reversible upon rapamycin treatment. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of managing ROD by restoring defective mitophagy in osteocytes.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design for RNA-seq study and time-dependent changes in body weight and serum biochemistries.</title><p>(a) 40 x 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated into 10 groups of 4 mice to the CTL group (n = 12) and sacrificed after D0, D20, and D35 or the CKD-MBD group (n = 28) and sacrificed every five days from D5 to D35. (b) Bodyweight progressively decreased in the CKD-MBD mice, which began losing weight by D5, plateauing at ~D25.

The strength of edges (line) was represented on a scale from thin and blue (weak) to thick and red (strong). It corresponded to correlations between individual measurements above the defined threshold (r ≥ 0.98). (b) The red line indicated that the first two principal components (PC1 + PC2) explain 56.1% of the variance of the data. (c) A co-expression graph of the RNA-seq data was constructed comprised of 3,455 nodes (genes) and 730,900 edges (correlations r ≥ 0.85). The graph was made up of two large and unconnected components of genes representing those whose expression was higher or lower in the CKD samples relative to controls as seen when differentially expressed genes with ≥ 1.5-fold change from D20 and D35 samples were overlaid on the network. The group highlighted in orange contains 411 transcripts whose expression was significantly up-regulated following adenine-induced CKD-MBD at D20 and D35. The group highlighted in green includes 754 transcripts consistently down-regulated following adenine-induced CKD-MBD at D20 and D35. (d) The network's nodes represent CKD-MBD correlated genes, and edges represent correlations above a defined threshold (r ≥ 0.85). Co-expressed genes form highly connected complex clusters within the graph. A gene-to-gene correlation graph was generated from all genes that were correlated (r ≥ 0.85) with differentially expressed genes from D20 and D35 (CKD vs. control). Nodes were coloured by cluster using the MCL algorithm (1.6) according to their specific biological function. The edges corresponded to the correlation between them.
