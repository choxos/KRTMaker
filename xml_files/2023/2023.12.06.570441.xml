40% of patients. Therefore, novel approaches to treat aggressive lymphomas are being intensively investigated. Several RTX-resistant (RR) cell lines have been established as surrogate models to study resistance to R-CHOP. Our study reveals that RR cells are characterized with a major downregulation of CD37, a molecule currently explored as a target for immunotherapy. Using CD20 knockout (KO) cell lines, we demonstrate for the first time that CD20 and CD37 form a complex and the presence of CD20 stabilizes CD37 in the cell membrane. Consequently, we observe a diminished cytotoxicity of anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in complement-dependent cytotoxicity in both RR and CD20 KO cells that can be partially restored upon lysosome inhibition. On the other hand, the internalization rate of anti-CD37 mAb in CD20 KO cells is increased when compared to controls, suggesting unhampered efficacy of antibody drug conjugates. Importantly, even a major downregulation in CD37 levels does not hamper the efficacy of CD37-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. In summary, we present here a novel mechanism of CD37 regulation with further implications for the use of anti-CD37 immunotherapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype, accounting for about 40% of NHL cases and is also one of the most aggressive subtypes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). For years, the first-line therapy in DLBCL has been R-CHOP – a combination of chemotherapeutics with rituximab – an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Although the treatment is mostly well-tolerated and efficient, approximately 40% of patients face relapse characterized by a very poor prognosis and the median survival following relapse not exceeding 6 months(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In the recent few years, considerable progress has been made in the registration of novel therapies used as a second-line treatment, that nowadays force the immunotherapeutic approaches like antibodies and antibody drug-conjugates directed against CD19 or CD79b molecules as well as CD19 CAR-T cell formulations - especially dedicated for primary refractory patients. Numerous clinical trials are currently underway exploring new molecular targets against aggressive lymphomas including those testing CD37-directed immunotherapies (NCT04136275, NCT04358458).</p><p id="P3">The molecular changes induced by RTX and leading to a failure of the next-line therapies have been widely studied in established B-cell lymphoma cell lines with induced resistance to RTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). These models confirmed CD20 downregulation already reported in R-CHOP – treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In this study, we have sought to thoroughly characterize the RTX-resistant cell lines to better understand their phenotype. Our analyses revealed a significant downregulation of CD37 molecule on the surface of RR cells. CD37, a tetraspanin protein with structural similarity to CD20, is expressed exclusively on hematopoietic cells and its highest levels are detected in the B-cell lineage from pre-B to mature B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Alike CD20, CD37 is absent on the surface of plasma cells, making it a suitable target for immunotherapy. In fact, numerous anti-CD37 targeting immunotherapies are currently under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Besides being a molecular target for immunotherapies, CD37 is an important player in the biology of B-cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) as demonstrated in murine models, where CD37 has been described as a negative regulator of lymphomagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Recently, CD37 has been reported to inhibit the fatty acids (FA) transporter FATP1, so CD37-negative lymphoma cells take advantage of increased FA uptake and process exogenous palmitate into energy supporting their increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In line with that, CD37 presence on the cell surface has been shown to correlate with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). As patients with high CD37 expression showed improved survival on R-CHOP regardless of <italic>CD20</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), CD37 has been suggested to act as a “molecular facilitator” of rituximab action in a yet undefined mechanism. Intriguingly, surface CD37 levels have been shown to correlate with CD20 levels as assessed by flow cytometry in DLBCL cell lines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In this study, using RR and CD20 KO cell lines, we investigated the role of CD20 in regulating CD37 levels and its consequences for the efficacy of mAbs and CAR-based immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P4">All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin.

As already reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), CD20 downregulation is a hallmark of RR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), which largely contributes to their resistance to RTX in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, these cells are resistant to RTX in vivo as assessed by mice survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref>) and tumor burden (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>). To investigate the biological consequences of CD20 decrease, we generated models of CD20 KO in several B-cell lymphoma cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). All generated CD20 KO cells were characterized with resistance to rituximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>CD20 KO cells are characterized with diminished CD37 levels</title><p id="P12">In order to investigate the consequences of CD20 downregulation, we characterized the surfaceome of three selected CD20 KO cell lines by multi-colour flow cytometry using the panel of mAbs against B-cell specific surface-restricted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although we observed changes in the levels of several antigens, the only universal change for all generated CD20 KO cell lines, except CD20 downregulation, was a decrease in the expression of CD37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We further confirmed CD37 decrease in 6 consecutive CD20 KO cell lines using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and whole cell lysates using Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we found no significant decrease in CD37 mRNA in CD20-defficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Given the body of research showing synergistic action of anti-CD20 and anti-CD37 mAbs and suggesting close proximity of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), we sought to investigate if they form a complex in the cell membrane. Indeed, using Duolink Proximity Ligation flow cytometry-based assay which enables the detection of proteins within 40 nm distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), we observed the amplification generating green fluorescent signal in the presence of both anti-CD37 and anti-CD20 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2B</xref>). These results clearly demonstrated that CD20 and CD37 are close partners within the cell membrane. To understand their mutual regulation, we generated CD37 KO in Ramos cell line using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach, sorted out a pool and selected clones of CD37-negative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B</xref>). To our surprise, we did not observe any reduction in CD20 levels associated with CD37 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These findings led us to conclude that CD20 and CD37 are closely associated on the cell membrane and that CD20 regulates the CD37 protein levels in a posttranscriptional mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>CD37 is downregulated in RR cells</title><p id="P13">To further explore the interaction of CD20 and CD37, this time in RR cells, we checked CD37 expression in RR cells, characterized by CD20 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In fact, CD37 was significantly down-regulated in all RR cell lines both on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) as well as in total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, in RR cells we have observed altered expression of several other antigens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>) which reflects a multifaceted effect of RTX on the B-cell phenotype and existence of several mechanisms underlying the observed changes. Interestingly, the CD37 negative phenotype of RR cells persisted in vivo in mice inoculated with RR Ramos cells as demonstrated by the staining on the cells isolated from the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, in primary samples obtained from DLBCL patients before the start of first-line treatment, the expression of CD37 was heterogenous with approximately 50% of cases expressing CD37 at less than 5% of cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This is in line with previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Furthermore, our results confirm the findings reported by Xu-Monette et al. showing the positive correlation between the presence of CD37 and PFS following R-CHOP therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Our clinicopathological correlations were limited to the newly diagnosed DLBCL cases (n=47) treated with R-CHOP in a first-line setting. Based on these experiments, we conclude that low/decreased CD37 expression can be relatively frequent in patients. Since CD37 is explored as a therapeutic target, in the subsequent steps, we investigated the consequences of decreased CD37 levels on the efficacy of various forms of therapy targeting CD37.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>CD37 decrease leads to impaired efficacy of CD37 mAbs-mediated CDC, which can be restored using lysosome inhibitors</title><p id="P14">A decrease in the target antigen directly translates into impaired efficacy of mAbs that exert cytotoxicity in complement-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Therefore, we have asked the question if decreased CD37 levels in RR and CD20 KO cells influence the efficacy of a CDC-inducing anti-CD37 mAb. We observed impaired efficacy of anti-CD37 mAb in CD20 KO and RR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>, respectively). This effect was clearly visible despite utilizing a mAb with the E430G mutation, which promotes more efficient IgG hexamer formation through intermolecular Fc-Fc interactions after cell surface antigen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). While in CD20 KO cells a decreased efficacy of anti-CD37 mAb may be solely attributed to decreased CD37 expression, in RR cells it may be the result of both decreased CD37 expression and an increase in complement inhibitor protein CD59 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Since CD20 and CD37 are interrelated in the plasma membrane, we hypothesized that the mechanisms of their interaction are dependent on the internalization, trafficking and degradation processes. More specifically, we assumed that CD37 endocytosis is accelerated in the cells lacking CD20 and that the presence of CD20 stabilizes CD37 within the cell membrane. To test this assumption, we have preincubated NTC and CD20 KO cells with non-toxic concentrations of compounds known to block lysosome-dependent degradation i.e. chloroquine and bafilomycin A. The used inhibitors up-regulated CD37 levels in both NTC as well as in CD20 KO cells, where they increased CD37 levels up to the values observed in NTC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Increase in CD20 and CD37 levels can also be observed in whole-cell lysates of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Accordingly, inhibition of lysosomal degradation increased the efficacy of anti-CD37 mAbs against CD20 KO cells in CDC cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). All in all, our results show that CD37 can be degraded by lysosome and the blockage of lysosome can be used as an approach to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells with CD20 KO to anti-CD37 mAbs.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>CD20 KO cells show an increased internalization rate of anti-CD37 mAb</title><p id="P16">In the further steps, we investigated the potential of the use of anti-CD37 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in the cells with decreased CD20 levels. This treatment approach involves the use of surface antigen-targeted mAbs to deliver cytotoxic payloads into tumor cells upon conjugate internalization through endocytosis. In our experiments, we investigated the internalization rate of anti-CD37 mAb in NTC and CD20 KO cells. We were able to observe increased internalization rate of a mouse anti-human anti-CD37 antibody. In this experiment, Raji NTC and CD20 KO cells were incubated with equal amounts of mouse anti-human anti-CD37 mAb conjugated with pH-sensitive dye, which becomes activated in lysosomes, for 23h in IncuCyte, and the images were registered every 20 min. Fluorescence AUC was normalized to the cell area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig. 4A</xref>). As CD20 KO cells were characterized with decreased CD37 levels, Quantibrite measurement was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4C</xref>) and the AUC normalized to the number of CD37 molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results suggest an increased internalization in CD20 KO cells as one of the potential mechanisms involved in the downregulation of CD37 that could be exploited therapeutically with anti-CD37 ADCs.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>CD37 decrease does not hamper CAR T cells’ cytotoxicity</title><p id="P17">Since CD37 has recently been designated as a suitable target for CAR-directed therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we then asked the question if a substantial decrease in its levels would hamper the efficacy of CD37 CARs as well. To address this, we performed CD37 CAR-T cytotoxic assays against both RR and CD20 KO cell lines as targets in two effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. We have discovered that despite significantly diminished CD37 levels in 6 different cell lines (either RRCLs or CD20 KO cells), the cytotoxicity of the tested CAR T cells was not significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). At this stage, we concluded that CD37, although diminished upon downregulation of CD20, remains an attractive target for cell-based therapies and could be further explored even in RTX-pretreated patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Novel treatment modalities for r/r DLBCL patients are intensively pursued. However, little is known about the mechanisms of primary resistance and molecular changes induced by the treatment on the phenotype of lymphoma cells despite the clear unfavourable prognosis of patients progressing during or shortly after first-line immunochemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In the recent few years, the therapeutic armamentarium for aggressive lymphomas has expanded thanks to registrations of second-line treatments that finally offer an alternative to auto-HSCT, namely anti-CD19 CAR T cells, novel mAbs-based regimens: tafasitamab plus lenalidomide and polatuzumab vedotin and novel promising agents such as novel ADCs and bispecific mAbs tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P19">CD37, a tetraspanin predominantly expressed on B cells is currently being explored as a target for mAbs, ADCs and CAR T cells. The results of our work show that strategies targeting CD37 need to be carefully implemented in r/r B-cell lymphoma patients. Using CD20 KO cells, we identified the association between CD37 and CD20, with the expression of the latter playing a crucial protective role in preventing CD37 from undergoing endocytosis as suggested by our results in CD20 KO cells where lysosome inhibition increased reduced CD37 levels to the levels seen in control (NTC) cells. This discovery has several implications. First of all, we demonstrate that decreased CD37 expression correlates with reduced efficacy of anti-CD37 mAbs in a complement-dependent mechanism, where the expression of the target antigen determines the cytotoxic effect. However, this limitation may be encompassed by the use of bi-specific antibodies e.g. targeting CD20 and CD37 that show superior efficacy to anti-CD37 mAbs alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) or bi-paratopic mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P20">On the other hand, we hypothesize that CD20 loss facilitates CD37 endocytosis and it may translate to increased efficacy of anti-CD37 ADCs that have recently been presented as a highly efficient strategy in B-cell malignancies in vitro and in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The efficacy of ADCs relies on the endocytosis of the target antigen-ADC complex and the release of the cytotoxic payload to the cytoplasm. It has already been reported that rituximab synergizes with naratuximab emtansine by increasing the endocytosis of CD37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Our results suggest that anti-CD37 ADCs may be effective even in the case of CD20-negative cells in r/r RTX-treated patients. Finally, we show that decreased CD37 levels (up to 50% in our models) do not influence the efficacy of CD37-targeted CARs and delineate CD37 CARs as an effective option for CD20-negative RTX-pretreated patients. However, approximately 50% of DLBCL patients have undetectable CD37 levels in immunohistochemistry (IHC), the reason behind this phenomenon being attributed at least partially to low levels of IRF8, a newly identified transcriptional regulator of CD37 expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Moreover, our study sheds new light on the regulation of CD37 expression. Decrease in CD37 expression has been reported to affect patients’ prognosis negatively, and according to the studies by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and ours, up to 50% of DLBCL patients show undetectable CD37 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. However, it needs to be emphasized that in the IHC stainings performed by us and others a clone of anti-CD37 mAb (2B8) used does not correspond to the clone used for CAR construct (HH1 clone). As mentioned before r/r patients are not routinely rebiopsed therefore not much is known about the changes in surfaceome. Also, IHC may be an imperfect tool to study such changes as demonstrated by the recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), where decreases in CD20 levels were observed in flow cytometry in the samples where no decrease in CD20 by IHC has been noted. By now, CD37 loss has been attributed to decreased expression a transcriptional factor IRF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). However, as demonstrated by the study by Elfrink et al., up to 40% of IRF8 low DLBCL samples still express detectable CD37 in IHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) suggesting that there are additional factors regulating CD37 expression. Tetraspanins play an important role in the organization of the cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), forming clusters that overlap each other. The CD37 cluster has been shown to overlap with CD81 and CD82 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), while the latter has been reported to form a supramolecular complex with MHC class I, MHC class II, CD53, and CD20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Our results suggest that a decrease in CD20 levels, a protein not belonging to the tetraspanin family but to MS4A family that shows some characteristics in the structure, may induce changes in the composition of the cellular membrane and promote the degradation of CD37. Other members of MS4A family have already been demonstrated to govern the endocytosis process i.e. MS4A4A by directing the trafficking of KIT regulates its signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and MS4A3 promotes endocytosis of common β-chain (βc) cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P22">All in all, our study adds new knowledge on the current state of the art on the regulation of CD37, which in the light of the recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) constitutes an attractive therapeutic target for immunotherapies. The results of our study once again prove that CD37 is highly variable in DLBCL patients. Finally, we show that immunotherapy using anti-CD37 CAR T cells can be an effective option despite low levels of CD37 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplement_material</label><media xlink:href="EMS192654-supplement-Supplement_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Prof. F.Hernandez-Iizaliturri, Prof. M.
