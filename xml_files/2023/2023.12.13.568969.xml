Here, we report an alternative and unique in vitro model of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) using primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs) from three healthy donors. The co-operation of ubiquitous alterations (<italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> loss) and components of commonly deregulated pathways including squamous differentiation (<italic>SOX2</italic>), PI3K signalling (<italic>PTEN</italic>) and the oxidative stress response (<italic>KEAP1</italic>) was investigated by generating hBECs harbouring cumulative alterations. Our analyses confirmed that <italic>SOX2</italic>-overexpression initiates early preinvasive LUSC stages, and co-operation with the oxidative stress response and PI3K pathways to drive more aggressive phenotypes, with expansion of cells expressing LUSC biomarkers and invasive properties. This cooperation was consistent with the classical LUSC subtype. Importantly, we connected pathway dysregulation with gene expression changes associated with cell-intrinsic processes and immunomodulation. Our approach constitutes a powerful system to model LUSC and unravel genotype-phenotype causations of clinical relevance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Lung cancers are a devastating group of neoplasms which broadly divide into two categories, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases and primarily consists of two histologically distinct subtypes including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (50% of all lung cancers) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (30% of all lung cancers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). LUSC is a complex disease which predominantly originates in the proximal airways. Basal cells, which function as the multipotent progenitors of the bronchial epithelium, are believed to be the most likely cells-of-origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), although a more complex interplay between genetic drivers and cell-of-origin has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Contrasting with LUAD, patients with LUSC are almost exclusively smokers, their survival is poorer and targeted treatments have largely failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). LUSC exhibits a heterogeneous landscape of phenotypic subtypes with unclear biological origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Genetically, LUSC is characterised by inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> and upregulation of the CDK4/6 pathway (typically by <italic>CDKN2A</italic> inactivation) in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and unlike LUAD, dysregulation of oncogenic pathways in LUSC is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). LUSC genetic landscapes have revealed components of the squamous differentiation (SD) pathway, PI3K/Akt signalling, and oxidative stress response (OSR) pathway to be the most frequently targeted, although co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity patterns in the dysregulation of these common LUSC pathways were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). More recent multi-platform characterisations of LUSC have shown characteristic genomic features in specific subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Modelling this complexity is required to understand the underpinning biology, the specific vulnerabilities associated with each subgroup and to identify essential components of LUSC development.</p><p id="P4">Modelling LUSC heterogeneity <italic>in vivo</italic> has the obvious advantage of encompassing the tumour microenvironment (TME), but it is arduous, time-consuming, and costly. Non-immortalised primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs), are a suitable and infrequently explored alternative. They can be expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> as basal cells and recapitulate bronchial epithelial architecture using organotypic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Regardless of the absence of an autochthonous TME, hBECs are an alternative to mouse models in the deconvolution of complex genotypes to find genotype-phenotype causation, identification of the essential alterations driving the cell-autonomous biology of LUSC development, uncover epistatic interactions between somatic events, and downstream actionable pathways with therapeutic application. In this report, we aimed to establish the potential of genetically engineered hBECs from three healthy donors to model LUSC and deconvolve the cell-intrinsic mechanisms whereby somatic events fuel LUSC progression using hBECs from three donors. We confirmed that the SD, PI3K/Akt and OSR pathways were all necessary for LUSC development and invasive progression, identified pro- and anti-oncogenic interactions between those pathways and matched somatic alterations with dysfunction of biologically and therapeutically actionable pathways.</p><sec id="S2"><title>hBEC genetic-engineering strategy to model LUSC</title><p id="P5">To determine the functions and cooperation of the most frequently dysregulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) in LUSC development, we designed a combinatorial strategy in which a regulator of each pathway (<italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>KEAP1</italic>) was targeted individually, or in combinations of two and three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and CDK4/6 pathway activation (typically by <italic>CDKN2A</italic> loss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) are ubiquitous in LUSC, we included concomitant <italic>TP53</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (TC) truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To capture some inter-person variation and avoid smoking-induced pre-existing alterations, mutants were generated using hBECs from three never-smoking donors without reported airways disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Genetic manipulation was achieved by electroporation with multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, selecting <italic>TP53</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells with Nutlin-3A, and lentiviral transduction to elevate the expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and mimic its amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1a and b</xref>). This strategy results in mutant hBECs with up to five modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). CRISPR efficiency analysis revealed 96-100% indel efficiency and almost complete abrogation of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-f</xref>). Lentiviral <italic>SOX2</italic> resulted in <italic>SOX2</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>) and analysis of SD, PI3K/Akt and OSR pathway surrogates demonstrated the expected pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f, h</xref>). We tested nine <italic>PTEN</italic> sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), only one successfully targeted the locus and this sgRNA also targets <italic>PTENP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>), a pseudogene with 98% <italic>PTEN</italic> homology. <italic>PTENP1</italic> encodes a lncRNA with miRNA decoy functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, as <italic>PTENP1</italic> indels are restricted to <italic>PTEN</italic> mutants and do not disrupt miRNA binding sequences, we did not anticipate any functional consequences. Analysis of the top-5 predicted off-target sites for the remaining other sgRNAs did not show any indels.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>SOX2</italic> inhibits proliferation in 2D cultures but enhances anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness in cooperation with the OSR and PI3/Akt pathway</title><p id="P6">Firstly, we assessed the transforming potential of our different mutant combinations in the three donors by investigating changes in proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasiveness. Overall, mutants without lentiviral <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> proliferated 2-3 fold faster than wild type hBECs and <italic>PTEN</italic> truncations enhanced this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> mutants grew with similar rates to wild type, excluding TC+PS in donors 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> was not associated with increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), this result was likely due to reduced proliferation in culture. Although paradoxical, <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> mediated growth suppression has been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and indicates that SOX2 drives oncogenesis by mechanisms unrelated to proliferation. Indeed, only mutants with <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> showed detectable anchorage-independent growth over background with TC+PKS displaying maximal colony formation in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>), demonstrating that SOX2<sup>OE</sup> is required for anoikis override and synergises with <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>KEAP1</italic> truncations. However, in donor 3, colony formation in TC+KS was comparable to TC+PKS. When we carried out invasion assays using the collagen disc method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), we found that TC+PKS mutants showed the most invasive behaviour in all the donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), consistent with our soft-agar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). These results are in line with published <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that highlighted the essential role of <italic>SOX2</italic> in LUSC and indicate an oncogenic role independent of proliferation. Furthermore, our results confirm the cooperation with activation of the PI3K/Akt and OSR pathways. Overall, these data characterising the newly generated models reflect carcinogenic transformation of hBECs and encouraged further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Effect of pathway dysregulation in bronchial epithelial homeostasis</title><p id="P7">LUSC developmental stages are characterised by epithelial changes that include loss of specialised bronchial cells, surface maturation (squamous cells) and expansion of p63-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To ascertain the role of pathway dysregulation in the development of these epithelial perturbations, we used organotypic air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), widely used to study bronchial epithelial biology. Histological analysis revealed characteristic epithelial alterations in ALI cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In general, wild-type and TC mutants lacked significant differences in epithelial structure and relative abundance of specialized bronchial lineages (goblet, ciliated and club cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). TC+P mutants showed a prominent phenotype characterised by increased cellularity and development of intra-epithelial cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), although without relative changes in differentiated bronchial lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 d-e</xref>). TC+K and TC+PK mutants exhibited an overall reduction in the fraction of club cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), which suggests a previously unreported function of the OSR pathway in the differentiation dynamics of that lineage.</p><p id="P8"><italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> mutants exhibited abrogation of specialized cell differentiation except for TC+PS, which retained higher levels of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> mutants also displayed evidence of squamous differentiation as indicated by apical dyskeratosis, most prominent in TC+S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>), and expression of the squamous differentiation markers SPRR2A, SPRR3 and IVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). TC+PKS mutants developed keratinisation and a highly disorganised histology with frequent loss of basal-apical polarity, indicative of progression to more advanced developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). We reasoned that lower <italic>SOX2</italic> expression might be responsible for the comparatively abnormal behaviour of TC+PS mutants. Indeed, we found a discontinuous pattern of mCherry expression in TC+PS mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), indicating negative selection of <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> cells in TC+PS that is prevented by <italic>KEAP1</italic> inactivation.</p><p id="P9">LUSC developmental stages are characterised by an expansion of p63-expressing cells from the basal compartment to occupy the epithelial layer. Therefore, we predicted an expansion of p63-positive cells that would be maximal in our modelling of most advanced stages of LUSC. To test this, we first confirmed the expansion of p63<sup>+</sup> cells in patient specimens with low and high-grade premalignant lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Tissue regions with premalignant lesions were divided into basal and apical halves and the fraction of total p63<sup>+</sup> cells residing in the apical half was quantified as a measure of p63<sup>+</sup> cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As expected, we validated an expansion of p63<sup>+</sup> cells which was maximal in high-grade lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Using the same approach in ALI cultures, we found that p63<sup>+</sup> cell expansion was maximal in TC+PKS in all three donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), strongly indicating that this mutant represents the highest disease grade. Expression of cytokeratins 5 and 6, also a LUSC biomarker, followed a trend similar to p63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). We also identified inter-donor heterogeneity, most evident in donor 3, where p63<sup>+</sup> cell expansion was as high in TC+KS as in TC+PKS lacked. This is consistent with the results obtained when investigating anchorage-independent growth in the same mutants from donor 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which also showed similar levels of colony formation. Of note, expression of the lung adenocarcinoma marker TTF-1 was barely detectable in all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Taken together, our analyses show that in the absence of lentiviral <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup>, mutant hBECs develop different alterations of the bronchial architecture, but do not acquire clear landmarks of transition to squamous lesions. <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> in the TC background induces features of tumour initiation, including multi-layered morphology, acquisition of anchorage-independent growth and squamous differentiation. In TC+PKS mutants, maximal expansion of p63-expressing cells, anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness indicate transition to a malignant phenotype that requires SD, PI3K/Akt and OSR co-operation. Our observations also indicate a detrimental interaction between <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> and PI3K/Akt pathway activation that is rescued by OSR pathway activation. This interaction and the requirement of the three pathways for malignant transformation could explain the co-occurrence of 3q-amplification (comprising <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> amplification) and alterations targeting the OSR pathway in the classical LUSC subtype. In line with our results, interrogation of DepMap Consortium data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) revealed that LUSC was the most dependent on <italic>NFE2L2</italic> of all tumour types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3b, c</xref>). <italic>NFE2L2</italic> encodes for Nrf2, a master regulator of the OSR (or Nrf2) pathway that is regulated by <italic>KEAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). <italic>SOX2</italic> is also a co-dependency in <italic>NFE2L2</italic>-dependent cell lines, implying that <italic>NFE2L2</italic>-dependent cell lines are also dependent on <italic>SOX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3e, f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Comprehensive gene-expression analysis of dysregulated pathways</title><p id="P11">Our combinatorial LUSC modelling approach allows us to deconvolve the effect of pathway dysregulation on gene-expression. To do this, we carried out bulk RNA-seq of ALI cultures. Before focusing on the effect of specific pathways, we carried out PCA and WGCNA analyses to confirm that mutants from different donors behave similarly at the gene expression level. PCA revealed four clusters segregated primarily by genotype (<italic>KEAP1</italic> loss and <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup>) instead of donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). As expected, TC+PS consistently clustered with wild type, TC and TC+P mutants. The role of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>KEAP1</italic> in shaping LUSC transcriptomes is congruent with published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Next, WGCNA was performed to assess inter-donor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4b, c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Seven consensus co-expression modules were identified when gene expression from the three donors was analysed globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>). These seven modules were largely conserved amongst the three donors and only a few additional small modules with low stability were identified in individual modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">5a-d</xref>). After identifying limited heterogeneity between donors, we set out to analyse the transcriptomic data globally and identify differentially expressed genes regulated by each pathway relative to the TC background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). TC+PKS relative to TC were also interrogated to ensure gene-set enrichments attributed to one pathway is not supressed by the concomitant dysregulation of additional pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>). Due to the size of the transcriptomic data, we focused on GO Biological Process and Hallmark collections. Positively enriched BP GO terms associated with <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> were dominated by epithelial development and keratinocyte biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>), reflecting transition to a squamous keratinised epithelium, characteristic of squamous metaplasia. Genes upregulated in TC+S and TC+PKS mutants were also enriched in RAS-RTK pathway associated GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>) and in the KRAS SIGNALING UP hallmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>). RAS-RTK signalling in LUSC has been functionally linked to <italic>SOX2</italic> in cooperation with <italic>TP63</italic> to induce <italic>EGFR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and with the expression of EGFR ligands different from EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> upregulated <italic>TP63</italic> and EGFR ligands, but not EGFR. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables 5</xref>). We identified a heterogeneous group of positively enriched GO terms related to protein processing, including multiple serine protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>). Among these was <italic>PI3,</italic> which encodes a neutrophil-elastase inhibitor and known component of the cornified envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), highly upregulated in <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that <italic>PI3</italic> might counteract the known tumour suppressive activity of neutrophil-elastases to promote LUSC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). A significant positive correlation between <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PI3</italic> mRNA (Spearman=0.24 q-value=0.0335) and protein (Spearman=0.268, q-value=0.0214) expression was confirmed using CPTAC data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), but not the TCGA cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). When we interrogated a transcriptomic database of premalignant lesions previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), maximal <italic>PI3</italic> expression was observed in high-grade and invasive carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), implying a function in the transition to invasive carcinomas.</p><p id="P12">As expected, processes downregulated following <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> largely related to cilia biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>), reflecting bronchial-squamous reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-f</xref>). A cluster of negatively enriched ontologies related to protein transport contained gene-sets consisting of MHC-II subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">7</xref>). Two recently published articles that analyse premalignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) or use LUSC human and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) reported the downregulation of epithelial MHC-II expression mediated by the MHC-II transcriptional activator, <italic>CIITA</italic>.

Whilst TC+PKS mutants showed similar results, they did not reach significance for the interferon gamma response hallmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). Likewise, tumours with OSR-targeting alterations also showed downregulation of genes in interferon and inflammation related hallmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), and suppression of interferon responses was most prominent in the classical subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Our model therefore recapitulates a wide range of reported metabolic and immune-related transcriptional changes mediated by OSR activation.</p><p id="P15">PI3K/Akt activation by <italic>PTEN</italic> truncation resulted in a more limited transcriptional response than <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> and <italic>KEAP1</italic> truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). This is consistent with our PCA and WGCNA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>) showing that the latter alterations are the most determinant factors in shaping transcriptomes, and on the other hand, with reports showing that LUSC subtypes are not determined by PI3K/Akt-targeting alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).

Our morphological analysis revealed that <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> abrogates bronchial epithelial architecture and induces SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7a, b</xref>), two processes that occur early in LUSC development, whereas additional <italic>KEAP1</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> inactivation drive further p63-positive cell expansion and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Therefore, <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification, or more generally, activation of the SD pathway, might occur earlier than OSR and PI3K/Akt pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Additionally, our observation that <italic>KEAP1</italic>-loss rescues the negative interaction between <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> and <italic>PTEN</italic> truncation suggests that PI3K/Akt pathway activation might occur at an evolutionary stage that avoids the detrimental interaction with SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Therefore, according to our results, the sequence SD-OSR-PI3K/Akt is the most likely evolution of pathway activation according to our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We next ascertained whether this hypothetical evolutionary trajectory is consistent with observations in human specimens. Published LUSC evolutionary histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) lack the temporal resolution required for this analysis. Moreover, the lack genomic characterisations of developmental LUSC stages prevents us from inferring an evolutionary sequence of somatic events. However, the preinvasive lesion cohort generated by Mascaux and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) can be interrogated to map the onset of pathway dysregulation using transcriptional signatures. Thus, we carried out ssGSEA analysis on the latter data using gene-sets associated with the three pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b-d</xref>). As expected, an increase in squamous differentiation-related enrichment scores was significant in squamous metaplasia and increased OSR- and PI3K/Akt-related scores became significant in squamous metaplasia and moderate dysplasia respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c, d</xref>). These observations support that PI3K/Akt pathway activation occurs later than SD and OSR pathways, which appear to be upregulated simultaneously. Though stromal contamination, LUSC molecular subtypes and the assumption that LUSC development is homogeneous across patients might be confounding factors, these results indicate that the onset of PI3K/Akt signalling occurs later in LUSC evolution, perhaps due to a reduction in cell fitness caused by the interaction between PI3K/Akt and <italic>SOX2</italic> gain-of-function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Advances in translational cancer research rely on the availability of tractable models that recapitulate key cancer traits. Mouse models are valuable for understanding basic LUSC biology. However, availability of resources and inter-species differences hinder the modelling of increasingly complex genotypes, evolutionary trajectories and inter-patient heterogeneity. We demonstrated here that genetically engineered hBECs constitute a tractable, biologically relevant system to study LUSC as demonstrated by the expression of p63 and cytokeratins 5/6, absence of TTF-1, and presence of keratinisation. We implemented our strategy with the same cell type from three donors without cancer or airway disease to ensure reproducibility. Similar models developed by genetic manipulation of primary human cells published for other cancer types made use of only one donor in a melanoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), or cells isolated from multiple patients with colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and cells from spatially separated intestinal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) in colorectal cancer models. Overall, our cell biology results indicated that concomitant activation of the SD, PI3K/Akt and OSR pathways was required for malignant transformation. Although some inter-donor heterogeneity was detected, a holistic vision of our results revealed homogeneous phenotypes in the three donors who were of similar age, non-smokers and lacked airway disease.</p><p id="P18">We conclude that our approach has generated a human model of the classical LUSC subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) as [1] the three pivotal pathways investigated were required for invasive transformation which is consistent with the accumulation of OSR pathway mutations and 3q-amplification (<italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>) in classical LUSC subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), [2] OSR activation was required for the expansion of <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> cells with concomitant PI3K/Akt activation, and [3] OSR and <italic>SOX2</italic> downregulated pathways involved in tumour immunity, which could contribute to the ‘immune-cold’ environment observed in the classical LUSC subtype. Mouse models have not clearly demonstrated the requirement for SD, PI3K/Akt and OSR activation in defining classical LUSC subtype. Ferone et al., (2017) used a strategy that involved <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>OE</sup>and <italic>Pten</italic><sup>ko</sup> without targeting the OSR pathway that successfully resulted in tumourigenesis. Notwithstanding inter-species differences and the lack of evidence of invasion in the latter model, positive selection for cells with OSR activation during tumour development in this model might explain this difference.</p><p id="P19">Our observations suggest new translational perspectives. For example, our results indicate that tumours with 3q-amplification and OSR-targeting alterations are likely to be more sensitive to experimental therapies targeting the Nrf-2 pathway (e.g. glutaminase inhibitors) and that rescuing the negative interaction between SOX2 and PI3K/Akt activation might constitute an elusive basic function of OSR activation in LUSC. A likely mechanism could be OSR mediated detoxification of endogenous toxic ROS originating from cumulative <italic>SOX2</italic> and PI3K/Akt driven metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) or increased metabolic demands caused by concomitant <italic>SOX2</italic><sup>OE</sup> and PI3K/Akt, such as a higher demand for amino acids and glutaminolysis reliance, that are compensated by upregulation of essential amino acid (<italic>SLC7A5</italic>) and glutamine (<italic>SLC1A5</italic>) transporters. In fact, our results might explain why lung cancer prevention strategies based on the use of antioxidants actually increase the risk of lung cancer, as these agents mimic Nrf-2 pathway activation and might favour the expansion of clones with 3q-amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Therapies that target the OSR pathway by limiting glutamate biosynthesis for glutathione production have been tested in trials (NCT04265534 and NCT04471415) without positive result. Addressing this lack therapeutic effect and testing new strategies to target the OSR pathway can be approached with our human model as it has recapitulated the wide range of gene expression changes previously reported for the OSR pathway, and additional changes, reflecting a complex interplay between interdependent and/or functionally redundant amino acid transporters.</p><p id="P21">We also show regulation of innate and adaptive immunity by the SD and OSR pathways. SOX2 downregulates the neutrophil-elastase inhibitor <italic>PI3</italic> and MHC-II while OSR activation lowered type-I and II interferon responses. For the first time, we have provided evidence that places SOX2 at the apex of cell intrinsic and TME-mediated pro-oncogenic signals that include links with innate and acquired immunity in LUSC such as MHC-II downregulation and neutrophil-elastase inhibitors. Notwithstanding that potential strategies to target the individual processes mediated by SOX2 must be tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), the multi-faceted SOX2 oncogenic functions emphasise the need to target SOX2 itself. New therapeutic tools such as PROTACs or approaches analogous to Omomyc could facilitate this endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Similarly, OSR inhibition is likely to enhance type-I and II interferon responses and remodel the immune cell landscape of LUSC. This is in line with the limited therapeutic response to immunotherapies observed in cancer patients and mouse models with OSR alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Our human LUSC model also provide a new experimental tool to investigate the latter strategies.</p><p id="P22">Finally, the comparison of our observations with transcriptomic signatures in patient samples are in accordance with an evolutionary trajectory in which activation of SD and OSR programs precede PI3K/Akt activation, but with several caveats. This trajectory is at odds with <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> co-amplification in 3q26, which suggests simultaneous SD and PI3K/Akt activation. However, gene-dose to phenotype correlations likely differ amongst genes, as might the timing of phenotype emergence following a copy number event. In fact, 3q26 amplification is detectable in progressive squamous metaplasias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and increases during LUSC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). If <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene dose is less efficient in inducing the pathway, this would result in an evolutionary ‘delay’ of PI3K/Akt activation.</p><p id="P23">We set out to provide an informative, tractable <italic>in vitro</italic> LUSC model as an alternative, or an animal use reducing prelude, to more expensive, technically challenging and animal consuming <italic>in vivo</italic> modelling of LUSC. By definition, our model focuses primarily on cell-intrinsic effects lacking the complexity of the native TME, which constitutes a limitation. However, our model incorporates intra-epithelial conditions and can be progressively upgraded to incorporate TME components. Our model can now be applied to address further basic and translational research questions, the most obvious being a reverse genetic approach to model LUSC heterogeneity using comparative genomic studies. For instance, our system can be used to test whether other drivers of the three LUSC prevalent pathways phenocopy the alterations used in this study and trigger the same vulnerabilities or, alternatively, to assess the function of unrelated drivers. Our model also provides an opportunity to explore the biology of risk factors including smoking and COPD by manipulating hBECs derived from appropriate donors. Although the study of metastasis is an additional limitation of our model, the use of bioengineering solutions, such as the organ-on-a-chip technology, might overcome this limitation. Lastly, identification of new biomarkers for LUSC prevention and early detection methods, drug resistance, and immune-oncology studies are examples of the multiple translational opportunities to exploit in our new LUSC model.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P24">Mouse embryonic 3T3-J2 fibroblasts (Kerafast, EF3003) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco™, 11995065) with 10% bovine serum (Fisher Scientific, 16-107-078), 2mM GlutaMAX™ Supplement (Gibco™, 35050061) and 5% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco™, 15070063).
