Current classifiers achieve only low accuracy without gene expression data, warranting the development of new approaches to copy-number-only-based IntClust classification. A novel XGBoost-driven classification algorithm, <italic>CopyClust</italic>, was trained using genomic features from METABRIC and validated on TCGA achieving a nine-percentage point or greater improvement in overall IntClust subtype classification accuracy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Extensive copy number (CN) and gene expression (GE) integrated analysis of the METABRIC cohort revealed 10 unique breast cancer tumor subtypes (Integrative Clusters [IntClusts]) each with characteristic genomic and transcriptomic architecture and genomic driver events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Clinically, the IntClusts showed distinct patterns of survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and risk of disease relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Crucially, this work reveals that by integrating multi-omic features, it is possible to derive more robust patient classifiers that can stratify tumours based on candidate genomic driver events, as opposed to GE-only approaches, like PAM50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it provides a framework for personalized breast cancer therapeutic strategies with extensive clinical utility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. For clinical application, new samples, which are initially unlabelled, must be assigned to a class. However, current approaches to classify unlabelled tumor samples into IntClusts rely on using a combined CN and GE-focused approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, limiting classification accuracy among cancer samples without transcriptomic data. With the increase in cancer genomics consortia and widespread availability of public data without GE profiling, a novel method to subtype tumors from independent cohorts based on CN data alone is warranted. Here, we present the development and validation of a reliable, flexible, platform-independent CN-driven machine learning algorithm (<italic>CopyClust</italic>) for IntClust classification as an open-source R package.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P3">The 1,980 breast cancer samples from METABRIC (internal validation) and the 1,075 samples from TCGA (external validation) with available CN and GE data were used to train and validate multiclass hyperparameter-optimized XGBoost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> machine learning algorithms. For METABRIC, IntClust label was assigned from the original manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, while for TCGA, label was assigned via the <italic>iC10</italic> classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> using CN and GE data. To reduce noise, a piecewise constant fit (PCF) was applied to the CN profiles of the METABRIC samples in each IntClust and unique breakpoints across the 10 profiles were identified and converted into 478 genomic regions. The mean CN in each region was calculated, and these were used as features for XGBoost models. METABRIC samples were split into a training cohort (80%) and validation cohort (20%). Intra-IntClust outliers were identified via local outlier factor (LOF) and removed from the training cohort prior to model training.</p><p id="P4">Two model approaches were implemented: a 10-class model with the final IntClust label predicted by a single multiclass model and a 6-class model with binary reclassification in which four pairs of IntClusts were combined for initial multiclass classification, then assigned an IntClust label based on the prediction of a second binary classifier trained on that pair. These pairs were selected based on their similar CN profiles and frequent misclassification in the 10-class model. The 6-class model with binary reclassification model was selected for final model implementation due to superior performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Scaling of feature values was performed prior to model implementation on external cohorts. Model performance was internally validated on 392 (20%) held-out METABRIC samples and externally validated on the TCGA dataset, with CN data generated from both single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and whole exome sequencing (WES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). More details of the methodology used and results for this study can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Tables S1–S7 and Supplemental Figures S1–S18</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P5">When compared to other hyperparameter-optimized classifier algorithms including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, LightGBM, and Prediction Analysis of Microarrays, XGBoost performed best in terms of overall recall and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and was selected as the approach for <italic>CopyClust</italic>. <italic>CopyClust</italic> achieved high classification performance across both the TCGA SNP and WES datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The classifier produced an overall recall of 81%, precision of 82%, and balanced accuracy of 89% when applied to the TCGA SNP dataset with an MCC of 0.787. Applied to the TCGA WES dataset, <italic>CopyClust</italic> produced an overall recall of 79%, precision of 80%, balanced accuracy of 88%, and MCC of 0.759. Across both datasets, IntClust 3 and IntClust 8 were the most misclassified pair of IntClusts, likely due to their similar CN profiles. IntClust 6 experienced the lowest individual recall, which could be due to differences in the distribution of IntClusts between cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), leading to model miscalibration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Compared to the current gold standard CN-only <italic>iC10</italic> classifier, <italic>CopyClust</italic> achieved a nine-percentage point greater overall recall when applied to METABRIC (82% vs. 73%) and a 22% and 20% greater overall recall when applied to the TCGA SNP and WES datasets, respectively (81% and 79% vs. 59%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). This increase in the performance of <italic>CopyClust</italic> compared to the <italic>iC10</italic> classifier can likely be attributed to the dominance of GE features in the selected probes of the <italic>iC10</italic> classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Features in the <italic>iC10</italic> classifier were taken from the original IntClust manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and only 38 out of 714 (5.3%) of the probes used are gene CN; therefore, the bulk of the features are GE values. The <italic>iC10</italic> classifier is trained using the prediction analysis of microarrays shrunken centroids approach, which was developed for GE analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Rather than using a small subset of CN probes, <italic>CopyClust</italic> was trained using features comprising the entire length of the genome. Many IntClusts have key features of their CN profiles that are characteristic for a given IntClust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (e.g. IntClust 5 [chromosome 17q12 amplification] and IntClust 6 [chromosome 8p12 amplification]). The CN probes used by the <italic>iC10</italic> classifier do cover some of these key regions, but they do not cover the characteristics of the entire CN profile, indicating the superiority of <italic>CopyClust</italic> in the absence of GE profiling.</p><p id="P7">Intricacies of the specific datasets used to train and validate <italic>CopyClust</italic> somewhat limit its generalizability. METABRIC did not set a minimum tumor cellularity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, while TCGA set a minimum of 60%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The TCGA cohort may be composed of tumors with a greater average percentage of neoplastic cells; this difference may also account for the stronger signal observed in the TCGA CN profiles relative to the METABRIC CN profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S18</xref>), which necessitated feature scaling before model training. Additionally, the need to apply feature scaling across samples limits performance when there are only a single or few samples to classify. Manual curation of genomic ranges developed from PCF was only performed to ensure that ranges did not span multiple chromosomes but ranges still cover regions of telomeres and centromeres. Finally, <italic>CopyClust</italic> was only trained using a single cohort and validated externally on a single cohort, therefore, replication on additional datasets may further improve performance.</p><p id="P8"><italic>CopyClust</italic> provides an accurate and easily implementable framework for IntClust classification using CN data and achieves a nine-percentage point or greater improvement in overall classification recall compared to the current gold standard approach. Furthermore, <italic>CopyClust</italic> can flexibly handle missing features, is agnostic to differences in genomic profiling platforms, and is easily implementable in an open-source environment, allowing for seamless application to external genomic datasets.
