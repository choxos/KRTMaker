Mitochondrial diseases are highly heterogeneous and even patients with the same mitochondrial disease can exhibit broad phenotypic heterogeneity, which is poorly understood. Mutations in subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complex I cause complex I deficiency, which can result in severe neurological symptoms and death in infancy. However, some complex I deficiency patients present with much milder symptoms. The most common nuclear gene mutated in complex I deficiency is the highly conserved core subunit NDUFS1. To model the phenotypic heterogeneity in complex I deficiency we used RNAi lines targeting the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NDUFS1 homolog ND-75 with different efficiencies. Strong knockdown of ND-75 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons resulted in severe behavioural phenotypes, reduced lifespan, altered mitochondrial morphology, reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contacts and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). By contrast, weak ND-75 knockdown caused much milder behavioural phenotypes and changes in mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, weak ND-75 did not alter ER-mitochondria contacts or activate the UPR. Weak and strong ND-75 knockdown resulted in overlapping but distinct transcriptional responses in the brain, with weak knockdown specifically affecting proteosome activity and immune response genes. Metabolism was also differentially affected by weak and strong ND-75 knockdown including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in ND-75 knockdown flies. Several metabolic processes were only affected by strong ND-75 knockdown including the pentose phosphate pathway and the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), suggesting 2-HG as a candidate biomarker of severe neurological mitochondrial disease. Thus, our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model provides the means to dissect the mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in mitochondrial disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mitochondria</kwd><kwd>phenotypic heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>complex I deficiency</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Primary mitochondrial diseases are a broad spectrum of disorders characterised by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Primary mitochondrial diseases are caused by inherited or spontaneous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA mutations in genes required for mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Russell et al., 2020</xref>). These include genes encoding OXPHOS subunits, enzymes required for mtDNA maintenance, and enzymes involved in regulating mitochondrial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gorman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Mitochondrial diseases can arise both during childhood and adulthood, although this is often dictated by the type of genetic mutation involved. Early-onset mitochondrial diseases, where symptoms develop during infancy or childhood, are often caused by autosomal recessive mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Skladal et al., 2003</xref>). Adult-onset mitochondrial diseases are largely caused by mtDNA mutations and are generally less severe than those that are early-onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gorman et al., 2015</xref>). Both early-onset and adult-onset mitochondrial diseases are commonly associated with the development of neurological symptoms, which is likely due to the high metabolic demand of the CNS.</p><p id="P4">The prevalence of primary mitochondrial diseases is predicted to be ~ 1 in 7634 at birth, and ~ 1 in 4300 by adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Skladal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gorman et al., 2015</xref>). As a collective and individually, primary mitochondrial diseases are highly heterogeneous; the age of onset, tissue-specificity, and symptom severity can all vary depending on the individual and gene affected. Mitochondrial diseases are classified based on clinical symptoms, however, the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity within some of these diseases can make diagnosis very challenging, and often patients do not fit within the defined criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gorman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Finsterer et al., 2018</xref>). The underlying reasons for phenotypic heterogeneity within individual primary mitochondrial diseases are not well understood, which makes it challenging to identify common and distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, our lack of knowledge surrounding the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases has made it difficult to develop therapies.</p><p id="P5">Complex I deficiency is the most common childhood mitochondrial disease and is caused by mutations in genes encoding complex I structural or assembly components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fassone and Rahman, 2012</xref>). Complex I deficiency encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Koene et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bjorkman et al., 2015</xref>). NDUFS1 is the most commonly mutated nuclear gene causing complex I deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fassone and Rahman, 2012</xref>). NDUFS1 is an [Fe-S] cluster containing subunit involved in electron transfer that lies within the N module of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wirth et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in NDUFS1 typically cause severe and rapidly progressive leukoencephalopathy and death within the first two years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kashani et al., 2014</xref>). However, phenotypic heterogeneity has been reported in NDUFS1 complex I deficiency, including several paediatric patients with much more mild symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hoefs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ferreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fassone and Rahman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kashani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bjorkman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Animal models of mitochondrial disease have been highly successful in revealing underlying mechanisms and identifying potential disease modifying therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Duncan and Bateman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hunt and Bateman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Granat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">van de Wal et al., 2022</xref>). Mirroring the diversity of mitochondrial diseases, animal models can vary greatly in the range and severity of phenotypes. However, none of these models have recapitulated the phenotypic heterogeneity observed within mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in the same gene. We recently generated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of complex I deficiency using knockdown of the complex I subunit NDUFS1 (ND-75) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Granat et al., 2023</xref>). Knockdown of ND-75 in this model is highly efficient and results in severe neurological symptoms and very early death, reflecting severe complex I deficiency. Here, we have used an independent RNAi against ND-75 that is much less efficient and causes a weaker knockdown. We find that this weak ND-75 RNAi results in far milder behavioural and cellular phenotypes. Importantly, weak knockdown of ND-75 does not cause changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contacts or activation of ATF4 in neurons. Interestingly, weak ND-75 knockdown in neurons causes significant transcriptional and metabolic changes in the brain but these diverge from strong knockdown of ND-75. The genetic tools that we have characterised provide a powerful system for studying the mechanisms contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity in mitochondrial disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Manipulation of ND-75 knockdown efficiency using RNAi</title><p id="P7">Mutations in <italic>NDUFS1</italic> cause complex I deficiency and Leigh syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Koene et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lake et al., 2016</xref>). NDUFS1 lies within the N module of complex I and is an [Fe-S] cluster containing core subunit involved in electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wirth et al., 2016</xref>). To model the phenotypic heterogeneity of complex I deficiency we utilised two independent non-overlapping ND-75 RNA interference (RNAi) lines with different knock-down efficiencies, ND-75<sup>KK108222</sup> and ND-75<sup>HMS00853</sup>, hereafter referred to as ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> respectively (Supplemental Figure S1A).</p><p id="P8">To compare the effects of ubiquitous ND-75 knockdown using these two RNAi lines in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> we expressed ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> using <italic>Tub-Gal4</italic>, however this resulted in embryonic lethality. To circumvent this, we used two strategies: 1. The GeneSwitch system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Roman et al., 2001</xref>), using <italic>da-GSGAL4</italic> to restrict ubiquitous ND-75 knockdown to adult flies; 2. ubiquitous expression during development using <italic>Tub-GAL4</italic> together with a temperature-sensitive repressor of Gal4, <italic>Tub-GAL80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>, 25°C (Gal80<sup>ts</sup> is inactive at 30°C and partially active at 25°C (McGuire et al., 2003)).</p><p id="P9">Ubiquitous expression of ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> in adult flies with <italic>da-GSGAL4</italic> for five days caused a 40% and 88% reduction in ND-75 mRNA levels respectively (Supplemental Figure S1B). Analysis of rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidation in mitochondria from adult flies expressing ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> with <italic>da-GSGAL4</italic> showed they had similar complex I activity to controls, while flies expressing ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> had an 87% reduction in complex I activity (Supplemental Figure S1C). Loss of individual complex I subunits can result in collapse of the whole complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ugalde et al., 2004</xref>). To test this possibility, we analysed the level of ND-30 expression, the orthologue of mammalian NDUFS4 and a component of Q module of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). ND-30 expression was unaffected in flies expressing ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> with <italic>da-GSGAL4</italic> but ND-30 levels were significantly reduced in flies expressing ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> (Supplemental Figure S1D-F). Consistent with these data, ubiquitous expression of ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> but not ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> in adult flies using <italic>da-GSGAL4</italic> caused a significant reduction in climbing ability (Supplemental Figure S1G).</p><p id="P10">ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> expression with <italic>Tub-GAL80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>; Tub-GAL4</italic> at 25°C caused developmental lethality.

These escaper flies had a 79% reduction in ND-75 expression and, although insufficient in number to isolate mitochondria and analyse complex I activity, showed a significant decrease in ND-30 levels and severely reduced climbing ability (Supplemental Figure S1H-L), indicating loss of complex I activity.</p><p id="P11">Taken together, use of these two ubiquitous expression methods show that loss of complex I activity, the associated loss of ND-30 expression and reduced climbing ability requires at least a 40% reduction in ND-75 gene expression. Moreover, these data demonstrate that both ND-75 RNAi lines are capable of efficient ND-75 knockdown, but ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> is more potent than ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Knockdown of ND-75 in neurons models the phenotypic heterogeneity of complex I deficiency</title><p id="P12">Complex I deficiency primarily affects the nervous system in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Koene et al., 2012</xref>). To model the phenotypic heterogeneity of complex I deficiency in the nervous system, we induced pan-neuronal expression of ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstong</sup> using <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic>. ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> expression in neurons using <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> caused an inability to climb and pupal lethality respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We next measured open-field behaviour in pan-neuronal ND-75<sup>KD</sup> flies. The average speed and total distance moved by ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies was dramatically reduced, and immobility was increased compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-E</xref>).

Using a mechanical stress-induced seizure assay we found that pan-neuronal expression of ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> in neurons caused a dramatic seizure phenotype, with 94% of flies developing seizures, which were significantly longer than controls and, in some cases, lasting four to five minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).

In order to understand the differences in the transcriptional response to pan-neuronal weak and strong ND-75 knockdown using <italic>Tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>; nSyb-Gal4</italic>, we performed RNA sequencing of fly heads. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed the two ND-75 knockdown groups were well separated from each other and the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In total there were 1127 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies compared to control, of which 501 were up- and 626 genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>; Supplemental tables S1, S2).

Of these, 373 were upregulated, while 135 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, D</xref>; Supplemental tables S3, S4). Although there were fewer DEGs, the average fold change of the upregulated DEGs in ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies (FC=8.41) was significantly higher than in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies (FC=5.2, p=1.56x10<sup>-5</sup>), indicating that strong ND-75 knockdown elicits a more pronounced increase in DEG expression.

Interestingly, five of these were similarly increased or decreased in both conditions (6-aminocaproic acid, D-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, glutaminic acid, succinic acid and mannose/fructose), whereas gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were decreased in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies but increased in ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; Supplemental Figure 3A, B; Supplemental Tables S6, S7). As the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA may contribute to the behavioural defects caused by strong ND-75 knockdown.</p><p id="P26">We performed metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) to identify biological processes or molecular pathways that were significantly dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Xia and Wishart, 2010</xref>). ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> expression led to significant dysregulation in 22 of 54 (41%) human KEGG pathways (Supplemental Figure S3C). In comparison, ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> expression caused significant dysregulation in 44 of 54 KEGG pathways examined (81%) (Supplemental Figure S3D). Comparison of the weak and strong ND-75 knockdown MSEA highlighted several processes that were dysregulated specifically in ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies including the pentose phosphate pathway, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, beta alanine metabolism, lysine degradation and galactose metabolism (Supplemental Figure S3C, D). Moreover, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels were strongly increased in ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> but not ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). 2-HG is synthesised from the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate and we and others have shown 2-HG levels are increased as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and contribute to neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Burr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P27">MSEA revealed that the TCA cycle was dysregulated in both ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies (Supplemental Figure S3C, D). Mitochondrial complex I is functionally coupled to the TCA cycle. NADH oxidation by FMN within the matrix arm of complex I replenishes NAD+, a co-factor required for the generation of α-ketoglutarate from isocitrate, succinyl-CoA from α-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate from malate (Supplemental Figure S3E). Expression of ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> led to a significant rise in citrate/isocitrate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), whereas expression of ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, both the ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> and ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> induced a significant increase in aconitate, an intermediate in the conversion of citrate to isocitrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with the changes in 2-HG levels, expression of ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> but not ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> caused a significant elevation in α-ketoglutarate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), and both produced a significant, comparable reduction in succinate (succinic acid) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Expression of ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup>, but not ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> led to a significant increase in fumarate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>), whereas neither had any significant effect on malate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>). Succinyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, the remaining TCA cycle intermediates, were not detected. Taken together, these data demonstrate that neuronal-specific knockdown of ND-75 leads to significant metabolic abnormalities in a range of metabolic pathways, including the TCA cycle, and that the severity of metabolic dysfunction is dependent on the extent of ND-75 knockdown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Primary mitochondrial diseases have a common cause but are highly heterogeneous. We have modelled this heterogeneity using a knockdown approach in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using two independent ND-75 RNAi lines, our data show that the behavioural phenotypes and mitochondrial morphology defects caused by complex I deficiency in neurons correlate with the ND-75 knockdown efficiency. However, the loss of ER-mitochondria contacts and activation of the UPR only occur with strong ND-75 knockdown. The transcriptional and metabolic changes caused by weak and strong ND-75 knockdown provide mechanistic insight and highlight specific molecular functions and metabolic pathways that differentiate the heterogeneity in complex I deficiency. Thus, our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model has good face validity for complex I deficiency and provides new insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with phenotypic heterogeneity.</p><p id="P29">Complex I deficiency typically manifests with neonatal-onset lactic acidosis or encephalomyopathies, Leigh syndrome, leukoencephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance and is often fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fassone and Rahman, 2012</xref>). However, heterogeneity has been documented in patients with mutations in several different complex I subunits. Missense mutations in the assembly factor NDUFAF5 cause low complex I activity resulting in classical early onset Leigh syndrome with onset before six months and death by three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gerards et al., 2010</xref>). However, several adult patients have been reported with more mild loss of complex I activity and minor neurological involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gerards et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Simon et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, paediatric patients with mutations in the complex I accessory subunit NDUFA12 exhibited a range in the onset of motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Torraco et al., 2021</xref>). Patients with NDUFS1 mutations most frequently manifest with severe neonatal rapidly progressive leukoencephalopathy that is fatal. However, a seven-year-old patient with a missense mutation in NDUFS1 had developmental delay and early motor symptoms associated with infections that gradually improved to the point where he was in generally good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kashani et al., 2014</xref>). This patient’s fibroblasts showed complex I activity was reduced to 20% of control cells. Björkman et al., described three patients with NDUFS1 mutations, two with severe symptoms who died within six weeks of birth and a third three-and-a-half-year-old with much milder symptoms, including hypertonia, who had normal language development and crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bjorkman et al., 2015</xref>). Pyruvate + malate and NADH ferricyanide reductase activities in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria were outside the normal range but more mildly affected in this patient than the severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bjorkman et al., 2015</xref>). Although limited in number, these clinical studies demonstrate that the mild behavioural phenotypes in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies reflect the symptoms caused by rare NDUFS1 mutations that likely cause a less severe loss of complex I activity.</p><p id="P30">The two ND-75 RNAi lines used both target non-overlapping regions towards the end of the gene (Supplemental Figure S1A). The difference in efficiency between the two RNAis can likely be explained by their properties; ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), whereas ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup>, encodes a long hairpin RNA (lhRNA) (Supplemental Figure S1A). Previous comparisons of shRNAs and lhRNAs targeting same gene have revealed that shRNAs consistently produce stronger phenotypes than lhRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bartoletti et al., 2017</xref>), strongly suggesting that shRNAs, which mimic endogenous microRNAs, are more efficient at reducing mRNA levels. Consistent with this, ubiquitous knockdown (using <italic>Da-Gal4</italic>) of ND-75 with an independent lhRNA produced viable flies with an approximately 50% reduction in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hegde et al., 2014</xref>). It will be interesting in future to employ the RNAi lines we have characterised to model the effects of complex I deficiency and phenotypic heterogeneity in other tissues, such as muscle, affected in mitochondrial disease patients.</p><p id="P31">ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> flies had loss of climbing ability, severe loss of locomotor function, seizures and greatly reduced lifespan. By contrast, the only behavioural defect in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies was a mild reduction in locomotor function. However, several cellular and molecular changes were evident in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies, including increased mitochondrial number and volume in neurons, 1127 DEGs and altered levels of 11 metabolites in the brain. Significantly, ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> expression did not activate ATF4, suggesting that the severe behavioural phenotypes caused by strong ND-75 knockdown are associated with ATF4 expression in neurons. Consistent with this, expression of <italic>Ldh</italic>, which is an ATF4 target in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>), is strongly increased in ND-75<sup>KDstrong</sup> but not in ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies. Moreover, we previously showed in an independent <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondrial dysfunction model that activation of ATF4 in neurons causes increased 2-HG levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>). 2-HG is also increased in cells from patients with a form of Leigh syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Burr et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, metabolomic analysis of children with mutations in respiratory chain complex I, complex III or multiple complex deficiencies showed they had significantly increased 2-HG levels in urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Reinecke et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, 2-HG may have potential as a prognostic biomarker for severe mitochondrial disease involving activation of ATF4.</p><p id="P32">The transcriptomic and metabolomic data also show that large scale transcriptional and limited metabolic changes in the brain of ND-75<sup>KDweak</sup> flies occur in the absence of ATF4 activation. These transcriptional and metabolic changes indicate distinct (e.g. proteosome activity and immune response genes) responses to mild complex I deficiency that do not involve UPR activation. It will be interesting in future to investigate the signalling pathways and transcription factors responsible.</p><p id="P33">Overall, our study illustrates how using RNAis with different efficiencies to knockdown the same OXPHOS subunit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a powerful means of modelling mitochondrial disease phenotypic heterogeneity. It will be interesting to compare these findings with future studies in complex I deficiency patients and of patient-derived cells to determine the predictive power of our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Fly strains and growth conditions</title><p id="P34">Flies were maintained on standard food (per litre: 6.4 g Agar (Fisher), 64 g glucose (Sigma), 16 g ground yellow corn and 80 g Brewer’s yeast (MP Biomed Europe), 3 ml propionic acid (Fisher), 1.8 g methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (Sigma), 16 ml ethanol (Sigma)) at 25°C in a 12 hour light/dark cycle unless stated otherwise.
