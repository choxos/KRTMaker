Given the respiratory epithelium is a source of CL-11 and downstream complement-pathway components, we investigated the potential of CL-11 to impact the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. While the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer could bind CL-11 and trigger complement activation followed by MAC formation, the virus was resistant to lysis. Surprisingly, virus production by infected respiratory epithelial cells was enhanced by CL-11 opsonisation of virus but this effect was fully inhibited by sugar-blockade of CL-11. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed at the bronchial epithelial cell surface was associated with increased CL-11 binding and MAC formation. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is exacerbated both by resistance to complement and CL-11 driven respiratory cell invasion and injury at the portal of entry. Contrary to expectation, CL-11 blockade could offer a novel approach to limit the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Complement is a major part of the innate immune system for detecting and eliminating invasive pathogens and signalling to the antigen-specific arm of the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. That many successful pathogens resist or usurp complement is indicative of the potency of complement as an antimicrobial deterrent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Activation of the complement system is initiated by pattern recognition molecules (PRM). C1q is the main PRM for the classical pathway for detecting antigen-antibody complexes, leading to the assembly of C4 and C2 and subsequent cleavage of C3, the central complement component. Collectins and ficolins are PRMs for the lectin pathway, detecting carbohydrate signatures on the activating surface prior to assembly of C4 and C2 and cleavage of C3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The alternative pathway is different because it has no specific PRM and appears to play a secondary role amplifying cleaved C3 deposited by the classical or the lectin pathway, using complement factors B and D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The discovery of collectin-11 (CL-11) has sparked new interest in the collectin family of PRMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Each CL-11 polypeptide includes a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and a collagen-like domain (CLD). These combine to form trimers and multiples of trimers with increased avidity for carbohydrate ligands typically fucosylated glycans and high mannose oligosaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Like the structurally similar mannan-binding lectin (MBL), CL-11 can interact with a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. But only CL-11 is synthesised in peripheral tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> whereas MBL is entirely produced by hepatocytes and present in the blood; and the large molecular size of MBL oligomers (400-700 kDa) may preclude extravasation. This compartmental separation has led to the idea that CL-11 acts as a guardian of the extravascular tissue space, particularly at epithelial surfaces where the secretion of CL-11 parallels that of other essential complement proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, MBL may primarily serve the intravascular compartment to protect against haematogenous spread of infection.</p><p id="P7">Like other collectins, CL-11 physically combines with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs 1-3), of which MASP-2 is the main lectin pathway enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Upon contact of the lectin with an activating surface, MASP-2 mediates the cleavage of C4 and then C2 to form C4bC2b, i.e., the C3 convertase shared with the classical pathway. Subsequent cleavage of C3 and then C5 leads to the formation of C3a, C3b, C5a and C5b-9; these complement effectors promote inflammation, opsonisation, and formation of membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) downstream of pathogen recognition.</p><p id="P8">Clinicopathological studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have suggested a link between severe lung inflammation and detection of complement factors that specify the lectin pathway, such as MBL, MASP-2 and C3b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The presence of microvascular thrombosis, also a feature of severe lung pathology in this condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> is a hallmark of complement activation particularly by the lectin pathway proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, a genome-wide study has identified an association between COVID-19 disease severity and CL-11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. It is also important to emphasise that early structural modelling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein - instrumental for the receptor recognition and membrane fusion process of cell entry – predicted 12 putative sites with which with CL-11 could interact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Based on these clinical, genetic, and structural observations, we set out to investigate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with CL-11 and determine the impact of complement activation on the virus and on virus-infected cells at the portal of viral entry. Our study unequivocally demonstrates interaction of CL-11 with SARS-CoV-2 and specifically the spike protein. Moreover, it reveals a significant effect of bound CL-11 on viral infectivity of respiratory epithelial cells exacerbated by cell-autonomous activation of complement.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><label>1</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 binds CL-11 by its carbohydrate recognition site</title><p id="P10">At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic we predicted that the pattern recognition molecule, CL-11, which is produced at the respiratory epithelial surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, would engage with SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This assumption built on historical evidence of SARS-Co-V interacting with the related collectin, MBL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and the modelled crystal structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is rich in glycan signatures that can be recognised by CL-11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The starting point of our study was to investigate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein to interact with CL-11. We carried out binding assays with immobilised UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and immobilised spike trimer to address the interaction with human recombinant CL-11 (rCL-11). Our results confirmed rCL-11 binding by SARS-CoV-2 and spike protein in proportion to the dose of the virus or spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a-d</xref>). It is important to note that CL-11 demonstrated equivalent binding to both the ancestral Wuhan spike protein and the later Omicron BA.1 variant spike protein (EC50 values of 7.6 (± 4.2) × 10<sup>−9</sup> M and 6.0 (± 2.6) × 10<sup>−9</sup> M respectively), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>. Controls for non-specific binding of rCL-11 used the immobilised non-glycosylated protein BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b &amp; c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next assessed whether membrane-expressed spike protein would also bind CL-11. For this, we incubated spike-transfected HEK293T cells with a fixed amount of rCL-11. Flow cytometry demonstrated significant binding of rCL-11 to cells expressing cell surface spike compared to transfected cells negative for cell surface expressed spike or empty vector (EV), control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data provide strong evidence that CL-11 readily interacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (as predicted from the crystal structure) when the protein is expressed on cells or immobilised on plastic.</p><p id="P12">Our experiments went on to address whether the interaction with spike protein involved the CRD of CL-11. In theory binding of CL-11 to a target surface could occur either through the CRD of CL-11 or its CLD. Binding by the CRD of C-type lectins such as CL-11 has two distinct properties: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding to the target substrate; and sugar-inhibitable binding. A series of experiments using HEK293T-cell-expressed spike trimer or plate-immobilsed spike trimer as the binding target determined rCL-11 binding to be both EDTA and sugar-inhibitable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). Thus, treatment with increasing concentrations of L-fucose to saturate the CRD of CL-11 typically inhibited rCL-11 binding to the target by &gt;90%. LIkewise, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EDTA inhibited the CL-11/spike interaction by a similar amount. Inhibition was less effective with D-galactose control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), which has been shown to have significantly lower binding avidity for CL-11 than L-fucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We concluded from these initial experiments that the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and CL-11 is mediated by the CRD of CL-11, an interaction which is potentially blocked in the presence high concentrations of L-fucose.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><label>2</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement activation</title><p id="P14">Since our data indicated rCL-11 present at a concentration equivalent to the level in normal human serum (NHS; 0.1-0.5μg/ml; 0.95-4.76 nM) was bound by SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>), we examined how well SARS-CoV-2 could stimulate complement activation in NHS, where other essential complement components are present. In the first of two independent approaches, we measured the soluble complement activation products C3a and C5a released into the supernatants after incubating SARS-CoV-2 virions with NHS as the source of complement. The levels of C3a and C5a generated were significantly above those in control samples in the absence of added virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The basal levels of C3a and C5a detected in these control assays are likely to reflect the presence of these products in NHS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> or may represent low-level complement activation on the plastic surface of the assay system.</p><p id="P15">Using a second approach, we examined the deposition of C3d and C5b-9 on UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions immobilised on plastic wells, where C3d is the end metabolite of bound C3b deposited on an activating surface and C5b-9 is MAC formed after cleavage of C5. We detected significant increases of bound C3d and C5b-9, as compared with control measurements where immobilised BSA replaced the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). The deposition of complement was dose-sensitive over a range of serum dilutions (0-10% NHS). These data indicate a low threshold for complement activation by SARS-CoV-2 under the assay conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>3</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to complement-mediated lysis</title><p id="P16">Because COVID-19 can be a clinically aggressive disease, despite activation of the complement cascade (as confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>), we questioned whether the virus could be resistant to complement-mediated lysis, as reported for some other viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To test this we assessed the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to resist virion lysis by NHS. We incubated SARS-CoV-2 virions with NHS and Ribonuclease A (RNase A) and then determined the ability of RNAse A to access the genomic RNA and degrade virions upon virolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In control studies where SARS-CoV-2 was treated with the detergent Triton-X instead of serum, as expected qPCR detected negligible genomic viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Conversely, the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not statistically reduced when virus treated with NHS (1-10%) when cross-compared with untreated virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To further probe the role of CL-11, we used NHS supplemented with rCL-11 in a final concentration (1-10µg/ml; 9.52nM-95.24nM) predetermined to give adequate binding with SARS-CoV-2 as in earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). However, the NHS enriched with CL-11 had no detectable effect on virolysis compared with non-enriched NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In addition to virolysis, we performed infectivity assays to determine whether NHS (sero-negative for SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody as determined by ELISA) had any impact on ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and produce infectious virus. Here, Vero cells were exposed to a fixed amount of SARS-CoV-2 that had been pretreated with NHS or heat-inactivated NHS (HI NHS). No loss of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity after exposure of virus to as much as 25% NHS was detected when cross-compared with exposure to HI NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Resistance to serum-mediated virolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>) was one possible explanation for how infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was unimpeded in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We then went on to explore another possibility: that CL-11 binding could have had a compounding effect on viral infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>4</label><title>Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced by bound CL-11</title><p id="P18">Certain human pathogens have adapted to complement allowing the microrganisms to escape destruction and promote tissue invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We constructed an assay where respiratory epithelial cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 that had been coated or not with CL-11, followed by quantification of virus released into the culture supernatant using a plaque forming assay (PFA) in Vero cells. In an exploratory experiment we incubated SARS-CoV-2 (England 02/2020) with rCL-11 over a range of pre-determined concentrations up to 10µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Remarkably, infectivity of the CL-11-opsonised virus was up to 3.2-fold higher than for non-opsonised virus, based on the titre of virus released from infected bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells engineered to express ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>). We also observed that lung epithelial Calu-3 cells, which naturally express ACE2 and entry co-factors TMPRSS2 and TEMPRSS4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> exhibited a similar degree of susceptibility to rCL-11-treated virus as BEAS-2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b,c</xref>). Likewise, we also detected a 3-4 fold enhancement of infection with the highly transmissible and infectious B.1.1617.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> in BEAS-2B and Calu-3 cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d-f</xref>). Generally, the amplifying effect of rCL-11 was dose-dependent with a peak effect between 1-10µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-f</xref>). The reproducibility of the opsonising effect of rCL-11 for different cells and different viral strains is indicative of conserved virus-expressed glycans critical for CL-11 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">To corroborate the importance of glycan recognition by CL-11 for enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, we preincubated rCL-11 with monosaccharide to saturate the carbohydrate-binding site on rCL-11 before mixing with the virus. We determined that preincubation of rCL-11 with L-fucose (1mM or 10mM) fully ablated the enhancing effect of CL-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). D-galactose, which has lower binding avidity for CL-11 compared to L-fucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> had a partial blocking effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). These experiments indicated that interaction via the CRD of CL-11, rather than the CLD, was primarily responsible for driving the enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P20">The above infectivity experiments were conducted in the absence of exogenous complement. To understand whether the effect of CL-11 upon viral infectivity was maintained in the presence of complement, we performed assays in which rCL-11 had been spiked with NHS (10%) before mixing with SARS-CoV-2. To that end, we included adequate provision of complement factors (as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) alongside rCL-11 to test the impact of complement factors on enhanced viral infectivity driven by rCL-11. We observed that CL-11-enhanced virus infectivity was not dependent on or limited by the provision of complement excess in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>5</label><title>Respiratory epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 are sensitive to cell-autonomous complement</title><p id="P21">We envisage that locally produced CL-11 interacting with SARS-CoV-2 facilitates infectivity at the portal of entry and, in turn, virus-infected cells autoactivate complement through CL-11 binding. Suporting this hypothesis, we found that BEAS-2B cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 markedly upregulated gene expression of CL-11 and the core components of complement, C3 and C5. This occurred over time and in proportion to the virus dose (MOI), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, detection of CL-11 and C3d proteins at the cell surface (of non-permeabilised cells) was most evident at higher virus MOIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2</xref> respectively), notably associated with the subpopulation of BEAS-2B cells expressing cell surface SARS-CoV-2 spike (spike<sup>+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,f</xref>, respectively). Co-localisation of staining for cell-surface SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and CL-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>, top row) or C3d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d</xref>, top row) was partial, meaning that the area of CL-11 and complement deposition was not limited to foci where spike protein was detected but it affected a wider surface area of virus-stressed cells. Complement activation proceeded to form membrane attack complex C5b-9 that was increased at the higher MOI of SARS-CoV-2, in spike<sup>+</sup> expressing cells compared to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that cell stress in general and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell surface in particular induced CL-11 binding and complement deposition following viral infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Our data suggests CL-11 (a C-type lectin) is an important first-line defence of innate immunity produced at the respiratory epithelium at the point of contact with airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, our study reveals that while production of CL-11 is enhanced by virus-infected respiratory epithelial cells and the lectin is directly bound by virus to trigger complement activation, the virus is resistant to complement-mediated lysis. Yet, once infected by SARS-CoV-2, respiratory epithelial cells expressing the spike protein are targeted by endogenous CL-11 and downstream complement activation products. These findings are consistent with reports on post-mortem analysis of lung tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> providing evidence of profound complement activation associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen, indicative of overwhelming inflammation and viral persistence at the portal of entry.</p><p id="P23">During our study a report was published showing immobilised SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer could deposit CL-11 from normal serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Our data significantly extend these findings with new insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, using rCL-11 to probe the interaction with immobilised virus and spike protein and with membrane-expressed spike protein. Notably, we demonstrated, the sugar- and EDTA-inhibitable nature of the interaction was typical of C-type lectin binding by the CRD of CL-11, validating the integrity of the recombinant lectin generated with an in-house mammalian (CHO) expression system. In contrast, another recently published study using a commercial wheat germ-derived rCL-11 did not detect interaction with solid-phase immobilised spike protein of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In our hands, comparison of CHO-expressed rCL-11 with the wheat-germ-derived rCL-11 (from the same commercial supplier as in the reported study) confirmed strong binding with our CHO-expressed rCL-11 but found negligible binding of the wheat germ-derived rCL-11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Correct protein folding required for functional activity of CL-11 could have differed between the two recombinant proteins. Equally, lack of post-translational modifications (including glycosylation, hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in the CLD and disulphide bond formation) inherent in the wheat germ system may have accounted for the differences in the CL-11 binding detected. The data presented here and in an independent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, along with the predicted glycan interaction sites on the spike trimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, robustly support a role for CL-11 interacting with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P24">Following complement activation, susceptible C3-opsonised viruses are cleared by phagocytosis or, in the case of enveloped viruses, through lysis by MAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Several viral pathogens, however, have evolved resistance to the effects of complement. Among the mechanisms of resistance, viruses can express novel proteins or capture host proteins that inhibit C3 or C4 convertases or block subsequent MAC assembly. For example, the NS1 protein of Flaviviruses leads to the recruitment of several different host complement-regulatory proteins that either inhibit the classical or alternative pathways of complement activation or inhibit the formation of MAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Another evasion mechanism is mounted by HIV-1, which adsorbs human GPI-anchored complement-regulatory proteins for protection against C3 cleavage and MAC formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We propose that selective pressure imposed by complement in a zoonotic reservoir has caused SARS-CoV-2 to evolve a mechanism that confers relative resistance to elimination by complement. It is entirely feasible, for example, that exposure to the complement system in bats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> may be a factor in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 before transmission to humans.</p><p id="P25">Early host defences at epithelial surfaces are recognised to impact pathogen spread and disease sequelae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. A notable finding of our data was the effect of rCL-11 enhancing viral infectivity. While other common pathogens (e.g., HIV-1 and <italic>E. coli</italic>) use bound C3b to enhance the infectivity of cells expressing complement receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, we found no evidence for such a mechanism in our experiments where virus incubated with CL-11 in the presence of 10% NHS did not enhance viral infectivity over that with CL-11 alone. Therefore, C3b mediated opsonisation of SARS-CoV-2 was non-essential for CL-11 driven enhancement of infectivity in our system. This implies other properties of CL-11 require consideration. For example, CL-11 is an oligomeric protein whose multivalency in conjunction with reactivity to both viral and mammalian glycan ligands may permit cross-linking of the virus with the epithelial cell surface. This could possibly increase internalisation or processing of the virus by cells expressing the ACE2 host-cell attachment receptor. The property to usurp CL-11 may be important for Wuhan-like viruses with lower affinity for ACE2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> to establish infection in respiratory epithelia that express lower levels of ACE2 compared to other tissues such as heart and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. We suggest that complement-resistance combined with enhanced infectivity mediated by CL-11 may act as pathogenicity factors in the course of infection.</p><p id="P26">Cell-autonomous damage by complement is a feature of epithelial cell stress in the presence infectious and sterile (e.g., hypoxia) noxious stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Our data show enhanced deposition of CL-11 and complement products (C3d and C5b-9) on SARS-CoV-2 infected respiratory epithelial cells, both at sites where spike protein is detected and extending to loci where no spike protein was present. This implies CL-11 interacts with both stress-associated and spike-associated glycans along the surface of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Our data are consistent with a primary role for the lectin complement pathway triggered by CL-11 binding to the infected cells. A secondary effect of the alternative pathway adding to the deposition of complement on respiratory epithelial cells is not ruled out by our data. Indeed, the secretome of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells contains factors D and B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, which are key components of the alternative pathway and are brought into play by the lectin-pathway enzyme MASP-3 acting on factor D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">CL-11 belongs to a family of collectins that includes the structurally related MBL. While CL-11 and MBL share similarities including the range of glycans recognised, only CL-11 is synthesised in peripheral tissues, noticeably at epithelial surfaces including the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. An analysis of MBL has defined a potential role for neutralising SARS-CoV-2, relevant to the prevention of systemic spread of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The difference here is that our study (of Cl-11) defines a potential role for CL-11 in the regional tissue response to the virus at the portal of entry. Future, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies may be best placed to analyse the biological significance of this compartmental model, which has implications for how, when and where treatment can be effectively delivered during early exposure to virus.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, our results advance the notion that SARS-CoV-2 usurps the local defence system provided by CL-11 at the portal of viral invasion of the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Virus treated with CL-11 was not only resistant to complement lysis, but the CL-11 opsonised virus displayed enhanced infectivity of respiratory epithelial cells. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells demonstrated self-inflicted damage through CL-11 and complement deposition. In principle, this cycle of infection and cell injury can be broken by blocking CL-11 from interacting with glycan ligand, as shown by sugar blockade of the CRD of CL-11 in the present study, and previously in models of hypoxic tissue injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Recombinant proteins, serum and antibodies</title><p id="P29">Recombinant human collectin-11 (rCL-11) was expressed in mammalian CHO cells and purified as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

(3); CL-11-opsonised virus exhibits enhanced infectivity, i.e., increased release of virus into the extracellular space of virus-infected cells by 3-4-fold; (4) virus-infected respiratory epithelial cells demonstrate cell-autonomous deposition of CL-11 and form complement products typically associated with inflammasome activation and membrane injury, (5), the cycle of enhanced infectivity can be
