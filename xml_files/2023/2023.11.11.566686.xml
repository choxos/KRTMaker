Signals are transduced by four different kinases, namely heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), whose activation results in the direct phosphorylation of a common downstream substrate, the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This step reduces the availability of the active Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>/eIF2/GTP ternary complex and leads to stalling of translation initiation followed by ribosome run-off and polysome disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. As a result, high local concentrations of released mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins trigger cytosolic phase separation and thereby drive the condensation of stress granules (SGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In parallel, translational attenuation by increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) promotes the expression of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> encoding Growth Arrest and DNA Damage inducible 34 (GADD34), a stress-induced adaptor protein that in complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) mediates the dephosphorylation of eIF2α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This negative feedback loop antagonizes prolonged activation of the ISR, allowing resumption of translation and return to homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Under normal conditions, maintenance of eIF2α in its non-phosphorylated form is essential for continuous translation. This is primarily achieved by the constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation (CReP), an alternative adaptor protein that targets PP1 to eIF2α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In the absence of stress, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is expressed at low levels and is translationally repressed by two non-overlapping upstream open frames (uORFs) within the 5’ untranslated region (UTR). Under stress conditions, when the availability of active ternary complex is limiting, uORF translation ceases and ribosomal read-through allows translation of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> main ORF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. At the same time, two stress-responsive transcription factors, the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), are upregulated and induce transcription of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Throughout this process, GADD34 is short-lived as a result of proteasomal degradation, enabling tight temporal control of its levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">We have previously described a unique example of a highly dynamic stress response to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), characterized by alternating phases of SG assembly and disassembly, which coincide with phases of stalled and active translation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. By integrating quantitative experiments with mathematical modelling, we established that the molecular network generating this dynamic ISR is regulated by a stochastic process with memory, whereby cells switch to phases of SG assembly based on their previous experience. While we identified stochastic bursts of GADD34 expression and rapid GADD34 turnover as important determinants of this unique temporal control, we also found that <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels remain elevated for a prolonged period after stress release, beyond the time when transcription is turned off. <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels gradually return to their initial level over a period of approximately 20 hours, which delineates a window of cell adaptation to stress. Together, these results suggested that <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA acts as a molecular memory of previous ISR activation, facilitating subsequent bursts of GADD34 synthesis and hence rapid changes in eIF2α phosphorylation levels when cells are exposed to prolonged or repeated stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These findings raise the question whether active control of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA stability might serve as an additional, post-transcriptional layer at which the ISR and stress adaptation are regulated.</p><p id="P5">The balance between transcription and decay determines the abundance of every mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. mRNA turnover is frequently regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the 3’ UTR, which can enhance or repress the stability of mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Among them, AU-rich elements (AREs) represent a major class of mRNA destabilizing elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> whose recognition by different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) causes rapid mRNA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, suppresses translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or enhances transcript stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Rapid degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs is initiated through deadenylation by the CCR4/NOT complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, followed by decay from the 3’ end through the exosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> or from the 5’ end by decapping and the exoribonuclease XRN-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The human tristetraprolin (TTP, also known as ZFP36) family comprises three closely related RBPs: TTP, Butyrate Response Factor 1 (Brf1, also known as ZFP36L1) and Brf2 (ZFP36L2), all of which bind to the ARE of their target mRNAs through two tandem CCCH-type zinc finger domains (TZDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The activity of TTP and Brf1 is regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation at several serine residues upon activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38-MAPK)/MK2 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

To examine this possibility, we first measured <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover in Huh7 cells under normal conditions by actinomycin D chase experiments and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), using the stable <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA as a reference. Intriguingly, we found <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA to be short-lived compared to <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA, with a half-life of approximately 1.2 hours (t<sub>1/2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon chronic infection with HCV, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA was weakly stabilized (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.6 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> left panel). This effect was stronger when the infection occurred in the presence IFN-α (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.4 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> right panel), consistent with our previous observation of a more dynamic SG response in infected cells treated with IFN-α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We next investigated whether <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA stabilization might also occur in response to infection with dengue virus (DENV), a closely related RNA virus whose course of infection is acute, in contrast to HCV. Stabilization of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA was observed early during infection (8 hpi t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.4 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and became more pronounced at a later stage (30 hpi t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 10 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting a dynamic regulation of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover over time. Despite different infection courses, the two viruses share a common feature in that they generate double-stranded (ds) RNA during genome replication. Transfection of cells with synthetic dsRNA also led to a strong stabilization (t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 10 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that the regulation of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover is triggered by the detection of dsRNA rather than by viral proteins.</p><p id="P9">We next examined <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover in response to the activation of different eIF2α-kinases by potent chemical stress inducers. We first chose sodium arsenite, which induces oxidative stress through the activation of HRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Remarkably, acute treatment of cells with arsenite led to a strong stabilization of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA (t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 10 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then turned to PERK-mediated ER stress induced by thapsigargin treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, which cells can survive for more than 12 hours, to examine <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover over a longer period of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thapsigargin treatment strongly stabilized <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA within the acute phase of the stress response, i.e. the first three hours of treatment (1h Thap, t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 10 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thereafter, as the stress response progressed toward the adaptation phase, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA half-life gradually decreased over time (3h Thap, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 4.5 hours, and 6h Thap, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.9 hours), reaching at 12 hours (12h Thap, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.4 hours) a value that remained significantly higher than that measured under normal conditions (DMSO, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.3 hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This finding supports our previous prediction of a progressive decrease in <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels during the stress adaptation phase, requiring more than 12 hours to return to basal levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Since <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover is dynamically regulated in response to ISR activation by different triggers, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA stabilization appears to be a conserved mechanism that contributes to the ISR negative feedback loop.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover involves a destabilizing AU-rich element in the 3’ untranslated region</title><p id="P10">Targeted control of mRNA degradation is frequently mediated by RBPs that recognize specific binding sites located in the 3’ UTR of mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. With 85 nucleotides, the 3’ UTR of human <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is particularly short and comprises 70 percent adenosine (A) and uridine (U) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Further inspection of the GADD34 3’ UTR sequence identified two canonical AUUUA pentamers embedded in U-rich clusters, which is typical for AREs as a major class of mRNA destabilizing elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. To examine whether <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover is regulated via a functional ARE, we generated stable Huh7 cell lines expressing a rabbit β-globin reporter gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> in which we inserted, between the stop codon and the β-globin 3’ UTR, either the wild type <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> 3’ UTR sequence (GADD34) or a mutated sequence where both AUUUA pentamers were converted to AUGUA (GADD34<sub>MUT</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). As positive control, we used a β-globin reporter gene harboring the ARE of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) known to strongly accelerate mRNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Remarkably, insertion of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> 3’ UTR promoted the decay of the otherwise stable β-globin reporter mRNA (WT, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 12.3 hours; GADD34, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.9 hours) almost as efficiently as the TNF-α ARE (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.5 hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Mutation of the two AUUUA pentamers prevented rapid mRNA turnover (GADD34<sub>MUT</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 8.3 hours), confirming the presence of an active ARE with destabilizing activity in the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> 3’ UTR.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>PPP1R15A</italic> ARE regulates mRNA engagement with polysomes</title><p id="P11">To consolidate this result, we sought to explore the impact of deleting the ARE from the endogenous <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> locus, within the third exon of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). We generated Huh7 GADD34ΔARE single-cell clones using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and nucleofection of two CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting the regions immediately upstream and downstream of the ARE. Three homozygous KO cell clones were selected by analysis of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Additionally, control (Ctrl) cell clones were generated by nucleofection of non-targeting crRNAs. We analyzed <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels at steady state and upon treatment with thapsigargin. While deletion of the ARE did not significantly alter basal mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), it resulted in a stronger increase of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels in response to thapsigargin exposure during the stress adaptation phase, particularly at 6 hours post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result was supported by the slower decay of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA measured during stress adaptation, after treatment with thapsigargin for 3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, 3h Thap: Ctrl t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.7 hours, ΔARE t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt;10 hours). Interestingly, Huh7 GADD34ΔARE cells showed a modest though significant increase in the basal GADD34 mRNA half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, DMSO: Ctrl t<sub>1/2</sub> = 0.9 hours, ΔARE t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.2 hours).</p><p id="P12">Since AREs are also known to attenuate translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we tested whether ARE deletion affects the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA translation efficiency, and performed polysome profile analyses with Huh7 Ctrl and GADD34ΔARE cells treated with thapsigargin for different periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B and S1C</xref>).

As anticipated for the mRNA of a housekeeping gene, <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>) was enriched in the heavy polysomal fractions under basal conditions (DMSO). During the acute phase of stress (1h Thap), it shifted towards the monosomal and light polysomal fractions, reflecting substantial translational repression. Entering the stress adaptation phase (3 and 6h Thap), <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA progressively re-engaged with heavy polysomal fractions as global translation resumed. Importantly, <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA distribution in polysomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>) as well as its proportion associated with polysomes - estimated by calculating the area above the cumulative mRNA distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, top panel) - was identical in Ctrl and GADD34ΔARE cells. This result indicated that levels of global translation were similar in both cell lines.</p><p id="P13">In contrast to <italic>GAPDH, PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA showed the opposite pattern typical for a stress-induced protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>).

While the difference in the proportion of mRNA associated with polysomes was not significant (DMSO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> bottom panel), the observed shift in polysome distribution was consistent with the fact that ARE deletion led to a stronger increase in GADD34 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) than in <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Upon treatment with thapsigargin, both <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> and <italic>PPP1R15AΔARE</italic> mRNA shifted towards heavier polysomal fractions, reflecting their translational de-repression.

Extracts of myc-his tagged TTP and Brf1 expressing cells were separated by Phos-tag polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>). The phosphorylation pattern was compared to that of the non-phosphorylated forms (NP), obtained by treatment of the extracts with lambda protein phosphatase (λPPase).

Stimulation with thapsigargin resulted in a noticeable shift of TTP and Brf1 towards a hyper-phosphorylated form (HP) in the acute phase of the stress response (1h). HP levels decreased continuously thereafter, as cells progressed to the stress adaptation phase, reaching almost basal levels 12 hours after treatment. The observed dynamic regulation of ZFP36 protein phosphorylation correlated with the activation kinetics of the PI3K/Akt and p38-MAPK/MK2 signaling pathways and coincided with the decreased decay activity measured during the acute phase of the stress response (1h Thap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). During the stress adaptation phase, dephosphorylation of ZFP36 proteins went along with the decreasing MAPK activity and decreasing GADD34 expression levels (6h Thap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C and 5D</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that ZFP36 proteins are induced yet their decay activity is transiently inactivated by hyperphosphorylation during the acute phase of the ISR, thereby enabling efficient GADD34 expression.

With an estimated half-life below 1.5 hours, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA classifies among the five percent of fast-decaying cellular mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">When cells encounter stress conditions, the regulatory circuit switches: the pre-existing pool of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is markedly stabilized within the acute phase of the stress response, due to phosphorylation-induced inactivation of ZFP36 proteins by the stress-activated p38-MAPK/MK2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. The mechanism by which TTP and Brf1 are inactivated upon phosphorylation has been characterized previously: it involves binding of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to phosphorylated TTP or Brf1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, which leads to reduced association with the deadenylase machinery that triggers mRNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, and may further cause reduced affinity of ZFP36 proteins for ARE-containing target mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This regulation promotes the timely production of GADD34 during the acute phase of the ISR, before <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is transcriptionally and translationally induced as cells progress in the ISR. Stress-induced stabilization of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is transient and gradually decreases upon dephosphorylation and reactivation of ZFP36 proteins later during the stress adaptation phase. This mode of regulation resembles the stabilization of newly synthesized mRNAs during the acute phase of the unfolded protein response, in particular that of the stress induced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, which escapes translational repression because of poly(A) tail extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">Our results provide mechanistic insight into how <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels are regulated. The persistence of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA above basal levels as cells progress through the stress adaptation phase serves as a molecular memory of the previously activated ISR and allows for rapid translation of GADD34 in response to an increase in p-eIF2α levels when they encounter subsequent or continued stress. This molecular memory imposes a refractory phase and reduces responsiveness to stress by elevating the threshold at which the next ISR is triggered, thereby promoting cellular adaptation to acute and chronic stress of moderate intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p id="P37">The multilayer regulation of the GADD34 negative feedback loop underscores how important it is for cells to maintain low levels of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA under basal conditions. In line with this notion, deletion of the ARE at the endogenous <italic>PPP15R1A</italic> locus led to a moderate, albeit significant, stabilization of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA associated with enhanced translation and GADD34 expression. Notably, this effect was more pronounced during the stress adaptation phase. While a comparable phenotype has been previously reported upon deletion of the ARE in the TNF-α gene in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, other mechanisms may contribute to the rapid decay of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA. For example, as reported for the yeast CPA1 mRNA, ribosome stalling at a uORF termination codon may activate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Given that <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA translation in under control of two uORFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, such a mechanism could potentiate the effect of ARE-mediated mRNA decay on <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover. Other factors to consider are members of the ELAV family such as HuR, which have antagonistic functions to ZFP36 proteins and frequently stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs. Although HuR predominantly binds U- and CU-rich sequences, it recognizes over 80 % of the TTP binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and could therefore contribute to the stabilization of GADD34 mRNA under stress conditions. Depending on the cell type, differences in TTP, Brf1 and Hu expression levels may also play a role in determining the extent to which mRNA turnover controls GADD34 expression before, during and after the ISR.</p><p id="P38">Two of our observations suggest that ZFP36 family members are not simply redundant as temporal differences in their expression help to orchestrate the dynamics of GADD34 expression. First, their expression profile differs, with basal <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> mRNA levels encoding Brf1 being higher than those of <italic>ZFP36</italic> encoding TTP, while <italic>ZFP36</italic> mRNA expression levels exceed those of <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> in response to stress. Secondly, the results obtained with the single KO and DKO cell clones indicate that Brf1 activity is predominant under basal conditions, whereas TTP activity takes over in response to stress. Hence, it appears that the impact of ZFP36 family members follows the dynamics of their expression, and may render posttranscriptional control of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA stability sensitive to different signaling pathways such as p38-MAPK (TTP and Brf1) and Akt (Brf1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">An important outcome of our study is that alterations in the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA and, consequently, GADD34 expression levels, critically affect cellular responsiveness and adaptation to stress. Defective ARE-mediated mRNA decay in TTP and Brf1 DKO cells as well as in GADD34ΔARE cells led to elevated basal expression of GADD34, which in turn reduced the responsiveness to stress. Following stress exposure, these cells required a longer period of time to regain full responsiveness. Comparison of Huh7 DKO, TKO and GADD34 KO cells showed that <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA is a key target of TTP/Brf1 for controlling stress responsiveness and adaptation. In addition to its essential role as an eIF2α phosphatase, GADD34 appears to have independent functions, e.g. in facilitating adaptation to osmotic stress by ensuring the preservation of Golgi integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Increased GADD34 levels have also been reported to promote autophagy by suppressing mTOR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, and both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions have been assigned to GADD34, depending on its expression level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">By exploring the memory function of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA in recording cellular stress experience, and demonstrating the impact of <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA stability on memory timing, our study uncovers an unexpected link between the regulation of mRNA turnover and the intricate translational control system that governs the ISR.</p><sec id="S14"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P41">While our study is based on human hepatocarcinoma cells and makes use of a wide range of stressors including viral infection, further work will be required to understand the importance of this mechanism systems that strongly depend on GADD34 such as pancreatic beta cells or in a mouse model subjected to physiologically relevant stresses.

Supernatants were transferred into DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) and two aliquots of 40 µl each were kept for later RNA and protein input analyses. Binding conditions were optimized by adding NaCl and imidazole to the lysates to achieve a final concentration of 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole. Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) were pre-washed twice with 500 µl IP lysis buffer and added to samples (50 µl/sample).

Top panel: Exposure to an acute stress pulse results in phosphorylation of eIF2α and activation of the ISR, as well as inhibition of TTP and Brf1 decay activity by phosphorylation. Consequently, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA synthesis is amplified by the stabilization of pre-existing and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized mRNA, allowing a rapid increase in GADD34 levels and efficient dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Towards the stress adaptation phase, TTP and Brf1 are progressively dephosphorylated and regain their decay activity, destabilizing <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA. Elevated <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels act as a molecular memory of the previously activated ISR. Cells regain full responsiveness to stress once <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA turnover returns to its initial rate and levels return to baseline. Bottom panel: Cells subjected to a second acute stress pulse during the stress adaptation phase show attenuated responsiveness to stress due to <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> mRNA levels, which counteract eIF2α phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190929-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
