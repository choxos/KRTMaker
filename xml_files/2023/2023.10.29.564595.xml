However, the mechanisms underlying DNMT3A recruitment to and function within different chromatin environments remain unclear. Using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches we find that DNMT3A interacts using multiple interfaces with chromatin; directly binding generic nucleosome features as well as site-specific post-translational histone modifications. The N-terminal region, unique to the DNMT3A1 isoform, is essential for these interactions and stabilises H3K36me2-nucleosome recruitment. Intriguingly, in the same region critical for nucleosome binding we also map a ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment motif (UDR). The UDR binds specifically to ubiquitylated H2AK119, explaining the previously observed recruitment to Polycomb-occupied heterochromatin. A cryo-EM structure of DNMT3A1-DNMT3L with a modified nucleosome reveals that the UDR interacts with the nucleosome surface including the acidic patch. Previously unexplained disease-associated mutations are present in the UDR and ablate nucleosome interactions. This leads to an increased understanding of how DNMT3A1 recruitment occurs in the genome and highlights the importance of multivalent binding of DNMT3A to histone modifications and the nucleosome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>DNA methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>Histone</kwd><kwd>Epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A pivotal player in the dynamic management of vertebrate genomes is DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark on cytosine bases which generally represses transcription. Upwards of 80% of CpG sites in the genome are methylated, but this is not equally distributed. Highly repetitive sequences are hypermethylated to ensure genome stability whereas promoters for developmental and housekeeping genes hypomethylated. Patterns of cytosine methylation are tissue-specific and heritable, which affects gene expression and subsequent cell fate determination. As a result, the correct maintenance and positioning of DNA methylation is critical to normal cellular function. Accordingly, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in numerous disorders including cancers, developmental and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Janssen &amp; Lorincz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Plass <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P3">DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyse the transfer of a methyl group from a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) donor to the C5 position of a cytosine base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Song <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Vertebrates have three methyltransferase proteins that deposit DNA methylation: DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. DNMT3A and DNMT3B deposit <italic>de novo</italic> CpG methylation during differentiation, but show continued expression and activity into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Feng <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Okano <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Despite high conservation between the two proteins, DNMT3A and DNMT3B exhibit different chromatin binding preferences, different catalytic activity, and different interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Baubec <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Gopalakrishnan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Morselli <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). There are two main isoforms of DNMT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">Weisenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>): DNMT3A1 is the full-length form of the protein, whilst DNMT3A2 utilises an alternative promoter and as such lacks the divergent N-terminus of the full-length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). These isoforms show different expression patterns, with DNMT3A2 expressed during early development and in the germline and DNMT3A1 being the predominant postnatal isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, the functional biochemical differences between isoforms have not been unravelled.</p><p id="P4">It is unclear how different regions of the genome recruit specific DNA methyltransferases. For instance, developmentally inactivated CpG islands are not normally methylated despite high CpG concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brinkman <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Also, DNA methyltransferases must contend with other chromatin proteins for access to substrate DNA. Most notably among these is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. Comprised of two copies each of the four core histones, the nucleosome wraps and compacts ~147 bp of DNA around its globular core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Luger <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). The nucleosome acts as a landing platform that integrates many signalling processes to help define genomic loci by extensive histone post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bannister &amp; Kouzarides, 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The recruitment of DNMT3A to specific genomic loci is a highly regulated process, finely tuned to ensure the fidelity of DNA methylation pattern. This is mediated in part, by direct recognition of multiple histone post-translational modifications. Beyond the C-terminal catalytic domain, DNMT3A contains chromatin recognition PWWP (Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dhayalan <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Ooi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) domains which help to target DNMT3A to non-transcribed intergenic regions marked by H3 Lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) and H3K4me0, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020b</xref>). The PWWP domain directly recognises H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Rondelet <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and disruption of H3K36 methylation or binding leads to aberrant DNMT3A1 localisation and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hamagami <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). However, the overall cellular and organismal phenotype is gain-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Heyn <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Sendzikaite <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), with aberrant hypermethylation at facultative heterochromatin Polycomb-associated regions. DNMT3A1 appears to localise to CpG island shores in both normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and disease state-mimic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Heyn <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Sendzikaite <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). These regions are enriched with facultative heterochromatin marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blackledge &amp; Klose, 2021</xref>), but DNMT3A1 lacks recognisable domains for interaction with these marks. Removal of the DNMT3A N-terminal region affects recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Exactly how DNMT3A integrates these multiple signals to ensure correct methylation at appropriate chromatin locations is unclear.</p><p id="P6">Here we biochemically map the N-terminal region and PWWP domain of DNMT3A1 as the minimal fragment required for robust binding to modified nucleosomes, particularly those marked with H3K36me2 or H2AK119ub. Disease-associated mutations in the N-terminal region were found to impair nucleosome binding, providing insights into the mechanistic basis of these mutations in various disease states. The same region implicated in binding the nucleosome surface also ensures specific interactions with H2AK119ub modified nucleosomes. Single-particle cryo-EM structures and subsequent analysis reveals DNMT3A1's extensive engagement with the nucleosome acidic patch, H2A and H3, facilitating a highly specific interaction with H2AK119ub. Finally, despite its strong binding to nucleosomes, DNMT3A1's catalytic activity was not proportional to its recruitment. These findings highlight a disconnect between DNMT3A recruitment and its enzymatic activity, shedding light on the complex relationship between DNMT3A and methylation of chromatinized DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The N-terminal region of DNMT3A1 facilitates interaction with chromatin</title><p id="P7">As DNA methylation occurs within the context of chromatin, we sought to understand which regions of DNMT3A are necessary for interaction on a minimal chromatinized nucleosome template. DNMT3A contains a C-terminal catalytic domain, highly similar to other DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The N-terminal regulatory section comprises an ADD domain that interacts with the unmodified H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Ooi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Otani <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), a PWWP domain that binds H3 lysine-36 di-methylation (H3K36me2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dhayalan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Rondelet <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and a poorly characterised divergent N-terminal region. We expressed and purified different 6xHis-MBP tagged fragments of DNMT3A1’s regulatory section and reconstituted H3K36me2 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1A &amp; S1B</xref>). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we could observe robust binding of the DNMT3A regulatory section to modified nucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> (DNMT3A11<sup>-614</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). The PWWP domain alone bound poorly, likely due to the low affinity of the interaction with the histone mark (DNMT3A1<sup>278-427</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dhayalan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dukatz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and affinity for competitor DNA used in the assay buffer. Notably, removal any region after the PWWP domain, including the ADD domain had no measurable effect on interaction with H3K36me2-nucleosomes in our assay. This suggests that the minimal fragment required for nucleosome interaction was DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> comprising of the N-terminal region and PWWP domain (NT-PWWP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This result was particularly intriguing considering the N-terminal region has the highest degree of amino acid sequence divergence between DNMT3A and its paralog DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, DNMT3A has two major isoforms which differ in this N-terminal region; the shorter DNMT3A2 isoform has been extensively studied biochemically and <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Jeltsch &amp; Jurkowska, 2016</xref>), but the predominant isoform found in somatic tissues is the longer DNMT3A1 that contains this N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>). Indeed, using <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>) and EMSAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>) only the NT-PWWP region of DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> robustly interacted with modified nucleosomes compared to similar fragments from DNMT3B and DNMT3A2. This suggested that the DNMT3A1-specific feature within the N-terminal region could be a key point of difference between the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases and may provide an explanation for tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns.</p><p id="P9">To investigate this possibility further we investigated binding to modified nucleosomes. The N-terminal region alone showed considerable interaction with nucleosomes irrespective of their modification state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>), suggesting this region mediates direct nucleosome contacts. Nevertheless, interaction of DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> was further stimulated and specificity gained by recognition of H3K36me2/me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>) in line with the observed localisation to H3K36-methylated regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dhayalan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020b</xref>). Furthermore, disrupting methylated-lysine recognition using Heyn-Sproul-Jackson syndrome causing mutations in the PWWP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Heyn <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) removed H3K36-methylation specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1E</xref>). Overall, this data shows the unique DNMT3A1 NT-PWWP region is the minimal chromatin-interacting fragment required for robust H3K36me2-nucleosome recognition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DNMT3A1 N-terminal region contains DNA and nucleosome binding regions</title><p id="P10">To precisely map the region of the DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> NT-PWWP fragment that is important for nucleosome interaction, we reacted zero-length covalent crosslinkers (see Methods) with preformed DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup>:H3Kc36me2-nucleosome complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>) and identified crosslinked residues by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Multiple repeat experiments revealed similar crosslinking patterns, including validating crosslinks between histones as predicted by the nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ai <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Luger <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Several crosslinks between the N-terminal tail of H3 and PWWP domain we observed, as expected given the H3K36me2 interaction. Intriguingly, the most predominant crosslinks clustered between residues 120-200 of DNMT3A1 and H2A-H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). The crosslinks observed between H2A and H2B were either part of or adjacent to the nucleosome acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), which is a negative charged recess on the nucleosome surface and a common site of interaction for chromatin binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">McGinty &amp; Tan, 2021</xref>). Neutralising the charge on the acidic patch through mutation <italic>(acidic patch:</italic> H2A<sup>E61A/E91A/E92A</sup> and H2B<sup>E105A</sup>) greatly reduced binding of DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> to both H3K36me2 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>) and unmodified mutant nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>), suggesting the acidic patch region is required for DNMT3A1 nucleosome association.</p><p id="P11">We next sought to biochemically map the DNMT3A1 interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch and other features further. We purified fragments of DNMT3A1 N-terminal-PWWP region lacking stepped-intervals of ~50 residues from the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). In agreement with the crosslinking mass spectrometry findings, the greatest loss of binding was observed between DNMT3A1<sup>142-427</sup> and DNMT3A1<sup>192-427</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D</xref>), mapping the acidic patch interaction within this region of DNMT3A1. A previous study identified two separable N-terminal basic clusters implicated in DNMT3A1 DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Suetake <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In agreement, removal of the positive charge of the first region at Lys-53 and Lys-55 in DNMT3A1<sup>1-427</sup> greatly reduced interaction to a 175bp DNA fragment but not H3K36me2-nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2E</xref>). In contrast, R181A and R183A mutations ablated the nucleosome interaction, but only marginally affected DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2F</xref>). As Arg-181 and Arg-183 are adjacent to the highly cross-linkable region and are absent in the most severe deletion fragment observed, we hypothesised that rather than DNA binding, these residues interact with the nucleosome acidic patch. Mutation of all 4 residues (K53A/K55A/R181/R183A) reduced overall DNA binding similarly to the K35A/K55A. However, this was additive to the R181A/R183A mutation on H3K36me2-nucleosomes, suggesting Lys-53/55 can contact nucleosome-linker DNA contributing to overall nucleosome interaction.</p><p id="P12">Disease-associated mutations of Arg-181 and Arg-183 have been reported in clonal haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Jaiswal <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Tatton-Brown <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) and cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Basturk <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Dutton-Regester <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), with no reported mechanism. These mutations do not affect protein stability but reduce DNMT3A1’s capacity to repress transcription in a reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We found R181C, and to a lesser extent R183W, reduced overall binding to H3K36me2 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>), suggesting a mechanistic basis for the role of these mutations in disease states. Overall, the minimal NT-PWWP fragment of DNMT3A1 incorporates recognition of generic chromatin features to increase overall affinity to chromatin, with nucleosome surface recognition mapped to a central region of the N-terminal region.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>H3K36me2 stimulates DNMT3A1-DNMT3L complex activity on nucleosomes</title><p id="P13">To test whether our observations on shorter fragments of DNMT3A1 hold true for larger assemblies of DNMT3A1, we co-expressed full-length DNMT3A1 with its binding partner DNMT3L in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified the complex to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A,B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A,B</xref>).

This affect is likely due to release of the normally autoinhibitory domain of the ADD, upon binding to the unmodified H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Indeed, nucleosomes lacking the first 24 residues of H3 in the normally flexible tail (termed ‘H3 tailless’) did not lead to significant increased activity compared to DNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Methylation of H3K36 in nucleosome substrate stimulated the activity of DNMT3A1-DNMT3L. This elevated activity is presumably mediated through increased recruitment of the enzyme to substrate but may also be due to release of PWWP mediated inhibition and/or increased availability of substrate methylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brohm <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To further understand how DNMT3A1-DNMT3L interacts on chromatin substrate we reconstituted the methyltransferase complex with H3Kc36me2 modified di-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3G &amp; H</xref>).

Interestingly, we could also observe some additional density ascribed to DNMT3A1-DNMT3L on linker DNA but closer to the better ordered nucleosome-protomer. Due to severe preferred sample orientation, we were unable to reliably determine a 3D reconstruction from this data. Nevertheless, our experiments show that nucleosome substrates are preferentially methylated and that DNMT3A1-DNMT3L can engage linker DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The N-terminal region of DNMT3A1 binds to H2A Lys119ub within a nucleosome</title><p id="P15">Having mapped interaction with H3K36me2 modified nucleosomes we wanted to explore interactions with other DNMT3A1-bound chromatin states.

Multiple predicted backbone-backbone contacts are supplemented by DNMT3A1 Phe-190 making hydrophobic contacts with H3’ Leu-109, and H3 Leu-126, and Arg-129.

Indeed, DNMT3A1 is the predominant isoform present in somatic tissues while K119ub sites are commonly hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Fu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) suggesting the lower enzymatic activity may underlie the otherwise confusing observation of H2AK119ub hypomethylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussions"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Here we have shown that DNMT3A1 multivalently engages with nucleosomes, integrating multiple signals on the nucleosome including resident histone marks and nucleosome features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). We identified a region in the N-terminal extension of DNMT3A1 that binds to the nucleosome surface, and we propose that this plays a direct role in recruitment of DNMT3A1 at both intergenic H3K36me2 sites as well as to facultative heterochromatin/bivalent domains, amplified by co-incident recognition of the N-terminal region via ubiquitin on H2AK119.</p><p id="P31">The N-terminal region of DNMT3A1 prior to the PWWP has previously been suggested to bind generically to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Suetake <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Here we show that this is mediated by both DNA- and nucleosome-interacting regions. We further mapped the nucleosome surface interaction to DNMT3A1 residues 164-219. This coincides with a region identified by high predicted local ordering and termed the ubiquitylation-dependant recruitment motif (UDR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We show that this is in fact a functional UDR and the minimal region is sufficient for specific recognition of HAK119ub nucleosomes. This sequence contains a proposed canonical nuclear localisation signal (residues 202-219, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) suggesting multiple functions of this region during and after DNMT3A1 is imported into the nucleus.</p><p id="P32">Intriguingly, the affinity for H2AK119ub nucleosomes appears higher than for H3K36me2 nucleosomes. This fits with the prior observation that DNMT3A1 localisation correlates with H2AK119ub-rich CpG island shores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). However, Polycomb-enriched regions are typically found to be hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).

The action of demethylating TET enzymes potentially explain why H2AK119ub marked sites are found to be hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Manzo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Neri <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), but this may also be due to a disconnect between recruitment and enzymatic activity described here.</p><p id="P33">Our structure shows DNMT3A1-DNMT3L is still present on DNA but is too low resolution in this region to observe if the enzyme is in a non- or poorly-productive state. Alternatively, the high affinity of DNMT3A1-UDR may tether the enzyme to prevent processive methylation at other sites.</p><p id="P34">The DNMT3A1-DNMT3L:H2AK119ub-nucleosome structure shows that specificity for both ubiquitin and the nucleosome is contained within a short peptidic motif. Recognition of the acidic patch mediated through arginine anchors as observed for DNMT3A1 in our structure has been described for many chromatin-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">McGinty &amp; Tan, 2021</xref>), but the pattern of nucleosome surface contacts has not been described for other human chromatin proteins. Interestingly, the spumavirus GAG protein binds to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Lesbats <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) with a similar overall interaction interface and fold despite a different amino acid sequence (RMSD 1.25 Å), evidently an example of convergent evolution. Another acidic patch interactor is DNMT3A2-DNMT3B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020a</xref>) which deploys a different binding strategy. DNMT3B3, like DNMT3L, is a methyltransferase adaptor protein, that while non-catalytic helps to guide DNA methylation. It is a specific feature of DNMT3B3 that is used to contact the acidic patch, rigidly orientating the rest of the methyltransferase complex on adjacent DNA. In contrast, we see low ordering for the DNMT3A1-DNMT3L methyltransferase domains on adjacent DNA suggesting much greater degrees of freedom, presumably due to the flexible sequences between the UDR and rest of DNMT3A1-DNMT3L. DNMT3B3 and DNMT3A1 are almost certainly co-occurrent and likely form a tetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Duymich <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). How these complexes co-ordinate their nucleosome and chromatin binding features would be a fascinating avenue of future study.</p><p id="P35">Nucleosome-ubiquitin interactions mediated by short peptidic motifs or parts of domains not predicted to bind ubiquitin have been revealed in several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Fradet-Turcotte <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Rahman <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Valencia-Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">Worden <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">Worden <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Like the DNMT3A1 UDR some of these have been described to show poor to undetectable binding to ubiquitin in isolation and leverage nucleosome surface biding to ensure specific orientation of ubiquitin interacting fragments. We have previously seen that combining nucleosome tethering and ubiquitin recognition elements ensures a specific readout in other readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burdett <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Kitevski-LeBlanc <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Indeed, while this orientation provides specificity it does not necessarily mean that the ubiquitin binding moiety is rigidly bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Kitevski-LeBlanc <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Rahman <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Ubiquitin interactions are commonly mediated via the canonical hydrophobic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Komander &amp; Rape, 2012</xref>), a feature that is also shared by nucleosome-ubiquitin interacting structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Kasinath <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Unusually, DNMT3A1’s UDR appears to interact elsewhere in ubiquitin, likely using one of the other interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Komander &amp; Rape, 2012</xref>). Further study is required to tease out the nature of this interaction.</p><p id="P36">H2AK119ub is the most prevalent histone ubiquitin mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Fursova <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and has been reported to be read by two independent ubiquitin binding domains found in the H3K27me3 methyltransferase PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blackledge <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Kasinath <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Like the DNMT3A1 UDR, both of these subunits form interactions with the acidic patch. Unfortunately, the flexibility in our system prevented us from visualising the nature of the ubiquitin-DNMT3A1 interaction, but we do not see clear DNA binding of the DNMT3A1 UDR as observed for PRC2 component JARID2 nor ubiquitin displacement as observed for zinc fingers of AEBP2, suggesting these proteins have different binding modes. However, the UDR region contains a stretch of positively charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), which affects recruitment to H2AK119ub when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Gu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These residues may contact DNA as part of ubiquitin interaction, but based on our biochemistry this is not via linker DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8B</xref>).

As such, all 4 readers of H2AK119ub described structurally to date share common features and likely would compete for the same interfaces but display highly variable binding modes.

The 6969 movies of the first dataset were CTF estimated using GCTF in RELION. 1 824 711 particles were picked using 2D nucleosome templates, and extracted with a box size of 384, binned by 2. Two rounds of 2D classification were performed yielding 446, 680 particles in nucleosome-like classes. 3D classification was done with 8 classes based on the ab-initio model generated from cryoSPARC processing of this dataset. One class showed high quality nucleosomes with added density (203 793 particles) and this map and particles were refined using RELION 3D auto-refine. The extra density on the linker DNA belonging to DNMT3A1-DNMT3L-StrepII clashed with the side of the box. To dela with this issue the nucleosome, rather than the whole particle, was re-cantered by re-extraction displacing all particles by 40 pixels in y direction (y -40) and a smaller box size of 320, binned by 2. An initial model was generated from these particles in RELION to check the centring of the particles and a 3D classification with three classes was done. Two classes (203 347 particles) showed good quality nucleosomes, and these were refined using RELION 3D auto-refine. A mask was created in RELION from the refined density and used for postprocessing. Postprocessing in RELION using B-factor -50, resulted in a 5.1 Å density map of DNMT3A1-DNMT3L-StrepII on a nucleosome.

Two rounds of 2D classification were performed to discard poorly averaged particles. The most promising classes were pooled (Dataset 1: 527, 966 particles, Dataset 2 529, 296 particles) and used for ab-initio reconstruction and separated into three (Dataset 1) or two (Dataset 2) ab-initio classes. The best class comprising 214, 344 and 330, 169 particles were merged and re-extracted with a 384-pixel voxel size.

For the UDR based mask on map corresponding to 191, 397 particles showed the clearest density for this region and homogenous refinement using a wide dynamic mask of 10-18 Å, produced Map 2 showing density for UDR, ubiquitin, extra-nucleosomal DNA and some poor extra density expected to be from DNMT3A1-DNMT3L. With the same particles non-uniform refinement with local CTF optimisation produced a 3.1 Å Map 3. Focused classification of the Ubiquitin density revealed poorer overall density and no discrete ubiquitin states. Pooling 2 classes followed by non-uniform refinement produced map 4.

Proposed model summarising the results, DNMt3A1’s N-terminal extension contains a novel nucleosome interacting region that is important for conferring extra stability to chromatin interaction. This integrates with other chromatin reading domains to orchestrate correct genomic localisation. UDR region also binds to ubiquitin when placed at position 119 of H2A, increasing overall affinity and explaining how DNMT3A1 can be recruited to bivalent chromatin and facultative heterochromatin sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190413-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
