However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we used cells deficient in the junction scaffold ZO-1 alone or together with its paralog ZO-2, which disrupts the junctional barrier. We found that ZO-1 knockout increased cell proliferation, loss of cell density-dependent proliferation control, and promoted cell death. These phenotypes were enhanced by double ZO-1/ZO-2 knockout. Increased proliferation was dependent on YAP and ZONAB, two transcriptional regulators. ZO-1 knockout stimulated YAP nuclear translocation and activity without changes in Hippo-dependent phosphorylation. Knockout promoted TANK-binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) activation and increased expression of the RhoA activator GEF-H1. Knockdown of ZO-3, another paralog interacting with ZO1, was sufficient to induce GEF-H1 expression and YAP activity. GEF-H1, TBK1, and mechanotransduction at focal adhesions were required for YAP/TEAD activation in ZO-1-deficient cells. Thus, ZO-1 controls cell proliferation and Hippo-independent YAP activity by activating a GEF-H1- and TBK1-regulated mechanosensitive signalling network.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tight junctions</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>GEF-H1</kwd><kwd>TBK1</kwd><kwd>ZO-3</kwd><kwd>ZONAB</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>focal adhesions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Epithelial and endothelial tissue development and homeostasis require control of cell proliferation and death.

ZO-1 depletion induces cell-wide changes in cytoskeletal organization, increased focal adhesion formation, and traction on the ECM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Analysis of different epithelial cancers suggests that ZO-1 may play an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Indeed, knockout of ZO-1 in the normally non-proliferative adult retinal pigment epithelium stimulated G1/S phase transition and cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Global knockout also resulted in massive cell and embryonic death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, relevant downstream effectors are not well understood. Overexpression data indicate that ZO-1 inhibits G1/S phase cell cycle progression by cytosolic sequestration of the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulator ZONAB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, recent loss of function experiments questioned whether knockdown/knockout of ZO-1 alone or combined with reduced ZO-2 expression indeed stimulates proliferation as no effects on G1/S phase transition were observed after serum starvation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Regulation of the transcriptional activity of the YAP/TAZ pathway is a key mechanism in the control of tissue proliferation and development. A central regulator of YAP/TAZ activity is the Hippo pathway; however, alternative Hippo-independent processes also impact on YAP/TAZ activity, such as cytoskeletal tension and actomyosin activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In epithelia, the Hippo pathway is regulated by adherens junctions and the apical polarity machinery, and guides YAP/TAZ signalling by phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The junctional adhesion protein JAM-A has been linked to regulation of the Hippo pathway in intestinal cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The TJ protein ZO-2 has also been investigated for its contributions to YAP/TAZ regulation. However, the reported results are contradictory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of TJ and ZO-1 in the regulation of actomyosin and cytoskeletal tension, no effects on YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription by ZO-1 have been reported. Similarly, it is not clear if TJ can regulate YAP/TAZ by Hippo-independent mechanisms.</p><p id="P7">ZO-1 forms mutually exclusive complexes with either ZO-2 or ZO-3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. ZO-3 is a 130kD protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Expression of a ZO-3 construct containing N-terminal domains has been shown to affect total cellular RhoA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Unlike ZO-1, ZO-3 has been proposed to be required for proliferation due to stabilizing cyclin D1 protein expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, ZO-3 has not been linked to the regulation of transcription.</p><p id="P8">We have recently established transient depletion and stable knockout approaches to study the roles of ZO-1, revealing, unexpectedly, distinct functions in the regulation of epithelial morphology and junction assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We now used these cell models to investigate the role of ZO-1 in the regulation of epithelial proliferation. Given ZO-1 deficiency stimulated basal actomyosin activity and, consequently, increased cell-ECM traction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, we also asked whether ZO-1 regulates Hippo-independent YAP/TAZ activity, a transcriptional regulatory mechanism regulated by ECM stiffness and basal mechanotransduction. Our data indicate that ZO-1 is required for normal control of cell proliferation, and that ZO-1 depletion/knockout stimulates proliferation by driving Hippo-independent YAP activation and cell proliferation via a mechanosensitive regulatory network that requires GEF-H1, TANK-binding kinase (TBK1), and mechanotransduction at focal adhesions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ZO-1 regulates cell proliferation and death</title><p id="P9">We first asked whether knockout of ZO-1 in MDCK cells impacts cell proliferation. In all knockout clones, we measured increased cell counts when cells were plated at low density and left to proliferate over 11 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A-C</xref>). Quantifications at day 6, when wild type cells had reached about 50% of their final cell density, revealed that single ZO-1 knockout cells proliferated faster than ZO-1/2 double knockout cells. This was paralleled by increased LDH secretion, a measure for necrosis, and caspase 3/7 activity, a measure for apoptosis (cell death markers were divided by cell numbers to correct for increased cell counts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). As expected from the increase in proliferation, activity of the cyclin D1 promoter also increased in knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). However, a TCF-regulated promoter was not affected by ZO-1 knockout, indicating that β-catenin signalling, a pathway regulated by adherens junctions, was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>). Thus, ZO-1 knockout in MDCK cells stimulated proliferation and increased cell death. The ZO-1/2 double knockout cells exhibited an even larger increase in necrosis, which might be the reason for the slower increase in cell numbers and the larger proliferation drop towards the end of the experiments when cells reached confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next asked whether cells continued to proliferate once they reached high densities. Hence, cells were plated on filters to ensure efficient medium access. The cells were fixed after 6 days, a time by which wild type and knockout clones developed stable barrier properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Staining for the proliferation marker Ki67 revealed that, unlike wild type cells, the ZO-1 knockout cells continued to proliferate as about half the cells remained Ki67 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G,H</xref>). Similarly, quantification of mitotic indices revealed a fourfold increase in ZO-1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1I</xref>). Thus, ZO-1 knockout cells continued to proliferate at high cell densities, indicating loss of cell-density dependent proliferation control. As total cell numbers reached a plateau in proliferation assays after about 8 days, a balance between proliferation and cell death/extrusion likely keeps the total cell numbers stable.</p><p id="P11">Confocal sectioning revealed that the monolayer structure was distorted with areas that appeared multi-layered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>). However, the cells remained normally polarized with distinct staining for ezrin, an apical marker, and scribble, a basolateral polarity protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>). Highly confluent cells on filters reflect a monolayer under low tension as the cells are very compact; hence, we tested whether monolayer deformation was mechanosensitive by repeating the confocal analysis with cells plated on ECM of different stiffnesses that had formed large islands but were still subconfluent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Strikingly, cell layer deformation was not observed in large islands of subconfluent cultures on stiff ECM but was pronounced on 1 kPa ECM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1B,C</xref>). As many cells were very extended and could be traced across the entire layer of cells, it is likely that the structures were not formed by multilayering of cells but primarily by morphological deformation, resulting in stretching and loss of the regular predominantly perpendicular orientation relative to the substrate. Thus, ZO-1 knockout resulted in increased cell proliferation and death, and a mechanosensitive deregulation of cell morphology and monolayer architecture.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ZO-1 regulates YAP/TEAD activity</title><p id="P12">Depletion of ZO-1 induces cell-wide changes in cytoskeletal tension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, we asked whether ZO-1 depletion influenced YAP/TAZ signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Knockout of ZO-1 alone or together with ZO-2 indeed stimulated the YAP/TAZ-activated transcription factor binding element TEAD activity twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). YAP phosphorylation at serine-127 was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B,C</xref>). Thus, enhanced TEAD activity in knockout clones was unrelated to regulation by the Hippo pathway.</p><p id="P13">A previous RNA interference study suggested that ZO-1 depletion does not stimulate YAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Hence, we performed knockdown experiments using previously described siRNAs along with a cell line expressing GFP-tagged mouse ZO-1, which is resistant to the here used canine siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>). As in knockout cell lines, depletion of ZO-1 resulted in a strong increase in TEAD responsive promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>). Stimulation was prevented by expression of mouse ZO-1, supporting the specificity of the depletion-induced stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>). In agreement with the knockout experiments, depletion of ZO-1 resulted in a strong increase in nuclear YAP. Increased nuclear localization was observed when individual or pooled siRNAs were used and was inhibited by the expression of an siRNA-resistant to GFP-tagged mouse ZO-1 (GFP-mZO-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2A</xref>). Thus, depletion of ZO-1 stimulated nuclear YAP accumulation and increased TEAD activity.</p><p id="P14">As YAP is a mechanosensitive transcriptional co-factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we asked if decreasing monolayer tension affects the ZO-1 depletion-induced increase in nuclear YAP localization by seeding cells on Matrigel-coated elastic substrates with tuneable stiffness (Haas, et al. 2022). When cells were seeded on stiff ECM (40 kPa), ZO-1 depletion still stimulated increased nuclear YAP localization. However, on soft 1 kPa hydrogels, much of the detected YAP remained cytosolic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2B,C</xref>), suggesting that ECM stiffness modulates the effect of ZO-1 on YAP localization. Similarly, measurements of TEAD activity indicated that ZO-1 depletion stimulated TEAD activity on stiff and soft matrices but that the absolute activity was lower on 1 kPa than on 40 kPa ECM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2C</xref>). Thus, ZO-1 depletion leads to increased TEAD transcriptional activity and increased YAP localization in a manner that is modulated by ECM stiffness.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TBK1 is required for regulation of YAP by ZO-1</title><p id="P15">The serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) can regulate YAP in a Hippo-independent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Immunoblotting for TBK1 phosphorylated at serine-172 indicated an increase in phosphorylated TBK1 in ZO-1 and double knockout cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A,B</xref>). Serine-172 resides in the activation loop; hence, increased phosphorylation indicates increased activity. Increased TBK1 activity was also supported by measurements of autophagic flux, a measure of autophagy which is known to be regulated by TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C,D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">We next asked whether TBK1 was involved in the control of ZO-1 over YAP localization and activity. We first used immunofluorescence to determine effects of TBK1 inhibition on YAP nuclear accumulation. This revealed that inhibition of TBK1 strongly attenuated the nuclear accumulation of YAP in ZO-1-deficient as well as double knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E,F</xref>). Inhibition of TBK1 also inhibited TEAD responsive promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3G</xref>). TBK1 siRNAs, which efficiently depleted expression in of the kinase in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3H</xref>), also suppressed the reporter assay for TEAD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3I</xref>), confirming the inhibitor data. Inhibition of the TEAD reporter assay upon TBK1 knockdown was also observed in MDCK cells depleted of ZO-1 using siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Therefore, regulation of YAP nuclear localization and activation of TEAD-regulated transcription by ZO-1 relies on a TBK1-dependent mechanism that requires catalytic activity of the kinase.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TBK1 depletion promotes junction formation by ZO-1-deficient cells</title><p id="P18">ZO-1 depletion inhibits TJ formation, which can be rescued by knockdown of GEF-H1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

Cο-transfection of ZO-1 and TBK1 siRNAs or transfection of ZO-1 KO cells with TBK1 siRNAs stimulated TJ formation by ZO-1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>).

RNAi-mediated depletion of GEF-H1 strongly inhibited the induction of TEAD transcriptional activity in the ZO knockout clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C,D</xref>). GEF-H1 is thought to stimulate actomyosin contractility. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin or inhibiting actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex with CK-666 also prevented TEAD activity induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>). Inhibiting formin with SMIFH2 did not have a significant effect. These results thus indicate that GEF-H1 and actomyosin contractility were required for YAP stimulation in ZO-1 knockout cells.</p><p id="P23">GEF-H1 is thought to promote actomyosin activity along the basal membrane in epithelia by inducing stress fibres <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

Depletion of talin, a key cytoskeletal linker at focal adhesions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, in ZO-1 knockout cells strongly inhibited TEAD responsive promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5F,G</xref>). Similarly, co-depletion of ZO-1 and talin using siRNAs also attenuated TEAD responsive promoter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4B,C</xref>). These data agree with the reduced YAP activity in ZO-1-depleted cells plated on soft ECM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>).

We next employed luciferase reporter assays to measure impacts on activity. The activity of the TEAD responsive promoter was not affected by ZONAB depletion. ZONAB activity was measured with a luciferase promoter construct that is repressed by ZONAB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In control and YAP siRNA transfected ZO-1 KO cells, ZONAB activity was similarly stimulated compared to wild type MDCK cells as promoter activity was low but, as expected, strongly inhibited when directly depleted, which is indicated by increased promoter activity.

ZO-3 knockdown did not affect junctional recruitment of occludin and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7D</xref>).

As observed for ZO-1 knockout cells, phosphorylation of YAP was not affected, indicating that YAP regulation was Hippo-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8F</xref>). Phosphorylation of TBK1 was not stimulated by ZO-3 depletion, indicating that depletion of ZO-3 was not sufficient to promote activation of all signalling mechanisms stimulated by ZO-1 knockout and that induction of GEF-H1 expression could occur without activation of TBK1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">We found that ZO-1 regulates a GEF-H1- and TBK1-dependent signalling network that activates YAP-regulated transcription and cell proliferation in a manner that depends on functional focal adhesions and is regulated by cell mechanics. ZO-1 depletion/knockout increased expression of the RhoA exchange factor GEF-H1 that, in turn, cooperated with the protein kinase TBK1 to stimulate the YAP/TAZ pathway in a Hippo-independent manner. Increased proliferation persisted in high density cultures, indicating that ZO-1 is required for cell density-dependent proliferation control. GEF-H1 is known to also activate ZONAB to promote its activity in the regulation of transcription and translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Depletion of ZO-3 – a paralog of ZO-1 that selectively binds ZO-1 and not ZO-2- was expressed at reduced levels in ZO-1 knockouts and was sufficient to induce GEF-H1 and Hippo-independent YAP activity. Therefore, GEF-H1 is a key target of ZO-1 signalling that stimulates independent transcriptional effector pathways based on YAP and ZONAB that regulate gene expression and drive cell proliferation.</p><p id="P31">Disruption of TJ by ZO-1/ZO-2 knockout selectively affected Hippo-independent YAP stimulation and did not impact YAP phosphorylation, indicating that the Hippo pathway did not regulate YAP downstream of ZO-1. The junctional complex contains multiple components of the Hippo pathway, many of which reside in the apical marginal zone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Hence, the ZO-1 complex represents a distinct branch of junctional YAP regulation that acts via regulation of cell mechanics rather than regulating Hippo signalling. TJ are divided into a junctional core, containing proteins like ZO-1 and barrier forming and regulating proteins like claudins and occludin, and the apical marginal zone, containing apical polarity determinants and Hippo pathway components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, the two junctional subdomains also differ in how they regulate the YAP pathway as the ZO-1-dependent junctional core regulates YAP in a Hippo-independent but GEF-H1- and TBK1-dependent manner.</p><p id="P32">Observations on the role of YAP and cell proliferation by ZO proteins have been contradictory. ZO-1 was suggested not to regulate YAP and ZO-2, depending on the study, to either promote or inhibit YAP signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Similarly, experiments with stable knockdown cells of ZO-1 and ZO-2 suggested no effect on cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While many of these experiments were done with MDCK cells as our experiments, we have recently found that ZO-1 needs to be depleted efficiently or knocked out completely to induce clear loss-of-function phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>; hence, the effects on cell proliferation may have been missed due to insufficient ZO-1 depletion. As ZO-1 and ZO-2 knockout increase cell death, it is also possible that effects on proliferation were missed if cells were analysed under conditions that cause cell stress, such as serum starvation to synchronize cells. Similarly, ZO-1 knockdown in the adult retinal pigment epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic>, a nonproliferating epithelium, induces G1/S-phase transition and cell death whereas in other tissues only death was reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Hence, the balance between cell proliferation and death in ZO-1-deficient cells may depend on other cell stressors acting on the epithelium studied. Increased proliferation was also not observed in ZO-1 knockout mouse mammary epithelial Eph4 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Unlike mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, Eph4 cells do not express ZO-3. As ZO-3 is part of the YAP-regulating machinery downstream of ZO-1, its absence may reflect permanent deregulation of that pathway in Eph4 cells.</p><p id="P33">Of the three ZO paralogs, ZO-3 has been studied the least. It was originally discovered as a protein co-precipitating with ZO-1 and was then later shown to possess a homologous structure to ZO-1 and ZO-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Biochemical studies further revealed that ZO-2 and ZO-1 compete for binding to the same PDZ domain of ZO-1. The function of ZO-3 is still poorly understood. In zebrafish, ZO-3 knockdown has been reported to affect the epidermal barrier function and, during gastrulation, to support ZO-1’s role in driving epiboly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, in mammals loss of ZO-3 in vitro or in vivo has not revealed defects in junction assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. A previous study in cultured cells, linked ZO-3 to the regulation of CDK4, a cell cycle kinase that is recruited to TJ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, by recruiting and stabilizing the CDK4 regulator cyclin D1 to TJ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Hence, ZO-3 may have proliferation promoting (i.e., stabilization of cyclinD1) and inhibiting (inhibition of GEF-H1 expression/YAP) activities. Expression of a truncated form of ZO-3 was shown to promote RhoA and actomyosin remodelling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. As ZO-3 can also bind to p120catenin, its effect on RhoA was attributed to p120catenin deregulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Our data now indicate that ZO-3 is, together with its interaction partner ZO-1, linked to the regulation of GEF-H1 expression, an activator of RhoA.</p><p id="P34">In addition to GEF-H1, TBK1 is the other signalling protein we have identified here to regulate YAP activity downstream of ZO-1 ablation. Unlike GEF-H1 induction, ZO-3 does not affect TBK1 phosphorylation; hence, activation of the kinase is not required for increased GEF-H1 expression. TBK1 is a multifunctional kinase known to regulate multiple signalling mechanisms including autophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, which we also found stimulated in ZO-1-deficient cells. In lung fibroblasts, TBK1 stimulates Hippo-independent YAP/TAZ activation and is thought to be promoted by increased ECM stiffness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, GEF-H1 induction was not sufficient to promote TBK1 activity as ZO-3 knockdown increased GEF-H1 expression but not TBK1 activity. It is thus possible that other regulators of tissue stiffness function upstream of TBK1 in epithelial cells or that the mechanism of TBK1 activation involves yet to be identified signalling processes downstream of ZO-1.</p><p id="P35">ZO-1 depletion induces cell-wide changes in cell mechanics, including increased traction on ECM, and disruption of junction formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. GEF-H1 plays a central role in this effect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, deregulation of GEF-H1 is a key process downstream of ZO-1 signalling that regulates cytoskeletal tension and thereby affects cell morphogenesis, focal adhesion formation, ECM traction, and gene expression. GEF-H1 is inhibited by TJ formation and redistributes upon knockout of ZO-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, its activation is due to release of junctional inhibition as well as increased expression.</p><p id="P36">Mechanotransduction at focal adhesions is an integral component of the TBK1 and GEF-H1 regulated signalling network activated by ZO-1 knockout. ECM stiffness modulated the impact of ZO-1 knockout on YAP activation, and disruption of focal adhesion function by talin knockdown strongly inhibited YAP activation in knockout cells. Similarly, TBK1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>), and GEF-H1 depletion or inhibiting mechanotransduction at focal adhesions (i.e., talin knockdown or very soft ECM) rescues junction formation upon knockdown/knockout of ZO-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, the ZO-1-regulated TBK1- and GEF-H1-dependent, mechanosensitive signalling network guides YAP activation and proliferation, as well as junctional integrity and, thereby, provides a functional regulatory link between TJ and ECM adhesion.</p><p id="P37">GEF-H1 is induced in the retinal pigment epithelium in response to epithelial mesenchymal transition stimulated by TGFβ signalling and, in patients, in responds to retinal insults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Similarly, GEF-H1 induction is thought to be a key mechanism of cancer cell proliferation and was linked to escape from MAPK inhibition in cancer therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Reduced ZO-1 expression and tight junction corruption has been reported in different types of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>; hence, GEF-H1 induction upon reduced ZO-1 expression and subsequent activation of transcriptional pathways like YAP/TAZ and ZONAB is likely to play an important role in the deregulation of cancer cell proliferation. Given the involvement of TBK1 in YAP regulation and the importance of TBK1 in cancer pathogenesis, it will be exciting to determine how the functional interplay between GEF-H1 and TBK1 impacts cancer cell behaviour and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P38">Experiments with MDCK II knockout cells were performed with cell lines described previously using two ZO-1 knockout clones (MDCK ZO-1KO C1 and C2), a ZO-1/ZO-2 double knockout clone (MDCK ZO-1/2KO), and the corresponding wild type MDCK II cell line (MDCK wt) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZO-1 was performed in an MDCK II strain that has been previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.
