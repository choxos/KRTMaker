However, the physicochemical properties and structural heterogeneity of amyloidogenic proteins hinder the mechanistic understanding of anti-amyloidogenic compounds. Further, modes of interaction with amyloidogenic proteins are often probed <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified protein samples, even though these models may not capture <italic>in vivo</italic> protein structures and do not enable identification of off-target effects. We have developed a modular structural proteomic pipeline based on limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) with improved, amino acid level-resolution, to probe the mechanism of action of anti-amyloidogenic compounds. We demonstrate our approach by analysing the interactions of six known or putative anti-amyloidogenic compounds and the amyloid binder Thioflavin T (ThT) with different structural forms of the amyloidogenic Parkinson’s disease (PD) protein α-Synuclein. Our approach enables determination of putative interaction sites, identification of whether interactions are covalent or non-covalent, and crucially, can probe for interactions of compounds with physiological structures of α-Synuclein in complex cell and tissue extracts and identify off-targets. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses with our pipeline showed that the green tea polyphenol EGCG induces an N- and C-terminus-dependent compaction of the unstructured α-Synuclein monomer, detected preferential interactions of ThT with the N-terminus of α-Synuclein fibrils compared to the amyloid core, and showed that the most potent inhibitors of aggregation in our study (EGCG, baicalein and AC Immune compound #2) induced similar non-fibrillar end structures despite different interactions with α-Synuclein monomers. Importantly, in mammalian cell lysates, α-Synuclein was either a low-affinity target (for EGCG and Baicalein) or did not show evidence of compound interaction (for ThT and doxycycline) in our experimental conditions, despite both monomeric and fibrillar forms interacting with these compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>. For EGCG, we validated this result in postmortem brain homogenates from PD patients. These <italic>in situ</italic> analyses identified many additional putative cellular targets of Doxycycline, EGCG, Baicalein and ThT, suggesting that their effects in cellular or animal models of neurodegeneration are likely due to interactions with proteins other than α-Synuclein and showing that anti-amyloidogenic compounds should be analyzed <italic>in situ</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our modular pipeline will enable <italic>in situ</italic> screening of drugs and PET tracers for amyloid aggregates of interest as well as detailed mechanistic studies of compound action <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Amyloidogenic proteins can undergo a structural transition to form highly ordered, cross β-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. Although amyloid aggregation can be functional and conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, numerous amyloidogenic proteins are implicated in disease. In particular, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are believed to involve the aggregation of specific amyloidogenic proteins, which have been found in inclusions in post-mortem brains of patients and genetically linked to these diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Preventing aggregation or eliminating aggregates of disease relevant proteins is therefore a strong focus of drug development efforts, but with limited success so far.</p><p id="P3">Screening for anti-amyloidogenic compounds is typically done either by probing <italic>in vitro</italic> for modification of the aggregation process of a given protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, or by screening for reversal or modification of phenotypes in cellular models of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (e.g., formation of foci containing aggregated proteins). However, in both screening approaches, there are limitations in deciphering the mechanism of action of compounds that show an effect. Specifically, a compound could have its effect via covalent or noncovalent binding or otherwise interfering with the monomeric, amyloid fibrillar, or other structural states of the amyloidogenic protein. Compound mechanism of action, in particular knowing which structural state is targeted, is key information for design of validation and selectivity studies as well as for structure-activity relationship (SAR)-based modifications of a drug to increase potency and reduce side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Further, fibril structures prepared <italic>in vitro</italic> may not recapitulate structures that are formed in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and effects in cells could be indirect and due to binding to other targets. There is therefore a strong need for approaches to characterize anti-amyloidogenic drugs that can reveal which structural state of an amyloidogenic protein is bound by the drug and what the binding sites are; whether and how the compound affects structural transitions of amyloidogenic proteins over time; whether the drug interacts with the aggregation prone protein in patient samples; and whether it targets other cellular proteins that could have indirect or unwanted effects.</p><p id="P4">Aggregation-prone proteins possess intrinsic physicochemical properties that make mechanistic studies of compound action very challenging. The non-aggregated, monomeric form of amyloidogenic proteins is often highly dynamic and unstructured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, so that structural analysis and deconvolution of compound binding are more complex than for proteins with well-defined 3D structures. Once amyloid fibrils are formed, their insolubility and size interfere with a variety of techniques. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and solid-state NMR have yielded fibril structures, but analysis of drug binding as performed for example for the protein Tau and the compound Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> is time intensive, and as yet few such studies have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Further, most structural techniques are limited to purified proteins outside of their native environment or require electroporation of purified proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and are therefore limited to the analysis of one protein at a time. A robust technique to characterize anti-amyloidogenic drug mechanism of action that can be applied both in purified and in complex settings, in a structurally aware manner, is still missing.</p><p id="P5">Here, we show that LiP-MS can be used to characterize the mechanism of action of anti-amyloidogenic compounds <italic>in vitro</italic> and directly in cell and tissue extracts. The approach employs a modular experimental pipeline, relying on a new high-resolution version of LiP-MS, a structural proteomic approach that probes protein structure based on preferential protease accessibility of flexible and surface exposed regions of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Cleavage products are measured by mass spectrometry, yielding information about altered surface accessibility of proteins upon a perturbation such as anti-amyloidogenic compound treatment. Our high-resolution LiP-MS approach enables the extraction of interaction sites and structural information at near-amino acid resolution. Further, it allows assessment of whether a compound of interest interacts with a specific structural state <italic>in vitro</italic> (e.g., monomeric or fibrillar states of an amyloidogenic protein) and of how the compound affects the structural evolution of the protein over time. The approach can provide proteome-level data from cell and tissue extracts, thus enabling assessment of compound interactions with the endogenous forms of the amyloidogenic protein but also with other potential protein targets.</p><p id="P6">We applied this pipeline to characterize the mode of action of a set of anti-amyloidogenic compounds (EGCG, Baicalein, doxycycline, Fasudil, and two proprietary anti-amyloidogenic compounds from drug discovery efforts) and of the amyloid binder ThT, using the PD-associated protein α-Synuclein as a test case. Applied to an aggregation time course <italic>in vitro</italic>, our approach revealed that the most potent inhibitors of aggregation (EGCG, Baicalein, ACI compound # 2) resulted in structures that were distinct from both monomers and fibrils and may also represent a mixture of states. We identified interactions with monomer and/or fibrillar forms of α-Synuclein <italic>in vitro</italic> for most of the compounds; for instance, EGCG induced a compaction of α-Synuclein monomer via interactions with the N- and C-terminus of the protein but caused structural changes in α-Synuclein fibrils at the N-terminus and the C-terminal region of the aggregation core. Surprisingly, Fasudil had no structural effects on either form of α-Synuclein and ThT interacted with the N-terminus of α-Synuclein fibrils but only weakly with the aggregation core i.e., the non-amyloid component (NAC). Applied in the context of a mammalian cell lysate, our approach showed only low-affinity interaction, or no interaction at all, of EGCG, Baicalein, doxycycline and ThT with overexpressed α-Synuclein, while concomitantly identifying numerous other putative cellular interactors of these compounds, consistent with prior classification of EGCG and baicalein as pan-assay interference (PAIN) compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that effects of these compounds in <italic>in situ</italic> models of neurodegeneration must be due to interactions with proteins other than α-Synuclein, and argue strongly that screening and characterization of anti-amyloidogenic compounds and PET tracers should be carried out <italic>in situ</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An amino acid-resolution analytical approach for high-coverage LiP-MS data</title><p id="P7">We first asked if we could use LiP-MS to derive structural information about anti-amyloidogenic or amyloid-binding compound effects on purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. LiP-MS analysis of purified proteins typically results in the detection of a large number of partially overlapping peptides along a protein sequence. To take advantage of the resulting high-coverage data and increase the structural resolution of LiP-MS, we developed a new analytical approach. As a test case, we compared the LiP fingerprints of intrinsically disordered α-Synuclein monomers and α-Synuclein amyloid fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>. We first analyzed the data with the classical LiP-MS pipeline which achieves peptide-level resolution. As expected, differential analysis showed that many peptides were significantly different in abundance (|log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt;1, q-value &lt; 0.05) between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). When significantly changing peptides were mapped along the linear sequence of α-Synuclein, almost the entire sequence was conformationally different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), because of the large structural changes between the two forms of the protein. In such a case, a peptide-level analysis gives limited information about detailed structural changes across different regions of the protein. We therefore designed an alternative analysis strategy to combine information from multiple peptides mapping to the same region and gain higher-resolution insight into the conformational landscape of α-Synuclein.</p><p id="P8">Similar to approaches used in RNA sequencing analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we first assigned a score to every peptide, corresponding to the|log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)| in peptide intensity between the two conditions times the log10(q-value) as a measure of statistical significance. The larger and more significant the fold change, the higher the score for a given peptide. Next, we overlapped all the peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and calculated the mean value of this score per amino acid position. Aggregating the data per amino acid across the entire protein sequence then yielded a detailed structural fingerprint of α-Synuclein monomers compared to fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). At a comparable significance threshold as the peptide level analysis (|log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)|&gt; 1; q-value &lt; 0.05), we now observed that the NAC core region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> until amino acid 95 showed strong structural differences between the two forms of the protein, as expected since this region is arranged in cross β-sheets in the fibril but not the monomeric form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Also as expected, the C-terminus, which is known to be flexible in both structural states of the protein, did not differ between monomeric and fibrillar α-Synuclein. Smaller but significant differences were observed for the N-terminus, suggesting that a fraction of the N-termini of α-Synuclein fibrils are structured or have reduced protease accessibility under the buffer conditions used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. These results illustrate that our new amino acid centric approach yields the expected patterns for a structural comparison of α-Synuclein monomer and fibril and allows a more fine-grained picture of the structural differences between the two states of the protein.</p><p id="P9">We further tested whether this amino acid centric analysis could pinpoint small molecule binding sites from high coverage LiP-MS data with improved resolution. To this end, we used LiP-MS data from our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which showed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) binds at the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding site of Enzyme I of the PEP-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (ptsI), thereby inhibiting enzyme activity by competitive inhibition. To test the resolution of the amino acid centric approach, we analysed the LiP-MS data comparing the FBP-bound and unbound states of ptsI either with our previous peptide-level analysis or the new amino acid centric approach. We found that our new approach closely mapped the significantly changing amino acids to the known PEP binding cleft of ptsI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, E</xref>). Our previous peptide-level quantification also allowed mapping of the binding site, but with lower precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, D</xref>). We achieved similar results upon analysis of <italic>in silico</italic> LiP-MS data, showing in addition that the amino-acid approach may be more resistant to false positives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Finally, we used our approach to assess binding of Vitamin D binding protein (GC) to Vitamin D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) to fructose bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and Thyroxine Binding Globulin (TBG) to thyroxine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), in all cases re-analysing data from a previous study in which we added the compounds to purified proteins and comparing proteolytic patterns in the presence versus absence of the compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. For ALDOA and GC, the amino acid centric approach improved the resolution of binding site mapping over our previous peptide-centric analysis. In the case of TBG, both versions of our LiP-MS analysis did not detect a structural change in the known thyroxine binding site, due at least in part to limited coverage of this region. Nevertheless, the amino acid scoring approach detected at much higher resolution the known conformational change of the reactive loop of TBG upon thyroxine binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">High-resolution amino acid-centric analysis of LiP-MS data requires high sequence coverage, which is typically achieved <italic>in vitro</italic> on purified proteins, but not for all proteins in complex backgrounds. Nevertheless, we also tested the amino acid-centric analysis on a dataset in which a yeast lysate was treated with the well-studied small molecule rapamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Compared to the <italic>in vitro</italic> data discussed earlier (i.e., α-Synuclein, ptsI, vitamin D binding protein, ALDOA, TBG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figures 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>), where the median sequence coverage per protein was 95.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>), the proteome-wide data from the rapamycin treated yeast lysate showed a median protein sequence coverage of 14.13% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>) and the main target of rapamycin, FPR1, was covered at 69.3% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Even though the amino acid-centric analysis did not in this case increase the resolution of binding site mapping, likely due to the insufficient number of detected peptides, it was still more informative than the classical pipeline since regions with higher scores preferentially mapped to the known binding site of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C-F</xref>). The amino acid centric analysis can therefore also be informative for proteome wide data since it allows ranking regions by the strength of the effect of a small molecule, but protein coverage will strongly influence the performance.</p><p id="P11">Overall, we have developed an analytical approach for LiP-MS data that much increases the resolution with which we can pinpoint small molecule binding sites and structural alterations in high-coverage data.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structural changes of <italic>α</italic>-Synuclein in the presence of anti-amyloidogenic compounds</title><p id="P12">Employing our high-resolution amino acid centric approach, we analyzed the effects of candidate anti-amyloidogenic compounds on structural changes of α-Synuclein during amyloid fibril formation. We probed the effects of EGCG, Baicalein, Fasudil and Doxycycline as known inhibitors of aggregation, and two proprietary compounds of AC Immune SA (Switzerland) that inhibit α-Synuclein aggregation in vitro and have protective effects on neuronal cultures challenged with α-Synuclein fibrils, here named ACI compound #1 and compound #2. We also included the known amyloid binding compound ThT.</p><p id="P13">To test the effects of these compounds on α-Synuclein aggregation, we incubated purified α-Synuclein with α-Synuclein seeds in the presence of each of the compounds (140 uM) or a DMSO control. After 17 hours of incubation under constant agitation, fibril formation had reached steady state in the DMSO-only control as measured by ThT emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>); we confirmed fibril formation with electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). EGCG and Baicalein completely blocked fibril formation as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, since there was no increase in ThT intensity throughout the time course. Doxycycline and compound #1 led to a significant reduction of ThT intensity at the end of the time course, but only caused minor changes in the half time of aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In contrast, compound #2 inhibited the aggregation but did not show a sigmoidal curve profile, rather yielding a small linear increase in ThT intensity until the end of the experiment. Fasudil did not affect the aggregation, in contrast to published reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> that used an aggregation assay without fibrillar seeds. We note that compound competition with ThT for binding to α-Synuclein cannot be ruled out. Electron microscopy at the end of the time-course revealed the presence of fibrils in all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A-G</xref>), although these were visually different in compound #2-, EGCG-, Baicalein-treated samples, our analysis was not quantitative, and the latter two samples also contained oligomeric species as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Native PAGE of the samples further indicated that compound #2-, EGCG-, Baicalein-treated α-Synuclein contained remaining monomeric species, comparable to the monomer at time point zero, while most of the monomeric fraction was lost upon treatment with the other compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To assess in more detail how the structure of α-Synuclein changed over time in the presence of these compounds, we performed a LiP-MS experiment at the start and the end of the time course and derived fingerprints comparing the structures at these two time points for each condition. As expected in the DMSO control sample, the strongest structural changes between the start and end of the time course were in the α-Synuclein aggregation core (aa 61-95)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), which becomes highly structured upon aggregation of α-Synuclein. The structural fingerprint for the Fasudil-treated sample was the same as that of the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>), consistent with the fact that Fasudil did not affect the aggregation process in our experiments and indicating that the same fibril structures were formed in the presence of Fasudil and in the control sample. Fibrils formed in the presence of Doxycycline and compound #1 yielded the same structural fingerprint as in the control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>), again indicating that similar fibril structures were formed, despite a substantially lower ThT signal in the presence of these compounds; this may suggest interactions of doxycycline or compound 1 with ThT, or competition with ThT for binding to α-Synuclein, or simply a low amount of α-Synuclein fibrils formed under these conditions. We observed a different structural fingerprint for fibrils formed in the presence of compound #2, with less profound changes in the aggregation core relative to the monomeric form, when compared to fibrils formed under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, the fingerprint does indicate some changes in the C-terminal part of the aggregation core (aa 81-97)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Most interestingly, structures formed in the presence of EGCG and Baicalein changed in proteolytic accessibility in their very N-and C-terminus, but the aggregation core remained unchanged compared to the monomer (i.e., unstructured) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I, J</xref>). Overall, the most potent inhibitors of aggregation (baicalein, EGCG and compound 2) produced similar structures at the end of the aggregation time course (i.e., structural changes around residue 40 for all compounds, plus residues 90-100 for compound 2, and residues 100-115 for baicalein and EGCG). Since these structural changes relative to monomer largely do not involve the NAC region, these fingerprints indicate that no fibrils were detectable by LiP-MS in EGCG, baicalein and compound #2, consistent with the ThT fluorescence results.</p><p id="P15">Thus, our approach allows assessment of structures formed by amyloidogenic proteins in the presence of compounds of interest. The aggregation core region of α-Synuclein could be accurately identified by our technique, allowing a direct assessment of the aggregation process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Compound interactions with monomeric <italic>α</italic>-Synuclein</title><p id="P16">To characterize the mechanisms of action of anti-amyloidogenic compounds, it is important to assess whether they interact with specific structural states of the amyloidogenic protein. We thus asked whether the LiP-MS pipeline could detect interaction of our compounds with monomeric α-Synuclein. We prepared monomeric α-Synuclein, verified its purity by blue native PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>), and compared its protease accessibility in the presence and absence of the compounds (1:100 molar ratio) using LiP-MS. A change in protease accessibility in this setup could either capture the direct binding site of the compound to α-Synuclein or could indicate structural changes that occur as a consequence of binding, outside of the compound binding site itself.</p><p id="P17">First, we investigated structural changes of α-Synuclein monomer upon addition of EGCG for 5 minutes. We observed changes in protease accessibility of the N-and C-termini in monomeric α-Synuclein in the presence of EGCG, primarily in regions containing aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Previous reports have suggested unspecific binding of EGCG to the protein backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which we could reproduce by NMR analysis (1:10 molar ratio monomeric α-Synuclein: EGCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since our LiP-MS observations are specifically at the N-and C-termini, these could indicate an additional structural change due to the interaction with EGCG. To test this, we employed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR using A91C-α-Synuclein and (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-<italic>D</italic>-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) labelling to determine changes in long-range contacts within the α-Synuclein monomer in the presence of EGCG. We observed that the ratio of MTSL / no MTSL at the N-and very C-terminus was lower in the presence of EGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the interaction of EGCG with monomeric α-Synuclein induces a compaction of the protein. Truncated versions of α-Synuclein lacking the N-(Δ2-11) and the C-terminus (Δ122-140) had a greater propensity to aggregate, as previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, but in comparison to the WT protein, EGCG had a smaller effect on their aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the N-and C-termini of α-Synuclein are involved in the inhibition of aggregation by EGCG further supporting our LiP-MS based observation of conformational compaction of N-and C-terminus induced by EGCG.</p><p id="P18">We assessed whether the tested compounds covalently bound α-Synuclein using data from the control condition, in which samples were digested only with trypsin, a site-specific protease, under denaturing conditions. Covalent binding is expected to yield a decrease in abundance of peptides including the covalent modification site due to the resulting mass shift. Thus, a decrease in intensity of tryptic peptides in the tryptic control condition upon addition of a compound may indicate covalent binding events. We detected no evidence of covalent binding of EGCG to α-Synuclein monomer. Baicalein however did show tryptic peptides with decreased intensity (3 peptides out of 6 detected peptides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), likely indicating covalent modification of α-Synuclein monomer by Baicalein, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The parallel structural (i.e., LiP) analysis indicated that Baicalein also had structural effects on α-Synuclein monomer. Since the sites of covalent modification overlapped substantially with the observed structural changes, we normalised the peptide-level LiP data with the tryptic peptides (see Methods). The Baicalein-dependent structural changes no longer persist after this normalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), indicating that the detected LiP changes may reflect these covalent changes alone. Unexpectedly, we also observed changes that could be consistent with covalent modification for α-Synuclein monomer treated with ThT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>), however these occur at regions that do not overlap with the LiP changes.</p><p id="P19">Structural alterations of monomeric α-Synuclein in the presence of the other compounds were less pronounced than those for EGCG and Baicalein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-I</xref>).

Overall, we detected 1102, 3249, 1856, and 877 proteins showing structural changes in the cell lysate upon addition of doxycycline, EGCG, Baicalein and ThT. We went on to test the effects of EGCG on lysates of postmortem human brain, analysing cingulate gyrus pooled from two individuals with Parkinson’s disease. As in the cell lysates, we detected some α-Synuclein peptides structurally responding to EGCG, but also detected structural changes in 2489 other proteins (|log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt;1, q-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). At a more stringent threshold, 949 proteins in the brain lysate showed structural changes upon addition of EGCG, but α-Synuclein was not among the hits (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). In both brain and cell lysate, structural changes upon addition of EGCG mapped to the NAC region of α-Synuclein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), with some additional N terminal changes apparent in the cell lysate.</p><p id="P27">Given the large number of hits in both lysates, we used our previously developed LiPQuant approach, which uses multiple criteria to define a score that can prioritize potential compound targets with high confidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. We applied a dosage series of all compounds to SH-SY5Y cell lysates, restricting the analysis to cellular samples due to human brain sample availability constraints. At a stringent LiP-Quant score threshold (LiPQuant score 2.0) that we have previously used in target deconvolution experiments, we observed no evidence of α-Synuclein (55-58% coverage; C-terminus not detected) as a binding target of any of these four compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10B</xref>). Instead, many other proteins were identified as putative targets, with multiple hits for EGCG and Baicalein (420 and 253 proteins out of 5050 and 5566 detected proteins), and fewer for ThT and Doxycycline (18 and 23 proteins out of 5650 and 4993 detected proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>; LiP-Quant score threshold of 2.0). At a lower LiPQuant score threshold (1.5), EGCG, but none of the other compounds, showed two significant peptides in α-Synuclein <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10C</xref>). Binding curves for these peptides indicate a relatively low affinity interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10D</xref>), and many other potential target proteins of EGCG (n=1550) were also identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10E</xref>). The data thus indicate that α-Synuclein is not a major binding target of EGCG, Baicalein, Doxycycline or ThT in a cell lysate and that the several other potential interactors of these compounds could compete for binding to α-Synuclein. Although we cannot rule out <italic>in situ</italic> binding to the protein C-terminus due to lack of coverage of this region, we consider this unlikely since we detected no strong C-terminal interaction for any compound with either the monomeric or fibrillar protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P28">We next analysed the detected <italic>in situ</italic> interactors of the anti-amyloidogenic compounds in light of the literature. Previously identified direct interactors of Doxycycline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> were significantly enriched in the corresponding LiPQuant hitlist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, LiPQuant score &gt; 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10F</xref>, LiPQuant score &gt; 1.5), indicating that the approach captures known binding targets. EGCG is classified as pan-assay interference (PAIN) compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and is known for its promiscuity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

For GRP78 (BiP), a known binder of EGCG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, the significantly changing LiP peptides mapped close to the predicted EGCG binding site on the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Similarly, changing peptides mapped close to the ATP binding site of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1), known to be inhibited by EGCG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) and the changing peptide exactly maps to the known binding site of epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) on the bovine enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>). Indeed, LiP-Quant-detected structural alterations of multiple ATP binding proteins (ACTR, HK1, MYH10, PAICS, ACTB) were consistently near ATP binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of EGCG for ATP binding proteins, as for all detected interactors, was observed at median ed50 values of 25.6 μM, which indicates relatively low affinity of EGCG towards these targets. We also observed that 4 putative EGCG targets were annotated as NAD-binding proteins (e.g., ADH5, MDH2) and that these also showed significantly changing peptides mapping near NAD binding pockets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). Finally, ATP-binding proteins (169 proteins) and NAD-binding proteins (19 proteins) were also enriched (GO analysis, ‘Molecular function’; q val&lt;0.05) among the EGCG hits within PD brain lysates, in single-dose LiP-MS experiments. Our data thus show that EGCG binds ATP-and NAD-binding pockets in complex lysates and at proteome scale.

In the presence of baicalein, the green tea polyphenol EGCG and compound #2, the three most potent inhibitors of aggregation as measured by ThT fluorescence, α-Synuclein showed relatively subtle structural changes compared to the α-Synuclein monomer. Moreover, the patterns of structural change were similar for all three compounds. Since both ThT fluorescence assays and our LiP data indicated a lack of fibril formation, this could suggest a much slower rate of fibril formation or the formation of other structures, such as stable oligomers, that did not evolve to amyloid fibrils in the presence of these compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Our approach also identified structure-specific effects of the compounds on purified monomeric and fibrillar forms of α-Synuclein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since EGCG, baicalein and compound #2 showed different overall interaction fingerprints with α-Synuclein monomers, the data suggest that they induced similar end structures despite different interactions with monomers.</p><p id="P33">We observed an interesting discrepancy between the ThT fluorescence assay and the LiP-MS structural data for α-Synuclein aggregation in the presence of doxycycline and compound #1. For both compounds, ThT fluorescence indicated that fibril formation was substantially reduced relative to control. At the same time, the LiP data indicate that fibril structures similar to control were formed at the end of the time course. A possible explanation for these data is that doxycycline or compound #1 compete with ThT for binding to α-Synuclein, or otherwise interfere with ThT fluorescence. Indeed, ThT, compound #1 and doxycycline all interacted with the N-terminal region of the NAC in the α-Synuclein monomer. While compound #2 also showed interactions with this region, and could in principle also affect the ThT fluorescence assay, in this case the structural data were consistent with the ThT data and indicated that compound #2 prevented formation of α-Synuclein fibrils. An alternative explanation for this discrepancy is that the LiP-MS signal in the presence of doxycycline or compound #1 may simply reflect a smaller amount of α-Synuclein fibrils formed under these conditions, or a fibrillar form that does not interact with ThT.</p><p id="P34">EGCG induced an N- and C-terminus-dependent compaction of α-Synuclein monomers. Previous NMR data have suggested that the monomeric protein undergoes N-C terminal interactions in the absence of any added compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, consistent also with our own previous LiP-MS data showing protection of some positions in the N-terminal region; our data now suggest that EGCG may stabilize this compacted form of the protein. This is also in line with observations from ion mobility shift MS that suggested that EGCG engages α-Synuclein in compact conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. For α-Synuclein amyloid fibrils, a structural form that poses many challenges for current methods, our LiP-MS based approach revealed that the N-terminus and the C-terminal end of the NAC are involved in the interaction with EGCG, corroborating predictions from molecular dynamic simulations. While baicalein and EGCG interact very similarly with α-Synuclein fibrils, the other potent aggregation inhibitor compound #2 has a completely different interaction fingerprint, with exclusively the first 10 residues of α-Synuclein involved in the interaction, suggesting a different molecular mechanism. Doxycycline also interacted with fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>; it remains to be tested whether fibril interactions of the compounds we assayed leads to disaggregation on longer time scales.</p><p id="P35">ThT interaction with amyloids is of particular interest as the PET tracer Pittsburgh Compound B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, used for imaging of β-amyloid plaques, is a radioactive analogue of this compound. Further, ThT aggregation assays are the main tool used to identify inhibitors of aggregation and thus understanding its mode of interaction with amyloid fibrils is of high interest. ThT is proposed to bind the amyloid-β peptide at β-sheets either by binding to hydrophobic channels along the amyloid-β peptide fibril axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> or to surfaces containing aromatic residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, ThT induced clear changes in proteolytic accessibility in the N-terminus of α-Synuclein fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic> but only very minor changes in the aggregation core. Several prior observations are consistent with an interaction of ThT with the α-Synuclein N-terminus. The majority of cryo-EM structures of α-Synuclein fibrils resolved to date showed that at least part of the fibril N-terminus is structured, potentially allowing ThT interactions at those sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>.

In addition, the N-terminus of α-Synuclein is positively charged, as a result of which it could electrostatically interact with negatively charged ThT.

Given competing binders within the complex proteome, the amount of compound available for α-Synuclein interaction is likely to be much lower in the lysate than for purified protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, in brain lysates, half of the top 10 EGCG hits were 1-2 orders of magnitude more abundant than alpha-synuclein, which may in part explain preferential binding to these proteins. Further, the α-Synuclein coverage <italic>in situ</italic> was incomplete. It is possible that the compounds interact with the α-Synuclein C-terminus, which we did not cover <italic>in situ</italic>, although this region did not seem important for compound interaction based on <italic>in vitro</italic> data. There may also be biological reasons for the discrepancy. α-Synuclein is thought to be conformationally complex, and it is possible that the structure of the protein in cell lysates is not identical to either the purified unfolded monomer or to the amyloid fibril we used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.

This would target such screening efforts directly at physiologically and pathologically relevant structures, for instance by identifying compounds that selectively bind the pathological conformation of α-Synuclein in brain lysates of PD patients but have no interaction with any proteins in healthy individuals. Our approach would also allow the identification of putative off-targets in a physiologically relevant context.</p><p id="P39">We report the first proteome-wide analysis of interactors of EGCG.

In the case of purified proteins DIA data was searched directDIA 2.0 in Spectronaut 14.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P74">In purified protein and patient brain sample data the fragment group quantity was selected for peptide precursor abundance comparison using a moderated t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment after median normalisation. The analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2 and the protti package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. Calculations of the amino acid scores were done by assigning the score of -log<sub>10</sub>(q-vale) x absolute(log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)) to every peptide. Amino acids were grouped and the mean score per amino acid was calculated. Where relevant (i.e., for removal of covalent modification effects), normalisation to tryptic control was done by subtraction of control intensities followed by the addition of the median intensities per peptide, prior to abundance comparison.</p><p id="P75">Data from α-Synuclein overexpressing SH-SY5Y samples was fed into the LiPQuant algorithm as described in Piazza and Beaton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. 2020. GO enrichment analysis was done using the protti function “calculate_go_enrichment”.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Visualization</title><p id="P76">For the fingerprint visualisation the ggplot2 package in R version 4.1.2 was used. To project the amino acid fingerprints and the peptide level fingerprints, the protti functions “find_peptide_in_structure” and “map_peptides_on_structure” were used. All the plots were exported to .pdf files from R and imported into Adobe Illustrator (Version 23.1) for the presented figures.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS192907-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d162aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Steve Gentleman from Imperial College London, the patients and their caregivers for their participation and contributions to this study.
