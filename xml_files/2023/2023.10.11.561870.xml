Each chromosome is coarsely divided into active (A) and inactive (B) compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Within TADs, fine-grained chromatin organization is established through interactions of non-coding, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs; here defined as enhancers and promoters). Such CRE interactions are critical for gene regulation, as most promoters alone possess low intrinsic power for regulating gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], and active genes interact on average with 2-4 enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Depending on the context, perturbation of one or multiple enhancers can be sufficient to largely attenuate gene expression through disruption of regulatory CRE interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P6">CREs can be accurately mapped using epigenome profiling assays such as ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, and stratified into different categories according to their regulatory properties (enhancer vs promoter, weak vs strong etc.) on a per cell type basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Further epigenome-based studies on cohorts of non-related individuals in single cell types revealed that not every CRE harbours equal chromatin accessibility or activity across individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Downstream association studies pairing this activity to commonly occurring genetic variants allowed to identify loci (i.e., Quantitative Trait Loci; QTLs) that impact either CRE accessibility due to disruption of transcription factor (TF) binding site(s) or histone modification deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Such a ‘population epigenomics’ approach has been used to link genetic variants to the activity of CREs and gene expression in a range of cell types and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While highly valuable, these studies mostly focused on individual CREs and thus did not explicitly assess how CREs interact to regulate the expression of nearby genes.</p><p id="P7">Chromosome conformation capture (3C) as well as microscopy-based approaches allow linking enhancers and promoters into units of functionally collaborating CREs, although this can be challenging in terms of resolution and throughput[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. An orthogonal approach is to perform epigenome analyses on many different genotypes, enabling the identification of co-variable CREs. This in turn allows the grouping of CREs based on their interindividual variability into coordinated, epigenomic hubs within TADs, which are referred to as chromatin modules (CMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]). Such an approach allows the mapping of CRE coordination in a genome-wide manner and, as compared to Hi-C and microscopy assays, provides direct epigenomic readouts of CRE activity and therefore allows revealing the impact of genetic variation on epigenome regulation. Nevertheless, the methods for mapping of CMs are diverse in terms of underlying statistical principles (varying from hierarchical clustering of interindividual peak correlations to Bayesian modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]), required input data and format and interpretation of output data. Effective implementation of these approaches requires a profound understanding of underlying computational techniques, including data standardization and experience with handling different data modalities, and accurate interpretation of the results. Moreover, broad application of these methods is hindered due to the lack of streamlined pipelines and associated methodological guidelines.</p><p id="P8">To address these challenges, we evaluated the existing approaches for CM mapping in terms of methodological and CM characteristics. We assessed the (dis)advantages of each of the methods and provide guidelines related to evaluation criteria, positive controls and data and sample size. We provide executable code that will allow each researcher to easily execute each of the workflows on their own data, leading to standardized data output formats and convenient interpretation. Next, we leveraged our method benchmarking efforts to perform CM mapping in six different cell types, revealing that regulatory coordination, captured with CMs, is organized in a cell type-specific manner, with cell type-specific CREs embedded in CMs being hallmarked by binding sites for lineage-specific TFs. Through association with the underlying genotypes and focusing on distinct immune cell types, we identified multiple (autoimmune) disease-associated genetic variants that impact CM activity. These analyses complement canonical chromatin QTL mapping efforts by providing regulatory insights into how non-coding variants contribute to disease by influencing gene regulation in a cell type-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>Comparative mapping of CMs across individuals with bulk epigenome data</title><p id="P9">Chromatin modules (CMs) represent genomic regions where CREs display co-variable activity for active histone marks such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). CMs can be mapped using correlation-based approaches that quantify epigenome signal co-variability across individuals to group CREs into modules using either graph-based community detection ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], which we will refer to as VCMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>])) or hierarchical clustering (Clomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]). A complementary strategy (PHM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]) uses interindividual variation to infer interactions between peak pairs conditioned on genetic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). So far, there has been no systematic comparison of existing techniques for CM mapping. To address this, we downloaded available H3K4mel and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data for 317 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]) together with respective genotype data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. We performed peak calling on all chromosomes for H3K4me1 (218’542 peaks) and H3K27ac (127’060 peaks). We mapped CMs using VCMtools, Clomics and PHM using the smallest chromosome 22 to evaluate several aspects of computational performance (i.e., elapsed time, memory consumption), and CM-related quantitative outputs (i.e., the number of mapped CMs, median module length, and coefficient of variation of CM length) across various sample sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1.1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>). Execution-wise, Clomics was the most user-friendly tool (i.e., required least input data formatting and was simple to use), the fastest (in terms of elapsed time) and the most efficient (in terms of RAM usage), followed by VCMtools and PHM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1b-c</xref>). Overall, Clomics also produced the largest number of CMs yielding two to three times more modules as compared to VCMtools and PHM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1d</xref>). The number of identified CMs and genetic associations scaled with the number of individuals and saturated at ~175 (Clomics and VCMtools) or ~250 (PHM) individuals, even though features such as median CM size remained relatively stable from 75 individuals onwards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1d-h</xref>). We also devised a strategy to quantify the reproducibility of mapped CMs in terms of included CREs using the different number of subsampled individuals (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>). This revealed higher average reproducibility scores with larger cohort sizes, with the best average reproducibility scores achieved for &gt;175 (Clomics / VCMtools) or 250 (PHM) samples. These analyses highlight that CM identification robustness scales with the number of included individuals, only increases marginally when more than 250 individuals are included, and requires a minimum of ~50-75 individuals. The lower number of detected CMs with PHM compared to correlation-based approaches can be attributed to PHM identifying only those associations that are linked to an underlying, putatively causal variant. In contrast, correlation-based approaches do not rely on genotype data and are thus less constrained in terms of selection of covariable CREs.</p><p id="P10">Next, we identified CMs on all chromosomes with VCMtools (n=9071), Clomics (n=18633) and PHM (n=5299) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Across all overlapping CMs in pairwise method comparisons, 42.4% of all CMs were at least partially identified using all methods (Venn diagram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>), with the largest average similarity between the correlation-based approaches Clomics and VCMtools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.2a</xref>). A representative example of a highly reproducible CM comprises the <italic>MB21D2</italic> locus that was previously shown to display high levels of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], displaying high or very low ChIP-seq signal in the CM-embedded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>, left). A large proportion of CMs was identified only using Clomics (~29%), of which a representative example is the <italic>SPIC</italic> locus. Although CM peaks in the <italic>SPIC</italic> locus showed lower average interindividual correlation (cor=0.18) compared to the CM around <italic>MB21D2</italic> (cor=0.58), the normalized ChIP-seq signal clearly indicates co-presence or co-absence of CM-embedded peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>, right). This indicates that Clomics has higher power in conditions with more subtle variation in co-variable chromatin activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1j</xref>). This is likely due to the adaptive background-aware thresholding used in Clomics that allows to account for local (1 Mb scale) differences in background correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], as opposed to universal p-value thresholding implemented in VCMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P11">In general, the methods showed high concordance with respect to previously reported CM characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], such as CM lengths (median 8.6-31.7k) and sizes (median 2-4 peaks) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.1i</xref>), localization (63.9-65.9% CMs in A (active) and 25.4-27.5% CMs in B (inactive) compartments, 71.3-76.8% CMs within TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.2b</xref>), enrichment in 3D interactions between CM-embedded CREs (Hi-C 500bp <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.2c</xref>) and active chromatin states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.2d-f</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref> for details). Finally, genes overlapped by CMs (20-50% among 26362 protein coding genes and lincRNAs; 75-80% of CMs overlapped a gene) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.2g-h</xref>) showed higher standard deviation and average expression compared to genes that did not overlap with a CM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.3a-c</xref>), and enrichment in B cell and immunity-related terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1.3d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Based on the performed analysis, we suggest to opt for Clomics over VCMtools among correlation-based approaches. Even though there is a high overlap between the methods, Clomics stands out by its ease of use and higher sensitivity towards identifying subtle yet putatively relevant chromatin co-variation. PHM provides directional insights into CRE communication, yet requires large sample cohorts and significant computational resources. Therefore, we suggest using PHM as an auxiliary approach for interpretation of CMs mapped with Clomics, which we will hereafter use for all downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cell type specificity of interindividual variation</title><p id="P13">Understanding regulatory variation among individuals in different cell types and states is crucial both from a fundamental and translational perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. To explore the extent of cell type specificity of chromatin activity variation among individuals, we extended the LCL dataset with downloaded ChlP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) and genotype data for hundreds of individuals resulting in epigenomic variation coverage in five cell types: LCLs (n=317), Fibroblasts (FIB, n=78), Monocytes (n=172), Neutrophils (n=164) and T cells (n=93) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To facilitate the interpretation of mapped co-variable CREs and ensure consistency in downstream analyses, we remapped ChlP-seq peaks to obtain a universal set of peaks for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2.1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>), and mapped CMs using Clomics in FIB (n=10158), Monocytes (n=9002), Neutrophils (n=6604) and T cells (n=4841) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.1b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). We first assessed cell type similarity based on mapped CMs across cell types. The highest average similarity was observed for CMs mapped in Monocytes and Neutrophils, while Fibroblasts tended to be the most distant cell type from the other ones, as expected based on its cell lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.1d</xref>). We used pairwise cell type comparisons to coarsely categorize CMs into: 1) universal CMs (similarity score &gt; 0.7), 2) partially overlapping CMs (0 &lt; similarity score ≤ 0.7), and 3) cell type-specific CMs (similarity score = 0). This showed that the majority of CMs are cell type-specific while some cell types, such as Monocytes and Neutrophils, have a relatively higher proportion of similar CMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.1e-i</xref>). Representative loci for each category are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>. This high degree of cell type specificity is also reflected in the association between CM activity, captured as the first principal component of the PCA performed on the CM peak count matrix (aCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]), and gene expression on these representative loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.2a-c</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate the prevalent lineage- and cell type specificity of the regulatory landscapes that we captured in the form of CMs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CM formation appears driven by functionally distinct groups of TFs</title><p id="P14">To identify candidate TFs associated with CREs embedded within CMs, we first performed differential peak-based TF binding site (TFBSs, which represent the genomic locations of TF motifs matching TF binding sites as determined using ChlP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]) enrichment analysis between CREs embedded within CMs and non-CM CREs for each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.2d</xref>). As non-CM reference regions, we created a set of ‘simulated’ CMs from the non-CM CREs that were size-, distance-, ChIP signal strength-, and GC-matched to the mapped CMs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>). The TFBS analyses revealed that CREs in CMs are significantly enriched for TFBSs of known cell type-specific TFs, e.g., EBF1 in LCLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and CEBPA/B in Monocytes and Neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.2e-i</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>), with larger similarity between myeloid (Monocytes and Neutrophils) and lymphoid (LCLs and T-cells) cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.2j</xref>). Since CMs were mapped based on a universal peak set across cell types, this indicates that CM CREs are enriched for cell type-specific TFBSs.</p><p id="P15">To further characterize the cell type specificity of the CM-embedded CREs, we aimed to compare the TFBS enrichment between cell types as well as assess the regulatory activity of the CREs. To determine the latter, we used available STARR-seq data from the GM12878 LCL cell line, which provides episomal CRE activity information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. We then performed pairwise comparisons between LCLs and every other cell type to stratify the CM-embedded CREs into those shared between the compared pair of cell types (i.e. CREs that we will refer to as ‘anchors’) and those specific to one of the cell types (i.e. CREs that we will refer to as “non-anchors”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2.3a</xref>). For all pairwise comparisons of LCLs to other cell types, we observed significantly higher activity at anchor CREs, with the lowest average activity at non-anchors of non-LCL cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.3b</xref>). This could indicate that CM CREs that are shared between cell types (anchor CREs) may have higher regulatory potential than non-anchor CREs, which themselves may have more secondary support functions as driven by cell type-specific TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we first aimed to assess which TFBSs are enriched in non-anchor CREs in a cell type-dependent manner, which revealed the enrichment of TFs with well-known functions in the respective cell types, such as KLF4 in Monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], KLF5 in Neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], the pioneer B-cell TF EBF1 in LCLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and TWIST1 in FIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.3c-d</xref>). These findings suggest that the TFBS enrichment that we observed when comparing the set of reference versus simulated CMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.2e-i</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>) is driven by cell type-specific TFs that bind to non-anchor elements.</p><p id="P16">As a next step, we included the anchor CREs in our pairwise TFBS enrichment analyses to define if non-anchor CRE-enriched TFBSs can also be detected in anchor CREs and if this depends on the assayed cell types. To do so, we specifically focused on the anchor CM CREs and contrasted these with a collection of non-anchor CREs between each cell type pair. Together with the comparison of non-anchor CREs, this allowed us to broadly categorize TFs into several groups based on 1) whether enrichment of their respective BSs in CMs is specific to either anchors, non-anchors or both (with the latter representing “general” CM TFs), and 2) if this BS enrichment is specific to one or few cell types (i.e. “cell type restricted”), or if this enrichment is present in all pairwise cell type comparisons (‘common’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2.3e</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We identified a total of 165 TFs that are enriched in anchor and/or non-anchor CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). The TFBSs for a total of 23 TFs were always enriched at anchors. These TFs include more universally-expressed regulators such as USF1/2 and SP1/2, as well as proteins involved in regulating 3D chromatin organization such as CTCF and YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. However, we found that the large majority of these 165 TFs (n=130) have BSs that are enriched in a cell type-restricted fashion in non-anchor or all CM CREs.</p><p id="P18">Altogether, these analyses suggest that CMs consist of both common regions (anchors) with higher regulatory activity that are preferentially bound by universally expressed TFs as well as CREs that are more cell type-specific and that are bound by TFs relevant to the respective cell type(s). A notable example that illustrates how CM formation may be driven by distinct classes of TFs is the B-cell-relevant <italic>TCL1A</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] where the gene is specifically expressed in B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.4e</xref>). The  <italic>TCL1A</italic> gene locus is enriched for binding sites of LCL-enriched TFs in the CM body, especially at the CM peaks, as compared to other cell types. This is exemplified by binding of cell type-specific TFs such as EBF1 and PAX5, as well as LCL-specific binding of CTCF and BHLHE40, at the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.4f</xref>). Together, our analyses indicate putatively divergent functional roles of TFs in the context of CM formation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Chromatin modules capture CREs associated with gene expression</title><p id="P19">Having identified TFs that are enriched within CMs and that as such may contribute to their establishment, we next aimed to conceptually assess how CMs can aid in understanding gene regulation (as gene expression (RNA-seq) data is not used for the mapping of CMs). It is conceivable that CMs offer several advantages compared to single CREs, since i) they group CREs into collaborating hubs, ii) the activity state of the CM (aCM) can be derived which reflects the compound activity of all CM-embedded CREs and thus that of the locus, and iii) CREs are linked to genes based on co-activity profiles and thus do not require 3D information for this. We first aimed to assess to what extent the aCM score is associated to gene expression relative to that of individual CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). Specifically, for each gene, we correlated its expression with 1) the height of the peak closest to the TSS but not part of the respective CM, 2) the height of the CM-embedded peak closest to the TSS, and 3) the activity score of the CM closest to the TSS. This revealed that in all conditions, the CREs closest to the TSS have the highest correlation to gene expression. However, it also revealed that CM CREs show higher correlations with expression of the closest gene at larger genomic distances compared to non-CM-embedded CREs and the group of any peaks (without distinguishing between CM and non-CM-embedded peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3.1a-d</xref>). This can be also observed in the gain of significant associations to gene expression when using aCM scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3.1e-i</xref>). In addition, absolute correlation values between aCM scores and expression of the closest genes were on average higher than absolute correlation values between the heights of individual CM peaks and expression of the closest genes, largely independent of which CM peak was assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3.1j-n</xref>). Together, by using multiple co-varying CREs aggregated into this aCM score, the set of candidate genes for which their respective expression correlates with chromatin state activity can be expanded by at least two-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS3.2a-e</xref>).</p><p id="P20">CMs are detected by leveraging interindividual variation, so it is conceivable that genetic variation contributes to the activity of at least a portion of CMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and through the CM affects gene expression. We therefore mapped not only histone mark (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) QTLs (hQTLs), but also variants that affect the activity of CMs (cmQTLs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>). While the total number of hQTLs is higher, QTLs could be mapped for a higher proportion of CMs compared to histone marks (~10% compared to ~40-50% for CMs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1a-b</xref>). We observed that ~60-70% of cmQTLs are also hQTLs or in LD (R2 &gt; 0.8) with hQTLs, indicating that in a large number of cases, variants disrupt a CM by disrupting histone mark enrichment at one or multiple CREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1c</xref>), and they do so in a largely cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1d</xref>). Binning of the interindividual peak signal variability further showed that CREs with higher interindividual variation in peak signal are more likely to be associated to a QTL and/or embedded in a CM, and that CM mapping allows to capture almost twice as many variable peaks compared to conventional hQTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1e</xref>). This suggests that many CMs capture regions with variable peaks that are not impacted by a focal genetic variant, but rather by another peak within the same CM. This is consistent with observations based on <italic>in silico</italic> approaches which suggest that frequently one or two CREs may act as the ‘dominant’ or ‘lead’ element(s) resulting in increased chromatin activity at the lead element itself as well as at nearby CREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Given that approximately half of the CMs can be linked to a candidate causal variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1a</xref>), it is conceivable that such QTLs disrupt the lead CRE in a locus leading to both local and distal changes in the chromatin landscape. As is evident from the examples highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3.2f-j</xref>, there are generally two or three CREs at which the ChIP-signal is strongest associated with expression of the nearby gene, in line with previous observations using CRISPR interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The associated cmQTLs localize in one of the peaks with the strongest association (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> of linear regression between peak height and gene expression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3.2f-i</xref>, red triangles), which therefore represents a putative ‘lead’ regulatory element in a genomic region. For example, in the <italic>CD9</italic> locus in Neutrophils, there are six principal regions that correlate with <italic>CD9</italic> expression (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.4 &amp; FDR &lt; 0.05 in linear regression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). All these elements are embedded into a CM, highlighting that these CREs covary between individuals in terms of epigenomic signal, which then influences <italic>CD9</italic> expression. The genetic variant with the strongest association to CM activity localizes in one of these peaks ~50 kb upstream of the <italic>CD9</italic> promoter, indicating that this is the putative lead CRE for the CM. Another example comprises the <italic>LRRC8C</italic> locus, where we identified a cmQTL (rs519989) for the CM in Neutrophils localized in an intergenic enhancer ~25 kb upstream of <italic>LRRC8C</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). The rs519989 variant was recently shown to impact PU.1 binding to this enhancer, leading to reduced enhancer-promoter connectivity and lower expression of <italic>LRRC8C</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Together, this illustrates how CM mapping can aid in identifying causal variants and linking them to genes in the locus without any 3D chromosome conformation information. Moreover, CMs capture different CREs that contribute to expression of the same gene in a cell type-specific manner. A notable example comprises the <italic>ICOSLG</italic> locus, where a putative enhancer 50 kb upstream of <italic>ICOSLG,</italic> previously shown to interact in 3D with the <italic>ICOSLG</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], is associated with <italic>ICOSLG</italic> expression in Monocytes and Neutrophils. This CRE does not contribute to gene expression in T cells, where expression is instead most associated with signal exclusively around the <italic>ICOSLG</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>). This is also reflected in the localization of the cmQTL in these respective cell type-specific CREs, indicating how cmQTLs allow to unravel cell type-specific regulation of gene expression. Finally, it is also conceivable that the same CRE drives expression of a gene, but that a cell type-specific element assists in this process. A notable example is the <italic>CD40</italic> gene expressed in both Monocytes and Fibroblasts, where a monocyte-specific CM captures an additional putative enhancer element, and both elements are only impacted by a variant in Monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3.2j</xref>). This shows that CMs can capture CREs that are impacted by genetic variants located in a distal CRE in a cell type-specific manner.</p><p id="P21">Altogether, these analyses provide conceptual examples of how CM mapping aids in obtained a fine-grained understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying (cell type-dependent) gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>cmQTLs are associated with binding of cell type-specific TFs</title><p id="P22">Next, we assessed the cell type specificity of cmQTLs and observed that hQTLs were more frequently hQTLs in another cell type (or in LD (R2 &gt; 0.8) with hQTLs) compared to cmQTLs. For example, 31.6% of H3K27ac hQTLs vs 19.4% of cmQTLs were shared between Monocytes and Neutrophils, indicating that cmQTLs capture more cell type-specific activity, as also revealed based on the enriched TFBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1d</xref>). As both hQTLs and cmQTLs can provide regulatory cues by disrupting or creating TFBSs, we compared histone QTLs that are also cmQTLs (which we will refer to as ‘hcmQTLs’ for simplicity) to QTLs that only impact a histone modification peak (hQTLs). Both QTL types displayed a similar genomic distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1f</xref>) yet hcmQTLs had on average a bigger impact on the peak height (i.e., higher beta values in a linear regression of genotype and normalized peak counts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1g</xref>). Both QTL types were enriched in cell type-specific open chromatin regions, with slightly higher specificity for hcmQTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1h</xref>), and hcmQTLs displayed stronger overlap (or in LD (R2 &gt; 0.8) with cell type-specific expression QTLs (eQTLs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.1i</xref>). Given that CM CREs enriched for TFBSs associated with cell type-specific TFs, we aimed to assess if hcmQTLs would also more often disrupt TFBSs for cell type-specific TFs compared to hQTLs. To do so, we compared the TF binding events that are disrupted by the QTLs using allele-specific binding (ASB) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>](<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>). This revealed that a higher proportion of hcmQTLs is associated with ASB in any cell type compared to hQTLs with associations of QTLs with ASBs being partially cell type-specific. Notable examples include enrichments in ASB for the myeloid master regulator CEBPA/B in Monocytes and Neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], for the mesoderm TF TCF21 in Fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] and the T(h1) and lymphoid factor TBX21 in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.2a</xref>). In addition, many of the ASB events were more frequent in the hcmQTL group, indicating that hcmQTLs are associated with regions of dense(r) TF binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.2b</xref>). We complemented these analyses by assessing which TFs are more often binding (based on ChIP-seq data in any cell type) in a 200 bp window around the hcmQTL compared to hQTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. This validated the ASB observations in terms of binding of cell type-enriched TFs at hcmQTLs, such as IRF4 and BCL6 TFs in LCL, JUN/FOS in Fibroblasts and C/EBP in Monocytes and Neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.2c</xref>). Together, these observations further indicate that CMs tend to arise in a cell type-specific manner driven by the binding of cell type-related TFs.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Deconstructing regulatory hierarchies at autoimmune disease GWAS loci using CMs</title><p id="P23">Compared to QTLs exclusively impacting histone PTMs, hcmQTLs have a stronger impact on peak height, disrupt peaks that are most strongly associated with gene expression and are more likely to overlap cell type-specific eQTLs. We reasoned that hcmQTLs could thus be used to improve our understanding of disease predisposition. First, we computed the overlap (shared variants or in LD with R2 &gt; 0.8) of hcmQTLs and hQTLs with variants reported in the GWAS Catalog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] and compared the observed/expected ratio for the two types of QTLs with respect to overlap with the GWAS Catalog. This revealed several associations that occurred more frequently for hcmQTLs in the tested cell type, such as ‘Monocyte counts’ in Monocytes, ‘Lymphocyte counts’ in T cells and ‘Neutrophil percentage of white cells’ for Neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3a</xref>), further underlining the cell type specificity of cmQTLs. To assess how cmQTLs can assist in understanding regulatory logic at disease loci, we focused on autoimmune disease as these have their origin in immune cell types and a large number of GWAS summary statistics is available. Specifically, we used a list of 340 GWAS loci where co-localization of GWAS has been observed with at least an eQTL, hQTL, methylation QTL or a splicing QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. We then assessed co-localization of the cmQTLs on these loci with GWAS summary statistics for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Celiac Disease (CEL), Crohn’s Disease (CD), Juvenile dermatomyositis (DM), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), psoriasis (PSO), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. The majority of these loci (n=275, 80.9%) contained a CM in at least one cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). We applied a Bayesian co-localization approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] and defined co-localization as a Posterior Probability (PP) &gt; 0.8 and at least one variant with a p-value &lt; 1e-5 for both cmQTL (without distinguishing hQTLs and hcmQTLs) and GWAS association. This revealed co-localization of 59% (n=161) of cmQTLs with GWAS signal for at least one autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3b</xref>), with more than half of the mapped CMs as well as cmQTL-GWAS co-localization being cell type-specific and the large majority (in LD with) an eQTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] in at least one tested cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c-e</xref>). Next, we aggregated the co-localizations on a per-gene basis as one gene can be associated with multiple GWAS variants, resulting in 106 GWAS gene – cmQTL co-localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>, some examples of co-localizations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>). A notable example comprises the <italic>SKAP2</italic> locus where there are two associated candidate cmQTLs (rs2960785 and rs774267) with equal p-value of association with the aCM score, as well as expression of the CM-embedded genes <italic>SKAP2</italic> and <italic>HOXA1</italic> in Neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g-h</xref>). We found that only rs2960785 localizes inside an intergenic enhancer region between <italic>SKAP2</italic> and <italic>HOXA1,</italic> indicating that rs2960785 is the likely causal variant. In addition, rs2960785 is highly blood-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3c</xref>), creates a putative GABPA binding site (CGGAAG)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] (which is a direct interactor of the myeloid TF CEBPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]) and is associated with ASB of CEBPA in AML[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], providing direct insights into the molecular mechanisms that likely underlie how this genetic variant impacts the locus in a cell type-specific manner. For the <italic>C3</italic> and <italic>TNFSF14</italic> locus, the highest associated cmQTL is rs339392, which localizes in the <italic>C3</italic> promoter where it impacts chromatin activity at the locus, the expression of <italic>C3</italic> itself and to some extent also the expression of <italic>TNFSF14</italic> in LCLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4i-j</xref>). The variant is also an eQTL for C3 in LCLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3c</xref>) and is predicted to create a PU.1 / ETS binding motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3d</xref>). The variant rs339392 was recently confirmed as a PU.1 binding QTL in LCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], and this impact on PU.1 binding extends to the other peaks embedded within the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4i</xref>), showing how a DNA base change can impact both histone modifications and TF binding on the focal CRE as well as associated distal CM-embedded CREs. A final example shown here involves the <italic>TRIM14</italic> locus, where the variant rs7867966 in the <italic>TRIM14</italic> promoter impacts the aCM score and the expression of <italic>TRIM14</italic> as well as the nearby gene <italic>CORO2A,</italic> likely owing to the impact of the variant on the promoter of <italic>CORO2A</italic> that is also embedded in the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4k-l</xref>). Similar to rs2960785, rs7867966 is an eQTL specific to blood cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3c</xref>) and predicted to disrupt a C/EBP binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.3e</xref>). Together, these example loci conceptually illustrate how mapping of CMs and associated QTLs can be used for the mechanistic interpretation of disease-associated non-coding variants, here exemplified by autoimmune disease-associated genetic variants. In addition, it allows to narrow down the number of candidate variants within a locus, as frequently more than one hQTL per locus can be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g, i, k</xref>; red triangles).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Chromatin modules reveal how genetic variants can impact expression of immune surface markers</title><p id="P24">Surface markers represent the molecules essential for immune cell interactions and consequently function, and several associations between non-coding variants and cell surface marker expression have already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Altered regulation of surface marker expression can affect how immune cells interact to combat infection and also impact the efficacy of treatment modalities that target these markers such as immunotherapy regimes. To assess the mechanisms underlying epigenomic regulation of surface marker expression, we aimed to investigate links between surface marker expression, CMs and associated QTLs. We used a list of 185 surface markers consisting of all Cluster of Differentiation (CD) and Tetraspanin molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. For 69 of these loci, we identified a CM in at least one cell type, and for 44 loci, a cmQTL was found in at least one cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.4a</xref>). For example, for the CM spanning <italic>CD207</italic> in Monocytes, the top associated cmQTL rs11126300 localizes in an intergenic enhancer region between <italic>CD207</italic> and <italic>CLEC4F,</italic> where it modulates the epigenome of a range of putative CREs as well as the expression of both <italic>CLEC4F</italic> and <italic>CD207</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.4b-d</xref>). While CD207 is only expressed very lowly, <italic>CLEC4F</italic> is expressed higher and important for monocyte-derived Kupffer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Another relevant example is the <italic>CD93</italic> locus in Neutrophils, where a CM spans a range of genes. The top ranked candidate associated variant rs844881 localizes in a peak at the 3’ UTR of the lncRNA <italic>LINC00656.</italic> This variant has a strong impact on the activity of the respective aCM, and also leads to strong reduction of the expression of <italic>THBD, CD93</italic> and <italic>LINC00656.</italic> Interestingly, we did not observe an expression change for <italic>NXT1</italic> and <italic>NAPB,</italic> which are adjacent genes that are not part of the respective CM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.4e-g</xref>). The variant rs844881 shows a strong association with the development of varicose veins in the FinnGen cohort (p = 5.5e-5)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>].

Finally, the example of the <italic>CD9</italic> locus shows that even though the same genetic variant impacts an intergenic enhancer in different cell types, it is only when adjacent CREs are included in the CM that this results in an impact on gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4.4h-i</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Altogether, these analyses reveal how genetic variants can impact CMs around surface markers and potentially result in functional variation in immune cell function with impact on disease susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Context-dependent formation of CMs in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</title><p id="P26">Recent works revealed that non-coding genetic variants can impact the prognosis of chronic (CLL) and acute (ALL) lymphocytic or myeloid (AML) leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. For example, a variant in the <italic>AXIN2</italic> locus was shown to activate multiple enhancers (within a CM) as well as the expression of <italic>AXIN2</italic> which was linked to better survival rates of CLL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Another study on ALL reported a variant in a <italic>GATA3</italic> enhancer that impacts multiple regions around GATA3, resulting in higher <italic>GATA3</italic> expression in <italic>cis</italic> and downstream 3D genome rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. As such, we aimed to assess if CMs could capture CLL-specific-induced epigenome configurations. For this purpose, we uniformly analysed epigenome data from LCLs (immortalized B cells in a non-disease context, n=317 individuals) and CLL (immortalized B cells in the context of cancer, n=105 individuals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). Similar to the strategies applied for the five cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>), we defined a common set of peaks based on H3K27ac enrichment in both contexts and used these for CM mapping. Since CMs capture variable signal, we reasoned that calculating the variance of each CM in both LCL and CLL in combination with the interindividual variability in gene expression would allow identification of genomic loci in which both the local chromatin environment as well as expression of the embedded genes are distinct between LCL and CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5a-b</xref>). Such loci are of special interest since they may contribute to the leukemic state of these cells, and some of the CLL-specific locus-gene combinations identified in these analyses include previously implicated genes such as <italic>CTLA4</italic> and <italic>WNT3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). The locus-gene combination that we found is most specific to CLL is the <italic>OSBPL5</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). While not active in LCL, we observed that the <italic>OSBPL5</italic> promoter as well as several flanking enhancers are activated in a subset of CLL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>). By associating this region to the underlying genotype (n=35 individuals for which both H3K27ac ChIP-seq and genotype data are available[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]), we identified a common candidate non-coding germline variant (rs895555, MAF=45%) in an <italic>OSBPL5</italic> intron that is strongly associated with the activation of the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d-e</xref>). The T allele of rs895555 creates the core of a putative Forkhead (FOX) TF binding site ((<underline>T</underline>/C)GTTT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5c</xref>), which is of interest given the implication of this TF family in the development and progression of B cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. The expression of <italic>OSBPL5</italic> is a prognostic marker for overall survival in the context of mutated IGHV status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f</xref>), and has also recently been identified as the strongest predictive gene expression marker for time to progression after chemoimmunotherapy treatment of CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. Thus, our findings indicate how a genetic variant might impact disease progression in a personalized manner through induction of a CM at the <italic>OSBPL5</italic> locus. The second-highest variable gene-locus combination was the <italic>COBLL1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5d-f</xref>), for which the strongest associated variant is a common (MAF = 17%) intronic TATA duplication in a subset of CLL individuals. <italic>COBLL1</italic> expression is associated with survival in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5g</xref>) and has also been linked to survival probability in several other cancer types including chronic myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. Finally, we analysed TF binding profiles in the CREs included in CLL or LCL CMs, compared to simulated reference CMs. We observed enrichment of many similar types of TFs, related to B cell function such as IRF, RUNX and EBF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5g-h</xref>), but also specific enrichment of factors such as FOXO1 (as also seen for rs895555) in CLL which have been implicated in CLL and harbour driver mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>].

We provide mapped CMs in an accessible format (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S31">data availability</xref>) and show how these can be used to disentangle the different (epi)genomic modalities, starting from genetic variants to TFBSs, histone modifications on local and distal CREs and finally gene expression. Our results substantiate the hypothesis of cooperation between local and distal CREs within TADs, which we observed using both epigenome data and enrichment in 3D interactions. At the sub-TAD scale, we argue that mapping of CMs thus provides an approach complementary to 3C-based applications for determining CRE interactions within TADs in a genome-wide manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. An advantage of mapping CMs is that CREs are grouped into functional units, and that CMs therefore allow to provide mechanistic rationales regarding how non-coding variants can impact the epigenome of local and distal CREs as well as the expression of genes embedded within the respective CM.

Moreover, structural proteins such as CTCF are ubiquitously expressed, and tend thus on themselves to be unable to define the cell type-specific CRE cooperativity within CMs. Together, this raises questions of how regulatory interactions within a TAD environment are established in a cell type-specific context. An attractive hypothesis is that this is mediated by cooperating TFs, which often are expressed in a cell type- or lineage-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>], followed by TF-mediated recruitment of general co-activators and chromatin modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The observations on the cell types assayed here suggest that CMs are established by classes of more ubiquitously expressed TFs that bind CM-embedded CREs that are shared across multiple cell types (here defined as anchors) in combination with cell type-specific TFs that bind CM-embedded CREs whose activity is restricted to one of just a few cell types. Such cooperative binding of cell type-/lineage-specific and core CM TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] that reflect a specific cell state may thus mediate CRE interactions within and beyond the 3D genome organization established by CTCF and Cohesin. This observation is also consistent with the notion that cmQTLs frequently disrupt the binding sites of cell-type specific TFs, which then could impact histone modification deposition and cooperation between CREs within a CM in a cell type-specific manner. This finding complements recent observations showing that genetic variants impact CRE interactions relevant for establishing gene expression through direct perturbation of TF binding to enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>] and that TFs are the main drivers of gene expression cooperativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P29">Altogether, we demonstrate that CMs provide a means to shed light on the mechanisms underlying gene expression and gene regulatory variation with high-throughput epigenome data in a range of genetic backgrounds, provided the availability of a sufficient number of assayed samples. Future applications of CM mapping could include defining CM plasticity within closely related cell types during cellular differentiation, or rather in different species to assess how conserved local genome organization is. With the constantly decreasing cost of high-throughput sequencing and easy-to- implement epigenome tools, we advocate for the value of CM mapping in future studies where epigenome data is being generated in large sample cohorts as part of the overarching goal to understanding how regulatory variation contributes to complex traits and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>].

The CM mapping approach described in Waszak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] was implemented in python (hereafter referred to as VCMtools) and adapted to account for the cell type-specific background by using empirical p-value correction followed by FDR thresholding. Namely, for each chromosome, for two peaks, whose centers are located at the max distances of 500 Mb from each other, we calculated and stored correlation values of the respective peak height profiles across individuals. Then, we calculated the average background correlation (<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>bg</italic></sub>) and its standard deviation (<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>bg</italic></sub>) for all peak pairs across all chromosomes.

CMs were identified by selecting isolated components after filtering peak-to-peak correlations based on the specified corrected p-value threshold (p-value &lt;= 0.001).

The number of peaks per histone mark in the set of sampled non-CM peaks was perfectly matched with the respective reference CM histone mark peak frequencies. We repeated the procedure 10 times per CM, resulting in 10 sets of sampled peaks per CM, where each set represents a candidate simulated CM. These candidates for simulated CMs were characterized with the same feature set as for CMs. For every CM in the reference set, we searched for the five most similar simulated CMs among all generated candidates of the same size (same number of peaks), with respect to the feature vector, by applying Approximate Nearest Neighbors search (Annoy package <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">https://github.com/spotify/annoy</ext-link>).

We collected available H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data for LCLs and associated genotypes for 317 individuals. We then used the data to map covariable regions with three approaches: correlation-based approaches (VCMtools, Clomics) that depend only on the epigenome data for CM mapping, and a Bayesian hierarchical method (PHM) that requires genotype information in addition to epigenome data. <bold>c.</bold> The depicted Venn diagram shows the percentage of overlapping CMs by at least one base pair across different methods. <bold><italic>Left panel</italic></bold>: example of the most reproducible CMs across three methods in the <italic>MD21D2</italic> gene locus.

ChIP-seq and genotype data were collected for hundreds of individuals for five cell types, namely LCLs, Monocytes, Neutrophils, T cells and Fibroblasts (FIB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The collected ChIP-seq data was processed in a standardized way to obtain a count matrix for a universal peak set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref> for details), which was used for CM mapping. The downstream analysis included evaluation of cell type specificity of regulatory variation captured in the form of CMs, and quantification of TFBS enrichment in specific CM peak types. <bold>b. <italic>From left to right</italic></bold>: 1.
