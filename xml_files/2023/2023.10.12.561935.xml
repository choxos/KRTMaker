Coronaviruses exhibit many mechanisms of innovation given flexibility in genomic composition relative to most RNA virus families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Examples include the acquisition of unique accessory genes that can originate by capture of cellular genes or through duplication and divergence of existing viral genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Accessory genes may be influential in dictating viral host range and cellular tropism, but little is known about how selection acts on these variable regions of virus genomes. We used experimental evolution of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) with an inactive native phosphodiesterase, NS2, that encodes a complementing cellular AKAP7 gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, to simulate the capture of a host gene and found hidden patterns of constraint that determine the fate of coronavirus accessory genes. After courses of serial infection, AKAP7 was retained under strong selection but rapidly lost under relaxed selection. In contrast, the gene encoding inactive NS2, ORF2, remained intact, suggesting it is under cryptic evolutionary constraint. Guided by the retention of ORF2 and hints of similar patterns in related betacoronaviruses, we analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, which arose via gene duplication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and contains premature stop codons in several globally successful lineages. As with MHV ORF2, the coding-defective SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 gene remains largely intact, mirroring patterns observed during MHV experimental evolution and extending these findings to viruses currently adapting to humans. Retention of inactive genes challenges assumptions on the dynamics of gene loss in virus genomes and can help guide evolutionary analysis of emerging and pandemic coronaviruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronaviruses in the <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order have some of the largest known RNA genomes, ranging from ~27-32 kilobases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The stability of these large genomes is facilitated by the innovation of a proofreading exonuclease into the RNA polymerase complex, unique among RNA viruses, that enhances replication fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

However, exogenous genes engineered into TEV, a small single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, substantially increase genome size, which might drive loss regardless of a potential fitness benefit offered by the gene product. To date, no comparable studies using animal RNA viruses to test the interplay between gain of beneficial coding sequence and selection on genome size are reported. Therefore, our understanding of how viral genome architecture and content evolve is poor, relative to the intense focus on how viruses evolve by nucleotide substitution. Given the major evolutionary leaps afforded by gene rearrangements, gains, and losses this represents a significant gap in our fundamental understanding of viral evolution.</p><p id="P4">To explore how selection acts on newly acquired viral genes we used experimental evolution of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototypical betacoronavirus, the genus that includes SARS and MERS-related coronaviruses. ORF2 of MHV and related viruses encodes a 2’-5’ phosphodiesterase (PDE), NS2, that antagonizes the OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway. We used recombinant MHV encoding a cellular PDE, the AKAP7 central domain (AKAP7), as a functional replacement for an inactive NS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> with a substitution at position 126 (His126Arg), that results in restricted replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Viral PDEs were derived via capture of cellular AKAP7-like genes so using this virus, MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup>, simulates a horizontal transfer event giving rise to a novel viral gene. Critically, the AKAP7 PDE is inserted in place of ORF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, allowing us to probe the relationship between selection and gene retention without introducing a substantial expansion of the genome.</p><p id="P5">We found that the retention of coronavirus accessory gene sequences in different selective environments does not conform to expectations of genome streamlining. Under relaxed selection in the absence of an active OAS-RNase L immune defense, AKAP7 was rapidly lost, consistent with selective pressure favoring reduced genome size. However, in striking contrast, MHV ORF2 was retained under all conditions tested. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 has been maintained largely intact even in lineages where it has lost coding capacity. These results suggest fundamental and widespread constraints on reducing viral genome size that may result from genes with overlapping coding and non-coding functions that influence coronavirus evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell type-dependent selective pressure on viral phosphodiesterases</title><p id="P6">To test outcomes of selection on coronavirus genome composition, we used a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant that has an inactivating H126R amino acid change in NS2, its native PDE, which is functionally complemented by insertion of the coding sequence for the cellular AKAP7 PDE central domain (AKAP7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The AKAP7 gene inserted into MHV is 618 nucleotides and replaces the non-essential 321 nucleotide ORF4, so expansion of the genome is minimal (~1%). MHV with inactive NS2 (MHV<sup>NS2Mut</sup>) is restricted in mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by OAS-RNase L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, while AKAP7 inserted into MHV (MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup>) compensates for the inactive NS2 and restores replication to wild-type virus levels in BMDMs and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. MHV<sup>NS2mut</sup> is restricted in immortalized primary macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, but replicates to wild-type levels in L2 mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), providing differential selection for courses of experimental evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Similarly, MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> replicated to high titers whereas MHV encoding an inactive AKAP7 PDE (MHV<sup>AKAP7mut</sup>) was significantly restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that these cells have an active OAS-RNase L pathway that imposes selective pressure to retain an active PDE. In contrast, MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> and MHV<sup>AKAP7mut</sup> replicated to an equivalent level in L2 fibroblasts, establishing these cells as a model for MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> evolution under relaxed selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deletion of AKAP7 occurs rapidly under relaxed selection</title><p id="P7">Our experimental evolution workflow uses serial passage in macrophages and L2 cells to model evolution of a horizontally acquired PDE under different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We plaque purified passage 0 (p0) MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> and conducted ten serial passages in triplicate in each cell type at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. At each passage we titrated virus production by plaque assay to calculate the MOI for the subsequent passage and collected total RNA for analysis of AKAP7 by PCR and Sanger sequencing. In macrophages, full-length AKAP7 was retained through ten passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A-B</xref>), whereas in L2 cells, smaller PCR-generated bands appeared by passage two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1C</xref>). The smaller bands became increasingly prominent through p10, while the full length AKAP7 band faded in intensity, indicating viruses with the full-length gene were disappearing from the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). We cloned and sequenced full length bands from macrophages and L2 cells, and smaller bands from L2 cells at each passage. AKAP7 from both cell types contained no mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). The smaller bands replacing full-length AKAP7 during L2 passage revealed substantial deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). The AKAP7 deletion variants did not undergo nucleotide mutations, consistent with high fidelity coronavirus replication and revealed a lower barrier to genetic change by deletion than mutation, at least in the AKAP7 gene. Virus populations recovered at passage 10 from L2s exhibited significantly restricted replication relative to macrophage-passaged virus populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>), demonstrating that despite the heterogeneity in AKAP7 deletion patterns between replicates, all three MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> populations lost the ability to effectively suppress OAS-RNase L.</p><p id="P8">In addition, we plaque purified isolates from replicate three p10 virus populations from both cell types and used these isolates to infect macrophages and L2 cells. Consistent with the loss of AKAP7 during L2 passage, p10 plaque purified isolates from these cells exhibited significantly reduced replication in macrophages but replicated to wild-type titers in L2s, with some experiments showing a small growth advantage for AKAP7-deleted isolates, which warrants further study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2E-G</xref>). The rapid loss of AKAP7 under relaxed selection is consistent with an evolutionary model wherein new viral genes must provide a sufficient near-immediate advantage to be retained long enough for further adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Inactive MHV ORF2 is retained under strong and relaxed selection</title><p id="P9">Like the loss of AKAP7 under relaxed selection, there is a strong <italic>a priori</italic> prediction that ORF2, which encodes an inactive PDE in MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup>, would be also rapidly lost from the MHV genome. Unlike AKAP7, ORF2 with the H126R inactivating substitution should be dispensable in both macrophages and L2 fibroblasts. Surprisingly, PCR of ORF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>) at each serial passage in macrophages and L2s and sequencing of ORF2 after 10 passages, revealed no deletions, gene loss, fixed mutations, or reversions of the H126R substitution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 2</xref>). Given the unexpected retention of inactive ORF2, we conducted five additional passages in both cell types to provide additional opportunity for deletion. We sequenced the macrophage-passaged viruses again at p15 to confirm there was no amino acid 126 reversion that might suggest ORF2 retention in these cells was due to OAS-RNase L-mediated selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 2</xref>). The striking retention of ORF2 raised the possibility that proteincoding coronavirus genes can be under hidden evolutionary constraint in addition to selection on protein function.</p><p id="P10">To investigate if similar patterns of constraint exist in the wild, we analyzed ORF2 from other betacoronaviruses in the same subgenus as MHV. Rabbit coronavirus HKU14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> has a premature stop codon mutation truncating NS2 to 43 amino acids. However, the entire nucleotide sequence encoding full-length NS2 is present in 4/5 HKU14 sequences in NCBI, while the other has ~100 bp of missing sequence relative to human coronavirus OC43, one of its closest relatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary FIle 3</xref>). In contrast, ORF2 in porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) appears much more evolutionarily malleable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, with various isolates containing ORF2 with premature stop codons or deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 3</xref>). These findings are broadly consistent with constraints on deletion of ORF2, with the heterogeneity in PHEV suggesting there are ecological contexts in which even these widespread hidden constraints are relaxed.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Long read sequencing confirms retention of ORF2 after experimental evolution</title><p id="P11">To fully characterize changes in the ORF2 and AKAP7 genes after experimental evolution we performed Oxford Nanopore direct cDNA sequencing of plaque purified MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> p0, five L2 p10 isolates and one macrophage p10 isolate. Mean read length across sequencing runs ranged from 1,065 to 1,528 bases and average coverage was 2,603x to 27,296x per nucleotide of the MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> genome with a mean of 8,943x. Across all sequencing runs ~70-75% of reads aligned to the MHV<sup>AKAP7</sup> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 5</xref>). To quantify changes in ORF2 and AKAP7 gene content after ten passages and control for variable overall sequencing depth across runs, we normalized average coverage of ORF2 and AKAP7 to average coverage of ORF1ab for each isolate. Consistent with PCR analysis, average relative coverage of ORF2 was the same in plaque purified passage 10 isolates from macrophages or L2 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3C-F</xref>), demonstrating with exquisite granularity that this genomic region is under previously hidden evolutionary constraint. The average relative AKAP7 coverage for p0 and macrophage p10 were 11.2 and 27.8, respectively, possibly reflecting enhanced synthesis of subgenomic mRNA following passage in macrophages, which could increase production of immune-modulating proteins and select for retention of AKAP7 during passage under OAS-RNase L selection. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). In contrast, the average relative coverage for L2 p10 isolates was 0.332, a 33-fold decrease from p0 consistent with PCR analysis. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B, 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3G-J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is retained despite loss of coding capacity</title><p id="P12">Our analysis of ORF2 in MHV-like viruses suggested the constraints we identified experimentally also exist in wild circulating viruses. However, the power of this analysis was limited by the relative paucity of genomic data available for animal viruses. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 dataset curated in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database contains more than 16 million genomes, offering an unprecedented window into viral evolution. Analogous to the inactivation of MHV ORF2 in our system, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 has acquired premature stop codons in numerous globally successful lineages, including B.1.1.7, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9, and XBB.1.16., as anecdotally described. ORF8 has been of interest since early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to a small deletion that emerged in its SARS-CoV ortholog in 2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, an early cluster of infections in Singapore involving an ORF8 deletion variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, as well as debate over its role during SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Despite the intense focus on ORF8 function and loss of full-length protein synthesis, very little attention has been devoted to the evolution of the gene itself. Given the recurrent acquisition of premature stop codons and the position of ORF8 upstream of nucleocapsid, a key structural gene, we analyzed patterns of sequence retention.</p><p id="P13">Although deletion of ORF8 might be predicted based on loss of its protein function, we hypothesized that, given its positioning upstream of a key structural gene, that it would be retained. We downloaded all sequences assigned to the B.1.1.7, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9, and XBB.1.16 lineages from GISAID and applied a cutoff date to exclude any samples with associated metadata suggesting they are incorrectly assigned. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4</xref>). We calculated a deletion length distribution of ORF8 in B.1.1.7 (45,920 sequences), XBB.1 (627 sequences), XBB.1.16 (518 sequences), XBB.1.5 (4,373 sequences), and XBB.1.9.1 (425 sequences) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), finding that across all sampled lineages 96% of deletions were smaller than ten nucleotides, ranging from a high of 97.6% for B.1.1.7 to a low of 81.8% for XBB.1.5. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 5</xref>). We then calculated the percent of ORF8 gene content in these lineages, sorted by collection date, and plotted these values for all genomes from all five lineages together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). Genomes with less than 95% ORF8 gene content were rare, and in XBB.1-derived lineages with a greater percent of genomes with large deletions these genomes were collected primarily early or in the middle of the circulation period of these variants rather than increasing at later collection dates as would be expected if ORF8 was being deleted over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). Finally, we calculated deletion frequency by position for all five lineages and observed two peaks, one in the middle of the gene and one at the 3’ end, but deletions were otherwise uniformly rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) These results are consistent with the retention of the ORF8 gene promoting SARS-CoV-2 fitness independent of selection on protein function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Due to their large genome sizes compared to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are amenable to horizontal gene transfer and gene duplications, among various mechanisms of genomic innovation and adaptation. They also exhibit signatures of constraint or streamlining of genome size, such as a ribosomal frameshift in ORF1ab as well as overlapping reading frames and bicistronic subgenomic RNAs observed among diverse coronaviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. How selection acts to balance adaptations involving genomic expansions and reductions, particularly in RNA viruses, is largely uncharacterized.</p><p id="P15">Findings from this study challenge a simple evolutionary model wherein the fate of protein coding genes hinges entirely on protein function. The persistent, unexpected retention of ORF2 in both macrophages and L2 fibroblasts through fifteen serial infections suggests a complex interplay of selective pressure acting on viral coding sequence. In L2s the PDE activity of ORF2 is dispensable, and the stability of the H126R substitution during experimental evolution in macrophages is consistent with AKAP7 fully counteracting OAS-RNase L activity. While it is formally possible that an unknown secondary role for the ORF2-encoded protein NS2 antagonizes innate immunity, no such function has been identified and the protein contains no identifiable domains other than the PDE.</p><p id="P16">The difference in genomic location between ORF2 and AKAP7 may be relevant to their respective fates. AKAP7 is located upstream of ORF5a, which encodes an accessory gene with unknown function, whereas ORF2 immediately precedes the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and spike structural genes. HE subgenomic mRNA is not expressed from the MHV A59 genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that some element within the ORF2 sequence or merely its presence may impact spike subgenomic mRNA synthesis and enhance viral fitness. ORF2 was lost in the HCoV-HKU1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 3</xref>) lineage, but other viruses descended from the HKU1 zoonotic reservoir have not been sampled, precluding a historical analysis of this deletion event. Determining whether ORF2 loss occurred before or after spillover into humans could provide important clues about selection acting on genome composition soon after zoonosis.</p><p id="P17">Direct parallels between the experimental retention of ORF2 and the recurrent retention of coding-defective SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 highlights the power of laboratory evolutionary studies for detecting patterns of constraint on pandemic viruses. Under a conventional model of selection favoring genome streamlining, viruses with ORF8 deleted would rapidly dominate B.1.1.7 and XBB.1-derived lineages, undergoing selective sweeps soon after the potential to encode full-length protein was lost. Analogous to the genomic position of ORF2 upstream of a key structural gene, ORF8 is directly 5’ of nucleocapsid. Previous work showed that changes in nucleocapsid can enhance viral fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and the retention of ORF8 indicates that it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 fitness irrespective of the function of the protein it encodes, which seems to explain widespread patterns of ORF8 sequence retention.</p><p id="P18">The exact nature of evolutionary constraint on MHV ORF2 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is not yet clear. An intriguing possibility is that the retained RNA sequence encodes a regulatory function tuning transcription of other genes. MHV ORF2 is upstream of spike, albeit with the defective HE gene intervening and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 immediately precedes nucleocapsid. If accessory genes promote synthesis of spike and nucleocapsid subgenomic mRNAs, viral fitness could be negatively impacted by reduced transcription and the resulting decrease in protein synthesis. Such regulatory functions might be sequence specific, involve RNA-RNA interactions, or relate to RNA secondary structure. While one study suggested RNA-RNA interactions between SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and spike genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, these possibilities are not well-characterized.</p><p id="P19">In future work, identifying patterns of evolutionary constraint may serve as an indicator of hidden sequence features impacting viral fitness. These regions can be prioritized for mechanistic studies using reverse genetics systems of MHV and SARS-CoV-2, opening a new bridge between experimentation and computational analysis of viral evolution. Experimentally dissecting fitness impacts will likely require the use of competition studies that can reveal subtle adaptive shifts in replication. The loss of ORF2 in HCoV-HKU1 demonstrates that viruses lacking this gene are viable, so any fitness defects of MHV<sup>ΔORF2</sup> might appear only over courses of experimental evolution or in direct competition with wild-type viruses. By identifying features under selection with experimental evolution to guide searches in genomic databases of viral populations, a new door opens to discovery of previously hidden viral evolutionary dynamics and constraints.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cells and Viruses</title><p id="P20">Immortalized primary macrophages were provided by Sunny Shin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, 17-Clone 1 and L2 cells were provided by Susan Weiss.

Alignments were performed using minimap2 (v.2.23) and subsequently sorted and indexed with samtools (v.1.16). Coverage at every position across the genome for each sample was calculated using the bedtools (v.2.26.0) genomecov command. Coverage was then normalized for each sample to the average coverage across ORF1ab (nucleotide positions 211-21746 in the reference genome), which contains the non-amplified reading frame, allowing for comparison across sequencing runs and samples. A rolling average of this normalized read depth was calculated across the genome in 25 bp windows and plotted with ggplot2 in R. For AKAP7 and ORF2 analysis, rolling averages were recalculated for the region containing the gene sequence ± 300 bp of flanking sequence on either side and plotted identically to the genome wide coverage plots.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 Deletion Analysis</title><p id="P29">All methods and code used to conduct this analysis are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/niemasd/SC2-Deletion-Analysis">https://github.com/niemasd/SC2-Deletion-Analysis</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Files</label><media xlink:href="EMS189659-supplement-Supplemental_Files.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d84aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS189659-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d84aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants F32AI152341 to SAG and R35GM134936 to NCE.
