The cell surface of the pathobiont <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) is decorated with a substantial array of ABC transporters, critically influencing nasopharyngeal colonization and invasive infections. Given the auxotrophic nature of pneumococci for certain amino acids, the Ami ABC transporter system, orchestrating oligopeptide uptake, becomes indispensable in host compartments lacking amino acids. The system comprises five exposed Oligopeptide Binding Proteins (OBPs) and four proteins building the ABC transporter channel. Here, we present a structural analysis of all the OBPs in this system. Multiple crystallographic structures, capturing both open and closed conformations along with complexes involving chemically synthesized peptides, have been solved at high resolution providing insights into the molecular basis of their diverse peptide specificities. Mass spectrometry analysis of oligopeptides demonstrates the remarkable promiscuity of some of these proteins when expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, displaying affinity for a wide range of peptides. Finally, a model is proposed for the complete Ami transport system in complex with its various OBPs. We further disclosed some essential structural changes facilitating oligopeptide transport into the cellular cytoplasm. Thus, the structural analysis of the Ami system provides valuable insights into the mechanism and specificity of oligopeptide binding by the different OBPs, shedding light on the intricacies of the uptake mechanism.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Author Summary</title><p id="P3">The uptake of diverse oligopeptides enables pneumococcal growth despite auxotrophies and functions as a critical sensor for assessing the composition of the local environment.

This process enables cells to acquire nutrients from the surrounding medium and facilitates communication with their environment. Bacteria employ various importers and permeases to take up diverse molecules, a subset of which belongs to the extensive family of transport systems referred to as the <underline>A</underline>TP-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>c</underline>assette (ABC) transporters. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is a Gram-positive bacterium assuming both commensal and opportunistic pathogenic roles. Notably, pneumococci colonize the human nasopharyngeal cavity before causing invasive infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Successful colonization of the nasopharyngeal cavity necessitates the acquisition of amino acids from this dynamic niche. Specifically, pneumococcus is auxotrophic for cysteine, glycine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, arginine, asparagine, histidine, and glutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Consequently, oligopeptide uptake from the milieu represents a pivotal mechanism for sustaining pneumococcal nutrition. Moreover, Gram-positive bacteria frequently employ oligopeptides as sensory molecules, capable of modulating the expression of numerous virulence factors, including hemolysins, adhesins, and genes mediating biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In particular, the pneumococcus recognizes and cooperatively responds to neighboring bacteria within its intricate ecological niche by sensing released peptide fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The uptake of oligopeptides by pneumococci is performed by a specific ABC transporter system known as ‘<italic>Ami’</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. All ABC transporters share a common architecture, comprising two permease components and two nucleotide-binding components (ATPases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Additionally, ABC import systems may involve a globular protein termed <underline>s</underline>ubstrate-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>rotein (SBP), serving as the initial receptor for the cargo. In Gram-positive species, the SBP is retained either anchored to the cell membrane <italic>via</italic> a lipid modification on the N-terminal cysteine or covalently linked to the translocation pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Crucially, SBPs determine the specificity of their respective transport systems, thereby governing the range of molecules capable of entering the cell. Despite exhibiting limited sequence similarity, these proteins share common features. They are bilobate molecules typically consisting of two domains, interconnected by a hinge region. The ligand binds within a deep cleft formed between both lobes [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and are trapped by the so-called “<italic>Venus fly-trap</italic>” mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The Ami system was the first ABC transporter identified in Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. It serves as the exclusive system responsible for the uptake of oligopeptides from the environment to overcome the pneumoccoccal auxotrophies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The constituents of the Ami system include two transmembrane proteins, AmiC (SP_1890/ SP_RS09390 in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4) and AmiD (SP_1889/ SP_RS09385), which collectively form a channel facilitating the selective passage of substrates across the membrane. In addition, two ATPases, namely AmiE (SP_1881/ SP_RS09380) and AmiF (SP_1887/ SP_RS09375), are positioned at the cytosolic face of the membrane, orchestrating substrate transport through the ATP hydrolysis. The Ami system is completed by the presence of the SBP AmiA (SP_1891/ SP_RS09395), which is an <underline>o</underline>ligopeptide-<underline>b</underline>inding lipo<underline>p</underline>rotein (OBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Following analyses unveiled that the Ami permease comprises four additional OBPs: AliA (SP_0366/ SP_RS01790), AliB (SP_1527/ SP_RS07525), AliC and AliD, all of which are paralogs of AmiA (‘Ali’ derives from ‘<italic>Ami-like’</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. It is worth to mention that AliC and AliD are exclusively identified in <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>e</underline>ncapsulated <italic><underline>S</underline>. <underline>p</underline></italic><italic>neumoniae</italic> (NESp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and are related with nasopharyngeal colonization and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P7">According to the Pfam database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the OBPs AmiA, AliA, AliB, AliC and AliD belong to the bacterial extracellular <underline>s</underline>olute-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>roteins family SBP_bac_5 (PF00496). The N-terminus of these lipoproteins encompasses a signal peptide which includes the lipobox motif [L][AST][A][C] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), that facilitates the translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and subsequent anchoring to the membrane by lipidation of the conserved cysteine residue (Cys23).</p><p id="P8">OBPs in the Ami system present molecular masses ranging from 53 to 70 kDa and belong to the cluster C of SBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], which includes SBPs with an additional third domain located within one of the two lobes.</p><p id="P9">The Ami system has been proposed to play a significant role in environmental signaling, the initiation of competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], as well as contributing to the successful colonization of the nasopharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. AliB, but not AmiA or AliA, is associated with meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]; suggesting that AliB may possess a distinct oligopeptide substrate specificity that cannot be compensated by AmiA or AliA. Notably, in the absence of capsular polysaccharides and PspK, group II NESp strains harboring <italic>aliC</italic> and <italic>aliD</italic> within the deleted <italic>cps</italic> locus, are still capable of nasopharyngeal colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Recent investigations led to the conclusion that AliC enhances pneumococcal competence while AliD facilitates early nasopharyngeal colonization of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] both are crucial in persistence during invasive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Moreover, AliC and AliD bind peptides matching ribosomal proteins of other bacterial species, indicating a potential route for interspecies communication within the nasopharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Subsequent investigations revealed a similar behavior for AmiA, AliA and AliB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P10">In this work, we present the atomic-resolution structural characterization of the OBPs from the Ami system that illuminate the dynamic structural changes occurring between open and closed conformations. Mass spectrometry experiments using samples derived from AliB and AmiA, revealed a considerable abundance of peptides sequestered during heterologous expression. Analysis of these peptides, together with structures of the OBP-peptide complexes reported here, provides a detailed comprehension of the specific peptide recognition patterns intrinsic to the OBPs of the pneumococcal Ami system.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Structural determination of OBPs within the Ami system. Three-dimensional insights into the apo conformations of AliD and AliC</title><p id="P11">The pneumococcal OBPs belonging to the Ami system, namely AmiA (24-659), AliA (residues 24-660), AliB (residues 26-652), AliC (residues 24-655) and AliD (residues 28-652); were expressed and purified deprived of the lipobox segment (see Methods). Next, all these OBPs, with the exception of AliA, were crystallized leading to the resolution of their three-dimensional structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Table</xref>). In addition, synthesis of five oligopeptides (peptides <bold>1</bold>-<bold>5</bold>) was undertaken for this work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Specifically, nine distinct crystal structures were resolved, representing the apo state (open conformation) or complexed (holo state) with the indicated synthesized peptides, showcasing closed conformations. The resolutions of these structures ranged from 1.49Å to 2.38Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Table</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The five lipoproteins exhibit pairwise sequence identity of ~52-60% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>) and share a very similar overall folding. Consequently, the 1.8 Å-resolution open conformation of AliD was selected as a representative structure to describe the global architecture of OBPs in the Ami system. Moreover, AliD was the only OBP for which we could obtain both conformations (open and closed, see below). Unless otherwise specified, structural features observed in AliD can be extrapolated to the other family members. The obtained electron density map of the AliD structure, encompassing residues 28 to 652, presents an excellent quality all over the sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A Fig</xref>). AliD adopts a bilobate structure characterized by three domains interconnected by short polypeptide chain segments serving as hinges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The two lobes enclose a deep cavity measuring ~16 Å in width and 45 Å in height, housing the peptide-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Lobe 1 comprises Domain I (residues 29-63, 191-296, and 583-617) and Domain II (residues 64-190), while Lobe 2 consists solely Domain III (residues 297-582) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). This structural organization, previously observed in other OBPs such as OppA from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], is implicated in the transport of peptides ranging from two to five residues in length, including cell-wall peptides containing γ-linked and D-amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Although AliD and OppA (PDB 1RKM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], with a sequence identity of 25.76 %, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B Fig</xref>) share a similar overall structural organization, notable differences exist between them, as evidenced by the high <italic>rmsd</italic> values obtained upon superposition (~3.2 Å, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, both proteins display a mixed β-sheet arrangement within each lobe, where strands undergo a characteristic cross-over pattern involving the so-called regions c1 and c2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The most striking feature of the AliD structure compared to OppA is the presence of an intriguing additional C-terminal 30-aa long α-helix (α19, spanning residues 622-652; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). This α-helix, which serves as distinctive hallmark of all the Ali proteins, establishes numerous hydrophobic and polar interactions with Domains I and II from Lobe 1, contributing significantly to the structural stability of the protein. Intriguingly, the exposed surface of α19 is decorated with multiple basic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A Fig</xref>), a conserved feature across all the OBPs in the Ami system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, helix α19 could contribute to both the rigidity of Lobe 1 during the Venus fly-trap mechanism and the stabilization of Lobe 1 on the membrane, while accommodating the length of the linker that connects the protein to the lipidated cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B Fig</xref>). Supporting this notion, the surface of Lobe 1 exhibits several basic patches that are absent in Lobe 2, suggesting that the protein aligns itself with the membrane <italic>via</italic> these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P16">AliC was also crystallized in the open conformation, and its structure manifests all the characteristics delineated for AliD. Remarkably, the crystal structure of AliC unveils a distinctive three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer arrangement. In this configuration, the Lobe 1 (comprising Domain I and II) of one monomer becomes intertwined with the Lobe 2 (Domain III) of the adjacent monomer, resulting in an overall architecture that is identical for the two functional monomeric units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A Fig</xref>). The resulting entwined dimer adopts an open conformation, but the width of the ligand-binding cleft is expanded compared to that observed in AliD, measuring 29 Å instead of 16 Å. Consequently, AliC exhibits a 13 Å wider open conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Three-dimensional structure of the AliD:peptide 1 complex</title><p id="P17">To investigate the conformational changes occurring in the Ami permease OBPs upon ligand binding, we synthesized specific peptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Table</xref>) previously demonstrated to be recognized by these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. One such peptide, FPPQSV (peptide <bold>1</bold>), derived from <italic>Prevotella</italic> species, has been shown to induce significant changes in gene expression and enhanced colonization when bound by AliD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The crystal structure of the AliD:peptide <bold>1</bold> complex was obtained by co-crystallization (see Materials and Methods) at 2.18 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The asymmetric unit contained two monomers (chains A and B) with virtually identical structures (<italic>rmsd</italic> of 0.14 Å for 564 Cα atoms superposition). In these structures, AliD monomers adopt a closed conformation, resulting in a complete engulfment of peptide <bold>1</bold> between the two protein lobes without contact with the bulk solvent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Movie</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). The ligand-bound and unbound forms of AliD retained the three-dimensional structures of the individual domains unaltered, as both conformations were related by a rigid-body rotation of ~20° of Lobe 1 (Domain III) relative to Lobe 2 (Domains I and III) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Movie</xref>). The peptide-binding site is located in the crevice between the two lobes, akin to other substrate-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. The electron density for the AliD:peptide <bold>1</bold> structure was of high quality, enabling straightforward model building of the hexapeptide FPPQSV in both chains of the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>) and facilitating the identification of the interactions that stabilize the substrate within AliD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). In the complex, the side chain of the first residue of the substrate (F) is accommodated within a hydrophobic cavity formed by residues I603, V499, and A52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). The N-terminal region of the substrate establishes electrostatic interactions with residue D501 and forms H-bonds with the main-chain atoms of residue V499, both from Domain III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Residue D501 assumes a crucial role in the interaction by establishing H-bond interactions with residue W498, which is involved in clamping the first two substrate residues through Van der Waals interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, residues located in Domain I of AliD including G39, A52, D53 and N608, actively contribute to stabilizing the substrate through polar interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). These polar interactions are complemented by several hydrophobic interactions facilitated by aromatic residues such as Y50, Y51, W498, F481, F518 and Y519 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), resulting in the tight binding of the initial five residues of peptide <bold>1</bold> to the AliD protein.

Consistently, we observed an increase in the B-factors of the substrate from the N-to C-terminus, along with the presence of two different conformations for the sixth residue in the substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Substrate recognition by other OBPs of the Ami system</title><p id="P19"><bold>Substrate binding in AliB</bold>. The crystal structure of AliB (residues 28-652) was solved at 1.65 Å resolution, revealing a closed conformation despite the absence of pre-incubation with any peptide. During the modeling and refinement process, additional electron density at the AliB substrate-binding site became evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7 Fig</xref>), likely originating from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> peptides bound during the purification process. Thus, we modeled <italic>E. coli</italic> peptides (VMVKGPGPGREST and PIVGGHEGAGV) previously reported to bind AliB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Although the electron density map clearly outlined the backbone of a nonapeptide, the side-chain density exhibited ambiguity in places, suggesting the binding of a heterogeneous population of peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7 Fig</xref>). Given that the observed peptide lengths did not align with the reported <italic>E. coli</italic> peptides, an identification effort was undertaken through mass spectrometry (see below). To evaluate AliB’s capacity to recognize diverse peptides, the protein was incubated with an excess of defined synthesized peptides that were previously reported to bind AliB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. This approach facilitated the determination of crystal structures of AliB in complex with three different peptides (peptides <bold>2, 3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Table</xref>).

As detailed later, these distinctions, coupled with the specific amino acid residues shaping the binding site, likely contribute to the observed variations in substrate specificity between these two OBPs.</p><p id="P21">The three complexes obtained for AliB exhibited minimal backbone changes among them (<italic>rmsd</italic> ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 Å). In all three complexes, mirroring the observation in the AliD:peptide <bold>1</bold> complex, the N-terminus of the peptide establishes a salt-bridge with an aspartic residue (D503) and van der Waals interactions with the neighboring tryptophan residue (W500) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C-3E</xref>). The region encompassing the first three residues of the ligands (AIQ in peptide <bold>2</bold>, PIV in peptide <bold>3</bold> and VMV in peptide <bold>4</bold>) folds in an antiparallel β-sheet-fashion with the β20 (G499, W500 and G501) from Lobe 1, and parallel β-sheet-like interactions with a loop of domain I (containing residues N52 and A54) on the opposite side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C-3E</xref>). This recognition pattern for the initial three residues of the peptide is conserved in both AliD and AliB complexes and, as detailed below, is also observed in the AmiA complex. Given the conservation of the structure and key residues in this region, the recognition pattern for the first three residues of the substrate could be considered a hallmark of all OBPs within the Ami permease system. Beyond the third position, the recognition by AliB does not adhere to a conserved pattern, as each peptide adopts a distinct conformation within the substrate-binding cavity and establishes different interactions with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C-3E</xref>). For instance, in the case of peptide <bold>2</bold>, the remaining portion of the oligopeptide immediately following the small β strand region, which exhibits a strong basic character (EKARKHN), adopts an α-helix conformation within the AliB cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). This helical region finds stabilization through numerous H-bonds with the protein and is further reinforced by salt-bridge interactions involving the basic residues of the substrate interacting with the acidic residues of the protein (E351, E437, and D443) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Peptide <bold>3</bold>, comprising 11 residues (PIVGGHEGAGV), shares the same length as peptide <bold>2</bold>, but possesses a distinctly different sequence. Analogous to peptide <bold>2</bold>, the initial three residues adopt a short β-strand conformation. However, in contrast to peptide <bold>2</bold>, the subsequent portion of peptide <bold>3</bold> lacks a substantial quantity of basic residues, comprising several glycines and other non-bulky residues. In this case, the ligand inside the AliB binding-site does not exhibit any secondary structural elements except for the conserved β-strand at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). The two glycine (G) residues in the peptide (residues 4 and 5) do not engage in polar interactions with AliB, while the following two G residues (residues 8 and 10) establish strong stabilizing H-bonds. Particularly noteworthy are the salt-bridge interactions that take place between peptide <bold>3</bold> and AliB (H4 from the substrate with E440 from AliB, and E5 from the substrate with K437 and H497 from AliB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).

Nevertheless, two notable distinctions emerge compared to the previous cases. Firstly, a <italic>cis</italic> peptide bond is present at position 6 of the peptide, corresponding to a proline. Secondly, the electron density representing the last three peptide residues (EST) weakens significantly, indicating a lack of stabilization for the C-terminus of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>).</p><sec id="S7"><title>Substrate binding in AmiA</title><p id="P24">As we observed in the case of AliB, the analysis of AmiA structure (solved at 1.50 Å resolution) revealed an unidentified electron density trapped at the substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9A Fig</xref>). Considering the precedent of this observation in previous reports for AmiA and the identification of the peptide’s nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we modeled this decapeptide reasonably matching the observed experimental map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9B Fig</xref>). To mitigate uncertainties stemming from potential mixtures of different peptides in our crystallized structure, we conducted pre-incubation of the AmiA protein with an excess of synthetized peptide <bold>5</bold> before crystallization. This strategy facilitated the elucidation of the AmiA:peptide <bold>5</bold> complex at 1.76 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). Four independent monomers were found in the asymmetric unit, all with a highly similar structure (<italic>rmsd</italic> value ranging from 0.14 to 0.21 Å for 574 Cα atoms among the four monomers, using monomer B as a reference throughout the text). Furthermore, the peptide <bold>5</bold> in the four chains exhibits an identical conformation of the peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10 Fig</xref>). In this complex, the N-terminus of peptide <bold>5</bold> is stabilized in a manner analogous to the description provided above for the other complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref>). It forms a salt-bridge with an aspartic residue (D507) and engages in hydrophobic interactions with a neighboring tryptophan residue (W504). The initial four residues of the peptide (AKTI) establish antiparallel β-sheet-like interactions, engaging the terminal residues of the extended strand of β20 on one side and forming parallel β-sheet-like interactions with a loop of domain I (which includes residues S54 and N56), on the opposite side. The oligopeptide adopts an extended conformation with minimal intramolecular interactions, displaying a kink of ~90º at residue 6, resulting in an “L” shape. The two isoleucine residues in peptide <bold>5</bold> (I4 and I6) tightly pack against each other, occupying a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues D443 (aliphatic chain), Y449, F481, L482, Y486 and V502, all situated in AmiA’s domain III. The lysine residue (K) at position 2 of the oligopeptide is stabilized through a salt-bridge interaction with E524 and a H-bond with T528 (domain III) of AmiA. The remaining charged side chains of the oligopeptide (K5, Q8, and R10) establish multiple hydrogen bonds with specific AmiA residues; notably, in the case of Q8, mediated by water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref>). The C-terminus of the peptide finds stabilization through hydrogen bonding with the nitrogen backbone atom of G590, located at the interphase between domains I and III.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the oligopeptides captured by AliB and AmiA during purification</title><p id="P25">The three-dimensional structures of AmiA and AliB revealed the capture of oligopeptides during their expression and purification from <italic>E. coli</italic>.

For identification criteria, we considered only peptides whose spectra with +2H charge state had been detected at least twice. Surprisingly, our analysis identified a total of 356 distinct peptides bound to the AmiA protein and 393 peptides bound to AliB. Notably, both AmiA and AliB bound large peptides ranging from 8-16 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11A Fig</xref>). AmiA predominantly recognized peptides consisting of 10-11 residues, while AliB favored 11-12 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11A Fig</xref>). Both AmiA and AliB showed a tendency to bind peptides with a hydrophobic amino acid, particularly valine, as the first residue. However, AmiA displayed an additional preference for peptides with negatively charged residues such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid at peptide positions 3, 4 and 5, whereas AliB preferred peptides also containing negative residues, especially glutamic acid, but at positions 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11B Fig</xref>). Remarkably, a considerable number of the identified peptides were found to originate from ribosomal and metabolic proteins, aligning with prior observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, a significant proportion of the peptides belonged to proteins involved in processes not previously linked to this context, including transcription, DNA replication or macromolecule transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11C Fig</xref>). Intriguingly, the distribution of peptides derived from proteins engaged in various processes exhibited differences between AmiA and AliB. Specifically, AmiA exhibited a higher proportion of peptides derived from proteins involved in cellular metabolism compared to ribosomal proteins, while AliB demonstrated a more balanced distribution. Furthermore, AmiA recognized peptides derived from proteins involved in cellular processes that were not detected by AliB, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. These distinctions underscore the unique peptide specificities of AmiA and AliB in comparison to each other. Furthermore, in a comparative analysis involving AliD or AliC, both of which were also expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we did not observe peptides originating from <italic>E. coli</italic> within the crystal structures of these proteins.

Mass spectrometry analysis of peptides trapped by AliB and AmiA during purification unveil an unexpected capacity of both OBPs to capture numerous distinct oligopeptides, with a maximum peptide length of 16 amino acids. This observation suggests a lack of stringent specificity in the nature of the trapped substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11B Fig</xref>). Such promiscuity aligns with two key factors: (<italic>i</italic>) the substantial volume of the substrate-binding cavity in the Ami system OBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12A Fig</xref>), which is the largest among OBPs within the same family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12B Fig</xref>); and (<italic>ii</italic>) the primary involvement of the N-terminal region of the oligopeptide in substrate recognition (see below).</p><p id="P27">AliB was crystallized with three different peptides (<bold>2, 3</bold>, and <bold>4</bold>), revealing that recognition primarily hinges on protein-oligopeptide interactions involving Lobe 2 of AliB with the N-terminal region of the oligopeptide (<italic>i.e</italic>., salt-bridge interaction with D503, van der Waals interaction with W500, and main chain H-bond interactions of β20 with the initial three positions of the oligopeptide in an antiparallel β-strand fashion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the three complexes indicates that no substantial alterations in the backbone or in side chains of AliB are requisite for the recognition of these three peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13A Fig</xref>). Consequently, the first three positions of the oligopeptides precisely aligned with the AliB binding site, whereas beyond the fourth position, different conformations of the oligopeptide are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Regardless, the electrostatic potential of the AliB binding site exhibits a neutral character to facilitate interaction with the residue at position 2 through Van der Waals interactions, and a strongly acidic character after position 4, enabling the stabilization of basic residues of the oligopeptides through salt-bridge interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, while maintaining the interaction pattern observed in AliB, AmiA features a β20 that is half the size of AliB’s (6 residues in AliB <italic>vs</italic> 3 residues in AmiA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). This shorter β-sheet is preceded by a coil that extends interactions with the oligopeptide backbone to residue 4 (as opposed to residue 3 in AliB). Indeed, the interaction of AmiA with the oligopeptide backbone propagates to residue 6 through interactions with side chains within the AmiA binding-site. Moreover, distinct structural disparities between the binding sites of AliB and AmiA are evident in two regions of Lobe 2, denoted as R1 and R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). AmiA features an additional α helix in R1 (residues 523-530), a characteristic absent in AliB, AliC and AliD, which instead exhibit a four-residues-long 3<sub>10</sub> helix. In addition, AmiA presents an acidic residue that mediates a salt-bridge interaction with the Lys residue at position 2 of peptide <bold>5</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Regions R1 and R2 (residues 532-538) together form a narrow pocket (Pocket 1), crucial for stabilizing the side chain from residue 2 of the oligopeptide, while a large pocket (Pocket 2) enables the stabilization of various conformations of the oligopeptide beyond position 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This combination of structural elements introduces notable differences in the shape and the electrostatic potential of the oligopeptide-binding cavity in both OBPs. Considering these structural characteristics, the five OBPs within the Ami system can be categorized into two groups: (<italic>i</italic>) the <italic>AliB-like</italic> group (exhibiting a 6 residues-long β20 and lacking an additional α-helix in R1), comprising AliB, AliC and AliD; and (<italic>ii</italic>) the <italic>AmiA-like</italic> group (featuring a 3 residues-long β20 and possessing an additional α-helix in R1), comprising AmiA and likely also AliA [as predicted by AlphaFold (AF)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). These disparities in the secondary structural elements, along with the nature of the residues decorating Pocket 1 and Pocket 2, provide distinctive particular features to the binding sites of each OBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13B Fig</xref>). These features are expected to influence the range of oligopeptides recognized by each OBP within the Ami system.</p><p id="P29">For instance, AliD presents a significant number of aromatic residues decorating the binding-site cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), promoting the binding oligopeptides with a high hydrophobic residue content.

Substrate recognition involves the side chain of the oligopeptide residue 2 within Pocket 1. Additionally, the first oligopeptide residue forms a salt-bridge interaction <italic>via</italic> a conserved aspartate with the backbone amino group of the oligopeptide. The capacious cavities in the OBPs of the Ami system facilitate the stabilization of oligopeptides up to 16 residues in length. Contrary to the N-terminal region, these longer oligopeptides adopt different folds (as coils or even as α-helices, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>) after position 4 and are recognized by the Pocket 2. Following recognition by Lobe 2, Lobe 1 further stabilizes the substrate through a few interactions with the N-terminal oligopeptide backbone and side-chain interactions with residues beyond the 9<sup>th</sup> position of the oligopeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).

Our structural analysis reveals that AF predictions for the permease in complex with the OBPs show an inward conformation, with a cluster of bulky aromatic residues (L435, L439 and I450 from AmiC; L155, F244, F247 and F248 from AliD) obstructing the passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref> top), thereby impeding oligopeptide transport. Also, the NBDs are in their apo conformation (before ATP binding, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref> top). To gain further insights into the structural transitions required for oligopeptide transport, we employed the recently developed program VARIO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chango.ibmb.csic.es/VAIRO">http://chango.ibmb.csic.es/VAIRO</ext-link>), to provide functional context to AF-predicted models by incorporating consistent prior experimental knowledge (see Methods). This is necessary to guide AF predictions to less stable conformations, as in this case where energy provided by the ATPase assists conformational changes. Consequently, an outward conformation for the permease was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This conformation reveals AmiE and AmiF in close contact, as observed in other NBDs from ABC transporters when trapping ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref> bottom). In this conformation the transmembrane dimer formed by AmiC and AmiD adopts an outward open conformation, with displacement of the aforementioned cluster of hydrophobic residues, creating the space for oligopeptide transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref> bottom). While a comprehensive description of the dynamics and molecular intricacies of oligopeptide transport awaits further experimental investigations, our study offers a thorough analysis of the initial step orchestrated by the OBP lipoproteins in the pneumococcal Ami system. The importation of diverse oligopeptides allows pneumococcal growth despite several auxotrophies and provides crucial sensory input regarding local environment’s composition. The additional OPBs, AliC and AliD, identified in some NESp strains, might enable the sensing of a broader range of bacterial competitors present in the company of these highly commensal organisms.

In this work, all subunits forming the permease system and the five different OBPs have been predicted alone and in complexes in different conformational states. Using as templates the experimental structures of SBPs in open, unbound state or alternatively, those in closed, ligand-bound state led to matching conformations for the AF predictions, yielding models representing states for which no experimental structure was available. High pLDDT scores and favorable free energy characterized these predicted models. Furthermore, predictions corresponding to available experimental structures have been compared to assess the reliability of the method, evidencing deviations from the experimental structure below 1.1 Å <italic>rmsd</italic>. AliA, which is not available experimentally in either state, was predicted in open and closed conformations. The TMD formed by AmiC and AmiD was guided towards an outward conformation promoting the extracellular/periplasmic aperture of the channel using as a template the transmembrane domain of a maltose transporter in pre-transitional state (3PUY). The resulting models display the hydrophobic residues that are blocking the channel displaced towards the external region of the channel. The NBD formed by AmiE and AmiF was guided towards its catalytic conformation using as a template the NBD of the same experimental structure used to predict the TMD in outward facing. The prediction obtained shows AmiE and AmiF closer, being compatible with a conformation responsible for the hydrolysis of the ATP. Finally, predictions of the full permease system including as templates the previous predictions for all different subunits in their respective outward and catalytic conformation was made.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting information</label><media xlink:href="EMS192605-supplement-Supporting_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d198aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the staff of XALOC beam line at ALBA synchrotron facility (Barcelona, Spain) for support in diffraction data collection.
