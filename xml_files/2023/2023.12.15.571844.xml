NKH is an autosomal recessive condition and the majority of affected individuals carry mutations in <italic>GLDC</italic> (glycine decarboxylase). Current treatments for NKH are not effective or curative. As a monogenic condition with known genetic causation, NKH is potentially amenable to gene therapy. An AAV9-based expression vector was designed to target sites of GCS activity. Using an ubiquitous promoter to drive expression of a GFP reporter, transduction of liver and brain was confirmed following intra-venous and/or intra-cerebroventricular administration to neonatal mice. Using the same capsid and promoter with transgenes to express mouse or human GLDC, vectors were then tested in a GLDC-deficient mice that provide a model of NKH. GLDC-deficient mice exhibited elevated plasma glycine concentration and accumulation of glycine in liver and brain tissues as previously observed. Moreover, the folate profile indicated suppression of folate one carbon metabolism (FOCM) in brain tissue, as found at embryonic stages, and reduced abundance of FOCM metabolites including betaine and choline. Neonatal administration of vector achieved reinstatement of <italic>GLDC</italic> mRNA and protein expression in GLDC-deficient mice. Treated GLDC-deficient mice showed significant lowering of plasma glycine, confirming functionality of vector expressed protein. AAV9-GLDC treatment also led to lowering of brain tissue glycine, and normalisation of the folate profile indicating restoration of glycine-derived one-carbon supply. These findings support the hypothesis that AAV-mediated gene therapy may offer potential in treatment of NKH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Non-Ketotic Hyperglycinemia</kwd><kwd>glycine decarboxylase</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>glycine</kwd><kwd>folate one-carbon metabolism</kwd><kwd>inborn error of metabolism</kwd><kwd>adeno-associated virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Non-Ketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH; glycine encephalopathy) is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disease, characterised by accumulation of glycine in body fluids and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Severe NKH presents in neonates, with lethargy, respiratory problems (apnea) that may require assisted breathing, hypotonia and seizures. Myoclonic jerks and burst suppression pattern on EEG are frequently present in neonates but the type, frequency and severity of seizures change in infants, to include hypsarrhythmia, burst suppression and multifocal epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. This clinical course highlights opportunity for early therapy that could prevent secondary epilepsy-related neurological damage. Surviving infants suffer profound neurological impairment with complex epilepsy and severe psychomotor retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Around one-third of affected individuals die within the first year and the median age of death is 8 years.</p><p id="P3">NKH is caused by loss of function of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein complex that acts to decarboxylate glycine with concomitant transfer of a one-carbon group to tetrahydrofolate (THF) in folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The GCS has four protein components, of which glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) and aminomethyltransferase (AMT) are thought to be GCS-specific, whereas GCS H protein (GSCH) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) have additional roles in other enzyme complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Approximately 80% of individuals with NKH carry mutations in <italic>GLDC</italic>, with the majority of the other cases being attributable to mutations in <italic>AMT</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and a small number to <italic>GCSH</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In a subset of cases, described as ‘variant NKH’ mutations in GCS-encoding genes are not detected and, in some individuals, mutations have been identified in the enzyme pathway responsible for synthesis of the lipoate co-factor, which is responsible for lipoylation of GCSH and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P4">In addition to severe NKH that presents in neonates or infants, it has become evident that a wider spectrum of disease is associated with GCS mutations. Attenuated NKH appears to result from <italic>GLDC</italic> or <italic>AMT</italic> mutations that result in partial loss of protein function, with heterogeneity in age of onset and a less severe neurological outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], but still a debilitating disease. Identification of <italic>GLDC</italic> mutations in children or adults with mental retardation and behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], further suggests that mild or late-onset NKH may go unrecognised in some individuals.</p><p id="P5">Current treatment for NKH is largely focussed on control of glycine and amelioration of the predicted epileptogenic effects of glycine. Administration of sodium benzoate can lower glycine levels via stimulation of the glycine conjugation pathway in liver and kidneys, resulting in the production of benzoylglycine (hippurate) that is excreted in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In addition, multiple anti-epileptics and the NMDA-receptor antagonist dextromethorphan are frequently used in order to mitigate the effects of excess glycine in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. These treatments are not curative, and do not appreciably improve neurodevelopment, while benzoate treatment has associated side-effects and requires co-administration of antacids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P6">While current treatments for NKH are not effective, the continuum of clinical severity from neonatal onset, severe NKH to milder and later-onset forms suggests that therapies which reinstate GCS function may have a beneficial effect. Unlike current treatments, restoration of GCS function would achieve both lowering of glycine and supply of glycine-derived one-carbon groups to FOCM. Gene therapy vectors provide potential to deliver a <italic>GLDC</italic> transgene to endogenous sites of expression in the liver and brain, and this approach would potentially be applicable to any loss of function mutation in <italic>GLDC.</italic></p><p id="P7">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) based vectors are based on the AAV genome with replacement of the <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>cap</italic> genes by the therapeutic transgene and promoter. AAV vectors enter the target cell nucleus and exist primarily in episomal form with rare integration into the host chromosomes. Hence, long-term expression of transgenes may be achieved in non-dividing cells, such as neurons, although the vector may be ‘diluted’ in tissues undergoing cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The cell-type specificity (tropism) of AAV is determined by the capsid serotype. AAV9 has been found to be effective in crossing the blood brain barrier and can transduce neurons and non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. AAV9-based vectors have been used effectively in mouse models of several monogenic diseases including Krabbe disease, Niemann Pick type C and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Successful testing of AAV9 vectors in animal models led to their implementation for clinical applications, for example, in treatment of spinal muscular atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P8">As a model for testing potential novel treatments, mice that are homozygous for a gene-trap allele of <italic>Gldc</italic> (<italic>Gldc<sup>GT1</sup></italic>) provide a GLDC-deficient model for NKH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice exhibit 90% reduction in <italic>Gldc</italic> mRNA abundance, undetectable GCS activity and hallmark features of NKH, including elevated glycine concentrations in blood, urine and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. In addition to glycine, GLDC-deficient mice display tissue-dependent accumulation of multiple glycine derivatives including acylglycines and guanidinoacetate, which is reversible by liver-specific rescue of <italic>Gldc</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In accordance with predicted effects of GCS loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], GLDC-deficient mice exhibit suppression of FOCM, with accumulation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) at the expense of folates that carry one-carbon groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].

As plasma glycine is regulated by liver GCS activity, this provides a measure of GLDC functionality. The treatment effect was observed in the overall cohort of mice and within male and female sub-groups. We conclude that vector expressed GLDC protein is functional and restores GCS activity.</p><p id="P28">As expected, we did not observe an effect on plasma glycine among mice in which <italic>Gldc</italic> expression was restored in brain but not liver, following vector administration by ic route only. However, we tested whether vector mediated GLDC expression in the brain was sufficient to lower tissue glycine content in <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice. We observed a significant reduction in brain tissue glycine content among mice 6 weeks after neonatal treatment with AAV9-CBh-mGLDC by iv + ic or by ic route only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). It therefore appears that excess glycine in brain tissue can be removed by GCS activity within the brain, even when plasma glycine is not fully normalised.</p><p id="P29">In parallel with evaluating glycine control, we tested whether treatment affected the supply of one-carbon units into FOCM. As reported at embryonic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], we found that the folate profile is abnormal in <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> brain tissue, with an increase in relative abundance of THF and decrease in abundance of 5-methyl THF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Following treatment with AAV9-CBh-mGLDC at P1, the folate profile in brain tissue of <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice at 6 weeks was normalised, with the relative proportions of THF and 5-methyl THF showing no difference to wild-type tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). As a further read-out of FOCM function in brain tissue we analysed abundance of betaine and choline. Choline is the precursor of betaine, which in turn can act as a methyl donor in the remethylation of homocysteine. We found that both metabolites are present at significantly lower levels in the brain of <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Concomitant with normalisation of the folate profile we observed restoration of betaine and choline abundance following AAV-mediated restoration of <italic>Gldc</italic> expression by neonatal iv + ic or ic routes of administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3.4</label><title>AAV-mediated expression of functional human GLDC in mouse</title><p id="P30">Implementation of an AAV-based gene therapy for NKH will require a vector that leads to expression of the human GLDC protein. The GLDC protein in mouse (Uniprot Q91W43) and human (Uniprot P23378) comprise 1025 and 1020 amino acids respectively, with 92% identity. We hypothesised that the human protein would substitute for mouse GLDC in the GCS. Therefore, in order to test vectors expressing human GLDC we replaced the mouse <italic>Gldc</italic> coding sequence with a transgene sequence encoding the consensus human GLDC protein and packaged this into AAV9 capsid. The AAV9-CBh-hGLDC vector was administered to neonatal <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice and tissues were collected for analysis at 6 weeks of age. Expression of <italic>GLDC</italic> was confirmed in liver and brain by qRT-PCR. GLDC protein expression was assessed by immunoblot and as expected, endogenous mouse GLDC was detected in wild-type liver and brain but not in <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). In contrast, in samples from <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice that received neonatal treatment with AAV9-CBh-hGLDC, a GLDC band was present corresponding to vector-expressed GLDC. GLDC abundance in liver appeared to be lower than endogenous protein in liver but of greater abundance than endogenous protein in brain.</p><p id="P31">We further examined expression of human GLDC in the brain of treated <italic>Gldc</italic>-deficient mice by immunostaining of sagittal sections. Unlike in untreated <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), GLDC staining was detected and appeared widespread in brain of AAV9-CBh-hGLDC treated <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D-I</xref>), with intensity comparable to that of endogenous GLDC in untreated wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D-F</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Having confirmed that human GLDC is expressed in mice following AAV-vector administration we tested whether the human protein is functional in the context of the mouse GCS by analysis of plasma and brain tissue glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We observed significant lowering of plasma glycine at 6 weeks of age in vector-treated mice compared with untreated <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the brain of treated <italic>Gldc<sup>GT1/GT1</sup></italic> the tissue glycine content was also significantly lowered compared to untreated <italic>Gldc</italic>-deficient mice, to a level that was comparable to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Hence, vector expressed human GLDC is functional in the mouse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">The GCS has two key functions, regulation of glycine concentration in tissues and supply of glycine-derived one carbon units to FOCM and downstream biochemical pathways. Disruption of each of these functions is thought to contribute to pathogenesis of NKH. As in humans, GCS disruption in mice leads to accumulation of glycine, and a series of glycine derivatives which may themselves be deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In parallel, impaired supply of one-carbon units leads to altered folate profile which we previously observed at embryonic stages and here confirmed in post-natal tissue. In addition to a shift in the folate profile, we found a reduced abundance of betaine and choline in the brain of <italic>Gldc</italic>-deficient mice which we hypothesise to reflect an increased requirement for betaine as a methyl donor owing to impaired supply of glycine-derived one-carbon groups via the GCS.</p><p id="P34">In the <italic>Gldc</italic>-deficient mouse model of NKH, treatment with benzoate or cinnamate is sufficient to lower circulating glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], recapitulating the effect of benzoate in NKH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, this does not overcome suppression of FOCM and, as a therapeutic intervention in NKH, benzoate is associated with significant side effects including gastrointestinal irritation. Conversely, maternal supplementation of GLDC-deficient mice with formate, as a one-carbon donor, prevents the embryonic structural malformations that lead to neural tube defects and ventriculomegaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], but does not lower excess glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P35">The ability to reinstate GCS function through vector-mediated expression of a functional copy of the mutated protein in NKH (GLDC or AMT) would provide an opportunity to restore both glycine regulation and one-carbon metabolism. In the current study we tested this concept in the GLDC-deficient mouse model, and found that AAV-mediated expression of GLDC resulted in both lowering of plasma and tissue glycine, and normalisation of FOCM intermediates. Lowering of plasma glycine was achieved following iv administration of vector, with a lesser effect following ic administration, suggesting that this effect largely reflects GLDC expression in the liver, the major site of GCS activity. However, within the brain the tissue glycine content was normalised by ic (or ic + iv) treatment indicating that GCS activity within the brain may be sufficient to regulate glycine within this tissue (even if not normalised systemically). Similarly, FOCM-related metabolites were restored by vector administration to the brain. This treatment led to widespread expression of GFP reporter or GLDC, including sites of endogenous expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum.</p><p id="P36">Expression of GLDC and normalisation of metabolite biomarkers in the brain was observed in young adult mice after neonatal administration, suggesting the potential for long-term benefit which will be evaluated in future studies. It was predicted that, as a predominantly non-integrating vector, the AAV vector may become ‘diluted’ relative to the total size of the liver owing to continuing cellular proliferation after neonatal administration of vector. However, significant lowering of plasma glycine, which reflects liver GCS activity, was still observed in young adults. Further studies will assess whether this effect persists longer-term. As a step towards long-term studies we found that neonatal administration of vector did not adversely affect survival or weight in wild-type mice maintained for up to 13 months.</p><p id="P37">Given that glycine conjugation and glycine cleavage are mediated by two separate enzyme systems, it is reasonable to predict that combined use of benzoate or cinnamate (to stimulate glycine conjugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]), with administration of a GLDC-expressing AAV vector (to reinstate GCS activity), could offer potential both for lowering plasma glycine and control of glycine, with restoration of FOCM within the brain, or other target tissues.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by LifeArc, Joseph’s Goal and Action Medical Research (grant number GN2403).
