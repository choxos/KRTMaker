Despite its known pathological consequences in specific rare diseases, we have a limited understanding of its wider prevalence and mechanisms in humans. To address this, we analyzed gene misexpression in 4,568 whole blood bulk RNA sequencing samples from INTERVAL study blood donors. We found that while individual misexpression events occur rarely, in aggregate they were found in almost all samples and over half of inactive genes. Using 2,821 paired whole genome and RNA sequencing samples, we identified that misexpression events are enriched in <italic>cis</italic> for rare structural variants. We established putative mechanisms through which a subset of SVs lead to gene misexpression, including transcriptional readthrough, transcript fusions and gene inversion. Overall, we develop misexpression as a novel type of transcriptomic outlier analysis and extend our understanding of the variety of mechanisms by which genetic variants can influence gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression is essential for the functioning of multicellular eukaryotes. Gene regulation involves the context-specific activation and maintenance of transcription, as well as gene silencing to avoid aberrant transcription interfering with normal cellular function. The aberrant transcription of a gene in a context where it is usually inactive is termed gene misexpression (also referred to as ectopic expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Gene misexpression can occur either via the transcription of a single inactive gene or production of a novel transcript derived in part from an inactive gene. We refer to these different types of events as non-chimeric and chimeric misexpression, respectively.</p><p id="P3">Gene misexpression can have profound phenotypic consequences, as evidenced by the development of ectopic eyes across different tissues in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> upon targeted misexpression of the <italic>eyeless</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In humans, gene misexpression has been implicated in cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and several rare diseases, for example, congenital limb malformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, congenital hyperinsulinism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and monogenic severe childhood obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These studies have identified gain-of-function genetic variants that lead to both chimeric and non-chimeric gene misexpression. For example, chimeric misexpression can be caused by transcript fusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and non-chimeric misexpression via rearrangements in 3D chromatin architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> or loss of silencer function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, these studies have predominantly focused on a limited number of disease-related loci.</p><p id="P4">Recent large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies analyzing transcriptional outliers in humans have demonstrated that outliers are enriched for rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and structural variants (SVs) in <italic>cis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and that these outlier-associated genetic variants can contribute to complex disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, these studies focused on outliers in highly expressed genes within the tissue(s) under study, overlooking misexpression of inactive genes. Consequently, the prevalence of gene misexpression in humans, the genes whose misexpression can be tolerated and their associated properties are unknown. Furthermore, the types of genetic variants associated with misexpression and their mechanisms remain underexplored.</p><p id="P5">To address these gaps in our understanding, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene misexpression using bulk RNA-seq data from 4,568 blood donors from the INTERVAL study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We assessed the prevalence of gene misexpression across genes and samples, and the characteristics of genes that tolerate misexpression. Additionally, we established the types of genetic variants associated with gene misexpression as well as their putative mechanisms of action using 2,821 paired whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq samples.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of misexpression events in whole blood</title><p id="P6">To identify misexpression events, we first defined a set of inactive genes with negligible or no detectable expression across the majority of the 4,568 whole blood RNA-seq samples from the INTERVAL study (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We restricted our analysis to 29,614 autosomal protein-coding and long non-coding RNA genes with evidence of being expressed in at least one tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. From these, we identified 8,779 inactive genes that were expressed (transcripts per million (TPM) &gt; 0.1) in less than 5% of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We confirmed that these genes were likely inactive using other whole blood RNA-seq datasets, such as GTEx, and predicted chromatin states from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). To account for non-genetic drivers of misexpression, such as sequencing depth or variation in cell proportions, we removed 129 (1.5%) genes that were significantly correlated (|Spearman’s rho| &gt; 0.2, FDR-adjusted p &lt; 0.05) with any of 225 technical and cellular covariates. We transformed expression values into z-scores and identified 28,956 misexpression events (z-score &gt; 2 and TPM &gt; 0.5). Across all inactive gene-sample pairs, the proportion of misexpression events was low (0.07%, 28,956/39,513,200) with the number of events decreasing substantially at higher z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While individual misexpression events occurred rarely, in aggregate they were found in 51% of inactive genes (4,437/8,650) and in 96% of samples (4,386/4,568) with a median of 4 events per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Misexpressed genes are shorter, depleted of developmental genes and less tightly regulated</title><p id="P7">Next, we investigated the properties that differ between genes with and without misexpression events. We tested for enrichment of 81 gene-level features in genes that were misexpressed at least once (“misexpressed genes”) versus genes with no observed misexpression events (“non-misexpressed genes”) across different misexpression z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Overall, misexpressed genes were shorter, less constrained according to both mutational (gnomAD LOEUF and missense OEUF) and non-mutational (Enhancer Domain Score and Episcore) metrics and were less likely to be implicated in developmental diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These genes also had fewer predicted enhancer interactions based on both proximity- and activity-linking approaches from Wang &amp; Goldstein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that they are under weaker regulatory control. Misexpressed genes were less likely to be expressed in brain, pituitary and heart tissues, and generally were expressed across fewer GTEx tissues (n = 52). Additionally, they were underrepresented for Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms relating to phenotypic abnormalities of the nervous and musculoskeletal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). This is of interest as congenital limb malformations are known to be caused by gene misexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results suggest that natural selection has acted to prevent the misexpression of genes important in developmental processes. Importantly, these results also demonstrate that our method for identifying gene misexpression is valid, as we would expect misexpression of inactive developmental genes to be deleterious, and therefore, underenriched in a generally healthy population cohort.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Rare structural variants are associated with gene misexpression</title><p id="P8">To assess the influence of genetic variation on gene misexpression in <italic>cis</italic> we conducted genetic variant enrichment analyses. Our analysis focused on 2,821 participants with both WGS and RNA-seq data in the INTERVAL study (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). In total, we conducted 700 enrichment tests, determining significance using a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold (p &lt; 0.05). Firstly, we tested whether rare (MAF &lt; 1%), low-frequency (1% ≤ MAF &lt; 5%) or common (5% ≤ MAF &lt; 50%) SNVs, indels (≤ 50 bp) or SVs (&gt; 50 bp) were enriched within the gene body and flanking sequence of genes involved in misexpression events (±10 kb for SNVs and indels, ±200 kb for SVs, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Across all tested z-score thresholds, we observed a significant enrichment of rare SVs around gene misexpression events, whereas no significant enrichment was observed for low frequency or common SVs at any z-score threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The enrichment for rare SVs increased dramatically at increasing z-score thresholds, with 4.7% (38/803) of extreme misexpression events (z-score &gt; 40) having a nearby rare SV compared to 1.3% (229/17,380) of less extreme events (z-score &gt; 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Notably, we did not find a significant enrichment for SNVs or indels at any MAF or z-score threshold (maximum enrichment SNVs = 1.04 and indels = 1.15) and even observed a significant weak underenrichment in some cases.</p><p id="P9">We examined whether the observed rare SV enrichment could be due to a small number of SVs leading to the misexpression of many genes. However, out of the 312 SVs within 200kb of a misexpression event, 95% (297) were linked to only one gene and the remainder to a maximum of two genes. We also assessed whether the observed rare SV enrichment could be due to a small number of participants with a high number of SVs and misexpression events. Similarly, of the 206 participants containing misexpression events with a nearby SV, 89% (183) had only one misexpression event with an SV in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><p id="P10">To investigate the influence of genetic variation on gene misexpression over longer distances, we tested rare variant enrichment at increasing distances from genes. For each gene, we assigned each rare SNV, indel and SV to a unique genomic window up to 1 Mb upstream or downstream and tested variant enrichment for each window independently (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Across all z-score thresholds, enrichment was highest for rare SVs within the gene body and decreased at greater distances from the misexpressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), remaining significant up to 200 kb upstream. Interestingly, rare SV enrichment was not symmetrical around misexpressed genes with greater enrichment upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) compared to downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS). Similarly to the gene-level analysis, we found that rare SNVs were not significantly enriched across any window or expression threshold, and again observed significant weak underenrichment in some genomic windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). While indels did show a significant enrichment in some windows, the level of enrichment was much lower than SVs (maximum significant enrichment = 1.11) and was not consistently observed across all z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Rare deletions, duplications and inversions are associated with gene misexpression</title><p id="P11">We hypothesized that misexpression events are associated with a specific type of structural variation and therefore conducted enrichment tests for the four different SV classes available: deletions (DEL), duplications (DUP), inversions (INV) and mobile element insertions (MEI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Across all z-score thresholds, rare deletions and duplications were significantly enriched within a 200 kb window around misexpressed genes with duplications consistently showing the highest enrichment. However, at this sample size and genomic window size, rare inversions and mobile element insertions were not significantly enriched.</p><p id="P12">Next, we tested whether different SV classes showed distinct patterns of enrichment at increasing distances from misexpressed genes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Rare duplications and inversions were significantly enriched only within the gene body of the misexpressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). For duplications, all tested z-score thresholds were significant, while for inversions this enrichment was significant only up to a z-score threshold of 10, likely due to the low number of inversion calls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Rare deletions were significantly enriched in the window 200 kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) across all z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Rare deletions were also enriched within the gene body of the misexpressed gene but this was only significant at higher z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Rare mobile element insertions were not significantly enriched within any tested window at any z-score threshold. No significant enrichment was observed at greater distances for any SV class.</p><p id="P13">We annotated each rare SV by its predicted consequence on the inactive genes in the tested window using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. For each SV class, we then tested for enrichment of predicted consequences ±200 kb around misexpressed genes relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We found that inversions affecting coding regions had the highest enrichment of any variant consequence; however, this was only significant up to a z-score threshold of 20, again likely due to the low number of inversion calls. Deletions upstream and with no predicted effect on the tested gene were significantly enriched as were deletions affecting non-coding transcripts at higher z-score thresholds. Additionally, duplications leading to transcript amplification and affecting coding regions as well as non-coding transcripts were significantly enriched. These results support the enrichment observed for SVs classes within specific genomic windows.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Properties and regulatory features of misexpression-associated structural variants</title><p id="P14">To understand the general properties of misexpression-associated rare SVs, we compared a set of 105 misexpression-associated and 20,150 control SVs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Of these 105 SVs, 87 were deletions, 16 were duplications and 2 were inversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). All the duplications were confirmed to be tandem duplications (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Notably, for 60% and 28% of deletions and duplications VEP did not predict an effect on the misexpressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While the majority (72%) of duplications overlapped the misexpressed gene either entirely or partially, this was not the case for deletions (8% overlapping) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the properties of deletions and duplications separately, excluding inversions due to their low numbers.</p><p id="P15">First, we found that misexpression-associated deletions and duplications were on average 2.5- and 3.4-times longer, respectively, than control variants (p = 6.03×10<sup>-7</sup> and p = 3.9×10<sup>-6</sup>, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Since MAF and SV length are inversely correlated, we also compared the lengths of singletons and found that misexpression-associated deletions and duplications remained on average 2.8- and 2.0-times longer, respectively (p = 2.3×10<sup>-4</sup> and p = 2.2×10<sup>-3</sup>, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). To avoid the correlation between length and other genomic features driving enrichment, we included length as a covariate in subsequent enrichment analyses.</p><p id="P16">To investigate the importance of regions overlapping misexpression-associated SVs versus controls, we tested for enrichment of five different genomic scores spanning evolutionary conservation, constraint and deleteriousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).

We found that misexpression events occur in the majority of samples and in over half of inactive genes. By integrating WGS and RNA-seq data, we assessed the influence of genetic variation on gene misexpression, demonstrating that these events are enriched for rare SVs in <italic>cis</italic>. We also show that a subset SVs lead to misexpression via specific mechanisms including transcriptional readthrough, transcript fusion and inverting gene orientation. These findings extend our understanding of gene misexpression and its genetic mechanisms beyond the limited number of samples and disease-relevant loci where misexpression had previously been described.</p><p id="P27">Large-scale RNA-seq studies have found that different categories of transcriptional outliers are enriched for distinct types of genetic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We found that this was also the case for misexpression events, which were strongly enriched for rare SVs. Compared to SV enrichment in other outlier types measured across multiple tissues, this rare SV enrichment occurred at shorter distances from the TSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Although rare disease studies have demonstrated that SNVs and indels can lead to gene misexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we did not observe a consistent significant enrichment for these types of genetic variation in this large predominantly healthy cohort.

Unlike in previous studies focusing on SVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, we identified multiple regulatory features that were enriched in misexpression-associated SVs and used these features to identify specific misexpression mechanisms.</p><p id="P28">Previous studies of rare diseases have observed that non-chimeric misexpression, where an individual inactive gene is aberrantly transcribed, can result from rearrangements in 3D chromatin architecture resulting in changes in enhancer-promoter interactions (enhancer adoption)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, in our cohort, we were unable to identify such events with confidence. This might indicate that these events are exceedingly rare in healthy human populations. Alternatively, our approach may fail to identify these events due to a lack of high-resolution, context-specific Hi-C data. However, parallels can be drawn between the SV mechanisms resulting in chimeric misexpression we have observed here and those involving rearrangements in 3D chromatin architecture. While SVs leading to chimeric misexpression via transcript fusion or transcriptional readthrough place an inactive gene under the control of a different active promoter, SVs resulting in enhancer adoption place an inactive promoter under the control of active enhancers. Therefore, a consistent theme across different SV misexpression mechanisms is changes to the regulatory environment of an inactive gene through alterations to either its promoter or enhancers.</p><p id="P29">It is important to highlight the limitations of this study. Firstly, we have only analyzed gene misexpression within whole blood and further studies should examine the prevalence of misexpression across different tissues and cell types as well as in disease. Indeed, a link between misexpression and disease is more likely to be detected in the relevant disease tissue rather than in whole blood. Secondly, we have focused on high confidence events by using a stringent expression threshold. This threshold is arbitrary and the level of misexpression required to influence cellular processes is likely to vary across genes and contexts. Thirdly, due to the technical difficulties of calling SVs in short-read genome sequencing, we may be unable to detect some SVs that lead to misexpression and therefore the proportion of misexpression events associated with an SV is likely underestimated. Some of the misexpression events not associated with SVs may be due to non-genetic mechanisms such as leaky transcription, chromatin plasticity or specific environmental cues. Finally, when interpreting the consequences of rare SVs we have focused on mechanisms that are shared by multiple variants or events with multiple variant carriers. Therefore, we are biased towards detecting more common misexpression mechanisms and may miss additional mechanisms caused by ultra-rare SVs.</p><p id="P30">Interpreting the functional effects of rare genetic variation remains challenging and is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which variants influence human traits. Here, we have extended our understanding of how genetic variants influence gene expression. The fact that rare SVs can induce misexpression not just in the rare disease context should be taken into account in future studies when cataloging and interpreting their effects in population cohorts. This is especially important for SVs associated with human complex diseases, as it is currently unknown what fraction of these SVs may mediate their phenotypic effects by causing gene misexpression.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>The INTERVAL Study</title><p id="P31">The INTERVAL study is a prospective cohort study of approximately 50,000 participants nested within a randomized trial of varying blood donation intervals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

The control group was defined as all expression events below these thresholds restricted to the genes within the misexpression group. Therefore, for each misexpression threshold the misexpression and control group gene sets were identical. This ensured that enrichment calculations reflected differences in genetic effects rather than differences in mutation background distributions between non-identical gene sets. Risk ratios were calculated as the proportion of expression events in the misexpression group with a given variant type within the tested genomic region and MAF range over the proportion of events in the control group. For SV enrichment tests we counted variants overlapping a ±200 kb window around the gene body while for SNVs and indels a ±10 kb window was used. P-values were calculated using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a normal approximation. We tested four non-overlapping MAF thresholds: rare (0-1% MAF), low-frequency (1-5% MAF) and common variants (5-10% and 10-50% MAF).</p><p id="P49">To test the enrichment of variants at different genomic distances from genes involved in misexpression events, we assigned variants to a genomic window for each gene. Variants were assigned to 200 kb windows up to 1 Mb upstream and downstream from the gene start and end, respectively, or when overlapping the gene itself to the gene body window. In cases where a variant spanned multiple windows, the variant was placed in the window closest to the gene with variants overlapping any part of the gene assigned to the gene body window. This resulted in all gene-variants pairs being uniquely assigned to a single window. Enrichment testing was then conducted for each genomic window separately.</p><p id="P50">To investigate variant consequences, SVs were annotated with the most severe VEP consequence on the gene in the test window (VEP v97.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Variants with no predicted consequence on the gene were annotated according to the most severe consequence if the annotation was regulatory or intergenic (TFBS ablation, TF_binding_site_variant, regulatory_region_variant, TFBS_amplification, intergenic_variant, regulatory_region_ablation, regulatory_region_amplification). If the variant had no predicted consequence on the gene and its most severe consequence was not regulatory or intergenic then it was annotated as having no predicted effect. Enrichment calculations were performed for each variant consequence that had at least one carrier within the tested window. For SVs a ±200 kb window around the gene body was used.</p><p id="P51">Overall, we performed 700 genetic variant enrichment tests.

For each gene-SV pair, we calculated the median TPM and z-score across all carriers. We defined misexpression-associated SVs as SVs with a nearby gene that had a median TPM &gt; 0.5 and median z-score &gt; 2. We additionally excluded gene-SV pairs where any carrier had a TPM &lt; 0.1, resulting in 105 misexpression-associated SVs. These criteria allow for variable levels of gene expression around the misexpression threshold while removing likely non-causal variants.
