Due to the limitations and severe side effects of currently available opioid drugs, there is considerable interest in developing novel modulators of μOR function. Most GPCR ligands today are small molecules, however biologics, including antibodies and nanobodies, are emerging as alternative therapeutics with clear advantages such as affinity and target selectivity. Here, we describe the nanobody NbE, which selectively binds to the μOR and acts as an antagonist. We functionally characterize NbE as an extracellular and genetically encoded μOR ligand and uncover the molecular basis for μOR antagonism by solving the cryo-EM structure of the NbE-μOR complex. NbE displays a unique ligand binding mode and achieves μOR selectivity by interactions with the orthosteric pocket and extracellular receptor loops. Based on a β-hairpin loop formed by NbE that deeply inserts into the μOR and centers most binding contacts, we design short peptide analogues that retain μOR antagonism. The work illustrates the potential of nanobodies to uniquely engage with GPCRs and describes novel μOR ligands that can serve as a basis for therapeutic developments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent key therapeutic targets due to their central roles in cellular signaling and control over a plethora of physiological processes. Developing new ligands that bind a given GPCR with high selectivity remains a significant challenge in drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Small molecule ligands have historically dominated the landscape of GPCR-targeted drugs but recently biologics, including antibodies and nanobodies (Nbs), have emerged as an alternative class of ligands that offer distinct advantages and hold promise for therapeutic developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Nbs are single domain antibody fragments derived from heavy chain-only antibodies, which naturally occur in camelids and cartilaginous fish, and are characterized by a small size, strong antigen-binding affinity, and binding loops that can access deep cavities on target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Nbs can show enhanced selectivity over small molecules due to their ability to interact with unique and extended epitope surfaces. Over the last decade, Nbs that bind GPCRs on their intracellular side have served as innovative research tools to uncover GPCR signal transduction mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). For example, Nbs were used as crystallization chaperones or as fiducial markers in high resolution structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Conformation-selective Nbs were also repurposed into biosensors to report GPCR activity in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Contrastingly, only a few Nbs that bind GPCRs as extracellular ligands and thereby modulate receptor function have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Generating knowledge on GPCR-targeting Nbs is key to unlocking their potential as both versatile research tools and therapeutic compounds.</p><p id="P4">Opioid receptors (ORs) are prototypical members of the rhodopsin-like GPCR family and function in pain modulation and analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The OR family comprises four major receptor subtypes, including the μOR, δOR, κOR, and nociceptin-OR (NOPR), with the μOR representing the prime therapeutic target for pain relief. Approved drugs that target μORs are diverse small molecule compounds, including the widely used analgesics morphine and fentanyl. The ligand repertoire has recently been expanded through structure-based molecular docking, rational design, and high-throughput screening, delivering new OR ligands with distinct pharmacological profiles, including biased agonism, receptor subtype selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Discovering additional and innovative modulators of μOR function, including agonists and antagonists, remains a pressing necessity for developing improved analgesics and compounds that can reduce or reverse the deleterious opioid side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Until now, no antibody or Nb ligand for ORs has been characterized in-depth, representing a hurdle in exploiting the unique features of biologics to effectively target ORs.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we functionally and structurally analyze NbE, an extracellular μOR-targeting Nb ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Using cellular binding and signaling assays, we identify that NbE selectively binds to μOR with nanomolar affinity and acts as an antagonist when added as ligand or expressed as a genetically-encoded cell surface displayed protein. We then solve the cryo-EM structure of the NbE-μOR complex, which reveals that NbE deeply inserts into the orthosteric pocket and additionally interacts with two extracellular loops (ECL) of the μOR. We find that the ECL interactions significantly contribute to NbE binding and OR subtype selectivity. Based on NbE’s complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3), which inserts as a β-hairpin loop into the orthosteric pocket, we synthesize peptide Nb mimetics of different lengths that retain binding and μOR-selective antagonism. The work uncovers a novel and unique ligand engagement profile at the μOR and provides a strategy for developing biologics-based μOR ligands.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NbE binds the extracellular side of μOR and is an antagonist</title><p id="P6">We first tested whether NbE, which was part of a Nb library previously generated against the μOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), binds to the extracellular side of μOR in the surface of living cells. We covalently conjugated purified NbE with Alexa Fluor 488 and incubated OR-expressing HEK293 cells with the fluorescently labeled NbE. Confocal microscopy analyses showed a pronounced NbE signal at the plasma membrane of μOR-expressing cells after incubation with NbE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Cells expressing the closely related δOR, κOR, or NOPR were not labeled by NbE. Selective binding of NbE to μOR-expressing cells was also detected by flow cytometry analyses after adding NbE at increasing concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). δOR-, κOR-, or NOPR-expressing cells gated for similar receptor surface levels did not exhibit NbE binding above control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Since the NbE staining intensity of μOR expressing cells did not plateau at the highest NbE concentration tested (10 μM), we turned to grating-coupled interferometry (GCI) to determine the NbE binding strength. We immobilized biotinylated AVI-tagged NbE on a streptavidin coated biosensor surface and perfused it with buffer containing purified μOR at different concentrations. From the binding curves we extracted the affinity of the NbE-μOR interaction (K<sub>D</sub>=56 nM) and the kinetic parameters (k<sub>a</sub>=2.8*10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and k<sub>d</sub>=1.6*10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), which revealed a slow NbE off-rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we investigated if NbE binds competitively with orthosteric μOR ligands. We incubated μOR-expressing HEK293 cells with increasing concentrations of naloxone, subsequently added fluorescent NbE, and quantified the NbE signal by flow cytometry. NbE binding decreased in a naloxone concentration-dependent manner and was entirely abolished at high naloxone concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The data suggested that the NbE binding site on the μOR overlaps with the orthosteric ligand binding pocket, and thus we tested if NbE modulates μOR activity. We first assessed whether NbE behaves as an agonist by measuring μOR-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in living cells, a readout of Gi-driven OR signaling. Application of NbE did not activate μOR even at high concentrations, in contrast to the peptide agonist DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We then tested whether NbE acts as a μOR antagonist and reduces the signaling effects of opioid peptides and small molecule opioid drugs. Indeed, pre-incubation of μOR-expressing cells with NbE caused a concentration-dependent decrease in DAMGO- and morphine-induced Gi signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). At high concentrations, NbE fully blocked DAMGO and morphine-driven μOR inhibition of cAMP production. Furthermore, NbE addition strongly reduced the recruitment of a G protein probe (miniGi) and β-arrestin2 to DAMGO-activated μOR, as measured by split nanoluciferase (NanoLuc)-based complementation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We hypothesized that NbE may also antagonize μOR function when ectopically expressed in cells and targeted to the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycolipid anchor. To test this, we fused NbE to a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) signal peptide, separated by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We also added a secretory signal peptide at the N-terminus, followed by an HA-tag or a fluorescent protein to enable determining the subcellular localization of the NbE fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Confocal microscopy analyses of NbE-GPI-expressing cells showed that NbE predominantly localized at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Immunostaining of cells expressing HA-NbE-GPI with HA antibodies in non-permeabilizing conditions revealed that NbE was efficiently displayed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig S1c</xref>). We also constructed a bivalent tandem NbE-NbE-GPI construct as well as a non-targeting Nb-GPI control (Nb-ctr), and both showed similar predominant cell surface localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig S1d</xref>). μOR-expressing HEK293 cells transfected with monovalent or bivalent NbE-GPI constructs showed significantly higher cAMP levels after DAMGO treatment relative to cells expressing the Nb-GPI control, indicating a NbE-mediated block of μOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Taken together, NbE specifically binds to the extracellular side of the μOR and competes with orthosteric opioid ligands. Furthermore, NbE acts as an antagonist when added to cells as an extracellular ligand or when ectopically expressed as GPI-anchored fusion protein.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cryo-EM structure determination of the NbE-μOR complex</title><p id="P10">Advancement of structural biology techniques have led to the determination of several μOR structures in complex with either antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), partial agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), or full agonists, including the endogenous peptides β-endorphin and endomorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). All ligands bind to the orthosteric ligand binding pocket that is on the extracellular side and largely solvent exposed. To identify the precise molecular binding mode of NbE, we determined the structure of the NbE-μOR complex using cryo-EM. Initial structure determination was precluded due to the absence of large extracellular features of the complex. The surrounding detergent micelle additionally impaired accurate particle projection alignments, resulting in unsuccessful 3D reconstruction. To provide extra features for accurate particle alignment, we incubated the purified NbE-μOR complex with a Fab module consisting of a Nb-binding Fab fragment (NabFab) and an anti-Fab Nb, recently developed as a fiducial marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The resulting stable and homogenous NbE-μOR-Fab module complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2a,b</xref>). Cryo-EM analyses enabled us to determine the structure of the NbE-μOR-Fab module complex at a global resolution of 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2c-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>, Table 1). The EM-derived Coulomb potential map provided excellent side chain densities for most parts of the complex with the best resolved region at the NbE-μOR interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2d,f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The overall structure of the NbE-μOR complex bound to the Fab module is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a.</xref> The Fab fragment binds in a single and rigid conformation to NbE, enabling high-resolution structure determination of the NbE-μOR complex. For reasons of clarity, the Fab module is omitted in all subsequent figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and Suppl. Video 1). When bound to NbE, the μOR adopts an inactive conformation, which closely resembles the structures of the µOR bound to the morphinan antagonist β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) or alvimopan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The average root mean square deviation (RMSD) for all C<sub>α</sub> atoms of µOR between the NbE-µOR complex and the μOR complexes bound to antagonists is 0.78 Å, whereas the RMSD between NbE-µOR and agonist-bound structures is on average 1.72 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>). In particular, transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), which is displaced by roughly 10 Å in the activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), superimposes well between the NbE-µOR and the β-FNA- or alvimopan-bound inactive µOR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4a,c</xref>). Moreover, a conserved core triad consisting of the amino acids I155<sup>3.40</sup>, P244<sup>5.50</sup>, and F289<sup>6.44</sup> (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)), which lies below the ligand binding pocket and propagates structural rearrangements involved in receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), superimposes well with the µOR in the inactive form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4b,d</xref>). Structural differences in the ligand binding pocket between agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists are relatively subtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), however, binding of NbE to the μOR induces several unique conformational changes in the orthosteric binding pocket and the extracellular loops.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Unique interaction profile of NbE with the inactive μOR</title><p id="P12">Binding of NbE to the μOR is mediated through its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) CDR1 and CDR3, with the main interaction interface being formed between the β-hairpin loop of CDR3 and µOR’s TM helices 3, 5, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 3</xref>). CDR3 deeply inserts into the orthosteric ligand binding pocket with the three aromatic residues Y106<sup>NbE</sup>, F107<sup>NbE</sup> and Y108<sup>NbE</sup> forming the tip of the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,e</xref>, Suppl. Video 1).</p><p id="P13">Similar to previously determined µOR structures bound to the ligands DAMGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), BU72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), β-FNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), alvimopan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), PZM21, and FH210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), as well as β-endorphin and endomorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), H297<sup>6.52</sup> is positioned closely to a phenol hydroxyl group of the NbE ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). While binding of BU72 and β-FNA is mediated through a hydrogen bond network that involves two water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), in the NbE-µOR complex, H297<sup>6.52</sup> and Y106<sup>NbE</sup> are directly forming a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, Y106<sup>NbE</sup> is surrounded by mainly hydrophobic residues, including Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, M151<sup>3.36</sup>, V236<sup>5.42</sup>, F237<sup>5.43</sup>, I296<sup>6.51</sup>, and V300<sup>6.55</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). F107<sup>NbE</sup>, the second tip-forming aromatic residue, inserts itself into a neighboring hydrophobic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,e</xref>) and interacts with the key residues I143<sup>3.30</sup>, Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, M151<sup>3.36</sup>, W293<sup>6.48</sup>, I322<sup>7.39</sup> and Y326<sup>7.43</sup> of µOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, the aspartate D147<sup>3.32</sup>, present in many family A GPCRs, and crucial for the recognition of DAMGO, β-FNA, BU72, PZM21, and endogenous peptides by forming a salt bridge with an amine group of the ligand, is rotated compared to all other µOR structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4e</xref>). Instead of forming a salt bridge with the ligand, in this conformation D147<sup>3.32</sup> stacks onto F107<sup>NbE</sup>, representing a novel ligand-receptor interaction mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4e</xref>). The third aromatic residue Y108<sup>NbE</sup> is situated at the periphery of the orthosteric binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The aromatic ring of the phenol group stacks against L219<sup>ECL2</sup>, part of ECL2, whereas the hydroxyl group forms a salt bridge with K233<sup>5.39</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). K233<sup>5.39</sup> had previously been identified as the side chain to which the morphinan ligand β-FNA is covalently attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Another notable difference in the ligand binding pocket involves W318<sup>7.35</sup> that is uniquely positioned likely due to steric constraints when inserting the large NbE ligand into the narrow ligand binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4e</xref>). This specific rotamer conformation has only been observed when DAMGO, a pentameric peptide ligand, is bound to the µOR, however, in the NbE-µOR structure W318<sup>7.35</sup> is shifted by several Å. Because of the unusual positioning of W318<sup>7.35</sup> and its rotamer conformation, K303<sup>6.58</sup> that often stacks onto W318<sup>7.35</sup> is displaced by several Å, forming a salt bridge with S103<sup>NbE</sup> of NbE instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The three tip-forming aromatic residues of NbE are recognized by neighboring but distinct binding cavities in the orthosteric binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Here, Y106<sup>NbE</sup> and F107<sup>NbE</sup> are binding to sites usually occupied by small molecule ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f-h</xref>), whereas Y108<sup>NbE</sup> stacks onto L219 of ECL2, thereby stabilizing the CDR3 β-hairpin loop in its conformation. Binding of ligands to this peripheral binding site has not yet been observed in other µOR structures. Conversely, the ligands alvimopan (antagonist), endomorphin, and fentanyl (agonists) are inserting aromatic functional groups into another binding cavity, which is not occupied by NbE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f-h</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To probe if the Nb ligand undergoes conformational rearrangements upon µOR binding, we crystallized NbE in its unbound form. The crystal contained three NbE molecules per asymmetric unit. All three molecules are virtually identical to each other, including the CDRs. Comparing the unbound and bound NbE structures revealed that CDR1 and the CDR3 β-hairpin loop undergo a conformational shift when µOR-bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S5a,b</xref>). The conformational differences imply that CDR1 and CDR3 exhibit intrinsic flexibility, potentially important for conformational selection of the inactive µOR and high-affinity binding.</p><p id="P16">In summary, NbE shows a unique interaction profile with the µOR. In particular, D147<sup>3.32</sup>, L219<sup>ECL2</sup>, and W318<sup>7.35</sup> of the μOR engage with NbE in a so far undetected ligand binding mode that can offer new possibilities for structure-guided drug design.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Extracellular loops confer NbE binding selectivity</title><p id="P17">To provide a rationale for NbE’s selectivity for μOR over other OR family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), we focused our structural analyses on the extracellular loops, which represent the most variable regions in the OR family. In particular, ECL2 shows variations in sequence and length between the receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S6</xref>), providing a possible explanation for the observed μOR selectivity given the specific interactions of NbE with ECL2 and ECL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). K209<sup>ECL2</sup>, R211<sup>ECL2</sup> and Q212<sup>ECL2</sup> form salt bridges with E111<sup>NbE</sup>, Y102<sup>NbE</sup>, and T35<sup>NbE</sup> respectively, thereby contributing to high-affinity binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Importantly, Q212<sup>ECL2</sup> is unique to the µOR. The centered L219<sup>ECL2</sup> of ECL2 stacks onto Y108<sup>NbE</sup> of CDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). K303<sup>6.58</sup>, also unique to μOR, forms a specific salt bridge with S103<sup>NbE</sup> that likely stabilizes ECL3 in a conformation that allows several nonspecific side chain-main chain interactions between μOR and NbE, with E310<sup>ECL3</sup> being at ECL3’s center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Binding of NbE to μOR induces clear shifts for ECL2, parts of TM6, ECL3 and TM7 compared to the other two antagonist-bound μOR structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To probe the relevance of μOR’s ECLs in NbE binding, we first substituted ECL2 residues K209<sup>ECL2</sup>, R211<sup>ECL2</sup>, Q212<sup>ECL2</sup> and L219<sup>ECL2</sup> (‘KRQL’ motif) by alanine and tested NbE binding to the μOR mutant by flow cytometry. Compared to wild-type μOR, the KRQL-A mutant showed 50% reduced NbE binding, indicating a lower affinity for the ECL2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Exchanging E310<sup>ECL3</sup> in CDR3 with alanine also significantly reduced NbE binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Combining both the ECL2 and ECL3 mutations did not lead to further reduction in NbE binding, highlighting the central role of the orthosteric pocket interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Next, we reasoned that assimilating the δOR to the μOR, based on the uncovered interaction interfaces, might transform the δOR from a non-binder to a NbE-binder. Given the established role of the amino acid position 7.35 in opioid receptor subtype selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), we first mutated δOR’s L300<sup>7.35</sup> in the orthosteric pocket to the corresponding μOR residue W318<sup>7</sup>.<sup>35</sup> (δOR<sup>L300W</sup> mutant). We then also converted the δOR residues D193<sup>ECL2</sup> (corresponds to μOR Q212<sup>ECL2</sup>) and M199<sup>ECL2</sup> (corresponds to μOR T218<sup>ECL2</sup>) into glutamine and threonine residues respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). T218<sup>ECL2</sup> of μOR forms an intramolecular salt bridge with the guanidinium group of R211<sup>ECL2</sup>. As a consequence of this loop stabilization, K209<sup>ECL2</sup> and R211<sup>ECL2</sup> of the μOR are ideally positioned to create the aforementioned hydrogen bonding network with Y102<sup>NbE</sup> and E111<sup>NbE</sup> of NbE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Because T218<sup>ECL2</sup> is unique to the μOR, we speculated that mutating δOR M199<sup>ECL2</sup> into threonine might stabilize the ECL2 of the δOR in a confirmation that favors NbE binding. We quantified fluorescent NbE binding to cells expressing μOR (control), wild-type δOR, or δOR mutants by flow cytometry and gated cells for similar receptor levels. As expected, only non-specific background NbE binding was detected for cells expressing wild-type δOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The NbE signal was not increased for cells expressing δOR<sup>L300W</sup>. However, strong NbE binding was observed when cells expressed the triple mutant δOR<sup>D193Q, M199T, L300W</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The results show that mutating two residues in the ECL2<sup>δOR</sup>, combined with the orthosteric L300W mutation, can convert the non-binding δOR into a strong NbE binder. To test the role of ECL3, we next substituted the entire ECL3 as well as residues of the connecting α-helix 7 of the δOR (residues 287-300) with residues of the μOR (306-318). The substitution led to a moderate but significant increase in NbE binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), indicating that μOR’s ECL3 region partially contributes to NbE binding.</p><p id="P20">In sum, the mutational and gain-of-function studies identify ECL2 and ECL3 as important contributors to NbE binding and receptor subtype selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Peptide mimetics of NbE’s CDR3 bind and antagonize μOR</title><p id="P21">The centering of key contacts on a single CDR made NbE’s CDR3 a promising starting point in the design of ligands that downsize the Nb towards smaller peptides based on the antigen-binding paratope. We designed and synthesized a library of linear peptides of increasing length, with the shortest peptide based on the four residues <sup>105</sup>SYFY<sup>108</sup> that compose the β-turn segment at the tip of NbE’s CDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

Peptide binding to μOR was assessed using the HTRF Tag-lite binding assay, which relies on FRET between SNAP-tagged μOR labeled with terbium cryptate as FRET donor, and the red fluorescent opioid ligand naltrexone, serving as acceptor, with a decrease in FRET indicating competitive binding of a test compound. Binding of the control ligand naloxone and of NbE was readily detected with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14 nM and 40 nM respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In the Tag-lite assay, we detected significant binding of peptides 5 (12 residues) and 6 (14 residues) at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.3 μM and 29 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The shorter peptides showed little to no binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S7</xref>). We next tested the ability of each peptide to antagonize DAMGO-driven μOR signaling by probing the cAMP response. Peptides 1-4 did not reverse the DAMGO effect, while peptides 5 and 6 caused a strong and concentration-dependent reduction of μOR signaling, detected as significantly increased intracellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Furthermore, DPDPE-driven δOR signaling was not antagonized by peptide 5 at the tested concentrations, showing that the CDR3 peptide mimetic retains receptor subtype specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).

In this study, we present an in-depth molecular characterization of the single-domain antibody fragment NbE that functionally interacts with the μOR. NbE selectively binds to the extracellular domains of μOR with nanomolar affinity and antagonizes its function. The cryo-EM structure of the NbE-μOR complex shows that NbE stabilizes the μOR in an inactive conformation that resembles μOR structures bound to the small molecule antagonists β-FNA or alvimopan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Yet NbE exerts distinct effects on key residues in the orthosteric binding pocket as well as the extracellular regions of μOR. The interactions of NbE with μOR’s ECL2 and ECL3 critically contribute to selective binding, paralleling recent observations for the role of extracellular vestibules in serving as selectivity filters of ORs for different opioid peptide agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). NbE exhibits a new ligand interaction profile with the μOR, centering almost all contacts on a hairpin loop formed by CDR3. The work opens the possibility to therapeutically target μOR with a biologic and provides an important structural template for new ligand design.</p><p id="P24">NbE’s binding kinetics are characterized by a relatively slow on-rate and by nearly irreversible binding on the time scale studied, pointing to unique bimolecular recognition. Based on the conformational differences that we detect in NbE’s unbound and μOR-bound state, in particular with regards to CDR3, it is possible that μOR binding drives NbE towards a conformation that is more complementary to the orthosteric pocket. Moreover, since GPCRs are known to be inherently dynamic and sample an ensemble of conformations in the unliganded state, NbE’s slow on-rate may also reflect conformational selection of a weakly populated μOR conformation. The slow off-rate makes NbE a unique μOR ligand, holding the potential for long-lasting μOR antagonism and distinct physiological effects.</p><p id="P25">Recent structures of class A GPCRs bound to extracellular Nbs begin to reveal the diversity in Nb driven GPCR modulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S8</xref>). For example, Nbs targeting the α1A-adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), or orexin receptor 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) interact with extracellular loops and allosterically modulate receptor function without directly contacting the orthosteric pocket. In contrast, extracellular Nbs of the apelin receptor (APJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) or the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) occupy the orthosteric pocket and mimic the binding of a peptide ligand. Similar to the NbE-μOR interaction, the APJ and AT1R Nbs access the orthosteric pocket via their long CDR3 loops. Yet APJ and AT1R Nbs both exhibit extensive additional interactions via CDR1 and CDR2, which contrasts with the limited interactions outside the CDR3 region detected for NbE. We find that linear CDR3 peptide analogues retain biological activity and are selective for the μOR, confirming the importance of the CDR3 sequence in NbE binding and, more broadly, demonstrating that CDR paratopes of Nbs can spur the development of low molecular weight antibody mimetics. Until now, OR peptide antagonists have been developed through structural modification and conversion of natural agonist peptides or by functional screening of synthetic short peptide libraries, often yielding in peptides with limited OR subtype selectivity or reduced affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The functional NbE-derived peptides described here comprise the NbE CDR3 residues that interact with the orthosteric pocket and include flanking Y102 and E111 that form salt bridges with μOR’s ECL2, providing a rationale for their μOR selectivity. As expected, taking NbE’s CDR3 sequence out of the rigid Nb framework results in a drop in affinity and efficacy, however, future steps towards fine-tuning the three-dimensional peptide structure, for example via side chain-to-side chain macrocyclization or insertion of conformationally constrained amino acids, and will very likely give access to improved binding and antagonist potency.</p><p id="P26">Beyond NbE’s action as extracellular ligand, we present a strategy to employ NbE as a genetically encoded tool to modulate OR activity.

Data acquisition was monitored on-the-fly pre-processing software using CryoSPARC v.3.3.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Cryo-EM image processing</title><p id="P43">All data were processed using CryoSPARC v.3.3.1 and RELION 3.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). The data processing workflow is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S3</xref>. First, raw movies were aligned and dose weighted using patch-based motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated by patch-based CTF estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Only micrographs with a CTF fit better than 4.0 Å resolution were selected for further processing, resulting in a set of 5’686 micrographs. Particles were initially picked using a blob picker with a minimum and maximum diameter of 70 Å and 200 Å, respectively. The resulting 2D classes were fed into the Topaz particle-picking pipeline to increase the number and accuracy of picked particles. After several rounds of 2D classification (and removal of duplicated particles) 704’786 particles were selected. <italic>Ab initio</italic> reconstruction with multiple classes was followed by heterogeneous refinement. The best class contained 509,809 particles. 3D classification helped to further clean up the particle set. 3D refinement using non-uniform refinement and CTF refinement (global and local CTF refinement) resulted in a reconstruction of 3.1 Å resolution. To further improve the density of the μOR, refined particles were imported into RELION 3.1 for 3D classification without alignment (K=4 and T=12), using a soft mask on the seven transmembrane helices of the μOR. The best class showing high resolution features was selected (445,766 particles) and particles were re-imported to CryoSPARC for non-uniform refinement followed by local refinement with a soft mask around the NbE-μOR. As a result, the density for the NbE-μOR interface was significantly improved. All maps were sharpened with deepEMhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). All resolution estimations were derived from Fourier shell correlation (FSC) calculations between reconstructions from two independently refined half-sets, and reported resolutions are based on the FSC = 0.143 criterion. Local resolution estimations are obtained by ResMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Cryo-EM model building and refinement</title><p id="P44">The crystal structure of inactive μOR bound to a covalent antagonist (PDB: 4DKL) was used as an initial reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Similarly, the crystal structure of the NbE published in this manuscript was used as an initial model. For NabFab and anti-Fab Nb, the cryo-EM structure of VcNorM complex was used as initial models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). All initial models were fitted into cryo-EM maps using Chimera X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), then manually built in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), iteratively and real-space refined using PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).

Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C in a temperature-controlled incubator. The best NbE crystals grew in 1 M succinic acid pH 7.0, 1-2% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether (PEG 2000 MME) and 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.0, reaching their final size within 3 days. Crystals of NbE were cryoprotected using the well solution supplemented with 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data was collected at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 23-IDD on a Pilatus 6M detector. The final dataset was collected from a single crystal of NbE, with reflections extending to 2.85 Å resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Crystallographic data processing and model refinement</title><p id="P46">Reflection data was integrated using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), and scaled and merged using Aimless as part of the CCP4 suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Initial phases were obtained using molecular replacement in Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), using a homology model from SwissModel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) yielding three copies of NbE in the asymmetric unit. Iterative rounds of manual model building and automated refinement were carried out in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) and Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), respectively. The final model was refined to a R<sub>free</sub> of 0.331 with favorable geometry (96% Ramachandran favored, 3% allowed, and 0.3% outliers). Of the three chains in the asymmetric unit, one (chain A) is characterized by exemplary density for the resolution and was used as an initial model for building of the NbE-μOR-Fab complex.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Peptide synthesis</title><p id="P47">Peptides have been synthesized using Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) on a microwave assisted peptide synthesizer (CEM Liberty Lite). The synthesis was performed on 0.1 mmol scale using preloaded Wang resin or Rink Amide resin depending on the desired C-terminal end of the peptide, being a carboxylic acid or carboxamide. Fmoc deprotection was performed at 90°C for 3 min using a solution of 20% 4-methylpiperidine in DMF during the entire synthesis. Each coupling was done using 5 equivalents of Fmoc protected amino acid, with 0.5 M DIC and 1 M Oxyma as coupling reagents. N-terminal acetylation has been done manually using 10 equivalents of acetic anhydride and 5 equivalents of DIPEA during 1 h in DMF. After completion of the sequence, the resin was washed several times with DCM, followed by the cleavage using a cocktail solution consisting of 90 % TFA, 5 % triisopropylsilane and 5 % distilled water during 4 h. After freeze-drying, crude peptides were obtained and purified using preparative HPLC. More specifically, a Gilson HPLC system, equipped with Gilson 322 pumps and a Supelco Discovery® BIO Wide Pore C18 column (25 cm x 21.2 mm, 10 μm), was used. Crude peptides were dissolved in DMSO and purified using H<sub>2</sub>O-AcN–0.1% TFA as mobile phase. Finally, fractions were collected, and the accompanying purities were assessed by analytical RP-HPLC, after which the pure fractions were combined and lyophilized to obtain the final purified peptide as a powder (TFA salt) with a high purity (&gt; 95 %).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS192650-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d103aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A.
