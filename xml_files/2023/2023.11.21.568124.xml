This impact is worsened by inter-kingdom insect-microbe interactions that can increase transmission and disease severity in affected plants. Whilst bacterial chemical cues have been shown to directly influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived compounds on phytopathogens is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the chemical basis for interactions between beetle larvae and bacteria in acute oak decline (AOD), a disease characterised by inner bark necrosis and involving a polymicrobial consortium including <italic>Brenneria goodwinii</italic> and larval galleries of <italic>Agrilus biguttatus</italic>. We found that <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval extracts contain chemical elicitors that increase bacterial growth rate and final cell density during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, and stimulate the differential expression of ~600 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, which are major virulence factors in plant pathogens. Chemical compounds from closely related insect species did not have this effect. These findings highlight the importance of inter-kingdom interactions in plant disease and suggests a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Insect-microbe interactions are increasingly important in the context of plant disease owing to increasing incidence of pest and disease outbreaks, driven in part by international trade and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Coolen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Singh et al., 2023</xref>). For example, the six-spotted leafhopper <italic>Macrosteles quadrilineatus</italic> is a vector for bacterial phytoplasmas that cause Aster Yellows disease and in-turn benefits from secreted bacterial effectors that targets the plant defence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sugio et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic>, which infects a wide range of plant hosts, is transmitted by xylem sap-feeding insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Sicard et al., 2018</xref>). Volatile organic compounds produced by bacteria have been shown to influence insect behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Weisskopf et al., 2021</xref>), which in turn assists in bacterial dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Robacker et al., 2004</xref>). A handful of studies have examined the influence of insect metabolites on bacteria, finding inhibitory mechanisms based on the production of antimicrobial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Teh et al., 2013</xref>). However, weather insect-derived compounds have positive positive effects on bacterial activity, increasing growth and/or virulence has not been thoroughly explored. In one example, honeydew produced by aphids has been shown to increase <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Smee &amp; Hendry, 2022</xref>). In addition to serving as a source of nutrition, bacteria use chemical signals as a primary source of information to coordinate their behaviour at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miller &amp; Bassler, 2001</xref>). As such, our limited understanding of the impact of insect-derived compounds on plant-associated bacteria remain a major knowledge gap.Understanding multi-kingdom interactions in plant disease is therefore crucial, especially in decline diseases such as Acute Oak Decline (AOD), where insects could play a pivotal role. AOD is a complex decline disease affecting native British oak species (<italic>Quercus robur</italic> and <italic>Quercus petraea</italic>) and recently identified in many European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Carluccio et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ruffner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tkaczyk &amp; Sikora, 2024</xref>). It involves the cumulative action of multiple biotic and abiotic factors, such as larvae of bark-boring beetles and bacterial phytopathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Denman &amp; Webber, 2009</xref>). The disease is characterised by inner bark tissue necrosis caused by a polymicrobial consortium composed of at least three bacterial species (<italic>Brenneria goodwinii, Gibbsiella quercinecans</italic>, and <italic>Rahnella victoriana</italic>), and characterised by the presence of larval galleries of the two-spotted oak buprestid, <italic>Agrilus biguttatus</italic> on the phloem–sapwood interface.</p><p id="P3"><italic>B. goodwinii</italic> is recognised as the dominant pathogen within necrotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>) and transcriptomic analysis of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> in oak stem tissue revealed the up-regulation of putative virulence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>). Co-infection of <italic>A. biggutatus</italic> larvae significantly increased the expression of these genes including Type III secretion system effectors <italic>srfB</italic> and <italic>avrE</italic>, known to contribute to virulence and suppression of host immunity in other pathosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Worley et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Degrave et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>katG</italic> which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide released as part of the host defence response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jittawuttipoka et al., 2009</xref>). The presence of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae also increased the area of necrotic tissue caused by bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the interaction between <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> and <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae in the inner bark enhances bacteria-induced necrosis and facilitates the proliferation and spread of damaging bacteria within infected trees.</p><p id="P4">Although interactions between <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> and <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae have been demonstrated <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>), the mechanism underpinning this interaction remains unknown. In this study, we inoculated oak logs with <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> eggs and collected late-instar larvae and gallery wood tissue from the logs. As <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval feeding may chemically modify their environment and/or trigger host responses, we extracted chemicals from asymptomatic as well as gallery wood tissue and the bodies of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae and independently assessed their bioactivity towards <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> in controlled <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. We tested three hypotheses: (1) <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> proliferation and virulence gene expression are indirect effects of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval activity and are triggered by chemicals associated with gallery wood tissue; (2) <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> proliferation and virulence gene expression are direct effects of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae and are triggered by larval chemical elicitors; (3) the interaction between <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> and <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae is specific to <italic>A. biguttatus</italic>. We show that chemical elicitors from <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae (hypothesis 2), but not gallery wood tissue (hypothesis 1), directly trigger an increase in <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> growth and the up-regulation of 307 genes, including effectors involved in bacterial Type III secretion system. Such an effect was not observed with extracts from closely related wood-boring beetle species, suggesting some specificity in this interaction (hypothesis 3). Determining the mechanisms of insect-microbiota interactions and their emergent impacts on plant disease outcomes is critical to inform integrated pest management strategies for globally important plant diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Gallery wood tissue extracts do not increase bacterial proliferation compared to healthy wood tissue extracts</title><p id="P5">To test the effect of chemical extracts from galleries made by <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae on <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> proliferation (hypothesis 1), we compared bacterial growth in cultures supplemented with asymptomatic wood extract and gallery wood tissue extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Cultures supplemented with gallery wood tissue or asymptomatic wood extracts did not have a clearly distinct gene expression profile and did not cluster separately based on the correlation matrix of normalised transcript count per million (CPM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). A total of 12 genes were differentially expressed between the gallery and asymptomatic wood tissue, with 3 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated genes in the gallery wood tissue treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Two out of the 3 up-regulated genes were linked to flagellum production (<italic>fliA, fliF</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

We also included in the experiment the wax moth <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> (Gm) as an outgroup. Because of the limited availability of larvae extract, only one experiment was performed and culture were grown for 10 hpi only to allow sampling for RNAseq analysis. OD<sub>600</sub> measurements from these 10 first hours of growth were performed on some of the cultures and show a trend of higher growth rates for Ab, Ap, and Gm compared to As and control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S2</xref>).

However, the different species of larvae did not necessarily form distinct species-specific clusters, indicating some variability in the bacterial response to larval chemical compounds. Nevertheless, most Ab samples clustered separately from the other larval extracts. Cultures supplemented with As and Gm extracts did not show any significant differentially expressed genes compared to the control, although data shows a trend of higher CPM for <italic>hrpN</italic> compared to control. Cultures supplemented with Ap extracts showed 125 differentially expressed genes, including 85 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Most up-regulated genes were related to cell multiplication, while down-regulated genes contained 9 flagellar production- and motility-related genes.

Altogether, these results suggest that F1 contains the chemical elicitors responsible for the proliferation (higher growth rate) of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>, but that these chemical compounds, when separated from the other fractions, reduce cell density in the stationary phase of growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">Investigations of insect-bacteria interactions in plant diseases have largely focussed on the role of bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in modulating insect behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Leroy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Weisskopf et al., 2021</xref>). Less attention has been paid to the influence of insect-derived chemical cues on bacterial growth and virulence. In this study, we investigated the impact of insect chemical elicitors on a bacterial species associated with Acute Oak Decline (AOD). We found that <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval elicitors, but not gallery wood tissue extracts, increase <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> proliferation and virulence gene expression. Elicitors from some other insect species influenced bacterial gene expression but did not trigger the expression of T3SS effector genes.</p><p id="P13">Extracts from larval gallery wood tissue did not cause bacterial proliferation as compared to healthy wood controls, suggesting that proliferation of the bacteria around <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> galleries <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>) is not mediated by the tree host chemicals. The growth rate of cultures was in fact lower for extracts from gallery wood tissue compared to healthy wood tissue; potentially owing to tree host defence compounds produced in response to larval invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Broberg et al., 2018</xref>). However, the final cell density was not significantly different between gallery and healthy wood tissue extract treatments, suggesting that the extracted chemicals only affect the speed of proliferation but not final cell density. In addition to a reduction of growth rate, the wood gallery extracts triggered the expression of flagellum-associated genes, which are mainly involved in bacterial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Thomas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wilkinson et al., 2011</xref>) and could represent a mechanism for the bacteria to move away from an unsuitable environment. Some flagellar genes are involved in virulence and plant wall adherence in certain plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Malamud et al., 2011</xref>) which could indicate the activation of some virulence process components. However, any such indirect effect of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae on <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> virulence gene expression through the modification of the wood tissue environment is thus less powerful than the direct effect of larval extracts but cannot be completely excluded.</p><p id="P14"><italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval extracts increased bacterial proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the interaction between insect and bacteria observed <italic>in planta</italic> is at least in part directly mediated by larval chemical compounds. Previous studies conducted on artificially infected oak logs showed that the lesion size caused by AOD bacteria significantly increased in the presence of beetle larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, AOD lesions are observed in close proximity to beetle galleries <italic>in natura</italic>, which suggests a bacteria-beetle interaction, and/or the dissemination of the bacteria within wood tissues by the beetle larvae. In the light of our results, we hypothesise that elicitors are released by <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae as they form galleries, and that these chemical compounds trigger the proliferation of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>, which starts degrading the wood. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that elicitors may be metabolised by the bacteria and may act as a food source in our experiment.</p><p id="P15">The link between larval elicitor production and bacterial lesion formation is further supported by the fact that <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval extracts also triggered the expression of putative virulence genes in <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>. Among the 307 significantly up-regulated genes induced by larval extracts were some potential virulence genes associated with a Type III secretion system (T3SS), which is well reported in other plant pathogens. These include the <italic>hrpN</italic> gene encoding for the harpin component of the needle structure of the T3SS in <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Collmer et al., 2000</xref>) and has been found over-expressed in AOD lesions <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Broberg et al., 2018</xref>). This T3SS belongs to the Hrc-Hrp1 family only present in plant pathogens and is distinctive in that it possesses a long, flexible pilus able to traverse the thick plant cell wall, suggesting that the target of this T3SS is the plant host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Troisfontaines &amp; Cornelis, 2005</xref>). In addition, we found a<italic>vrE</italic> genes up-regulated in the presence of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval elicitors, which were previously reported to be up-regulated in the presence of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>). The a<italic>vrE</italic> gene encodes for a T3SS effector involved in the suppression of plant immunity by <italic>P. syringae</italic> and other plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Degrave et al., 2015</xref>) which induce water flux into host cells resulting in cell swelling and bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nomura et al., 2023</xref>). These results give another strong indication that beetle larvae are involved in triggering the virulence of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>. It should be noted, however, that some bacteria have also been reported to possess different T3SS effectors to allow interactions both with plant hosts and insect vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Correa et al., 2012</xref>). The response of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> to <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> chemical compounds could thus potentially be involved in the colonisation of larvae by the bacteria; a<italic>vrE</italic> gene knock-outs could confirm its function in the AOD system.</p><p id="P16">We investigated the specificity of this insect-bacterium interaction by extracting chemical compounds from the European oak borer <italic>A. sulcicollis</italic>, the emerald ash borer <italic>A. planipennis</italic>, and the wax moth <italic>Galleria melonella</italic>. We did not find any significant differentially expressed genes in <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> cultures supplemented with <italic>A. sulcicollis</italic> and <italic>G. mellonella</italic> compared to the control, which could be explained by the lower sample size we had for these insect species. However, <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> cultures supplemented with A. <italic>planipennis</italic> extracts showed 125 differentially expressed genes compared to the water control. Among these, numerous motility-related genes were down-regulated, which is similar to the response of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> to <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> extracts and indicate a change of phenotype in response to insect-derived chemical compounds. However, none of the T3SS-related genes found up-regulated in the presence of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> were differentially expressed in response to <italic>A. planipennis</italic> extracts. These results suggest that chemical compounds from different insect species can show bioactivity towards B. <italic>goodwinii</italic>, but the trigger of virulence gene expression is specific to <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> under the conditions of our experiment.</p><p id="P17">One fraction of the <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larval extract produced the same growth curves as the bulk larval extract when added to a culture of <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>. The growth rate obtained with this fraction was in fact higher than with the bulk larval extract, while the final cell density at 24 hpi was lower. This indicates that several chemical compounds are necessary to reproduce the full phenotype observed when supplementing cultures with the bulk larval extract, which may be present in several of the four fractions. Identifying the bioactive chemical compounds should be a future priority but it is hindered by the limited availability and seasonality of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> larvae and the predicted significant challenges associated with the identification work. However, we successfully narrowed down the activity range of separate fractions of larval extracts responsible for the proliferation and up-regulation of effector gene expression in <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>, which will aid chemical compound characterisation efforts.</p><p id="P18">The strong effects of <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> extracts on <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> in comparison to those from gallery wood tissue strengthens the argument that <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> acts as a synergistic factor with <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>, the major pathogen found in AOD lesions. Whether the bacteria are present in the tree in a non-pathogenic state before beetle invasion, or if they are vectored by the beetle to the tree remains to be answered, but our study emphasises the necessity of integrating <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> population survey and management into programs tackling AOD. The potential benefits this interaction provides to each partner need to be further evaluated to understand their evolutionary consequences. It is possible that this interaction results from co-adaptation and provides a benefit to <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> beetle larvae, as <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> expresses detoxification genes when infecting the tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Denman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>). This may provide protection for the larvae against plant defences as well as weakening the tree, thus increasing larval survival and overall reproductive success. For the bacteria, supporting the growth and emergence of beetle larvae could potentially lead to facilitated multiplication and transmission between trees. On the other hand, this interaction could equally be incidental and not a result of any evolutionary relationship, with no impact on the bacteria or beetle fitness.</p><p id="P19">Although <italic>A. sulcicollis</italic> shares its oak hosts with <italic>A. biguttatus</italic>, the same interaction with <italic>B. goodwinii</italic> was not observed in our experiment. Anecdotally, <italic>A. sulcicollis</italic> colonises very poorly defended or recently dead oak tissues, which are drier and more degraded than those colonised by <italic>A. biguttatus</italic> (K. Reed, personal observation). Perhaps it therefore does not have the same need for protection from host defences as <italic>A. biguttatus</italic>, which is able to colonise stressed, but still living host tissue. On the other hand, <italic>A. planipennis</italic>, a highly aggressive species, which is able to kill healthy ash trees, did provoke differential gene expression in <italic>B. goodwinii</italic>. Given the economic cost of damage due to <italic>Agrilus</italic> pests, future studies should explore the interaction between Agrilus species and microbial communities in trees.</p><p id="P20">Although the importance of interactions between insects and bacteria is well established in the case of symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Douglas, 2009</xref>) or insect behaviour manipulation by bacterial VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davis et al., 2013</xref>), our suggests another form of insect-bacteria interaction, where insect-derived chemicals modulate bacterial gene expression potentially influencing virulence. The implications of this finding are of particular importance in the context of recent increases in plant disease outbreaks involving pest-pathogen interactions. Our study together with previous work strongly suggest that an insect herbivore affects bacterial behaviour by triggering the expression of virulent phenotypes and facilitating lesion formation in live bark tissue, thus contributing to tree decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Broberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Doonan et al., 2020</xref>).
