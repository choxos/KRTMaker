distinct challenges. Advances in scRNA-Seq have improved our understanding of the diversity and stability of these programs, but it has proven difficult to link this information with known lymphocyte subsets. Here, we introduce Sort-Seq, an immune repertoire-based method that allows exact positioning of phenotypically defined lymphocyte subsets within scRNA-Seq data. Sort-Seq outperformed CITE-Seq for accurate mapping of the classical CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th) cell subsets (Th1, Th1-17, Th17, Th22, Th2a, Th2, and Treg), offering a more powerful approach to the surface phenotype-based scRNA-Seq classification of adaptive lymphocyte subpopulations. Using integrated scRNA-Seq, Sort-Seq, and CITE-Seq data from 122 donors, we provide a comprehensive Th cell scRNA-Seq reference map. Exploration of this dataset revealed the low plasticity and extreme sustainability of the Th17, Th22, Th2, and Th2a cell programs over years. We also develop Cultivation-based Antigen-specific T cell identificatoR in Replicates (CultivAToRR), which identified &gt;80 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> TCRβ clonotypes in a single donor across a wide frequency range. We complemented these results with frequency-based capturing of COVID-19-responsive clonotypes and screening against known SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. Positioning within the annotated scRNA-Seq map revealed functional subtypes of Th cell clones involved in primary and secondary responses against SARS-CoV-2. The ability to capture low-frequency antigen-specific T cell clones in combination with Sort-Seq-based scRNA-Seq annotation creates an integral pipeline that links challenge-responsive clones with their exact functional subtypes, providing a solid foundation for investigating T cell roles in healthy and pathological immune responses and vaccine development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Adaptive immunity controls pathogen clearance, tissue homeostasis, and vaccine efficacy.

Their functional and antigen-specific diversity allows them to guide both classical (B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages) and non-classical (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, granulocytes) antigen-presenting cells to optimize effector functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. As a consequence, inappropriate Th responses to certain antigens have been associated with impaired pathogen clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, inefficient responses to vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, acute and chronic hypersensitivity and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, inflammaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Accordingly, when investigating T cell responses, it is critical not only to quantify the magnitude of the antigen-specific T cell clonal expansion but also to understand functional programs, and related phenotypes of the responding and memory helper T cells.</p><p id="P4">Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) techniques are shedding light on the true diversity of Th cell programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), among which classical subsets described on the basis of cytokine release profiles and patterns of surface marker expression have to find their place. However, the expression of transcripts encoding characteristic surface markers is often low in scRNA-Seq datasets, with indirect correlations between mRNA abundance and protein density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This problem can be overcome to some extent by the incorporation of protein-level expression data into single-cell experiments, a task that is essentially implemented in CITE-Seq technology, which makes use of barcoded antibodies directed against markers of interest expressed on the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report an alternative approach to the surface protein-based mapping of lymphocyte subsets to scRNA-Seq data, termed Sort-Seq. This approach makes use of immune repertoires from sorted lymphocyte subsets, which are then mapped to scRNA-Seq+scBCR/TCR-Seq datasets obtained from the same donors, employing natural barcodes in the form of sequence-defined BCRs/TCRs. We demonstrate that this method outcompetes CITE-Seq for the accurate mapping of phenotypically defined Th subsets. We next integrate scRNA-Seq, Sort-Seq, and CITE-Seq outputs of 122 donors to provide a Th scRNA-Seq reference dataset and employ it to analyze long-term Th subsets stability and plasticity at the scRNA-Seq level.</p><p id="P6">In addition, dataset and improved method for the identification of low-frequency antigen-specific T cell clones among PBMCs, termed Cultivation-based Antigen-specific T cell identificatoR in Replicates (CultivAToRR).</p><p id="P7">These approaches in combination allowed the identification of functional subsets of the SARS-CoV-2-responsive Th cell clonotypes via scRNA-Seq.

We hypothesized that, due to relatively high phenotypic stability and low plasticity between the helper T cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, this approach would accurately map phenotypically defined subsets within scRNA-Seq data.</p><p id="P10">To verify this concept, named Sort-Seq, we exploited previously obtained TCRα and TCRβ repertoires of Th1, Th17, Th1-17, Th22, Th2, Th2a, Treg, and Tfh CD4+ T cell subsets thoroughly sorted from peripheral blood of healthy donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Three participants of the latter study were available for repeated blood donation at the moment of the current study. We performed scRNA-Seq and scTCR-Seq profiling from their sorted bulk effector/memory CD4+ T cells (gated as CD4+, NOT CCR7+CD45RA+ cells to deplete naive T cells). The obtained scRNA-Seq data has then been integrated with the CD4+ scRNA-Seq reported in Ref. 26 in order to: 1) increase the power of the downstream analysis such as clustering and UMAP visualization on a larger number of donors and 2) enable comparison of our approach with the CITE-Seq method employed in the latter work. This resulted in a reference dataset composed of 147,677 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), without notable donor-specific or study-specific batch effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In order to link scRNA-Seq clusters to the classic Th phenotypes, we mapped TCR clonotypes of the sorted Th subsets using scTCRs as natural barcodes. Remarkably, T cell clones from each of the sorted Th subpopulations formed clearly defined spots on the scRNA-Seq UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,с,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Of note, most of the scRNA-Seq clusters showed low clonality in the scTCR-Seq data, thus excluding clonal biases in the Sort-Seq-based annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). High clonality was exclusively observed for the cluster annotated as Temra cytotoxic Th1 subset, which is in line with the previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We next attempted to annotate the same surface-marker defined Th subsets within scRNA-Seq using CITE-Seq. For this, we used CITE-Seq data from Ref. 26, and performed sequential <italic>in silico</italic> sorting-like gating as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p id="P14">Altogether, Sort-Seq resulted in much more accurate cluster annotations compared to CITE-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1,3</xref>). Both approaches yielded similar accuracy of cluster annotations for certain subsets, such as Tregs, defined by CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> gating. CITE-Seq based annotation also readily distinguished Th17 and Th22 subsets. At the same time, CITE-Seq failed to annotate Th1 (gated as NOT CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>, CCR10-CCR6-CXCR3+CCR4-) and poorly annotated Th2 and Th2a subsets (gated as NOT CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>, CCR10-CCR6-CXCR3-CCR4+ and CRTh2- or CRTh2+, respectively), presumably due to poor surface expression of the corresponding markers. We concluded that, due to the high accuracy of FACS cell sorting, Sort-Seq approach is preferable for scRNA-Seq cluster annotation to find accurate correspondence with the studied T cell subpopulations of interest.</p><p id="P15">Based on the integrated data of scRNA-Seq, Sort-Seq, and CITE-Seq outputs of 122 donors and taking into account findings and considerations of Sakaguchi and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we propose a comprehensive Th scRNA-Seq reference map with 16 major Th clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Owing to Sort-Seq-based classification, it for the first time accurately positions Th2 and Th2a subsets. Classic Th1, Th17, Th22, as well as Temra cytotoxic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, but not Th1-17 (see below) subsets also find their exact locations within the reference scRNA-Seq dataset. “Eff-mem IFN response” cluster is nearly absent in healthy donors’ blood but is well-detectable in moderate and severe COVID patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), probably representing the typical behavior of Th cells in acute viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Tfh subset is found in two dissimilar clusters differing in the expression of CXCR5 and CXCR3. This points at functional heterogeneity of Tfh subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which warrants a deeper focused investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Phenotypic versus intrinsic program plasticity of Th cells</title><p id="P16">To evaluate the relationships and cross-subset plasticity of T cell clones, we analyzed cluster stability at different clustering resolution levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) and clonal intersections between the clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). We previously suggested notable plasticity between Th22/Th17, Th17/Th2, and Th2/Th2a subsets based on the corresponding intersections of sorted Th cell subset repertoires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, the new data on clonal overlaps and cluster stability at various resolutions in the current study prompts us to reconsider these interpretations.</p><p id="P17">Indeed, T cell clones sorted as classic Th17 subset (gated as NOT CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>, CCR10-CCR6+CXCR3-CCR4+) are found in both Th17 and Th22 scRNA-Seq clusters. However, clonal overlap between these clusters is low while the stability of both clusters is high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5a,b</xref>). Furthermore, clones sorted as classic Th22 (gated as NOT CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>, CCR10+) are almost exclusively found in Th22 scRNA-Seq cluster. This indicates that while certain Th22 clones may exhibit similar surface markers to Th17 clones due to the phenotypic plasticity, their intrinsic programs remain stable. In other words, our data suggests that Th17 clones mainly remain Th17, and Th22 mainly remain Th22. The independent origin of human Th22 clones was initially suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and reported in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Distinct TCR repertoire features also suggested the existence of clonally discrete Th22 subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. According to this logic, the population classically sorted by phenotypic markers and described as Th17, represents the mixture of <italic>bona fide</italic> Th17 and <italic>bona fide</italic> Th22 cells. In contrast, classically sorted CCR10+ Th22 subsets almost fully coincide with the corresponding scRNA-Seq cluster, representing an almost pure population of uniformly programmed T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Similarly, based on this data we suggest the self-standing nature of Th17 and Th1 subsets. T cell clones sorted as Th1-17 subset were localized in both of these scRNA-Seq clusters, but clonal overlap between Th17 and Th1 clusters is low, and stability of both clusters is high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). This data suggests the existence of stable clonal T cell populations that carry either Th17 or Th1 programs, and that only their phenotypic features but not the true underlying program could change. The Th1-17 subset, in this paradigm, does not exist as a stable combo of the two major programs of Th cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Th2a cluster appears to be self-standing: it is stable at different clustering resolutions, and is clonally well separated from Th2 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5a,b</xref>). In contrast, Th1 and Temra cytotoxic Th1 clusters demonstrate notable clonal exchange (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), indicating that the former could convert into the latter, as some of the recent works suggest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">In the proposed scRNA-Seq classification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, we give priority to the cells partitioning into stable scRNA-Seq clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), while Sort-Seq data are used to match classical surface phenotype-based sorted T cell subsets with those clusters.</p><p id="P21">Of note, T cell repertoires of the sorted subsets were obtained in 2018, while scRNA-Seq experiment was performed in 2022. Despite the 4-year distance, Sort-Seq mapped sorted clones to clearly defined positions, generally limited to one or two neighboring scRNA-Seq clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), indicating long-term stability of a program once chosen by an activated T cell clone.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>COVID-specific TCRs discovery</title><p id="P22">To test Sort-Seq capability to determine the phenotypes of antigen-responsive T cells, we focused on searching SARS-CoV2-specific CD4+ T cell clones in donor D11, who was vaccinated with adenoviral SARS-CoV2 vaccine in Dec2020/Jan2021 and got two registered, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infections in April 2021 and January 2022 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To identify TCR variants responding to SARS-CoV2 antigens for this donor, we implemented several approaches:</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>A</label><title>Cultivation-based Antigen-specific T cell identificatoR in Replicates method (CultivAToRR)</title><p id="P24">In this assay, we relied on the concept of antigen-specific T cell expansion, followed by TCR repertoire profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This approach, either used in bulk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> or focused on dividing T cells that progressively dilute cytoplasmic dyes such as carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, allows the identification of T cell clones that selectively proliferate in presence of particular antigens and consequently become enriched within the TCR repertoire.</p><p id="P25">Notably, the random nature of cell sampling and further interactions between T cells and potent antigen-presenting cells in a culture, as well as the varying proliferation potential of individual memory T cells, substantially limits applicability of such approaches to relatively large clonal T cell expansions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To account for the sampling issue, we exploited our previous experience with time-lapse T cell clonal tracking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and identification of T cell clones that are locally expanded in tumor sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In both scenarios, we obtained independent biological (at the level of cells) replicates for the TCR profiling, followed by identification of reproducibly expanded clones, where we also accounted for the sampling noise defined as variability between the replicates.</p><p id="P26">Here, we cultured CFSE-labeled D11 PBMCs in the presence of three distinct mixtures of antigenic peptides, each in three independent replicates. After 7 days, divided (CFSE<sup>low</sup>) CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were sorted from each replica, yielding 224-7,322 T cells, followed by the sensitive TCR library preparation technique. Obtained TCRβ CDR3 repertoires have been then analyzed with the pipeline based on EdgeR, a widely used method to identify differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Here, the same EdgeR algorithm allowed us to identify TCR CDR3 variants that were reproducibly enriched within repertoires of replicates cultured in the presence of the corresponding mixture of antigenic peptides, compared to the other mixtures of antigens (following the same logic as in Ref. 39). Those antigenic peptide mixtures included Miltenyi peptivators comprising the overlapping 15mers of 1) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and 2) pooled membrane glycoprotein (M) + nucleoprotein (N), and 3) a mixture of irrelevant control peptides. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> for the overview of the CultivAToRR approach.</p><p id="P27">EdgeR analysis of obtained repertoires revealed 93 TCRβ clonotypes that specifically and reproducibly proliferated <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of S (28 CD4 and 4 CD8 clonotypes) or M+N (59 CD4 and 2 CD8 clonotypes) peptivators. This bias towards CD4+ T cells could be explained by the nature of 15mers peptivators, since proper processing towards shorter 9-10mers that are presented by MHCI to CD8 T cells may not always proceed efficiently, the question that requires further investigation.</p><p id="P28">The frequencies of these clonotypes were tracked within the deep peripheral TCRβ repertoires of the donor, which were obtained at multiple time points. The analysis revealed that these clonotypes expanded in the donor’s blood exclusively on two time points, which coincided with one or both SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), confirming the accuracy of the CultivAToRR approach. A group of CD4+ Spike-specific TCRβ CDR3s (CASQEGVSNQPQHF, CASSEGASNQPQHF, CASSEGSSSQPQHF, TRBV6-1/TRBJ1-5) was identical or highly homologous to recently described TCRs specific to Spike epitope NLLLQYGSFCTQLNRAL in DRB1*15:01 context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, also carried by D11.

Thirdly, Sort-Seq is based on lymphocyte clonality, where we need to capture the same clone in sorting and scRNA-seq experiments.

Immune receptor repertoires are obtained for each sorted subset and mapped to the scRNA-Seq data obtained for the same patient or animal. Complementary scTCR-Seq or scBCR-Seq data is used to position clones of FACS-sorted subsets within scRNA-Seq. The figure is built to illustrate the content of the current work.

UMAP visualization of the reference scRNA-Seq dataset of peripheral blood Th cells. Dataset built via Seurat integration of publicly available and our scRNA-Seq data. The proposed classification is based on previous knowledge and findings of the current work. <bold>b</bold>. Dot plots summarizing the positioning of sorted (Sort-Seq) and <italic>in silico</italic> gated (CITE-Seq) Th subsets within the scRNA-Seq clusters shown on the panel (c). For normalization, we used 20,000 randomly selected scRNA-Seq cells with matched CITE-Seq or Sort-Seq data for each plot. Dot intensity shows the stained proportion of the scRNA-Seq cluster. Dot size shows the proportion of Sort-Seq-identified or proportion of <italic>in silico</italic> CITE-Seq-based gated scRNA-Seq cells mapped to the scRNA-Seq cluster. <bold>c</bold>. UMAP plots showing the localization of Sort-Seq and CITE-Seq defined subsets. TCRβ clonotypes were used to define Th subsets in Sort-Seq method. Expression of the surface markers was used to gate Th subsets in the CITE-Seq-based annotation. The color intensity in Sort-Seq is proportional to the clonal frequencies in the original sorted Th bulk TCRβ repertoires. <bold>d</bold>. Heatmap summarizing the positioning of Sort-Seq subsets, scRNA-Seq expression of characteristic genes, and CITE-Seq signal for the corresponding surface proteins. For normalization, equal numbers of 10,000 scRNA-Seq cells were randomly selected from Sort-Seq and CITE-Seq experimental datasets. Each tile of the heatmap represents one cell. The color intensity in the scRNA-Seq plot visualizes the gene expression in a cell (white color depicts zero expression). Protein expression measured by CITE-Seq was Z-scored, and all values exceeding 99.5 percentile were trimmed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190351-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Three methods of capturing COVID-specifc TCR clonotypes.</title><p><bold>a</bold>.
