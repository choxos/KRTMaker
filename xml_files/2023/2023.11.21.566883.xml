Investigation of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis, via reverse genetics enables deeper understanding of virus biology and a rapid response to emerging variants. Classic methods of reverse genetics for IBV can be time consuming, rely on recombination for the introduction of mutations, and, depending on the system, can be subject to genome instability and unreliable success rates. In this study, we have applied data-optimized Golden Gate Assembly design to create a rapidly executable, flexible, and faithful reverse genetics system for IBV. The IBV genome was divided into 12 fragments at high-fidelity fusion site breakpoints. All fragments were synthetically produced and propagated in <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmids, amenable to standard molecular biology techniques for DNA manipulation. The assembly can be carried out in a single reaction, with the products used directly in subsequent viral rescue steps. We demonstrate the use of this system for generation of point mutants and gene replacements. This Golden Gate Assembly-based reverse genetics system will enable rapid response to emerging variants of IBV, particularly important to vaccine development for controlling spread within poultry populations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide variety of species and that share a large (~30kb) positive sense RNA genome structure, capped at the 5’ end and polyadenylated at the 3’ end. There are four genera, <italic>Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-</italic> and <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>, with members of each genus posing threats to human and animal health. Genome organization is shared between the genera with a large replicase gene composed of two open reading frames (ORF) that code for the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The majority of the rest of the genome contains ORFs coding for the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), with a varying number of accessory genes interspersed. Flanking the genome are two untranslated regions, denoted the 5’ and 3’UTR.</p><p id="P3">Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a <italic>gammacoronavirus</italic> and the first coronavirus identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, is the etiological agent of Infectious Bronchitis (IB), an acute highly contagious predominantly respiratory disease of domestic fowl. IBV has a global distribution with many circulating and co-circulating strains that are classified by both serotype and genotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Many IBV strains inflict classical respiratory disease characterized by snicking, tracheal rales, watery eyes, nasal discharge, lethargy, reduced weight gain and drops in egg production and quality. Other IBV strains, for example QX, which emerged in the mid 2000’s in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and subsequently spread to Europe as D388(QX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, are deemed nephropathogenic and are characterized by additional symptoms including nephritis which can lead to high mortality and false layer syndrome. Many strains of IBV also render chickens susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, increasing mortality and spread of disease among agricultural populations. While vaccination is routinely practiced, cross protection between IBV strains is poor. Consequently, young chicks typically receive multiple live attenuated vaccines in the first few weeks of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Currently these vaccines are generated through the time-consuming process of serial passage of a virulent isolate through embryonated hens’ eggs, typically 80 to 100 times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. A fine balance must be achieved between attenuation and retention of immunogenicity and, as the molecular mechanism of attenuation is unknown, vaccines present a risk of reversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Alongside recombination in the field and/or the accumulation of genetic mutations, this potential leads to constantly emerging new variants and strains despite vaccination. Despite nearly a century of research, IBV remains a major concern to both the global poultry industry and global food security.</p><p id="P4">While IBV is predominantly of global concern due to risks to food security, other coronaviruses present risks for both domestic animals and human health. In the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, zoonotic transfer events have led to the emergence of novel pathogens and diseases with health and economic impacts, both veterinary and human. The recently emerged swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) causes acute diarrhoea in neonatal piglets and has resulted in significant economic losses in the pork industry in both Asia and the United States of America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Although human infection has not been reported and farm workers in the original outbreak showed no seroconversion (suggesting no infection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, SADS-CoV is considered a risk to humans due to the viruses’ ability to replicate in several human cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Likewise, the porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) that emerged in 2012, which also causes gastrointestinal symptoms in piglets, is considered a risk for human infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Zoonotic transfer events resulting in severe disease are well documented for the human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which emerged in 2002 and 2012 respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Most recently, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 with the resulting pandemic estimated to have resulted in over 6 million deaths worldwide as well as severe economic impact across the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Understanding the disease biology of and developing robust vaccines against this important group of pathogens is therefore paramount for the development of effective treatments and control measures, including biosecurity protocols and vaccines, to protect both public health and global food security.</p><p id="P5">The study of coronavirus biology, including that of IBV, has been greatly enhanced by reverse genetics which allows for specific modification of the coronavirus genome, commonly in the search for antiviral treatment and vaccine development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Classic reverse genetics systems for coronaviruses were first developed in the early 2000’s based on RNA recombination <italic>in vivo, in vitro</italic> ligation using pre-existing or uniquely engineered restriction sites, or assembly and propagation of a cDNA copy of the coronavirus genome in a Bacterial Artificial chromosome (BAC) or Vaccinia Virus Vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. More recently, several other systems have been established including the use of yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, overlapping PCR fragments following a circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, Lambda Red-based recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and Type IIS restriction endonucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Each system has limitations, including time, genome stability, error rate, and/or ease of manipulation, with some systems more suitable for specific coronaviruses than others. For example, RNA recombination does not permit the modification of ORF 1a or 1ab in coronaviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation methods typically rely on <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription followed by the electroporation of the full-length RNA transcript into a susceptible cell line, which is a particular difficulty if using primary cells for the subsequent recovery of infectious recombinant virus. Sequence stability and integrity is an additional concern—for example, the IBV genomic cDNA, when propagated via BAC, is unstable in <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic>. There are also logistical considerations, such as the enhanced biosafety measures required for working with vaccinia virus and the additional laboratory facilities separate from cell culture suites that are required for propagation of yeast. Reverse genetics for IBV specifically has historically been confined to RNA recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> or to the vaccinia-based system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> which utilizes homologous recombination for the modification of the IBV cDNA. Whilst the error rate of the latter system is very low and the system provides the necessary quantities of cDNA for subsequent recovery of infectious virus in primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, the process can be slow and cumbersome and is not well suited to rapid reaction to emerging IBV strains and/or variants. The development of a reverse genetics system that 1) requires minimal <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification or <italic>in vivo</italic> passage of the fully assembled genome, thereby reducing the potential for sequence error, 2) provides the necessary quantities of input nucleic acid for efficient recovery in primary cells, and 3) uses equipment and reagents that are routinely used in molecular biology laboratories is therefore highly desirable. Such a system would not only be beneficial for IBV but would also be applicable to the wider coronavirus field.</p><p id="P6">Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) is widely used in synthetic biology to create systems for studying gene networks and metabolic pathways. GGA permits the seamless assembly of large DNA constructs from multiple smaller fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. GGA relies on the action of Type IIS restriction enzymes, which cleave outside of their recognition sequence to create short overhangs, typically three or four bases in length, with no sequence constraint. The assembly order of DNA fragments can be specified using sets of overhang pairs which are joined by a DNA ligase. GGA uses the restriction enzyme and ligase in a single step, cycled reaction to permit the simultaneous joining of multiple fragments in a defined order in one operation. GGA relies on accurate ligation to maximize the yield of properly assembled constructs, as mismatch ligation can lead to constructs with mis-ordered, duplicated, or missing fragments. Classic application of GGA typically supports assemblies of 2-8 parts at once, with larger assemblies built over successive rounds of assembly. Recent work has used comprehensive profiles of DNA ligase fidelity to identify overhang combinations with high mismatch potential and avoid them when selecting fusion sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This has significantly expanded the capacity of GGA, with data-optimized assembly design (DAD) enabling the routine assembly of 25- 35 fragments in a single reaction with high yields of the desired assembly with a low error rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The expanded one-pot capacity provided by DAD has recently enabled the application of this methodology to simplify viral genome construction, permitting rescue of the T7 bacteriophage genome from 12-52 fragments in a two day protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The ability to divide the genome into many parts provides flexibility in the placement of fusion sites, allowing open reading frames (ORFs) or other regions of interest to be isolated on individual fragments and permitting manipulation of focused regions with re-use of parts in regions that do not need to be altered. Further, the part size can be reduced such that the DNA can be produced synthetically and/or cloned into carrier plasmids, enabling simple manipulation of the sequence <italic>in silico</italic> or through classic <italic>E. coli</italic>-compatible molecular biology techniques.</p><p id="P7">In the current publication, we describe the application of DAD to the development of a GGA-based reverse genetics system for the D388 strain of Avian IBV. This system permits the rapid and flexible assembly of complete viral cDNA from 12 parts held in plasmids, rationally designed to isolate many ORFs in fragments that are readily propagated and manipulated in traditional <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid systems. The resulting recombinant IBV (rIBV), denoted D388-GGA, was characterized and compared to the wild type D388 strain (D388-WT). Replication was comparable in <italic>ex vivo</italic> tracheal organ cultures (TOCs), <italic>in ovo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. D388-GGA also exhibited a comparable pathogenic phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrating that the reverse genetics system developed is a powerful tool for the study of pathogenic and immunogenic determinants. Further, the design enables the simplified introduction of specific mutations via site directed mutagenesis in component plasmids and enables genetic knockouts and gene replacements through substitution of individual parts, as demonstrated by the generation of three further rIBVs. The assembled cDNA is compatible with classic methods for viral rescue and directly usable in transfection without any need for passage in <italic>E. coli</italic> or vaccinia virus. The reverse genetics system presented will enable easier and more rapid investigation of virus biology, replication, and virulence. It further presents a facile platform for accelerating vaccine research and development for avian IBV, with advantages of speed, efficiency, fidelity, and safety compared to other systems utilizing Type IIS restricted parts, yeast assembly, or passage through <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design and Assembly of a GGA-based reverse genetics system for Avian IBV</title><p id="P8">A 28 kb consensus sequence for the IBV strain D388 was established using Illumina Sequencing and an in-house assembly pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> with the 5’ end of the genome determined using 5’ end rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (GenBank accession number OR813926). This sequence was used as the basis for the <italic>in silico</italic> design of the GGA assembly system, with a number of additional features incorporated to allow for both efficient assembly and virus recovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). First, two silent mutations were introduced into the genome to remove native BsaI recognition sites (T735A and T891A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). BsaI was chosen as the enzyme to be used in the assembly as the D388 genome contained only two native BsaI restriction sites, both within the ORF for non-structural protein (nsp) 2, permitting confident removal without risking gene regulation effects that could be caused by modifying intergenic regions. These mutations subsequently act as marker mutations to enable differentiation between virus derived from successful assembly and wild type virus contamination. Additionally, a T7 promoter was added upstream of the 5’ UTR in the cDNA construct to allow high yield conversion to the RNA genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Putting the genome cDNA under a T7 promoter is advantageous over a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter as it avoids the possibility of splicing during nuclear expression and ensures that no genomic IBV RNA can be produced from transfected cells unless the T7 RNA polymerase gene is simultaneously introduced into the cells. Downstream of the 3’ UTR, an encoded poly A tail, a T7 terminator sequence and a hepatitis delta ribozyme sequence were added; the latter permits self-cleavage of the transcript <italic>in vitro</italic> to leave a uniform 3’ end<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Finally, the assemblies were designed to form a circular construct to remove uncertainty about the end structure and provide protection against cellular nucleases.</p><p id="P9">With the full circular target sequence for the assembly designed, we applied our previously described SplitSet tool (ligasefidelity.neb.com) to select high fidelity junction sets within the sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The sequence was rationally divided into 12 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2</xref>) generally restricting the fusion sites to the regions between ORFs, with an additional fusion site placed at each end of the genome as the circularization fusion site. This rational breakpoint strategy ensured that sequences of interest were grouped together or isolated into a single fragment to allow for easy manipulation and interrogation of individual genes and proteins. As an example of the strategy considerations, the S gene encoding the spike protein, which is essential to study for antiviral and vaccine development, is contained in its entirety on fragment D388-F10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While it is technically feasible to divide the genome further, 12 fragment assemblies with DAD-selected fusion sites have been shown to assemble with very high fidelity and efficiency, while permitting the flexibility to add additional junctions as needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The design strategy and the set of overhangs chosen for this assembly were predicted to assemble with a 97% fidelity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), effectively expected to be near perfect assembly accuracy, and previous work has shown very high yields of full-length product are possible with 12 fragment assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. This design results in an average fragment size of 2.5 kb, a convenient size for manipulation within standard <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmids, and small enough such that the parts were able to be produced as synthetic fragments. Assembly from plasmid parts resulted in primarily full-length DNA product (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) that was used in virus recovery protocols without further purification.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Recovery of recombinant IBV D388-GGA from transfection of assembled cDNA</title><p id="P10">Following cDNA assembly, the rescue of infectious recombinant IBV D388-GGA was carried out in primary chicken kidney (CK) cells using a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Briefly, CK cells were infected with a recombinant fowlpox that expressed T7 RNA polymerase and subsequently transfected with D388-GGA cDNA and a plasmid expressing the D388 N protein, also under the control of a T7 promoter. The recovery of all infectious GGA-generated IBVs was tested in triplicate with the resulting cell lysate inoculated into embryonated hens’ eggs for the amplification of newly generated rIBV. The presence of D388-GGA in the harvested allantoic fluid was confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT)- PCR using primers targeting the D388 N gene and 3’UTR. Next Generation Sequencing confirmed that the sequence of the D388-GGA IBV genome matched the target design with no mutations beyond the two intentionally introduced silent mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterisation of D388-GGA</title><p id="P11">Replication kinetics of D338-GGA IBV were subsequently assessed <italic>in ovo, in vitro</italic> and within <italic>ex vivo</italic> tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) and compared to wild type D388 (D388-WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Infection <italic>in ovo</italic> resulted in equivalent titres between D388-GGA and D388-WT indicating comparable levels of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The replication of IBV <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs primarily in ciliated epithelial cells that line the trachea and results in the cessation of cilia movement, referred to as ciliostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Tracheal ciliary activity is therefore used as a marker for IBV replication. In <italic>ex vivo</italic> TOCs ciliary activity was comparable between D388-GGA and D388-WT from 48 to 96 hours post infection (hpi) with both viruses able to cause ciliostasis. Ciliary activity was measured at both 37°C and 41°C as the respiratory tract exhibits a temperature gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lower temperatures (37°C) are exhibited in the upper tract compared to the lower tract, which is closer to body temperature at 41°C. Interestingly at 24 hpi at both 37°C and 41°C ciliary activity was higher in TOCs infected with D388-GGA in comparison to D388- WT suggesting a difference in replication in this assay. Differences in replication were also observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). CK cells were inoculated with either D388-GGA, D388-WT or mock infected with media only and were stained with an antibody targeting dsRNA, a marker for IBV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and imaged using confocal microscopy. Unlike that observed in D388-WT infected cells, no dsRNA could be detected in those infected with D388-GGA suggesting D388-GGA is unable to establish infection in primary CK cells. It is not entirely surprising that D388-GGA does not display the exact same characteristics <italic>in vitro</italic> as D388-WT; wild type viruses exist as a quasi-species which consist of a large number of variant genomes, which individually may have different properties and phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The consensus sequence of D388, rather than a specific genomic variant, was used to generate D388-GGA. It is therefore possible that only a minor genomic variant within the population of D388-WT is able to replicate in CK cells, which is then selected for during propagation <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is noteworthy that the consensus sequence for D388-WT was generated from D388 propagated in embryonated hens’ eggs, and not in CK cells. Differences in phenotypes between a molecular clone and the wild type virus have been observed previously with the inclusion of nucleotides from minor variants impacting <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of the molecular clone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>D388-GGA exhibits a pathogenic phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P12">It is important, particularly for the study of pathogenic and immunogenic determinants within the IBV genome, that the molecular clone D388-GGA exhibits a pathogenic phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>. To determine <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenicity, SPF RIR chicks were inoculated with either D388-GGA, D388-WT or mock infected with phosphate buffered saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The level of snicking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and tracheal rales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) observed in chicks infected with D388-GGA from 1 to 7 days post infection (dpi) were comparable to those infected with D388-WT, with a modest lag seen in the D388-GGA infected chicks. The similar levels of snicking and rales demonstrate that infection with either D388-GGA or D388-WT results in similar clinical disease progression. Further, trachea were extracted from 5 randomly selected chicks 4 and 6 dpi and the ciliary activity assessed. At both 4 and 6 dpi, both D388-GGA and D388-WT compromised ciliary activity to similar levels. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The observed reduction in tracheal ciliary activity indicates comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> viral replication. To further confirm the extent and distribution of <italic>in vivo</italic> replication, RNA was extracted from trachea, lung, kidney and eyelid tissues, which represent the established known sites of IBV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, and the quantity of IBV-derived RNA was assessed using reverse transcription quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Equivalent quantities of IBV derived RNA were detected from eyelid, trachea, lung, and kidney tissue extracted from D388-GGA and D388-WT infected birds, again confirming comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> replication kinetics. Of note, the presence of the marker silent mutations in nsp2 that differentiate D388-WT from D388-GGA were confirmed in IBV RNA isolated from tracheal tissue, ensuring that observed results were as a result of infection by the assembly-derived IBV. Together these data demonstrate that the Golden Gate Assembly-based reverse genetic system established in this study is a robust method for generating a clonal IBV which behaves similarly to wild type virus.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Using the Golden Gate Assembly-based reverse genetics system to make single point mutations within the IBV genome</title><p id="P13">The most significant aspect of any reverse genetics systems is the ease with which modifications can be made to the genomic sequence. As a proof of concept, we generated two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) using GGA that contained single point mutations in Nsp 10 and Nsp 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The first rIBV, D388- nsp14mt-GGA contained a single mutation G18066C resulting in the amino acid change Val393Leu in Nsp 14. The second rIBV, contained the same mutation plus a single mutation C12089T resulting in the amino acid change Pro85Leu in Nsp 10. These two mutations were chosen as previous research has shown that incorporation of these mutations into the IBV strain M41 resulted in a temperature sensitive replication phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> and an attenuated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. These mutations offer a promising avenue for rational attenuation and therefore IBV vaccine development.</p><p id="P14">While it is possible to generate these point mutants <italic>in silico</italic> by simply ordering modified fragments D388-F6 and -F8, it can be cost prohibitive to order many 2kb fragments, particularly in cases where a large number of mutations may be of interest. Thus, for these point mutations C12089T and G18066C we demonstrate the ease of introducing mutations using a standard site directed mutagenesis protocol, modifying the plasmids containing fragments D388-F6 and -F8 respectively. The resultant plasmids were substituted into the GGA assembly protocol and two rIBVs were subsequently recovered in CK cells, D388-14mt-GGA and D388-10.14mt-GGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2 and 3</xref>). A stock of each rIBV was generated after two passages in embryonated hens’ eggs and the sequence of the resulting rIBVs was confirmed to contain the desired modifications.</p><p id="P15">To determine whether either of the mutant rIBVs exhibited a temperature sensitive replication phenotype, a ciliary activity assay was carried out in <italic>ex vivo</italic> TOCs at both 37°C and 41°C. At 37°C ciliary activity in TOCs infected with D388-14mt-GGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and D388-10.14mt-GGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) was comparable to those infected with D388-GGA suggesting comparable replication kinetics. At 41°C however ciliary activity was comparable to mock infected TOCs and was significantly higher than D388- GGA infected TOCs at all time points from 24 to 96 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B and 4D</xref>). This retention of ciliary activity indicates that both D388-14mt-GGA and D388-10.14mt-GGA are unable to replicate at 41°C; a finding that supports previous research using the M41 strain of IBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

Achieving high titres in embryonated hens’ eggs is important as all current IBV vaccines are manufactured in this manner.

The design of the IBV GGA-based reverse genetics system isolated the S gene on a single fragment, allowing for whole S gene swaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table X). This is an important design functionality as the IBV S gene is a determinant of serotype and protectotype in which IBV strains are classified into groups which offer protection against specific IBV strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Previous research using the highly attenuated Beaudette strain of IBV has demonstrated that the Beaudette S gene allows for a unique ability to replicate in Vero cells, a cell line licensed for vaccine manufacturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Incorporation of the Beaudette S gene into M41 also resulted in attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic> with the resulting rIBV, M41-Beau(S), eliciting 100% protection from virulent M41 challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. The S gene, and specifically the Beaudette S gene may therefore offer a mechanism for both rational attenuation and additionally a mechanism in which to move IBV vaccine manufacturing <italic>in vitro</italic>, removing the dependency on embryonated hens’ eggs.</p><p id="P17">To demonstrate the ease in which the S gene could be swapped using the GGA reverse genetic system, the rIBV D388-Beau(S)-GGA was generated. It is of note that Beaudette-CK (Beau-CK) is in a different serotype, genotype and protectotype grouping to D388. To swap the D388 S gene for the Beau-CK S gene, an alternative fragment D388-F10 was designed in which the ectodomain sequence of the D388 S gene was replaced with equivalent S sequence from Beau-CK. This sequence was generated <italic>in silico</italic> and subsequently cloned into the holding vector. The assembly of the IBV genome was then carried out by substituting fragment D388-F10 for the alternative fragment D388-F10-Beau(S) containing the Beau-CK S sequence. The rIBV D388-Beau(S)-GGA was recovered in CK cells, a stock was generated after three passages in CK cells, and the sequence of the altered S gene was confirmed. The ability to passage the rIBV during the recovery process in CK cells suggested that the incorporation of the Beaudette S had resulted in a tropism change. To confirm this and to determine whether D388- Beau(S)-GGA had the ability to replicate in Vero cells, both CK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) were infected with either D388-WT, D388-GGA, D388-Beau(S)-GGA, Beau-R (a molecular clone of the Beau- CK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, or mock infected. The cells were imaged using confocal microscopy using an antibody targeting double stranded RNA (dsRNA). As described earlier, during mock and D388-GGA infection no dsRNA could be detected in either CK or Vero cells. Conversely, in D388-Beau(S)-GGA and Beau-R infected cells, dsRNA was detected in both CK and Vero cells. This demonstrates that the replacement of the wild type IBV D388 spike gene with Beau-CK S via Golden Gate Assembly confers Beaudette’s unique ability to replicate in Vero cells to the IBV strain D388.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">The GGA-based reverse genetics system presented here is a simple, flexible method for investigating virus biology that will save critical time in avian IBV research. While prior vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics systems for IBV involved several months of work and multiple rounds of passage through cells to create a single recombinant virus, the GGA-based workflow presented here allows rescue of rIBV behaving similarly to wild type virus in mere days. Type IIS restriction enzymes have been previously used to assemble cDNA copies of coronavirus genomes, including SARS-CoV-2 and several other coronaviruses including IBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. In 2020, Xie et al divided the SARS-CoV-2 genome into 7 parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which were cut using a mixture of Type IIS enzymes, gel purified, ligated, and used for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a multi-step protocol, a similar methodology to Fang et al who assembled the cDNA genome of the Beaudette strain of IBV from 5 parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Additionally, while this manuscript was in preparation, a Golden Gate Assembly-based reverse genetics system was described for SARS-CoV-2 by Taha <italic>et al</italic>, which split the genome into 10 parts and then used a cycled assembly protocol followed by passage through <italic>E. coli</italic> using a BAC system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. While these previously published systems demonstrate the general utility of a genome assembly approach for studying coronavirus biology, the system presented here offers key improvements. In particular, the use of DAD to generate high fidelity assemblies by avoiding mismatch-prone ligation pairs is the key to high efficiency and high yield of final full-length product. This allows the direct use of assembly reactions in virus rescue, rather than passage through <italic>E. coli</italic> using a BAC system, which may be problematic for unstable genomes such as IBV.</p><p id="P19">The method presented here is a consolidation of these previously published methods and the best practices for DNA assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> as it reduces multiple steps of digestion, ligation, and passage through cells into a one-pot reaction that can be directly transfected for virus recovery, while incorporating features that promote flexible assembly design and biosafety measures. The cDNA fragments for assembly can either be ordered from a gene synthesis vendor or can be generated from genomic DNA samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the option of subsequently cloning into holding vectors to maximize DNA purity. As demonstrated through the generation of rIBVs which exhibit expected replication and pathogenic phenotypes, the flexible assembly design promotes simplified interrogation of specific mutations and allows for substitution of whole genes by swapping out component parts with minimal experimental effort. Additionally, it would be straightforward to convert the assembly into a replicon system for interrogation of specific steps in the viral life cycle, such as genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis, recombination, assessment of antiviral compounds and the assessment of non-entry related host restriction factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. A key factor in the generation of a replicon system is the ability to produce non-infectious viral particles, which for IBV is generally accomplished by eliminating the spike protein. With the described reverse genetics system here, this can easily be accomplished by replacing the S gene-containing fragment with one lacking the S gene. Propagation of the replicon cDNA can then be accomplished by insertion into a BAC. This inherent design flexibility provides the tools to study viral replication without producing infectious particles. This system therefore is not only conceptually simple and efficient, but also a powerful tool for IBV research that can used for the rapid response to emerging variants of IBV, which is particularly important to the development of vaccines to control spread within poultry populations.</p><p id="P20">We expect this method to be broadly applicable to eukaryotic viruses and especially useful for assembly of viruses with genomes too large to be contained on a single propagated plasmid (&gt; 10kb). With the use of DAD, at least 30 fragments can be reliably assembled with high fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, and therefore even larger viral genomes than IBV are theoretically accessible using this method. We also note that the direct transfection of the assembled cDNA results in a clonal virus population, which could be essential for precise investigation of specific virus strains, as was most clearly and recently demonstrated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.

Cells were washed once in PBS then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once in PBS, then blocking solution was added to each well consisting of PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were incubated in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed and replaced with blocking solution containing primary antibodies against dsRNA (Scicons, Szirák, Hungary) and alpha tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (both diluted 1:1000). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature before three 5 min incubations in PBS. Secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor488 and 568 Goat Anti-Mouse, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were diluted 1:400 in blocking solution and applied to cells for 1 h at room temperature (under foil). Cells were washed three times in PBS before the addition of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:10,000 in H2O. Cells were incubated with DAPI for 5 min before a final wash in H2O. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using VectaShield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) and sealed with nail varnish before analysis under a Leica confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P40">All statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 9.

IBV D388 reverse genetics system.</title><p>The 28 kb IBV D388 genome was used as the basis for a GGA-based reverse genetics system. Several additional features, including a T7 promoter, T7 terminator, and HDV ribozyme sequence, were incorporated into the design to permit conversion of assembled cDNA into RNA. The resulting sequence was split into 12 fragments, restricting the break points to be between ORFs, and was designed to assemble in a circular construct. Notably, the entire S gene, containing the spike protein, was designed to be contained on a single fragment (D388-F10) for easy manipulation. <bold>A</bold> IBV D388 cDNA was assembled from plasmids containing fragments D388-F1 through D388-F12 and directly co-transfected with a fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase before virus rescue. <bold>B</bold> IBV variants containing point mutants were generated using SDM on plasmids D388-F6 and D388-F8 before assembly. <bold>C</bold> The IBV D388 S gene was substituted with the Beau-CK S gene to generate IBV containing the Beau-CK spike protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191492-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Replication of D388-GGA is comparable to D388 WT in <italic>ex vivo</italic> TOCs and <italic>in ovo</italic>.</title><p><bold>A</bold> 10 day old SPF eggs were inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> CD<sub>50</sub> of either D388-GGA or D388-WT.
