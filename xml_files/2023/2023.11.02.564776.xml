We investigated the effects of TUS at the level of macaque using a recent metric, the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient, that quantifies different kinds of causal neural information processing. We analyzed this high-order quantity on the fMRI data after TUS in two targets: the supplementary motor area (SMA-TUS) and the frontal polar cortex (FPC-TUS). The TUS produced specific changes at the limbic network at FPC-TUS and the motor network at SMA-TUS and altered, in both targets, the sensorimotor, temporal, and frontal networks, consistent across macaques. Moreover, there was a reduction in the structural and functional coupling after both stimulations. Finally, the TUS changed the intrinsic high-order network topology, decreasing the modular organization of the redundancy at SMA-TUS and increasing the synergistic integration at FPC-TUS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promissory and non-invasive neuro-modulation technique that can safely alter neural activity and reach both cortical and deep areas with good spatial accuracy in comparison to other non-invasive brain stimulation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Legon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bystritsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Darmani et al., 2022</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms of TUS are still a matter of debate, some hypotheses have been suggested. At a microscopic level, TUS alters brain cells without causing a significant heating increase in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Naor et al., 2016</xref>) through mechanical stimulation of sodium and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kubanek et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tyler et al., 2008</xref>) and/or microcavitation resulting in local depolarization and alteration of the glia neuron decoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Krasovitski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Plaksin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). On a macroscopic level, TUS is related to an increased brain’s target temperature without causing oedema or impairing the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Webb et al., 2023</xref>) and to an increased excitability following a reduced GABA inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yaakub et al., 2023</xref>). TUS has also shown functional network alterations depending on the structural coupling of the target, with an increase in the brain functional connectivity with the strongly connected areas and a decrease in the correlations in the less connected regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Folloni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Verhagen et al., 2019</xref>) as well as behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hameroff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sanguinetti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nakajima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mahmoodi et al., 2023</xref>) changes from several minutes to several days following the stimulation.</p><p id="P3">However, studies are now required to understand how TUS could contribute to brain reorganization through high-order interdependencies explorations under the two types of interactions: redundancy and synergy. The redundancy can be understood as the information we can obtain in any system component. The synergy is the extra information we get if we only observe the whole system together. Several mathematical and computational tools have been proposed to estimate them, whereas different studies have pointed out their relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Williams and Beer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Timme et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lizier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rosas et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study reported the redundancy linked with lower-level sensorimotor processing and the synergy with higher-level cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, they exhibited different network organization, with the redundancy being more segregated and correlated with the structural connectivity. In contrast, the synergy was associated with the wiring distance matrix between pairs of regions and favored integrated processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). In healthy aging, redundancy increased in the older population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camino-Pontes et al., 2018</xref>; <bold><italic>Gatica et al., 2021a</italic></bold>), and could be explained by a non-linear-neurodegenerative model applied to the structural connectivity (<bold><italic>Gatica et al., 2021b</italic></bold>). Furthermore, these high-order methods have been used in a wide range of studies, such as neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herzog et al., 2022</xref>), artificial neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Proca et al., 2022</xref>), spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stramaglia et al., 2021</xref>), and elementary cellular automata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rosas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Orio et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">This article aims to elucidate how the TUS could reorganize the brain as measured by the computation of the causal redundancy and synergy at the individual level of macaques. In this direction, we re-analyze the TUS effect on resting-state fMRI data of three macaques under anesthesia, on a time period from 30 to 150 minutes following the stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Verhagen et al., 2019</xref>). We independently characterized the high-order quantities at the control condition (non-TUS) and after applying TUS at two targets: the supplementary motor area (SMA-TUS) and the frontal polar cortex (FPC-TUS). Our results showed that the TUS produced target-specific changes in the rank gradient distribution at the limbic network at FPC-TUS and the motor network at SMA-TUS and alterations in common, independent of the target, on the sensorimotor, temporal, and frontal networks. Secondly, the differences were consistent across macaques. Thirdly, the TUS decreased the structural and functional coupling independent of the stimulated target. Finally, the TUS changed the intrinsic high-order network topology, reducing the modular organization of the redundancy at SMA-TUS and increasing the synergistic integration at FPC-TUS.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">We first developed a simple example of two sinusoids to give an interpretation of how the redundancy and synergy change when modifying one of the signals. The sinusoids started as the same function, resulting in high redundancy and synergy zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and after modifying the second one gradually, the redundancy decreased, and the synergy increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) until the interaction is purely synergistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In particular, we obtained high values of redundancy and synergy due to the noiseless system, and they would be smaller if some noise were added, although the intuitions would remain. However, both quantities were annulled when the second function was noise-dominated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, if we modulated one of the signals, we observed that the redundancy and synergy nulled at low and complete synchrony, respectively. In contrast, there was a region where both quantities coexisted.</p><p id="P6">Next, we analyzed fMRI data of three macaques at non-TUS, SMA-TUS, and FPC-TUS from 30 to 150 minutes following the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To capture a region’s prevalence of redundancy or synergy, we performed a dynamical extension to the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>), which considers causality while estimating high-order interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, to answer if some areas were shifted to more redundant or synergistic interactions after the stimulation, we compared the rank gradient distribution between each TUS experiment and the control condition per each brain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Synergy-redundancy rank gradient disruption after SMA-TUS</title><p id="P7">To investigate the whole-brain effects of the stimulation at the SMA, we compared the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient between the non-TUS condition and the SMA-TUS. First, we grouped the three macaques and compared the gradient rank distribution between the control (non-TUS) and the SMA-TUS. Several networks were affected after the stimulation at SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The sensorimotor area was altered in the right secondary somatosensory cortex (SII, es = -0.94) towards redundancy and the left inferior parietal lobule (area_7_in_IPL, es = 0.92) to synergy. The temporal area in the left fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (STSf, es = -0.80) participated in more redundant interactions. The frontal cortex, particularly the right lateral orbital frontal cortex (lat_OFC, es = 1.03) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, es = 1.80) shifted towards synergy. The motor area was altered to redundancy in the right pallidum (Pd, es = -0.87) and left posterior thalamus (PThal, es = -1.06). The effect size comparisons (SMA-TUS minus non-TUS) of those regions are shown on brain maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, at the individual level, the differences are homogeneous across two or three macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we found differences between non-TUS and SMA-TUS across the sensorimotor (↑ redundancy and ↑ synergy), frontal (↑ synergy), temporal (↑ redundancy), and motor (↑ redundancy) networks at group and individual levels.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Synergy-redundancy rank gradient disruption after FPC-TUS</title><p id="P8">To explore the network alterations of the stimulation at FPC, we compared the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient between the control condition and the FPC-TUS. We found differences in the gradient rank distribution across several networks at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The sensorimotor network incremented the redundancy at the right secondary somatosensory cortex (SII, es = -1.07). In contrast, the sensorimotor region was altered towards synergy at the right primary somatosensory cortex (SI, es = 1.21) and the left inferior parietal lobule (area_7_in_IPL, es = 1.02). The temporal area shifted to redundancy at the left caudal superior temporal gyrus (STGc, es = -0.91). The frontal cortex switched towards synergy at the right lateral orbital frontal cortex (lat_OFC, es = 0.87). The limbic network shifted to redundancy at the left striatum (Str, es = -0.99), right hippocampus (paraHipp, es = -1.23), and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, es = -0.89). Additionally, The limbic network changed towards synergy at the left ventral midbrain (VMid, es = 1.03). The effect size comparisons of those regions are shown on brain maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) for the group analysis. Most differences are consistent across two or three macaques, except the left amygdala, left pons, right lateral orbital frontal cortex, and right hypothalamus, which were statistically significantly different at only one macaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In conclusion, the stimulation at the FPC produced an effect on the somatosensory (↑ redundancy and ↑ synergy), temporal (↑ redundancy), frontal (↑ synergy), and limbic (↑ redundancy and ↑ synergy) networks.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural and functional coupling</title><p id="P9">To understand if there is an alteration in the functional and structural coupling produced by TUS, we quantified the similarities between the high-order quantities with the structural connectivity (SC) and the Euclidean distance (ED).

Moreover, it decayed to <italic>ρ</italic> =0.196 at SMA-TUS, on group average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), and those differences persisted in all the macaques. Likewise, the ED-synergy correlation at non-TUS was <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.20 and decreased to <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.11 after FPC-TUS. Additionally, the differences were consistent in the macaques two and three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, the similarity increased from <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.20 (non-TUS) to <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.24 at SMA-TUS, on average, across macaques. The consistent differences were observed in the macaques one and three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, the ED-synergy correlation was more significant than SC-synergy, and there was no apparent disruption in SC-synergy after TUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure Supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, the SC-redundancy correlation was more prominent than ED-redundancy and without significant disruptions at the ED-redundancy after any stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure Supplement 1B</xref>). In conclusion, the SC-redundancy correlation decreased independent of the target. The ED-synergy similarity increased at SMA-TUS and decayed at FPC-TUS.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Network reorganization after TUS</title><p id="P10">To further understand if a network reorganization exists in the functional high-order interactions, we seek to characterize the network topology of the redundancy and synergy before and after the stimulation. We used modularity and global efficiency based on the pioneer topological characterization of redundancy and synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). The redundancy exhibited a modular organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), and the synergy presented an integrated topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). At the same time, the modularity in the synergy and the global efficiency in the redundancy were near zero in non-TUS or TUS experiments. Interestingly, the modularity of the redundancy decreased after the SMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) in two macaques, with unclear changes in the synergistic global efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, the FPC-TUS increased the synergistic integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) without consistent alteration at the modular organization in the redundancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Altogether, the intrinsic modularity in the redundancy decreased after SMA-TUS, and the segregation in the synergy increased after FPC-TUS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">This article presented three main results: 1.

The differences were consistent across macaques. 3. The TUS decreased the functional and structural coupling independent of the targets and modified the intrinsic high-order topological organization. SMA-TUS decreased the modularity of the redundancy, and the FPC-TUS increased the synergistic integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><sec id="S8"><title>SMA-TUS changes the rank gradient consistently across macaques</title><p id="P12">We found some regions changing to more redundant interaction at the sensorimotor (secondary somatosensory cortex), temporal (fundus of the superior temporal sulcus), and motor networks (pallidum and thalamus). In contrast, some networks presented a shift to synergistic interactions, such as the sensorimotor (inferior parietal lobule) and frontal (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral orbital frontal cortex) networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Although we used a causal high-order analysis instead of Pearson correlations, some regions are consistent with the previous study that analyzed the same data, reporting changes in the sensorimotor networks, prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal, and anterior and posterior cingulate at SMA-TUS on macaques. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Verhagen et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, targeting motor circuits on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces changes not only in the somatosensory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bestmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jung et al., 2020</xref>) but also spread across different areas, for example, in the lateral frontotemporal cortex, including the inferior frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pineda-Pardo et al., 2019</xref>), on human fMRI data.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>FPC-TUS changes the rank gradient consistently across macaques</title><p id="P13">There are some networks shifted to more redundant interaction at FPC-TUS, such as the sensorimotor (secondary somatosensory cortex), temporal (the caudal superior temporal gyrus), and limbic (striatum, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Even though we assessed a causal analysis instead of Pearson correlations, several of these areas corresponded with the previous study that analyzed the same macaque fMRI data showing changes in the lateral prefrontal areas, the superior temporal sulcus, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the sensorimotor networks presented functional connectivity differences after the FPC-TUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Verhagen et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the limbic network, particularly the striatum, thalamus, and amygdala, has modulated their functional connectivity after TMS at the frontopolar cortex in human data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Riedel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hanlon et al., 2013</xref>).

A seminal study described the integration and segregation as two underlying processes of brain organization that co-exist, allowing to perform diverse cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tononi et al., 1994</xref>). Lower cognitive tasks have been linked with higher functional segregation in simple motor tasks. However, in working memory tasks have been reported an increase of integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cohen and D’Esposito, 2016</xref>), where the prefrontal cortex had a critical role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Diamond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Menon and D’Esposito, 2022</xref>). In terms of high-order, lower-level processing networks such as the motor area had been liked with a prevalence of redundancy, whereas the frontal cortex was predominated by synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, our findings also showed different high-order reorganizations depending on whether the target is the supplementary motor area or the prefrontal cortex, with the TUS altering the modular organization of the redundancy at SMA-TUS and, in contrast, increasing the intrinsic integration in the synergy at FPC-TUS.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Limitations and future work</title><p id="P16">The current study has some limitations. First, rather than using absolute values, the synergy minus rank gradient depends on relative values dominated by redundancy and synergy. Secondly, only three macaques were examined in this study, and larger sample sizes should be used in further research. Third, we analyzed macaque fMRI data under anesthesia. Previous research has demonstrated that each anesthesia treatment altered functional connectivity differently in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>), macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Giacometti et al., 2022</xref>), and human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Peltier et al., 2005</xref>).

The protocol was controlled with a digital function generator (Handyscope HS5, TiePie engineering, Sneek, Netherlands) setting to 250 kHz with 30 ms bursts of ultrasound generated every 100 ms. A 75-watt amplifier (75A250A, amplifier research, Souderton) was used to deliver the power to the transducer. A TiePie probe (Handyscope HS5, TiePie engineering, Sneek, The Netherlands), connected to an oscilloscope, was used to monitor the voltage. The recorded peak-to-peak voltage remained constant throughout the stimulation. Per session, the voltages ranged from 130-142 V, analogous to 1.17-1.35 MPa, as measured in water with an in-house heterodyne interferometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Constans et al., 2017</xref>). For the SMA target, the maximum peak pressure (P max ) and I sspa at the acoustic focus point estimations were 0.88MPa and 24.1 W/cm 2 (I spta : 7.2 W/cm 2 ). For the FPC target, the parameters were 31.7 W/cm 2(I spta : 9.5 W/cm 2 ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Verhagen et al., 2019</xref>). The stimulation lasted for 40 seconds. The two target locations were close to the midline, stimulating both hemispheres simultaneously with a single train. The stimulation was guided using a frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation system (Rogue Research, Montreal), registering a T1-weighted MR image to each macaque’s head. The (X, Y, Z) Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates were (0.1, 2,19) at SMA and (-0.7, 24, 11) at FPC. The positions of the transducer and the animal head were tracked continuously using infrared reflectors. The transducer was placed on previously shaved skin using conductive gel (SignaGel Electrode; Parker Laboratories Inc.) to ensure ultrasonic coupling between the transducer and the scalp. There were at least ten days in between two TUS sessions. In the control condition (non-TUS), all procedures, including anesthesia, pre-scan preparation, fMRI scan acquisition, and timing, with the exception of actual TUS, matched with the TUS sessions.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Macaque data acquisition</title><p id="P19">We used the offline TUS fMRI dataset of macaques from the repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/lverhagen/offlinetus">https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/lverhagen/offlinetus</ext-link>. The data consists of three MRI sessions per each Control (non-TUS), SMA-TUS, and FPC-TUS, and macaque (N=3). Each macaque was anesthetized using inhalational isoflurane gas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the macaques received injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg, intramuscular), xylazine (0.125–0.25 mg/kg, intramuscular), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg, intramuscular), atropine (0.05 mg/kg, intramuscularly), meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, intravenously), and ranitidine (0.05 mg/kg, intravenously). Following the stimulation, the animals were placed in a sphinx position in a 3T MRI scanner (four-channel phased-array coil, Dr. H. Kolster, Windmiller Kolster Scientific, Fresno, USA). To avoid ketamine’s clinical peak, scanning started about two hours after anaesthesia. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was kept up to ensure a steady respiration rate. VitalMonitor software (Vetronic Services Ltd.) was used to record and monitor the values of respiration rate, inspired and expired CO2, and isoflurane concentration. Additionally, the core temperature and SpO2 were monitored constantly.</p><p id="P20">The fMRI data were acquired for three runs of 26 min each approximately using the scans parameters: 36 axial slices; in-plane resolution = 2 × 2 mm, slice thickness = 2 mm, without slice gap, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 19 ms, and 800 volumes per run.

The rank gradient consists of the synergy minus redundancy rank, obtaining one vector (1x140) per window. In particular, each run lasted around 26 minutes, with 800 volumes or time points. We defined 500-time points per window with 99% overlap, resulting in 60 windows. As every session (TUS or non-TUS) and each macaque included three runs, we concatenated the synergy minus redundancy rank gradient of all the 3x60 = 180 windows, resulting in a matrix (140x180) per macaque and experiment. We compared the three macaque sessions concatenated (dim 140x540 each gradient rank matrix) for the global analysis at non-TUS vs. each TUS experiment.

Then, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was assessed between the upper triangular part of the thresholded SC and the upper triangular part of the redundancy (or synergy) matrix.
