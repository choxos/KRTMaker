However, current chromatin profiling techniques relying on short-read sequencing technologies fail to characterise highly repetitive genomic regions and cannot detect multiple chromatin features simultaneously. Here, we performed Simultaneous Accessibility and DNA Methylation Sequencing (SAM-seq) of purified plant nuclei. Thanks to the use of long-read nanopore sequencing, SAM-seq enables high-resolution profiling of m6A-tagged chromatin accessibility together with endogenous cytosine methylation in plants. Analysis of naked genomic DNA revealed significant sequence preference biases of m6A-MTases, controllable through a normalisation step. By applying SAM-seq to Arabidopsis and maize nuclei we obtained fine-grained accessibility and DNA methylation landscapes genome-wide. We uncovered crosstalk between chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation within nucleosomes of genes, TEs, and centromeric repeats. SAM-seq also detects DNA footprints over cis-regulatory regions. Furthermore, using the single-molecule information provided by SAM-seq we identified extensive cellular heterogeneity at chromatin domains with antagonistic chromatin marks, suggesting that bivalency reflects cell-specific regulations. SAM-seq is a powerful approach to simultaneously study multiple epigenetic features over unique and repetitive sequences, opening new opportunities for the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenomics</kwd><kwd>accessibility</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>nucleosomes</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>plant genomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Chromatin is a highly dynamic structure that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. It is primarily structured as arrays of nucleosomes, which are separated by DNA segments of variable size often containing regulatory sequences. DNA wrapped into nucleosomes is generally inaccessible to other proteins. Thus, changes in the density and localization of nucleosome arrays provide a layer of epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). DNA itself can also carry epigenetic modifications, notably in the form of cytosine methylation (5mC), which is a repressive mark associated with the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and genes in both plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). How nucleosome organisation and DNA methylation affect each other and the regulation of gene activity is still not fully understood. This lack of knowledge is partly due to the inability of current technologies to simultaneously chart both DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility across strings of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Indeed, techniques such as MNase-seq dedicated to map nucleosome positioning, ATAC-seq to chromatin accessibility, and BS-seq to DNA methylation, rely on short-read sequencing technologies spanning fragments of less than one nucleosome in size. Furthermore, due to their short length (&lt;150 nt-long), these sequencing reads cannot be aligned unambiguously over highly repetitive sequences, such as centromeres, telomeres, and high copy TEs, thus providing an incomplete characterization of chromatin regulation. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), have overcome this limitation by reading long DNA molecules while simultaneously detecting base modifications. The ability of ONT to sequence native DNA also avoids amplification biases, leading to improved estimation of DNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Recent works have exploited these characteristics to study DNA methylation together with chromatin accessibility in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). For instance, it is possible to treat chromatin with bacterial m6A methyltransferases (m6A-MTases), which preferentially methylate accessible adenines due to steric hindrance. Because of the lack of endogenous m6A in most eukaryotes, treatment of chromatin with m6A-MTases followed by ONT sequencing could provide a high-resolution snapshot of chromatin accessibility, as was demonstrated using the single-molecule long-read accessible chromatin mapping (SMAC-seq) sequencing assay in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). More recently, targeted analysis of centromeres, telomeres, and rDNAs in the model plant species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), opening the possibility to implement m6A-MTases-based approaches to study chromatin in plants. However, broader use of this method for simultaneous analysis of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis and other plant species is yet to be explored. Moreover, its potential to unravel the intricacies of large and complex genomes, such as those of crops, remains to be validated. Crucially, DNA modifying enzymes are known to have sequence preferences, which must be taken into consideration when used to assess chromatin landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), even more importantly when tracking chromatin modifications at the genome-wide scale. Whether M6A-MTases have sizable sequence preferences remains elusive, and further characterizations need to be performed to ascertain the validity of results obtained with these approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Here, we adapted SMAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) to study high-resolution chromatin profiles of plant genomes. The simultaneous accessibility and DNA methylation sequencing (SAM-seq) data obtained here enabled us to study multiple epigenetic features in Arabidopsis and maize nuclei. We found that m6A-MTases have significant DNA substrate preferences, leading to sequence- and strand-biased m6A levels. We show that normalisation of m6A levels is critical to obtain reliable results, especially for the analysis of highly repetitive sequences such as Arabidopsis centromeric repeats. We demonstrate that SAM-seq can be used to identify large scale chromatin compartments, discriminate active and repressed regions, obtain high-resolution profile of nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation, identify DNA footprints at occupied transcription factors binding sites, and map chromatin landscapes across lowly and highly repetitive sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="P4">Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (Col-0 accession) were germinated and grown in long-days (16h:8h light:dark) conditions at 23°C for approximately three weeks.

For each of these 12-mer sequences we quantified the percentage of methylation of the focal adenines based on the EcoGII-treated DNA experiment, yielding a m6A methylation likelihood for each 12-mer. These values were re-centered to range between 0 and 1, and used to correct m6A levels of Adenines in both Watson and Crick genomic strands based on their specific K-mers.

Briefly, this calling first applied a convolution along the pooled profile using a 1D Gaussian kernel (standard deviation=30), and then calculated the second derivative of the convolved profile to determine local maximas. The mid-point of these maximas were defined as nucleosome dyads. The K-mean algorithm (K=2) based on dynamic time warping distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) was employed to clusterized the called dyads into well-positioned and poorly-positioned. Concretely, clustering used as input signals encompassing the 1 kb convolved profile upstream and downstream of each called dyad. The well-positioned dyads were further classified based on their genomic localization into: genes, TEs and CEN180s. Dyad’s positions were used to anchor metaplots generated by averaging MNase as well as normalised SAM-seq accessibility, mCG, mCHG, and mCHH levels.

Normalizing the histogram to sum up one, we obtained a probability distribution. We then computed the Shannon entropy of this distribution. This entropy involves the summation of the probability associated with each discrete bin multiplied by the logarithm of this probability, where a bin represents a specific range of 6mA methylation level.

To test whether this is also feasible in plants, we incubated Arabidopsis genomic DNA (gDNA) in a buffer containing the m6A-MTases EcoGII and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), followed by ONT sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genomic DNA (gDNA) without any treatment was also sequenced as control. We obtained long reads with a N50 of 5000 nt, with the longest reads reaching 200,000 nt. We processed these reads using two DNA modification callers, Megalodon (with Rerio model) and DeepSignalPlant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), to detect 6mA and 5mC modifications, respectively (see Methods). We estimated 2% and 65% m6A methylation levels in control and EcoGII-treated gDNA, respectively, indicating low false positive calls and extensive EcoGII methylation. To test whether the presence of 5mC can affect EcoGII activity and/or m6A calling, we assessed m6A levels on 20-bp sequences extracted genome-wide having variable levels of 5mC methylation. Overall, we found little dependency between 5mC and m6A levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We investigated the chromosome-wide profile of m6A levels of EcoGII-treated gDNA. Because no DNA-associated proteins are present in this <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, m6A levels are expected to be uniform across the Arabidopsis genome. Nonetheless, we found uneven levels of m6A along chromosomes, together with strong strand-biased m6A methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strand-biased m6A levels were most notable at centromeres, which are made of highly repetitive centromeric satellites. To test whether these biases may be due to m6A-MTase sequence preferences, we modelled the m6A probability as a function of sequence composition, by calculating the average m6A level from EcoGII-treated gDNA across all potential 12-mer in the Arabidopsis genome. Dimensionality reduction analysis of the 12-mers space revealed several clusters of k-mers with high and low m6A levels, suggesting complex dependencies between nucleotide content and m6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sequence biases were also evident over longer k-mers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). In addition, we observed strand-specific m6A levels in association with sequence content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). In combination, these results demonstrate the existence of significant m6A-MTase sequence preferences, likely underlying the uneven and strand-biased levels of m6A along chromosomes. Based on the 12-mers model, we generated a genome-wide map of m6A methylation likelihood as normalisation factor. After kmer-based normalisation, m6A levels were largely uniform along chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the strand-specific m6A levels observed at centromeric repeats were largely driven by m6A-MTase sequence preference. In combination, our results demonstrate that m6A-MTase treatment combined with ONT sequencing provides a powerful method to detect simultaneously m6A and 5mC on long DNA molecules from plants, and underscore the importance of considering inherent biases in m6A-MTases activities to obtain reliable m6A profiles.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Simultaneous chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation sequencing of Arabidopsis plants</title><p id="P16">To establish a robust protocol to probe chromatin accessibility in plant tissues, we purified, cross-linked, and permeabilized nuclei from two weeks old Arabidopsis seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). m6A-MTases, such as EcoGII or Hia5, are known to be inhibited by detergents such as Triton or SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), which are commonly used for plant nuclear extraction and permeabilization. In animal cells, these detergents can be replaced by digitonin, which does not affect m6A-MTases activity and interacts specifically with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, because cholesterol is present at very low concentrations in plant membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), we tested the capacity of different combinations of soft detergents and washes to permeabilize Arabidopsis nuclei as well as their effect on m6A-MTases activity. Methyltransferase activity was tested by incubating gDNA extracted from treated chromatin with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which cuts GATC sites only in the presence of m6A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

Visualisation of normalised m6A levels revealed two broad chromosome compartments with high and low m6A-MTase accessibility, corresponding respectively to chromosome arms and heterochromatin centromeric and pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, normalised m6A profiles showed little strand-biased m6A levels over centromeric regions, compared to non-normalized landscapes, highlighting the importance of the normalisation strategy for reliable accessibility profiling.</p><p id="P18">We next explored how incubation time and concentration of m6A-MTases affect SAM-seq accessibility results. We found that increasing incubation times improves profiling resolution over well-positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), at the cost of decreasing selectivity towards accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of genes. These results are consistent with previous observations made in animal cells [6]. To assess the robustness of our SAM-seq protocol, we compared the accessibility profiles obtained by SAM-seq with that obtained by ATAC-seq based on short-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Overall, we found good agreement between both techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), indicating that SAM-seq is a reliable method to chart chromatin accessibility at genes. Furthermore, accessibility profiles around TSSs of genes mirrored the nucleosome density assessed by MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), suggesting that SAM-seq can be used to detect nucleosome depleted regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).

Last, we assessed directly the reproducibility of SAM-seq by performing pairwise comparisons between biological replicates. These analyses show good agreement among replicates, which, as expected, increased in relation to the depth of sequencing. An average vertical coverage of at least 17 informative adenines per strand leads to correlation of 0.93 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), demonstrating the high reproducibility of SAM-seq experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Accessibility and DNA methylation landscapes of chromatin states</title><p id="P19">To test whether SAM-seq can provide information about gene activity, we assessed normalised m6A levels around TSS of genes with contrasting expression levels.

These results indicate that SAM-seq-based chromatin accessibility is a reliable proxy for gene activity. To explore further the ability of SAM-seq to chart chromatin landscapes, we plot m6A-MTases accessibility and DNA methylation over the nine chromatin states (CS) previously identified in Arabidopsis based on 16 genomic and chromatin features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These CSs distinguish promoters (CS1 and 2), upstream regulatory sequences (CS4), active (CS3) and inactive genes (CS6 and 7), intergenic sequences (CS5), and heterochromatic sequences (CS8 and 9). As expected, SAM-seq accessibility was high at active promoters (CS1), while the body of inactive genes and TEs have the lowest accessibility (CS7 and CS9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Overall, chromatin accessibility correlates negatively with DNA methylation, consistent with a role for this modification in limiting chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Nonetheless, CS8, which is enriched on TEs and characterised by the presence of DNA methylation and the PRC2-dependent facultative heterochromatin mark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), shows some level of accessibility. Interestingly, unlike CS9, which display the lowest accessibility and highest 5mC levels in the three sequence contexts, CS8 has high mCHH but reduced mCG and mCHG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the latter may be targets of the siRNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM). Simultaneous targeting of these <italic>loci</italic> by RdDM and PRC2 is consistent with recent studies demonstrating <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1 (MOM1) and AIPP3 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), which are respectively involved in RdDM-mediated methylation and H3K27me3 recognition. In combination, these results provide evidence that CHH methylation, in combination with H3K27me3, might constitute a form of relaxed heterochromatin.</p><p id="P20">To gain insights into the association between chromatin states and cellular heterogeneity, we took advantage of the ability of SAM-seq to probe accessibility across single molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that broadly inactive genes (CS7) and silenced TEs (CS9) show the lowest levels of intermolecular m6A heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>), indicating homogeneous chromatin accessibility across cells. Conversely, and despite their overall high accessibility, CS2 and to some extent CS4, which are characterised by bivalent marking of the antagonistic histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), display the highest 6mA entropy, with some loci showing on/off accessibility patterns across individual fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). The higher accessibility entropy at these loci provides strong evidence that co-marking reflects extensive cellular heterogeneity, rather than uniform chromatin states across fibres. Hence, CS2 and CS4 more likely reflect cellular-specific epigenetic regulations. Altogether, these results illustrate the power of SAM-seq to investigate epigenetic regulations within and across molecules, genomewide.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Uncovering DNA footprints at cis-regulatory elements</title><p id="P21">Accessibility assays can be used to uncover DNA footprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), sequences that are locally protected by the binding of chromatin associated proteins such as transcription factors (TFs). Due to the high frequency of adenine-thymine base pairs in the Arabidopsis genomes (about 64%), the high resolution provided by m6A-MTase is ideal to assess short-scale changes in accessibility, such as those associated with DNA footprints. To determine whether m6A-MTase can outline TF-binding sites (TFBS), we explored SAM-seq profiles around 390 putative TFBSs identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Overall, we detected higher SAM-seq accessibility in the vicinity of 90 of these TFBS motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>), consistent with numerous functional regulatory sequences residing within active chromatin regions. Furthermore, we found that SAM-seq accessibility drops at TFBSs were evident for at least 40% of these TFs, suggesting the presence of DNA footprints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To evaluate the potential of SAM-seq to pinpoint occupied TF binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we focused on ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), which is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP)-type TF involved in the post-germination response to abscisic acid. Clustering of predicted ABI5 binding sites based on SAM-seq accessibility yielded three types of sites with strong, intermediate, or no protection footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test the significance of the clustering, we analysed <italic>in vivo</italic> occupancy of ABI5 determined by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Sites with strong and low accessibility protection were highly and lowly overrepresented with ABI5 ChIP-seq peaks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, the intensities of ChIP-seq peaks were much higher at sites with accessibility footprints than those lacking such footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we assessed the minimum ONT sequencing depth required to detect accessibility footprints. To this end we subsampled SAM-seq sequencing data, clustered ABI5 sites based on normalised m6A levels, and quantified ChIP-seq peaks enrichment and intensities as performed above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). This analysis established that 1.25Gbp of ONT data (about 10X genome-wide coverage) is sufficient to robustly detect ABI5 footprints in Arabidopsis.

To test whether SAM-seq can provide such information in plants, we analysed normalised m6A levels around well positioned nucleosomes (see methods). Because accessibility over nucleosomes may differ between euchromatin and heterochromatin, we distinguished between well-positioned nucleosomes at genes, TEs, and centromeric repeats. We observed the lowest m6A levels within core nucleosomal regions, with the notable exception of the mid-points of centromeric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Accessibility peaks at the linker DNA situated approximately 75 base pairs upstream and downstream of the nucleosomal centres (<italic>i.e.</italic> dyads). Nucleosomal-scale SAM-seq protection extended several hundred base pairs in both directions from the focal nucleosomal midpoint, mirroring the MNase nucleosomal signal. The significant SAM-seq signal that we observed at the dyad of centromeric repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) suggests that CENH3-containing nucleosomes have unique accessibility patterns. Structural and biochemical studies suggested that DNA at the entry/exit sites of centromeric nucleosomes is highly flexible and does not cross above the dyad, thereby impeding the binding of linker histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). To further test this possibility, we compared SAM-seq accessibility over centromeric repeats with high and low CENH3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and observed that accessibility at dyads was higher at CENH3-rich than CENH3-poor nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>). Altogether, our SAM-seq results suggest that flexible DNA ends of centromeric nucleosomes provide higher accessibility at dyads, with potential implications for the epigenetic regulation of centromeres.</p><p id="P24">We next investigated how nucleosome accessibility affects DNA methylation. Over genes, nucleosomal DNA has higher levels of CG methylation compared to linker DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This result is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and suggests that MET1 activity is not impaired by euchromatic nucleosomes. Conversely, linker DNA at TEs and centromeres show the highest methylation levels compared to nucleosomal DNA, supporting the notion that heterochromatin nucleosomes are strong barriers to DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In addition, methylation profiles also reveal that dyads of centromeric nucleosomes have high CG methylation, and that this methylation follows the nucleosomal accessibility landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result suggests that relaxed DNA wrapping of centromeric nucleosomes promotes the accessibility of MET1 at dyads, leading to high levels of CG methylation. The unusual accessibility and DNA methylation landscapes of centromeric nucleosomes revealed here may have important implications for centromeric function and chromosomes segregation.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Chromatin profiling of Arabidopsis repeated sequences</title><p id="P25">Because long-reads can be unambiguously aligned over highly repetitive sequences, we explored the ability of SAM-seq to simultaneously chart chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation over such sequences, including <italic>CEN180</italic> centromeric satellites. Consistent with their role in kinetochore assembly, centromeric repeats show the lowest accessibility compared to euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Recent targeted m6A-MTase-based profiling of centromeres reported intriguing accessibility patterns of <italic>CEN180</italic> repeats, including higher accessibility of <italic>CEN180</italic> compared to surrounding <italic>ATHILA5</italic> retrotransposons, strand-biased accessibility, and reduced accessibility of linker DNA of centromeric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). We reasoned that such patterns could be influenced, at least in part, by the sizable sequence preferences displayed by m6A-MTases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, strand-biased m6A levels of <italic>CEN180</italic> repeats are evident on EcoGII-treated (naked) gDNA, and largely disappeared after controlling for m6A-MTase preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 16</xref>). Lower SAM-seq signal of <italic>ATHILA5</italic> retrotransposons compared to surrounding <italic>CEN180</italic> repeats also vanished after controlling for m6A-MTase sequence preference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>. Furthermore, our SAM-seq profiles revealed higher accessibility of linker DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results underscore the importance of considering enzymatic preferences for chromatin profiling, and provide evidence that accessibility patterns of Arabidopsis centromeres previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) can be largely explained by technical artefacts.</p><p id="P26">We next explored the accessibility and DNA methylation across TEs in the Arabidopsis genome. Overall, SAM-seq accessibility and DNA methylation correlate negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), in line with previous studies showing a dampening role of DNA methylation in TE accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To explore further this relationship, we clustered TE sequences based on accessibility profiles. This unsupervised model identified six clusters of TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Most clusters, except C1 and 3, contained lowly accessible TEs surrounded by regions with variable degrees of accessibility. As expected, the less accessible cluster, C6, has the highest levels of DNA methylation in all sequence contexts, is highly enriched on TEs belonging to <italic>Ty3/Gypsy</italic> families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), and are located far from genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Clusters 1 and 3, in contrast, have high accessibility and reduced DNA methylation levels. TEs in these clusters belong to Helitrons, SINEs, LINEs, and Pogo, and locate nearby genes, suggesting that they might serve as regulatory sequences. Potentially regulatory TEs have been recently identified based on dozens of chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Comparison between our clusters of TEs defined solely on SAM-seq results with those obtained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) confirmed that C1 and C3 largely span TEs enriched in chromatin marks associated with regulatory functions as well as TFBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 18</xref>). Moreover, accessibility over repetitive sequences have been shown to facilitate meiotic double strand breaks generated by SPO11 topoisomerase-like complexes, with nucleosome-depleted Helitron/Pogo/Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons showing an enrichment in SPO11-1 oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). As these types of TEs appear enriched in C1 and C3, we tested the accumulation of SPO11-1 oligos across the six TE clusters based on SAM-seq accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 19</xref>). This analysis confirmed the strong association between TE accessibility and SPO11-1-oligos levels, and indicate that TEs in C1 and C3, which are enriched in chromatin marks associated with regulatory functions as well as TFBS, are hotspots of meiotic DSB. In combination, these results demonstrate that SAM-seq can be used to characterise chromatin states at repetitive sequences and to pinpoint TE-derived sequences with potential regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>High-resolution chromatin profiling of complex genomes</title><p id="P27">With few exceptions, notably Arabidopsis, plant genomes carry a high load of repeats, making it very challenging to profile chromatin landscapes using short-read sequencing technologies. The long read-based approach employed by SAM-seq therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the chromatin of large and complex plant genomes. We adapted SAM-seq to investigate chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in the 2.1Gbp-long maize genome (see Methods), 80% of which corresponds to TE and other repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We performed SAM-seq on maize leaves of the reference line B73 and sequenced using a PromethION R9.4.1 flow cell, yielding 52 million reads. Unambiguously mapped SAM-seq reads covered 96% of the reference maize genome, compared to only 50-64% typically obtained with short-read sequencing. The significant increase in horizontal coverage demonstrates the definitive advantage of using SAM-seq to investigate the epigenome landscapes of highly-repetitive plant genomes.</p><p id="P28">Overall m6A level was ~3%, which is much lower than that obtained for Arabidopsis. This result is consistent with previous observations indicating that most of the maize genome is largely inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Notwithstanding the overall low accessibility, chromosome-wide normalised m6A levels were punctuated by narrow peaks of SAM-seq accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). These peaks were often located near the TSS of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), and metaplots at genes recapitulated the patterns obtained by ATAC-seq and DNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with these sites being ACRs. Accessibility profiles at genes TSS of another maize inbred line, M52, were similar to the ones obtained in B73 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 20</xref>), further supporting the reproducibility of SAM-seq to investigate maize chromatin. We then took advantage of the large maize genome, where ACRs can be located away from genes, to further test the correspondence between SAM-seq and ATAC-seq in B73. For this, we evaluated normalised m6A levels at high-confidence proximal (&lt;2kb from TSS) and distal (&gt;2kb from TSS) ACRs previously defined by ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). This analysis showed that SAM-seq accessibility was the highest over ACRs, independently of their distance to genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), thus highlighting that this method can inform on chromatin accessibility outside of genes, a feature particularly important for large plant genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In maize, ACRs have been found to be enriched in TFBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Consistent with these observations, SAM-seq accessibility increases around binding sites identified by DAP-seq for 32 TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 21</xref>). Last, we explored the SAM-seq accessibility of genes displaying different levels of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). This analysis revealed a good correlation between SAM-seq accessibility at TSS of genes and expression levels. Altogether, these results demonstrate that SAM-seq is scalable to large genomes, enables the identification of ACRs at promoters, proximal and distal regions, and provides a reliable proxy for gene activity <italic>in vivo</italic> for complex plant genomes.</p><p id="P29">Given the high TE-content of the maize genome, we tested the ability of SAM-seq to chart accessibility and DNA methylation over TEs. Overall, we found that maize TEs are poorly accessible and associated with high mCG and mCHG levels, supporting previous observations based on limited genome coverage obtained through short-read sequencing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Clustering of TE sequences based on SAM-seq chromatin accessibility identified seven clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). The largest cluster (C7) gathers TEs with, and embedded in regions of low accessibility, high mCG and mCHG, and low mCHH levels. These types of inaccessible, highly methylated TEs, are typically located far away from genes and associated with Harbingers, RTE, Helitrons and unknown LTR and TIR superfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Conversely, upstream and downstream regions respectively flanking TEs in C2 and 3, and to a lower extent C5 and 6, show relatively high SAM-seq accessibility and low CG and CHG methylation. Notably, these TEs have high mCHH levels, which peaked towards TE’s border facing the accessible flankings. Such a pattern is reminiscent of “CHH islands”, which has been described as narrow clusters of mCHH typically located nearby genes and proposed to operate as epigenetic boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Last, Cluster 1, and to a lower extent C4 too, gathers regions with high chromatin accessibility both within TEs and at flanking regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). TEs from this cluster have particularly high mCHH, reduced mCG and mCHG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), typically belong to <italic>hAT, Mutator</italic>, and <italic>PIF/Harbinger</italic> superfamilies, and are located close to genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F and G</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that maize TEs preferentially methylated in the CHH context are not linked to reduced accessibility nor to euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. Conversely, these TEs may be playing a role as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of nearby genes, as has been recently proposed for the emergence of distal regulatory sequences across angiosperm species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">The intricate interplay between nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility is fundamental for genome regulation in eukaryotic organisms. However, addressing these aspects has been so far challenging due to the technological limitations imposed by the use of short-read sequencing methods. This challenge is particularly critical when studying highly repetitive sequences, which are pervasive components of most plant genomes. Here, we adapted a method that takes advantage of m6A-MTases and long-read sequencing to ‘stencil’ accessible DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) to simultaneously map DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in complete plant genomes. We demonstrate that SAM-seq can be applied to obtain fine-grained chromatin landscapes in plant species with widely variable genome sizes and repetitiveness. Moreover, SAM-seq’s technical simplicity, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal approach for investigating chromatin marks and their dynamics in plants with large genomes.</p><p id="P31">The dynamic range and power of SAM-seq are comparable between Arabidopsis and maize, illustrating its versatility across species and genome complexities. This versatility would enable the characterization of chromatin landscapes in virtually any plant species, providing unprecedented insights into chromatin regulation, gene activity, and nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, given the recent improvements in the quality and quantity of ONT sequencing outputs, SAM-seq offers an all-in-one tool to generate <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies together with detailed epigenome information. This will significantly facilitate the investigation of chromatin-based regulations across the tree of life, bridging the gap between model and non-model species.</p><p id="P32">One significant limitation in investigating chromatin accessibility has been the inherent sequence biases of DNA modifying enzymes, such as those previously observed for DNaseI and Tn5 retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, by subjecting genomic (naked) DNA to m6A-MTases, we uncovered significant sequence preferences. We also show that these preferences can generate spurious accessibility landscapes. For instance, m6A-MTase sequence preferences can lead to significant strand-specific accessibility profiles, especially over highly repetitive sequences. Previous work using EcoGII m6A-MTase reported only modest differences in methylation levels among k-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These prior findings may have resulted from an incomplete characterization of m6A-MTase preferences. Indeed, the significance of biases increases with K-mers size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and we uncovered strong biases when considering 12-mers and 20-mers. Hence, m6A-MTase activity might be likely influenced by regional DNA composition, rather than local sequence motifs. Given the rapid growth in the number of methods using m6A-MTases to investigate chromatin, including recent developments of antibody-driven targeting of m6A-MTases to map DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), we underscore the importance of measuring and correcting inherent biases introduced by m6A-MTases preferences.</p><p id="P33">Chromatin accessibility is commonly assessed using ATAC-seq, which is based on short-read sequencing. However, detecting DNA footprints and nucleosome positioning using this technique remains challenging. We demonstrate that SAM-seq is a multipurpose chromatin profiling technique for plants capable of capturing a wide spectrum of chromatin nuances, from subtle, small-scale alterations to large-scale changes. This wide-resolution profiling enabled us to uncover striking variations in accessibility and DNA methylation along the nucleosome surface. In particular, we show that dyads of Arabidopsis centromeric nucleosomes are highly accessible, potentially facilitating the activity of the CG-specific DNA methyltransferase MET1. This atypical accessibility and DNA methylation nucleosome landscape may have important implications in the epigenetic regulation of centromeres and chromosomal segregation. In addition to mapping nucleosomes, the high-resolution of SAM-seq enables the detection of TFBS occupied in vivo. We found that at least one third of putative binding sites for the Arabidopsis TF ABI5 reside within open chromatin and show DNA footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Similar picture was obtained in maize, indicating that SAM-seq can be used to investigate cis-regulatory regions in different plant species.</p><p id="P34">The unique ability of SAM-seq to probe accessibility across single chromatin fibres open the opportunities to test for potential intermolecular variability, which should reflect variability at the cellular level. By comparing the intermolecular m6A entropy between chromatin states, we found that domains carrying antagonistic chromatin marks, the so-called bivalent states, are characterised by high heterogeneity of accessibility. Given that our SAM-seq experiments were performed using above-ground Arabidopsis tissues, the high heterogeneity we observed likely reflects tissue specific regulations of gene activity. Based on our findings, a key priority for the future will be to perform SAM-seq in different tissues and organs to investigate cell type-specific chromatin heterogeneity.</p><p id="P35">Clustering of TEs based on SAM-seq accessibility allowed us to distinguish between highly heterochromatin TEs, TEs located in heterochromatin/euchromatin boundaries between, TEs embedded in euchromatin, and bonafide euchromatic TEs. Remarkably, unlike Arabidopsis where DNA methylation in the three cytosine contexts correlate negatively with accessibility, euchromatic (i.e. accessible) TEs in maize show the highest mCHH levels. Given that maize lacks the mCHH-specific DNA methyltransferase CMT2, our results provide strong evidence supporting that accessible TEs are the preferred targets of RdDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Furthermore, we found that mCHH and accessibility is higher at the edge of these TEs, and this pattern is mirrored by mCG and mCHG. This result suggests that RdDM may establish a transition zone between heterochromatin and euchromatin, preventing the spreading of DNA methylation over genes as well as preventing accidental PolII read-through transcription from nearby genes. In combination, the high-resolution accessibility and DNA methylation landscapes of SAM-seq offers a powerful toolkit to study the interplay between nucleosomes, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation. Its technical simplicity and ability to simultaneously characterise multiple chromatin features, ranging from small-scale changes to chromosomal-scale patterns, enables the investigation of chromatin-based regulations in virtually any plant species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS191299-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Quadrana group for discussions.
