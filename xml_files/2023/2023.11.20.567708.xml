Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the key host immunity components against malignant cells. Thus, they are currently extensively investigated in the field of immunotherapy of cancer. Different approaches have been developed to improve the antitumor activity of NK cells. Nonetheless, tumor microenvironment remains an obstacle to effective NK cell-based therapies. Here, we demonstrated that a cancer-conditioned medium suppresses the anti-tumor activity of NK cells. Further, we found that ammonia, a by-product of cancer cell metabolism, accumulates in the cancer-conditioned medium and tumor microenvironment. We identified that ammonia impairs the cytotoxicity of NK cells as well as the effectiveness of antibody-based and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK-based therapies <italic>in vitro</italic>. Inhibited activity of NK cells was caused by decreased levels of perforin. This effect was dependent on the lysosomotropic features of ammonia and its ability to increase pH in acidic compartments. In consequence, upon contact with ammonia the mature form of perforin was decreased in NK cells leading to their dysfunction. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to its previously described role of promoting tumor growth as a nitrogen source for tumor biomass ammonia could promote tumor escape as an NK cells immune checkpoint.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS191478-f007"/></fig>

Due to their potent cytotoxic activity against malignant cells as well as relatively low sensitivity to inhibitory signals in cancer, they are extensively studied in the field of immunotherapy. Beyond their natural cytotoxic potential, NK cells can kill tumors in a mechanism of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by engagement with monoclonal antibodies, which include clinically available antibodies targeting CD20 (rituximab, RTX), CD38 (daratumumab), and HER2 (trastuzumab)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Additionally, NK cells can be used in adoptive cell therapies as chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR)-NK cells and are a promising alternative to CAR-T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, multiple factors secreted by cancer cells and other types of cells in the tumor microenvironment suppress their activity, including not only protein factors like cytokines but also different metabolites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Dysregulation of cellular metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. For instance, cancer cells rely on glycolysis and glutaminolysis to a much greater extent than healthy cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This dysregulation results in the specific profile of metabolites in the tumor microenvironment (TME) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. While in normal tissues toxic end products of metabolism are excreted, impaired tumor tissue architecture and abnormal vascularization lead to their accumulation in TME. That includes lactate and ammonia which promote tumor growth by serving as energy and nitrogen source, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Recently, ammonia concentrations have been demonstrated to be substantially increased TME where immune cells interact with the cancer cells. Previous studies also revealed that ammonia may regulate immune response by suppressing the activity of macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ammonia has been identified as a driver of T cell exhaustion and a regulator of the development of memory T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, whether ammonia impairs the cytotoxic functions of immune cells, including NK cells, remains unknown.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we demonstrated that a cancer-conditioned medium suppresses the antitumor activity of NK cells. We identified that ammonia accumulates in cancer-conditioned medium and tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) in mice and inhibits the cytotoxic activity of NK cells by decreasing the amount of mature perforin in secretory lysosomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that ammonia plays a role as a metabolic checkpoint for NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cancer-conditioned medium suppresses NK cells</title><p id="P8">To determine the impact of cancer-secreted factors on NK cell activity, we cultured different cell lines for 48 hours to generate a cancer-conditioned medium. Then, natural (spontaneous) cytotoxicity of NK cells was determined by their co-culture with K562 cells in the conditioned or control medium. We found that medium conditioned by various tumor cells such as human lymphoma cell lines (Raji, Daudi, and Ramos cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), human multiple myeloma cell lines (MM.1s, H929, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), breast cancer cell lines (human HCC1806, murine 4T1, E0771, EMT6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) significantly inhibited natural cytotoxicity of NK cells against K562 cells.

Thus, we subsequently determined whether the cancer-conditioned medium affected the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells. For this purpose, we employed lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell line models, expressing CD20 and CD38, respectively, as targets for clinically used antibodies. We found that tumor cells-conditioned medium suppressed RTX- and daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells against CD20<sup>+</sup> Raji cells and CD38<sup>+</sup> Daudi cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Further, to recapitulate natural architecture of solid tumor more reliably, including heterogeneous distribution of oxygen and nutrients differently affecting cell metabolism, we utilized a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture of both murine (4T1) and human (MDA-MB 231, HCC1806) breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and found out that conditioned medium potently inhibited cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To characterize factors responsible for the suppression of NK cells, we fractionated a representative cancer-conditioned medium from Raji cells using ultrafiltration into fractions containing factors smaller than 3 kDa (predominantly low-molecular weight metabolites) and larger molecules (predominantly proteins) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). It revealed that only low molecular-weight fraction of Raji cells-conditioned medium impaired cytotoxicity of NK cells against target cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ammonia accumulates in cancer cell-conditioned medium and TME</title><p id="P11">Based on the literature data that demonstrated the accumulation of ammonia in TME and its inhibitory effects on different populations of immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that it may contribute to the inhibitory effects of low molecular-weight fraction of cancer-conditioned medium on NK cells activity. Indeed, accumulation of ammonia was detected in media conditioned by all checked tumor cell lines including lymphoma (Raji, Ramos, Daudi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), multiple myeloma (MM.1s, RPMI 8226, H929, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, EMT6, E0771 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To determine whether ammonia accumulation also occurs <italic>in vivo,</italic> we isolated tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) that represents TME from different types of tumors in mice and measured ammonia concentration in comparison to subcutaneous fluid (SCF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In these experiments, both immunocompetent BALB/c mice and immunocompromised SCID or NSG mice were used for inoculation of murine and human cell lines, respectively. In both syngeneic and xenograft models, we found that ammonia accumulated in TME in all types of studied tumor models including lymphoma (Raji, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), multiple myeloma (MM.1s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), and breast cancer tumors (EMT6, E0771, 4T1, MCF-7, MDA-MB 231 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2g</xref>). The concentrations of ammonia in TIFs varied between different tumors from 0.5 mM to 5 mM, which remains consistent with the already published data, and were in general even higher than those measured in cancer-conditioned medium <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ammonia suppresses NK cells</title><p id="P13">To determine whether ammonia may indeed regulate the activity of NK cells, we tested the influence of exogenously added ammonia in a range of concentrations corresponding to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in TIF on NK cells. Ammonia did not affect the viability of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), even in long-term settings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Nonetheless, we found that ammonia accumulated within NK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), similarly to what was demonstrated in T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Notably, ammonia inhibited the natural cytotoxicity of NK cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In concentrations observed in most cancer-conditioned media and TIFs (2-3 mM), ammonia substantially suppressed NK cell cytotoxicity, while at higher (4-5 mM) concentrations that were still within a range of <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements it completely inhibited NK cell killing activity. Moreover, the suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity was even more pronounced when NK cells were preincubated with ammonia for up to 48 hours before contact with target cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Using RTX and daratumumab we demonstrated that ammonia suppressed ADCC against Raji (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and Daudi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), reproducing the effects of a cancer-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Moreover, ammonia inhibited trastuzumab-dependent ADCC against breast cancer MCF-7 cells, as assessed by real-time cell analysis (RTCA) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition to the engagement of NK cells by monoclonal antibodies, NK cells can be redirected to the tumor cells by introduction of tumor-targeting chimeric antigen receptors (CAR). Using NK-92 cell line transduced with CD19 (FMC-63 scFv) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab-based) CAR, we found that ammonia suppressed cytotoxicity of NK-92 CAR cells against Raji (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), respectively. Altogether, this data demonstrates that ammonia potently suppresses the antitumor activity of NK cells and NK cell-based therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="P16">To further determine the effects of ammonia on the antitumor activity of NK cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used BALB/c SCID mice characterized by an absence of functional T cells and B cells, that were inoculated subcutaneously with Raji cells. Mice were treated systemically with 10 mg/kg RTX and 50 mM of ammonium chloride was administered intratumorally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Only a trend toward shorter survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>) and a higher tumor volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>) of mice that were injected intratumorally with ammonia and RTX as compared to the RTX-only group was observed and it did not reach statistical significance. When RTX and ammonia were administered for a longer time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>), we observed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). These results motivated us to explore this issue further. According to the previous study, ammonia administered systemically as a bolus of 9 mmol/kg ammonium chloride is rapidly recycled in TME into amino acids by cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We found that after local administration of 50 mM of ammonium chloride directly into tumor masses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), it is rapidly utilized or excreted from TME since no significant changes in the ammonia concentration were detected in the TIFs of ammonia-injected tumors after 0.5 or 4 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Finally, we found that even administration of a supraphysiological dose of ammonium chloride (100 mM) into TME did not change ammonia concentration in the TIFs after as early as 30 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Nonetheless, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> data and <italic>ex vivo</italic> ammonia measurements in TIF isolated from tumor masses, we sought to determine the mechanism of the suppressive effects of ammonia on NK cell activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ammonia decreases the level of perforin in NK cells</title><p id="P17">The process of killing target cells by NK cells consists of several steps, which include NK cell activation, conjugation with a target cell, degranulation, cytokine production, and detachment from target cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We found that ammonia did not affect the surface levels of NK cell activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Moreover, there was no impairment of the formation of conjugates of NK and target cells in the presence of ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). After formation of conjugates, ammonia did not influence the percentage of degranulating NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Unexpectedly, high ammonia concentration increased the percentage of TNF-α- and IFN-γ-expressing NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, we observed delayed detachment of NK cells from target cells in a high ammonia concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These findings suggested that in the presence of ammonia, NK cells are still fully functional to attach to target cells and release the content of secretory lysosomes (degranulate). Nonetheless, they are unable to execute target cell killing which is a signal for the disengagement from target cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we determined the levels of granzyme B and perforin which are two major cytolytic proteins within secretory lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. While the level of granzyme B was unaffected even in high concentrations of ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), we found that the level of perforin in NK cells was significantly decreased by ammonia in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ammonia decreases the amount of mature perforin</title><p id="P18">We further confirmed the decrease of perforin level in NK cells by ammonia using a western blot method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar downregulation of perforin was observed when NK cells were incubated in a cancer-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Notably, ammonia not only decreased intracellular perforin in NK cells but also decreased the total amount of perforin that was secreted by the NK cells in response to cancer cell recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). We observed a similar trend toward decreased extracellular perforin level when NK cells were incubated with target cells in cancer-conditioned media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b-d</xref>). Notably, the downregulation of perforin by low doses of ammonia was reversible since after 16 hours of ammonia washout the amount of perforin reversed back to the control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These findings suggest that the decrease of perforin upon contact with ammonia is a relatively fast process, most probably related to its maturation and/or degradation.</p><p id="P19">Perforin is synthesized as a 70 kDa inactive precursor that undergoes several posttranslational modifications including proteolytic cleavage in an acidic compartment yielding a 60 kDa mature perforin which is stored in the lysosomes until secretion in response to stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Thus, it is possible to distinguish immature and mature perforin based on their molecular size <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, we detected both forms of perforin in primary NK cells using Pf-344 antibody that binds a linear epitope within EGF-like domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Notably, ammonia decreased mature perforin level even in as low concentration as 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Mature perforin completely disappeared in the high (4-5 mM) ammonia concentrations. Further, we confirmed by flow cytometry the reduction of mature perforin amount using δG9 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) that recognizes pH-sensitive motif in granule-associated mature perforin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>). Mature perforin was severely decreased in NK cells by ammonia which was even more pronounced in NK cells primed with IL-2 and IL-15 that potently expressed perforin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The most important stages of perforin maturation in NK cells take part in specific organelles that provide necessary acidic pH, including secretory lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>). Since it was reported that ammonia is a lysosomotropic agent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the decreased amount of perforin may be caused by increased pH in the lysosome. We found that other lysosomotropic agents, including chloroquine, concanamycin, and monesin, exerted similar to ammonia effects on perforin with most pronounced changes in mature perforin detected by a δG9 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). To determine whether changes in acidic compartment mediate effects of ammonia on perforin, we utilize a LysoTracker probe which selectively accumulates in acidic organelles. Indeed, we demonstrated that ammonia decreased acidic compartment in NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Then, we analyzed the CD63 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3, LAMP3) and LAMP1 (CD107a), markers of secretory lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> in NK cells incubated with different doses of ammonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).

Ammonia had no effect on CD63<sup>+</sup> vesicles. It suggests that ammonia selectively upregulates pH in acidic organelles. Collectively, we demonstrated that ammonia decreases mature perforin level and that this effect is related to the changes in the acidic compartment of NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Ammonia inhibits NK cell serial killing</title><p id="P21">Finally, we sought to determine the consequences of ammonia-impaired effector functions of NK cells. Decreased cytotoxicity of NK cells was associated with the increased percentage of NK cells that degranulated more than once (serial degranulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), which may be caused by the lack of signals promoting NK cell detachment and a second attempt to kill the target cell. Ammonia significantly increased the membrane expression of CD56 on both resting and activated by targets NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Moreover, it increased the levels of both Fas (CD95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and FasL (CD178, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>) on NK cells, suggesting a switch to death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p id="P22">To verify whether ammonia inhibits granzyme-dependent killing and leads to a compensatory upregulation of death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity, we used a Hela cell line that expresses two reporters enabling quantification of granzyme B and caspase 8 activity in living cells by fluorescence measuring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This method allows live tracking of target killing by NK cells and distinguishes between perforin/granzyme B-mediated death and death receptor-mediated cell killing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Live cell imaging of control NK cells incubated with reporters-expressing cancer cells revealed that the dominant mechanism of killing by NK cells depends on perforin/granzyme B. However, in the presence of ammonia, this mechanism was severely impaired even in low concentrations of ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Ammonia induced a switch from perforin/granzyme B to death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity as revealed by the increased cleavage of caspase 8 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). Notably, live cell imaging revealed that even in low ammonia concentration NK cells needed significantly more time to kill the target cell. In 2 mM of ammonia, the time from the contact with the target cell to successful killing was prolonged about 10 times, from 27 min for granzyme B and 25.5 min for caspase 8 to 254.5 min and 325.25 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p><p id="P23">An important feature of NK cells is the ability to detach from the target cell followed by binding and killing other cells in a process called serial killing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, this process is largely limited by the availability of lytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To investigate whether ammonia affects serial killing, we tracked the killing sequence of NK cells incubated with cancer cells in individual microwells. We found that ammonia significantly decreased the percentage of serial killers among NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>). Each NK cell was able to kill on average 1.5 target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j</xref>). However, in the presence of ammonia average number of cells killed by one NK cell substantially decreased leading to the profound reduction of the population of NK cells that were serial killers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6k</xref>). In the presence of ammonia most of the NK cell-target cancer cell interactions were unsuccessful and did not lead to the death of target cells. These results revealed that ammonia, by impairing perforin-mediated cell killing, substantially prolongs the time needed for NK cells to kill cancer cells, inhibits serial killing, induces a switch toward death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity, and significantly reduces the effectiveness of cancer cell killing after recognition by NK cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">NK cell-based immunotherapies are currently extensively studied in preclinical and clinical studies as a promising alternative to T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This field currently involves CAR-based therapies, monoclonal antibodies with modified Fc to enhance ADCC as well as bi-specific and tri-specific NK cell-engaging antibodies. Nonetheless, TME remains one of the main obstacles to the effectiveness of NK cell-based therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Here, we identified that microenvironmental ammonia is a metabolic immune checkpoint for NK cells. We demonstrated that the cancer-conditioned medium suppressed the antitumor activity of NK cells. Ammonia accumulated in a conditioned medium and TME reaching ~2-5 mM, which is similar to concentrations reported in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In these concentrations, ammonia inhibited the cytotoxicity of NK cells and decreased total and mature perforin levels leading to NK cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6l</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Recently ammonia arose as an important player in cancer. While systemic hyperammonemia in cancer patients is rather rare and generally does not exceed micromolar concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, ammonia accumulates in TME reaching millimolar concentrations. It is generated during a glutamine breakdown into glutamate by glutaminase (GLS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In cancer, ammonia is recycled and serves as a source of nitrogen to build amino acids promoting the growth of tumor biomass as well as supports autophagy and protects cells from TNF-α-induced cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Conversely, in high concentrations, ammonia suppresses polyamine biosynthesis and inhibits cancer cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Ammonia can be utilized by three enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthase-1 (CPS1), glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) which expression is regulated by oncogenes and growth signaling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Low expression of ammonia-detoxifying CPS1 is associated with worse overall survival of hepatocellular cancer patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. A high ammonia gene expression signature which includes low expression of ammonia-detoxifying enzymes and high expression of ammonia-producing enzymes is associated with decreased survival of patients with gastrointestinal carcinomas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, other types of cells in TME also contribute to the nitrogen metabolism and thus production of ammonia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Furthermore, ammonia promotes cancer progression indirectly by suppressing antitumor immune response. A recent study demonstrated that ammonia inhibits T cell-dependent antitumor immunity and enhances their exhaustion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Gene signature associated with high ammonia was a predictor of worse survival following immune checkpoint inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, ammonia inhibits antigen presentation by macrophages, phagocytosis by neutrophils, and impairs functions of dendritic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated that also NK cells are impaired by ammonia, thus suggesting its wide suppressive effects on immune response.</p><p id="P27">It is well established that cancer cells and tumor-promoting immune cells suppress the antitumor activity of NK cells. Different cytokines including TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10, as well as cancer-associated metabolites, including tryptophan metabolites, lactate, and prostaglandin E2 inhibit NK cell functions at various levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These factors regulate the expression of chemokine receptors, activating and inhibitory receptors, cytokines, and molecules of the lytic granule, granzymes and perforin.</p><p id="P28">Perforin has a primary role in the NK cell-mediated control of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. It is necessary for granule-dependent target cell death since it enables granzyme-induced apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Without perforin, NK cells are unable to perform granzyme B-mediated serial killing and only kill via death receptors which significantly prolongs the time required to kill cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Here, we observed that ammonia significantly impairs the antitumor activity of NK cells by decreasing perforin. Perforin is synthesized as a 70 kDa inactive precursor that is subjected to different modifications to yield a mature 60 kDa active form <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Trafficking of perforin from the endoplasmic reticulum, through Golgi to the lysosomal compartment is accompanied by the proteolytic cleavage and LAMP1/CD107a <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. NK cells with LAMP1 knockdown have impaired perforin recruitment to lytic granules which leads to the inhibition of their cytotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. The activity of mature perforin is regulated by two main factors, pH and calcium ions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, mature perforin is stored in lysosomal granules (secretory lysosomes) whose low pH prevents oligomerization protecting cytotoxic lymphocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In secretory lysosomes, the lytic activity of perforin is prevented by chaperon protein calreticulin and proteoglycans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This association of perforin with granule proteins is pH-dependent and increased pH leads to the dissociation of perforin from the proteoglycans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated that ammonia increases pH in the lysosomes and decreases amount of mature perforin. Previous studies demonstrated that alkalization of acidic compartment impairs perforin maturation by inhibiting proteolytic cleavage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> as well as leads to its inactivation and proteolytic degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. In our study, we observed the rapid disappearance of mature perforin in low concentration of ammonia and decrease of immature perforin upon treatment with 4-5 mM ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). It may suggest that both impairment of perforin maturation and its proteolytic degradation play a role in the effects of ammonia on NK cells.</p><p id="P29">In the presence of ammonia, NK cells compensatory upregulated the expression of death receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). Nonetheless, they still had impaired cytotoxic functions as they needed significantly more time to kill target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>) and the majority of their contacts with target cells did not lead to successful killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that defective killing results in an enhanced cytokine secretion which is caused by failed detachment from target cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed that ammonia increased levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α in NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Such delayed detachment was observed in human NK cells with genetic perforin knockout <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed that ammonia delayed the disengagement of NK cells from their targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Notably, previous studies revealed that ammonia does not affect target cell sensitivity to killing by purified granzyme B and perforin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, further confirming selective impairment of NK cells cytotoxic machinery by ammonia.</p><p id="P30">Importantly, different components of TME including hypoxia, PGE2, lactate, and kynurenines decrease perforin levels in NK cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms of these effects remain unknown. We observed that ammonia even in low concentration potently decreased the amount of mature perforin. It is known that genetic mutations in the perforin gene may result in the aberrant maturation that is observed in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we identified that ammonia decreases the amount of mature perforin by increasing the pH of the acidic compartment which results in a decreased level of total perforin and severely impairs perforin/granzyme B-mediated killing.</p><p id="P31">Ammonia (NH3) is neutral and rapidly passes across biological membranes. In contrast, ammonium ion (NH4<sup>+</sup>) cannot diffuse through membranes and accumulates in acidic organelles, including lysosomes. A recent study identified SLC12A9 as a lysosome-detoxifying ammonium-chloride co-transporter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. However, its expression in immune cells remains unknown. Moreover, while hepatocytes or tumor cells can metabolize ammonia, immune cells like T cells, macrophages, and NK cells lack this feature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>), which may explain its immunosuppressive effects.

However, whether some populations of NK cells possess that feature remains unknown.

It is supported by the fact that the effects of low ammonia concentrations on the level of perforin are fully reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Previous study demonstrated that neutralization of ammonia reduced colorectal cancer tumor growth and enhanced T cell response to immune checkpoint inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (H1399; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Cells were imaged using Opera Phenix live cell microscopy (PerkinElmer). Images were analyzed using Harmony 4.9 Software (PerkinElmer). At least 10 fields were analyzed for each of 4 NK cells donors. For LAMP1 and CD63 analysis, NK cells were incubated with ammonia (ammonium chloride) for 12 hours. Then, cells were rinsed twice for 5 min with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 min at room temperature, followed by a simultaneous permeabilization with 0.1% (w/v) saponin and blocking with 0.2% (w/v) fish gelatin in PBS for 10 min. They were further incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies in 0.01% (w/v) saponin and 0.2% fish gelatin in PBS for 30 min each. The mouse anti-CD63 antibody (mAb, #H5C6) developed by J.T. August/J.E.K. Hildreth was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. Rabbit anti-LAMP1 (L-1418, 1:400) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were: Alexa Fluor 488-, 555-, 647- conjugated anti-mouse-IgG and anti-rabbit-IgG were from ThermoFisher Scientific. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000. Airyscan imaging was performed with a confocal laser scanning microscope ZEISS LSM 800 equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 NA oil objective and an Airyscan detection unit, using Immersol 518 F immersion medium (Zeiss). Detector gain and pixel dwell times were adjusted for each dataset, keeping them at their lowest values to avoid saturation and bleaching effects. ZEN Blue 2.3 (Version 2.3.69.1003) software (Zeiss) was used for image acquisition. The Airyscan processing module with default settings was used to process obtained data. Pictures were assembled in Photoshop (Adobe) with only linear adjustments of contrast and brightness.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P57">Data are shown as means ± SD or means ± SEM, as indicated in the figure legends.
