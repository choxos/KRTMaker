rhythms across the body. The SCN clockwork is a self-sustaining transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) that in turn co-ordinates the expression of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) directing circadian programmes of SCN cellular activity. In the mouse, the transcription factor, ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox-3), is necessary for the development of the SCN and influences circadian behaviour in the adult. The molecular mechanisms by which ZFHX3 affects the SCN at transcriptomic and genomic levels are, however, poorly defined. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the genomic localization of ZFHX3 binding sites in SCN chromatin. To test for function, we then conducted comprehensive RNA sequencing at six distinct times-of-day to compare the SCN transcriptional profiles of control and ZFHX3-conditional null mutants. We show that the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 occurs predominantly around gene transcription start sites (TSS), co-localizing with known histone modifications, and preferentially partnering with clock transcription factors (CLOCK, BMAL1) to regulate clock gene(s) transcription. Correspondingly, we show that the conditional loss of ZFHX3 in the adult has a dramatic effect on the SCN transcriptome, including changes in the levels of transcripts encoding elements of numerous neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems while attenuating the daily oscillation of the clock TF <italic>Bmal1</italic>. Furthermore, various TTFL genes and CCGs exhibited altered circadian expression profiles, consistent with an advanced in daily behavioural rhythms under 12h light- 12h dark conditions. Together, these findings reveal the extensive genome-wide regulation mediated by ZFHX3 in the central clock that orchestrates daily timekeeping in mammals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Circadian (approximately one day) clocks are internal biological time-keepers co-ordinating coherent 24-h molecular, behavioural and physiological rhythms that are synchronized with changing environmental conditions across day and night. In mammals, the circadian clock mechanism consists of cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that drive rhythmic, ~24-h expression patterns of canonical clock components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>). The primary TTFL involves rhythmic transcription of period (<italic>Per1, Per2</italic>, and <italic>Per3</italic>) and cryptochrome genes (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>). Thereafter, PER and CRY proteins form heterodimers that act on the dimeric complex of CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-Like 1) to repress their own transcription, which is mediated by E-box (<italic>CACGTG</italic>) cis-regulatory sequences at their gene promoters. A secondary feedback loop is driven by <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> (<italic>Nr1d1</italic>), which is also directly transcribed through binding of CLOCK:BMAL1 at E-boxes. REV-ERBA feeds back to repress <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription by competing with a retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) activator to bind ROR response elements (RREs) in the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter. Along with this, CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers also trans-activate a series of clock-controlled gene (CCGs), many of which encode transcription factors (TFs) that regulate additional downstream programmes of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hogenesch et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P3">At an organismal level, mammalian circadian rhythms are directed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which synchronizes robust 24-h oscillations across peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Schibler et al., 2015</xref>). In the SCN, the cell-autonomous TTFL molecular clocks in individual cells are synchronized through intercellular coupling to form a coherent oscillatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Maywood et al., 2021</xref>). This intercellular coupling is maintained through several neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brown et al., 2005</xref>), while Prokinetin2 (PROK2) serves as a pace-making element in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Morris et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, zinc finger homeobox-3, ZFHX3, is a key transcription factor in the SCN. It is highly expressed in discrete populations of adult SCN cells and exerts robust control over circadian behavioural rhythms. Intriguingly, while a dominant missense mutation in <italic>Zfhx3</italic> (short circuit, <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup><italic>Sci/+</italic></sup>) results in a short circadian period in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>), a conditional null <italic>Zfhx3</italic> mutation results in more severe behaviour with short circadian period and arrhythmic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Given the crucial role of the SCN in orchestrating daily timekeeping in mammals, it is imperative to understand the role of ZFHX3 in regulating the molecular circadian clock, but although the effects of mutations in <italic>Zfhx3</italic> are known at the level of circadian behaviour, its molecular functions that underpin daily timekeeping are not well-characterized. Therefore, we set out to assess systematically the function of ZFHX3 by employing a multi-omics approach in the SCN. First, we analysed the genomic binding pattern of ZFHX3 by conducting ZFHX3 targeted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of SCN tissue to identify the genomic scope of ZFHX3 and its potential mechanistic roles. Second, we implemented a detailed transcriptional profiling of the SCN in control and <italic>Zfhx3</italic> conditional null mutants, using vibratome based microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bafna, Lau, et al., 2023</xref>). This allowed us to map the effect of ZFHX3 on tissue-specific expression of both rhythmic and non-rhythmic genes.</p><p id="P5">Overall, we have defined genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 in the SCN, showing that it is found predominantly around actively transcribed genes and is accompanied by modified histones and other SCN TFs. We noted that conditional (adult) deletion of ZFHX3 drastically modifies the SCN transcriptome by affecting genes important for circadian timekeeping, neuropeptide signalling and synaptic processes. An in-depth investigation on time-of-day dependent gene expression clearly highlighted loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> rhythmic transcription along with aberrant 24-h oscillations for TTFL and non-TTFL genes. This change in rhythmic clock gene transcriptional profiles contributed towards a phase-advanced internal central clock mirroring the advance seen in the daily behavioural activity patterns of the null mutant mice. These findings reveal a pivotal and genome-wide physiological role for ZFHX3 in the maintenance of robust circadian timekeeping in the SCN and identify molecular substrates that underpin this role.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ZFHX3 <italic>binds to active promoter sites in the SCN</italic></title><p id="P6">Genome-wide binding of ZFHX3 was profiled in the SCN using ChIP-seq. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from C57BL/6J mice raised in standard 12-h/12-h light-dark conditions at two distinct time-points; <italic>zeitgeber</italic> time (ZT) 03 (3 hours after lights on) and ZT15, and subjected to ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). The sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome and significant sites of ZFHX3 occupancy were assessed in the context of previously identified modified histone binding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bafna, Banks, et al., 2023</xref>) in the SCN. We found a total of 43,236 ZFHX3-bound sites, overlapping with approximately 22% of total modified histone regions in the SCN genome. About 60% of the ZFHX3 bound sites were found near promoters (&lt;= 3 Kb of TSS) and so would be likely to identify direct transcriptional targets of ZFHX3, whilst ca. 21% were in distal intergenic regions potentially involved in other modes of gene regulation.</p><p id="P7">When assessed in relation to modified histone binding, ZFHX3 sites fell into four categories. First, the majority of ZFHX3 peaks coincided with both H3K4me3 (trimethylation of Histone H3 at Lysine 4) and H3K27ac (Histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) occupancy (48.9% of total ZFHX3 peaks at ZT3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and were focussed near transcription start sites (TSS α 3kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since such sites are likely responsible for active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Beacon et al., 2021</xref>), the ZFHX3 occupancy in these sites highlighted probable transcriptional regulation by ZFHX3 in the SCN. Next, a subset of ZFHX3 sites (20.7%) were bound only by H3K4me3 (no H3K27ac) as illustrated at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>. These are indicative of poised transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Calo &amp; Wysocka, 2013</xref>) and were also enriched near the TSS. About 8.2 % of ZFHX3 sites were bound by H3K27ac exclusively (no H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These sites were commonly found at intergenic and intronic regions and suggestive of enhancer-mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Won et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, 22% of ZFHX3 sites were found to be devoid of modified histone binding and were also concentrated at distal intergenic regions (39.04%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Overall, the broad occurrence of ZFHX3 alongside histone modifiers near the gene TSS and at distal intergenic regions in the SCN genome suggests its crucial role in gene regulation potentially via promoter-enhancer interaction.</p><p id="P8">Next, we assigned each ZFHX3 site to its closest transcribed gene (α 3Kb) and performed functional annotation upon these genes. The functional annotation of genes which were associated with ZFHX3 and both the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications were found to be associated with neurodegeneration and axonal guidance, synaptic processes known to be important in the SCN (glutamatergic, GABAeric and dopaminergic systems) and various signalling pathways. Importantly, they also included pathways involved with circadian entrainment and timekeeping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>), highlighting the reciprocal intersection between ZFHX3 and the SCN cell-autonomous clock. In contrast, genomic regions co-operatively bound by ZFHX3 and H3K4me3 but with no H3K27ac, or sites with ZFHX3 alone, were found to be associated with genes involved in several fundamental biological processes such as DNA replication or MAPK signalling, but notably not circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B, C</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that ZFHX3 binds at the TSS and regulates actively transcribing genes, particularly those involved in tissue-specific functions such as daily timekeeping, while its occupancy without histone modifiers and/or at poised state regulates genes responsible for other basal functions. Interestingly, it is worth noting that ZFHX3 occupancy did not differ appreciably between the two time-points tested (ZT03 vs. ZT15): ZFHX3was seen to bind consistently at the same genomic loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This indicates that other factors/ mechanisms confer temporal control to these sites whilst the presence of ZFHX3 is permissive to such cis- and trans-regulatory cues.</p><p id="P9">We next examined the signature DNA binding motifs/ cis-regulatory elements occupied by ZFHX3, either alone or with specific histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac). As anticipated, this revealed an over-representation of AT-rich motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>),. Notably, it also suggested co-occurrence of ZFHX3 with SCN developmental and maintenance TFs such as DLX (distal-less homeobox) and LHX (LIM homeobox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">VanDunk et al., 2011</xref>) across the tested categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, ZFHX3-bound sites were also enriched for non-AT-rich motifs such as the RFX family of TFs, which have been implicated in transcriptional responses to light in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we noted enrichment of ARNT (bHLH) domains but only where ZFHX3 peaks were seen adjacent to H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (i.e., active promoters). This clearly points towards the possibility of shared binding of ZFHX3 with the circadian clock TFs BMAL1:CLOCK at E-boxes and highlights a point of interaction between the core TTFL and ZFHX3 in the regulation of circadian gene transcription in the central pacemaker.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Zfhx3</italic> knock-out affects circadian behaviour and entrainment of mice</title><p id="P10">To explore the contribution of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> to SCN function in the adult animal, we compared circadian wheel-running in cohorts of <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC- mice that had been dosed with tamoxifen (gene deletion, +Tamoxifen group) with mice that had not been dosed with tamoxifen (no deletion genetic control, -Tamoxifen group). Comparisons of gene expression between the –Tamoxifen and +Tamoxifen groups by real time PCR confirmed loss of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> expression in the +Tamoxifen group. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). Behavioural analysis was performed in conditions of constant darkness and in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Consistent with previous studies, this analysis showed that the free-running circadian period was significantly shortened by conditional deletion of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the overall activity rhythm was less well defined with significantly reduced amplitude, increased intra-daily variability and lower inter-daily stability in the deleted mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B, C, D</xref>). The full analysis is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. The loss of ZFHX3 therefore compromised free-running circadian behaviour.</p><p id="P11">Visual inspection of the actograms whilst the animals were in light/dark cycles suggested that animals with gene deletion showed poor entrainment to the light cycle, with animals showing increased activity in the hours prior to the light to dark transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, right). To quantify this, we analysed the distribution of wheel running activity across 24-h, by expressing wheel running activity within each 30 minute segment of the day as a proportion of the total daily wheel running activity for that animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>). Repeated Measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant interaction between tamoxifen dosing and time of day (tamoxifen dosing x time: F (47, 1316) = 9.013; p= &lt;0.0001). Pairwise analysis demonstrated that, compared to genetic control animals, gene deleted animals showed a significant increase in wheel running activity in the hours prior to lights off (p= &lt;0.05 for ZT 10.5-12.5) and a significant reduction in wheel running activity in the hours prior to lights on (p= &lt;0.05 for ZT 20 -23). Consistent with this, analysis of the activity onset demonstrated that gene deleted animals showed an earlier onset of activity than controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2E</xref>). This phase advance under 12 h L/12 h D is consistent with the shortening of circadian period seen under DD. Thus, ZFHX3 contributes to circadian time-keeping and entrainment in the adult SCN, independently of any developmental roles.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ZFHX3 <italic>knock-out (KO) results in extensive effects across the SCN transcriptome</italic></title><p id="P12">Having mapped the genomic binding sites of ZFHX3 and validated the behavioural effects of deletion of ZFHX3, we then employed total directional RNA sequencing to define the impact of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> deletion on the SCN transcriptome. Adult SCN tissues were collected from tamoxifen-treated <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC-Cre<sup>−</sup> (Cre-neg) and <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice that were not treated with tamoxifen (-Tamoxifen, genetic control), both serving as independent control groups, and tamoxifen treated <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC-Cre<sup>+</sup> (+Tamoxifen) mice i.e., <italic>Zfhx3</italic>-deleted, at six distinct times of light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). As an initial analysis we compared overall (i.e., time-independent) gene expression levels between the groups (Cre-neg vs. +Tamoxifen) to examine the global effect of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> deletion on the SCN transcriptome, and found that almost 36% (n = 5,637) of total assessed genes were affected by the acute loss of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> in the SCN. Of these, 2,725 were down-regulated and 2,912 up-regulated in +Tamoxifen animals compared to Cre-neg controls. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, as expected, both the control groups (Cre-neg and -Tamoxifen) showed consistent differential gene expression levels when compared to the mutant which mitigated any potential downstream effect of tamoxifen dosing <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To better understand the relationship between ZFHX3 occupancy on the genome and changes in gene expression, we compared the results of our initial CHIP-Seq with the RNA-Seq described above. Of the total differentially expressed genes, 80% (n = 4,543) revealed ZFHX3 occupancy at their promoter sites along with histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), showing a direct interaction between ZFHX3 bound TSS (α 3Kb) and gene expression (p = 0, odds ratio = 6.3, Jaccard index = 0.4, signifying strong association). In contrast, only 7% of differentially expressed genes (n = 381) were solely bound by ZFHX3 at the TSS (p = 0.37, odds ratio = 1, Jaccard Index = 0.1, signifying weak association), indicating the effect of ZFHX3 on gene transcription is predominantly observed when jointly occupied by histone modification at gene TSS.</p><p id="P14">We then sub-selected highly differential genes (log<sub>2</sub>FC ≥1, FDR ≤ 0.05) and conducted functional gene enrichment analysis. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wilcox et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>), genes that were downregulated were seen to be associated with neuropeptide signalling pathways (<italic>Vip, Grp</italic>), circadian rhythm, neuron differentiation etc., while those that were upregulated showed functional enrichment for cell differentiation and extracellular matrix organization processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Interestingly, our comprehensive assessment also highlighted an effect of loss of ZFHX3 on signal transduction by affecting cholinergic receptor (<italic>Chrna3, Chrnb4</italic>), melatonin receptor (<italic>Mtnr1a</italic>), prokineticin receptor (<italic>Prokr2</italic>), GRP receptor (<italic>Grpr</italic>), and the SCN peptide <italic>Nmu</italic>. Therefore, it is likely that loss of ZFHX3 leads to physiological impairment by affecting a diversity of neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems in the SCN and more generally, circadian-relevant transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loss of Zfhx3 affects rhythmic transcription of TTFL and clock-controlled genes</title><p id="P15">The present and recent studies have demonstrated severe disturbances of daily and circadian behaviour in mice carrying a missense mutation (<italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup><italic>Sci</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>) or knock-out (<italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC-Cre<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>) of ZFHX3. In addition to assessing general gene up- or down-regulation in mutants (above), we next wanted to assess how deletion of ZFHX3 might alter transcriptional rhythms. For this, we investigated gene expression levels in the SCN at six distinct times-of-day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>), starting at ZT02, at 4-h intervals (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). In total, we analysed the daily transcriptional profile of 20,521 genes in the SCN and compared the rhythmicity index between the control (Cre-neg) and mutant (+Tamoxifen) groups using statistical framework <italic>dryR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Weger et al., 2021</xref>). This enabled us to categorise the genes into one of 5 distinct modules (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>): Module 1 refers to genes with no detected 24-h rhythm in their expression levels in either condition (n = 16832, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>); Module 2 consists of genes that were rhythmic in control SCN but lost rhythmicity in the ZFHX3-KO (n =1566, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>); Module 3 consists of genes that gained daily rhythmicity after ZFHX3-KO (n = 403, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>); Module 4 was composed of rhythmic genes that exhibited no change between control and mutants (n = 1653, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>); Module 5 included genes that retained rhythmic expression but with a change in either amplitude or phase (peak expression) in the mutant group (n = 67) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Thus, we noted ~82% of compared genes did not show a daily rhythm (module 1). Conversely, ~18% of gene expressed in the SCN exhibited daily rhythmicity under one or other condition. Of these, ~45% were not affected by loss of ZFHX3, whereas ~55% of rhythmic transcripts showed alteration in their daily pattern following loss of ZFHX3. Indeed, ~42% of rhythmic genes required ZFHX3 to maintain that rhythm, whereas ~2% of genes (403/20521) gained rhythmicity in the absence of ZFHX3. Thus, ZFHX3 contributes, directly or indirectly, to a significant part of the daily rhythmic transcriptome of the SCN.</p><p id="P17">For each module, we compiled the gene list and examined the functional enrichment pathways. The genes that lost rhythmic transcription after the deletion of ZFHX3 (module 2) were seen to be involved in intracellular protein transport, signal transduction such as WNT-pathway linking circadian and cell-cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Matsu-Ura et al., 2018</xref>), oxidative stress response etc. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). On the contrary, genes that gain rhythmicity (module 3) were associated with RNA processing, stress and metabolic pathways. The genes that did not show any change in rhythmic expression (module 4) were found to be enriched for functional processes such as protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, cytoskeleton organization, DNA repair etc. Interestingly, only a tiny proportion (~1.8%) of the rhythmic genes showed substantial changes in their daily cyclic gene expression profiles (phase and amplitude, module 5), but these were primarily involved in circadian rhythm generation, entrainment and clock-controlled gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggests that in the absence of ZFHX3 the core circadian mechanism of the SCN is disrupted but is not ablated.</p><p id="P18">Indeed, almost all the genes driving the cell-autonomous TTFL were severely affected by <italic>Zfhx3</italic> perturbation with <italic>Bmal1</italic> demonstrating a complete loss of 24-h rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), and its counterpart <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA showing overall reduced expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). PER family genes (<italic>Per1-3</italic>) showed a significant advancement in peak expression with low amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Specifically, we observed a phase advance of ca. 2-h for <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic>, with <italic>Per1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kuhlman et al., 2003</xref>) which is also known to mediate light-responsive pathways, advancing by only ~0.3-h. Strikingly, there was no obvious change in the rhythmic levels or phase for CRY family genes (<italic>Cry1, 2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that ZFHX3 acts only on select genes driving the cell-autonomous clock in the SCN.

Clock-controlled genes are basically genes whose expression is regulated by circadian clock factors (such as CLOCK:BMAL1) that are directly associated with the TTFL. Several CCGs like DBP (D site albumin promoter binding protein) show rhythmic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lopez-Molina et al., 1997</xref>), and in turn control expression of a repertoire of genes, generating a cascade of 24-h cycling genes in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). In our mutant group, <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA levels also presented an advanced peak (~1.66 h) with reduced amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Another such TF- <italic>Creb3l1</italic> (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 1), that has been implicated in intercellular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bedont et al., 2017</xref>), showed a distinctive change in phase and amplitude. Therefore, the alteration seen in the rhythmicity index at the level of TTFL genes due to the loss of ZFHX3 was recapitulated in the diurnal expression of certain CCGs in the SCN.</p><p id="P20">Finally, we studied the effect of ZFHX3 deletion on the rhythmic pattern of intercellular coupling agents (neuropeptides), whose overall mean expression levels were significantly reduced (Fig.3, <italic>Vip, Grp</italic>). Along with lowered baseline expression, we noted severe loss in 24-h rhythm for crucial SCN neuropeptides such as <italic>Avp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), <italic>Prok2</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). For <italic>Avp</italic>, there was no apparent increase in daytime mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arima et al., 2002</xref>), and the levels remained intermediate throughout the day. Conversely, for both <italic>Prok2</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic>, transcript levels were reduced to minimal levels, possibly resulting in compromised intercellular-coupling in the SCN.</p><p id="P21">The effects of ZFHX3 on daily transcriptional profiles therefore varied between different gene categories. Whereas rhythmicity of downstream, clock-controlled genes was either independent of ZFHX3 or required ZFHX3 to be sustained, core circadian function was sustained but with altered dynamics. Intriguingly, this systematic approach not only highlighted the genes that lost 24-h rhythmic oscillations, such as <italic>Bmal1</italic> and the neuropeptide <italic>Avp</italic> (module 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), but also identified genes that retained rhythmicity with changes in their waveform (module 5). Given the fact that ZFHX3 deficient mice do not lose rhythmic behaviour in a daily LD cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), but do exhibit a short circadian period or arrhythmicity in free-running (complete darkness: DD) conditions, we believe our targeted SCN-specific assessment unravels the vital role of ZFHX3 in the mechanistic regulation of the daily molecular clock.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The state of the daily SCN clock in ZFHX3 deficient mice</title><p id="P22">In order to link the perturbations of the core molecular clock in the SCN of ZFHX3 deficient mice with their altered behavioural profiles, we used TimeTeller, a recently established method to predict circadian clock phase alongside the parameter ‘Theta’ which provides an index of clock disruption from transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Vlachou et al., 2024</xref>). This approach allows one to assess the clock globally as a system instead of gene by gene. For this, an initial training model was built using the available Cre-neg and -Tamoxifen (n = 35, control) mice data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Cross-validation for the training model suggested that the model is informative and predicts the control SCN time well with a median prediction error of -0.08 hours (95% CI: -0.83;1.33) and 0.50 hours (95% CI: -1.67;3.00), i.e., the difference between the TimeTeller predicted time and the known ZT of SCN collection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). This was further assessed by predicting SCN timing in an independent dataset of SCN RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deota et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to the TimeTeller predictions for the control group, median prediction error was 0.00 hours (95% CI: -2.00;1.33) for the <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed and -0.66 hours (95% CI: -1.83;1.00) for the temporary night-time restricted feeding groups. These are not distinguishable from the control SCN in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Similarly, the clock disruption parameter theta is low (Medians: 0.03, 0.03 and 0.04) as is expected for a fully functional and well predictable circadian clock in all three control groups. Furthermore, TT clock functionality parameter theta suggests that +Tamoxifen SCN have a similarly functional daily clock compared to the control SCN (Median 0.04 vs. 0.03 in controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">While TT’s theta metric suggests the clock in the ZFHX3-deleted SCN is not disrupted as it is indistinguishable from controls, the phase of the +Tamoxifen SCN was consistently advanced by a median 1.83 hours (95.0% CI 0.585, 2.67), when compared to the current controls and the published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deota et al., 2023</xref>) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6B</xref>. Of note, detecting this ~2-h phase difference from data sampled at 4-h intervals showcases the advantages in robustness and sensitivity of assessing the clock as a system rather than by a gene-by-gene approach, and TimeTeller as a tool of inquiry. In summary, according to TimeTeller, the SCN daily clock is intact but advanced by approximately 2 h in comparison to the control groups after loss of ZFHX3. This is consistent with the observed daily behavioural activity in mutant mice as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">The SCN is distinctive in its ability to sustain autonomous rhythmicity which is driven by circadian cascades of transcription that direct metabolic, electrophysiological and signalling rhythms. Our current findings highlight the instrumental role of the transcription factor, ZFHX3, in driving the daily timekeeping mechanism. By comparing the daily behavioural activity of ZFHX3-KO mice with the genetic matched control, we clearly noted an advancement in LD activity and shortening of circadian period in mutants. This finding is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wilcox et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>) and prompted a detailed molecular investigation in the SCN. Through targeted ChIP-seq we successfully demonstrated the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 in SCN chromatin with 78% of ZFHX3 bound sites found to be co-localized with modified histones (H3K4me3, H3K27ac), and a vast majority of these concentrated near gene TSS. This provides strong evidence in support of the observed pervasive regulation conferred by ZFHX3 on the SCN transcriptome. That said, a considerable proportion of ZFHX3 sites were also seen devoid of joint histone modifications (H3K4me3 + H3K27ac) and enriched for CTCF binding sites. CTCF is a ubiquitous DNA binding protein that has exceptional roles in genomic organization, chromatin looping and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holwerda &amp; de Laat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mach et al., 2022</xref>). This co-occurrence hints on the potential accessory role of ZFHX3 in modifying genome topology and chromosomal looping to bring about changes in target gene expression by regulating promoter-enhancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pugacheva et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, along with CTCF binding sites, ZFHX3 sites were also enriched for other SCN enriched regulatory factors; RFX, LHX, ZIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hatori et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 1D</xref>), suggesting well-coordinated tissue-specific gene regulation.</p><p id="P25">Given the crucial role of ZFHX3 in daily timekeeping, we speculated a dynamic change in its genomic occupancy and compared the binding intensity of the transcription factor at two anti-phasic (12-h apart, ZT3 vs. ZT15) time-points (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not detect any differential binding site(s) between the tested time-points, but rather noticed a uniform and coherent localization. This suggests that ZFHX3 belongs to a family of poised transcription factors, whose occupancy at regulatory sites does not change during the day, but could potentially act as a co-activator/mediator to modulate oscillating gene transcription. Indeed, in a recent unpublished study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Del Rocío Pérez Baca et al., 2023</xref>), ZFHX3 was shown to be associated with chromatin remodelling and mRNA processing factors, strengthening the viewpoint as a co-regulator. It is, therefore, highly plausible that ZFHX3 occupies the targeted TSS and partners with clock TFs such as BMAL1 <italic>(CACGTG)</italic>, as observed around active sites, to regulate rhythmic gene transcription.</p><p id="P26">Along with ChIP-seq, we executed detailed RNA sequencing to study the effect of loss of ZFHX3 specifically in the SCN. Crucially, ZFHX3 affected almost a third of the transcriptome in the SCN. An overall (time-independent) assessment of deletion of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> highlighted a significant impact on expression of genes involved in several biological processes ranging from cellular differentiation to behavioural responses. We then performed a comprehensive time-dependent assessment to delineate the functional role of ZFHX3 in regulating the circadian timekeeping mechanism. We observed about 55% of rhythmic genes showed alteration at distinct levels in their daily transcriptional pattern following loss of ZFHX3.</p><p id="P27">At the TTFL level, ZFHX3-KO resulted in the loss of rhythmic <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene expression. It remains to be determined whether this is associated with changes at the posttranslational level, given the findings by Abe et al where arrhythmic <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcript did possess posttranslational rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abe et al., 2022</xref>), and could explain the subsequent 24-h driven <italic>Per (1-3)</italic> and <italic>Cry (1-2)</italic> mRNA rhythms noted in our study. Likewise, in a separate study constitutive <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression has been shown to sustain rhythmic levels of transcriptional and translational products of <italic>Per, Cry, Clock, RORc</italic>, and <italic>Rev-erb</italic>α by means of mathematic modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mirsky et al., 2009</xref>). Arguably, clear circadian rhythmicity in BMAL1, CLOCK, or REV-ERBα protein levels were not sustained in association with constitutive <italic>Bmal1</italic> levels under <italic>in-vitro</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Padlom et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in future it will be interesting to study the daily abundance of protein levels of the clock genes in <italic>Zfhx3</italic>-deficient SCN, with its associated loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA 24-h rhythm, to gain a complete understanding of the clock molecular circuitry.</p><p id="P28">Broadly speaking, aside from <italic>Bmal1</italic>, the majority of clock genes did not lose 24-h rhythmicity but showed an early peak in expression, ranging between ~0.4 – 2-h that perfectly resonates with the advanced rhythmic behaviour seen in mutants. In this case, it is difficult to delineate a straightforward cause-and-effect axis in terms of the direct targets of the perturbed ZFHX3 activity. Based on the current data, ZFHX3 is possibly partnering with CLOCK:BMAL1 to regulate the daily transcription of clock genes (<italic>Per, Ror, Reverb)</italic> and CCGs. Two possible scenarios could explain the noted effect on the TTFL genes due to lack of ZFHX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). First, ZFHX3 preferentially controls <italic>Per</italic> family gene transcription (and not <italic>Cry</italic>) by binding at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Loss of ZFHX3 affects the daily rhythm of <italic>Per</italic> gene transcription, and potentially PER protein levels, which in turn disturbs the CLOCK:BMAL1 driven transcription cascades. This leads to an aberrant daily transcriptional profile of the <italic>Ror</italic> (activator)/ <italic>Reverb</italic> (repressor) genes as observed, which are known to control the amplitude and oscillation of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), and further results in loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcriptional rhythm. Therefore, the observed change in <italic>Ror</italic> and <italic>Reverb</italic> family gene expression levels could be reminiscent of the effect of ZFHX3 on the TTFL. In a second scenario, the constitutive expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA could result from the primary effect of ZFHX3 on CLOCK:BMAL1 driven <italic>Ror/Reverb</italic> genes (affecting ROR/REVERB translational products), which does not disrupt the TTFL, but weakens the daily clock. The direct /indirect effect is seen in the cyclic expression of <italic>Per</italic> family genes, with relatively greater phase change in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic> than the <italic>Per1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kuhlman et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary fig. 6</xref>). It is, however, noteworthy that the CRY family of genes <italic>(Cry1, Cry2)</italic> did not show any obvious change in the daily expression and is supposedly shielding the molecular clock, as recently postulated by Abe et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abe et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P29">As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>), lack of ZFHX3 also resulted in severe reduction in the SCN neuropeptides such as <italic>Avp, Vip, Grp, Prok2</italic>, that potentially compromises intercellular coupling and synchronization of circadian timekeeping. This universal effect, where loss of ZFHX3 does not deter a particular but all the key SCN neuropeptides, clearly points that 1) ZFHX3 is prevalent in almost all neuronal populations within the SCN, that are largely clustered based on their neuropeptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Morris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) 2) potentially results in loosely coupled intercellular clocks that are still able to drive 24-h behavioural and molecular rhythms but with advanced phase. The prevalence of ZFHX3 in neuronal populations is also supported by a complete independent assessment in which almost 60% of the top 100 categorised neuronal genes in the SCN (as per single-cell atlas) were seen to be affected by ZFHX3 deletion based on the current dataset. In contrast, only 20% of the 100 most expressed genes in the astrocytic cell populations were impacted.</p><p id="P30">Along with this, lack of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> also leads to aberrant daily transcriptional rhythms of several CCGs, with the majority of them seen to lose daily oscillations. This could potentially result in hindrance of clock-regulated vital biological processes such as regulation of cell-cycle, metabolic pathways etc. Indeed, ZFHX3 is reported to be crucial for the development of a functional SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wilcox et al., 2021</xref>), and could act as an ‘integrator’ of afferent signals such as light and feeding to generate timely and robust physiological outputs. Moreover, genetic ablation of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> has been shown to result in a compromised light sensing mechanism in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>), while the missense mutation (<italic>Zfxh3</italic><sup><italic>Sci/+</italic></sup>) results in reduced growth and altered metabolic gene expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nolan et al., 2023</xref>) converging on its functional roles in other brain regions. The pleiotropic roles of ZFHX3 further extend in non-brain tissues with its recently described crucial involvement in angiogenesis for tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fu et al., 2020</xref>), cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jameson et al., 2023</xref>) and spinocerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Figueroa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wallenius et al., 2024</xref>). It is important to note that although in the present study we used adult-specific <italic>Zfhx3</italic> null mutants resulting in global loss of ZFHX3, the circadian effects observed both at molecular and behavioural levels are independent of its pleiotropic role(s) in other tissues. In future, however, it will be beneficial to carry out the investigation using an inducible, SCN specific genetically ablated model to circumvent any confounding effects. Regardless, the current research is of great importance as it not only maps the genomic binding of ZFHX3, but also demonstrates its critical association with both lineage- and clock-controlling TFs that perfectly resonates with the observed profound effects of ZFHX3 on the SCN transcriptome, regulating a vast majority of genes ranging from circadian timing to synaptic transmission and inflammatory responses. This highlights how ZFHX3 regulates the core-clock (TTFL) in addition to its control over CCGs in order to drive sustained transcriptional rhythms in the SCN. Given the extensive pleiotropy of ZFHX3, it provides a solid substrate to further understand the functional interaction of ZFHX3 in distinct tissues indispensable for overall health and fitness.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice</title><p id="P31">All animal studies were performed under the guidance issued by Medical Research Council in Responsibility in the Use of Animals for Medical Research (July1993) and Home Office Project Licence 19/0004.

Paired-end FASTQ files were quality assessed (Phred&lt;20 removed) with FastQC and Illumina adapters were trimmed with TrimGalore (v0.4.3). Then, the reads were aligned to mm10 genome assembly using STAR (v2.7.8a) with MAPQ value for unique mappers set to 60. Binary alignment map (BAM) files were used to generate read counts per gene by FeatureCounts via Samtools (v1.11). Finally, limma-voom method (Liu et al. 2015) from the Bioconductor package-limma (v3.48.0) was adopted to quantify differential gene expression and normalised logarithmic CPM (counts per million) values were generated for downstream analysis. Genes without more than 0.5 CPM in at least 2 samples are insignificant and filtered out. 8582 of 24421 (35.14%) genes were filtered out for low expression.

The Fisher’s exact test also gives an odds ratio which represents the strength of association. If an odds ratio is equal to or less than 1, there is no association between the two lists. If the odds ratio is much larger than 1, then the association is strong. The class also calculates the Jaccard index which measures the similarity between two lists.
