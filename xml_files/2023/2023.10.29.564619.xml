We hypothesized that AD pathology in the hippocampus may influence dopaminergic neurotransmission even in the absence of AD-related lesion in the mesostriatal circuit. We thus chemogenetically manipulated the activity of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in wild-type and hemizygous TgF344-AD (Tg) rats, an animal model of AD pathology. We assessed the brain-wide functional output of this manipulation using <italic>in vivo</italic> Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography to measure cerebral blood flow and D2/3 receptor binding. We also assessed the effects of the chemogenetic manipulations on astrocytic and microglial capacity to surround and phagocytize Aβ both locally and in the striatum. Our results show that acute and chronic neuronal and astrocytic stimulation induces widespread effects on the brain regional activation pattern, notably with an inhibition of striatal activation. In the TgF344-AD rats, both these effects were blunted. Chemogenetic stimulation in the hippocampus increased microglial density and its capacity to limit AD pathology, whereas these effects were absent in the striatum perhaps as a consequence of the altered connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum. Our work suggests that hippocampal AD pathology may alter mesostriatal signalling and induce widespread alterations of brain activity. Neuronal and astrocytic activation may induce a protective, Aβ-limiting phenotype of microglia, which surrounds Aβ plaques and limits Aβ concentration more efficiently.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline and functional disability. AD neuropathology involves the extracellular accumulation of insoluble forms of β amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of a hyperphosphorylated form of Tau protein forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). A third neuropathological hallmark in AD consists in “neuroinflammation” which describes phenotypic and functional alterations in glial cells, notably astrocytes and microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>APOE</italic>, the most important genetic risk factor for AD is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, which are activated early in the disease process and may phagocytize Aβ plaques. Astrocyte function and dysfunction are intimately related to microglial states in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and some studies suggest that astrocytes may show signs of activation even before microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Microglial cells also have a major role in the disease pathophysiology phagocytizing Aβ thus limit the lesion burden in the brain. In addition, multiple gene associated with the genetic risk for AD are predominantly expressed in microglia, whereas. Overall, glial cells are important targets for the understanding of AD and its manifestations and for the development of therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="P3">AD is also associated to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, a clinical entity that includes multiple syndromes, some of which, such as psychosis, have been associated to dopaminergic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, these symptoms may also appear early in the disease process, even before the emergence of overt cognitive symptoms. Dopaminergic circuitry dysfunction has been shown in AD though clinical neuroimaging studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, whereas AD animal model studies also indicate a dopaminergic dysfunction, even at early stages of the pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The occurrence of dopaminergic dysfunction at stages of the disease where widespread neuropathological lesions are not yet present raises the hypothesis that areas such as the hippocampus, which is affected early in AD, may influence the function of the mesostriatal circuit and thus induce a dopaminergic dysfunction.</p><p id="P4">Previous work has indicated that optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal neuron activity can induce dopamine release in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. One may thus hypothesize that early AD pathology in the hippocampus may indirectly influence striatal dopaminergic activity via a circuit from the hippocampus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) where the dopaminergic connections to the striatum stem from.</p><p id="P5">For this reason, we employed a chemogenetic strategy using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) to manipulate the activity of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in wild-type and hemizygous TgF344-AD (Tg) rats, an animal model of AD pathology. We assessed the brain-wide functional output of this manipulation using (i) <italic>in vivo</italic> [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]HMPAO Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), an approach measuring cerebral blood flow as a proxy for regional brain activity and (ii) [<sup>123</sup>I]IBZM SPECT, an approach assessing D2/3 receptor binding, which may measure both the D2/3 receptor concentration and its occupancy by dopamine (a proxy for dopamine release)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We also assessed the effects of the hippocampal neuron and astrocyte manipulation on astrocyte and microglial activity and capacity to surround and phagocytize Aβ both locally and in the striatum. Our results point to an impact of hippocampal AD pathology on mesostriatal dopaminergic signalling, whereas local stimulation of neurons and astrocytes may enhance the capacity of microglia to limit AD pathology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental design and CNO treatment</title><p id="P6">At the age of 5 months, the animals were bilaterally injected in the hippocampus with one of the DREADD or AAV.

Our results show that acute and chronic neuronal and astrocytic stimulation induces widespread effects on the brain regional activation pattern, notably with an inhibition of striatal activation. This effect might be explained by the enhancement of dopamine release in the striatum by acute and chronic hippocampal neuronal and astrocytic stimulation. On the other hand, in a rat model of AD, these effects, especially of the chronic stimulation, are blunted, both in regional brain activation pattern and striatal dopaminergic signalling. The dysfunctional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions is also supported by the finding that DREADD stimulation in the hippocampus increased microglial density and its capacity to limit AD pathology, whereas these effects were absent in the striatum.</p><p id="P37">Dysfunctional dopaminergic signalling in AD has been suggested by human molecular imaging studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and might be implicated in the occurrence of psychotic and other behavioural and psychological symptoms of the disease. Our work indicates that even in the absence of local AD pathology in the striatum (as was the case for our rats, which only had soluble Aβ forms and no lesions), hippocampal pathology may already induce circuit alterations that impact dopaminergic neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Chronic dopaminergic signalling in the striatum of WT rats induced a reduction in D2 receptor density, as expected. This effect is a compensatory property of neurotransmitter receptors upon chronic stimulation. The fact that in Tg rats the receptor density was unchanged support the notion that mesostriatal dopaminergic signalling does not respond to chronic hippocampal neuronal or astrocytic stimulation in the same way as WT rats. These observations support a presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction, supported by the increased reactivity of postsynaptic receptors in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This dopaminergic dysfunction may be contributing to the pathophysiology of psychotic syndromes in dementia, as is the case in other psychiatric pathologies involving psychotic symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">Chronic DREADD activation of astrocytes has been shown to induce transcriptomic changes in adjacent microglia, notably with the upregulation of a set of Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes that are associated to a microglial phenotype which is protective against AD pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Our results extend this finding by showing that, functionally, the result of chronic astrocytic DREADD stimulation is associated to an increase in microglial density and especially in a microglial phenotype that more efficiently responds to and limits AD pathology. This effect was limited to the hippocampus, as chronic activation of neurons and astrocytes failed to reduce Aβ in the striatum, despite a significant increase in microglial density in this context and it even increased it. Indeed, chronic neuronal DREADD stimulation in the hippocampus induced an increase in the concentration of the Gu-soluble form of Aβ40 in the striatum. Moreover, a tendency towards an increase was observed for all forms of Aβ in this region. At the same time, the density of microglial cells was also increased. This discrepancy, i.e. the fact that microglial density increased in both the hippocampus and the striatum after chronic DREADD stimulation, but Aβ is reduced in the hippocampus and increased in the striatum could be explained by the effect of dopamine directly on microglia. Indeed, previous studies have shown that dopamine, through various receptors, can reduce proinflammatory activation and promote an overall protective phenotype. We may thus hypothesize that the blunting of the dopaminergic signalling to the striatum in Tg rats, deprives microglial cells of this protective effect of dopamine and fails to respond to AD pathology efficiently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. These results suggest that dysfunction of the dopaminergic circuitry in AD could also impact microglial phenotype. This could be particularly relevant for the understanding of the pathophysiology of syndromes such as AD psychosis, in which dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">The fact that neuron and astrocyte stimulation locally induced a microglial phenotype that showed improved performance against Aβ pathology may also have important implications for strategies involving brain stimulation to reduce Aβ load and limit the disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Our results support these approaches, although they indicate that the altered connectivity of the hippocampus with other brain regions may spatially limit the effect of neuronal and astrocytic stimulation to the areas that are being directly stimulated. Nevertheless, if brain stimulation strategies are applied to a sufficiently early time-point of the AD pathological process, when Aβ is present but has not yet induced dysfunctional connectivity, a locally applied stimulation in the hippocampus can potentially have brain-wide protective effects. Future work is needed to better characterize AD connectivity changes in the trajectory of AD pathology and inform on the optimal timing of the application of such approaches.</p><p id="P40">We recognize that our study has limitations. While we make a number of novel observations, a more thorough assessment of the phenotypic alterations in neurons and glial cells after acute and chronic DREADD stimulation is needed. In addition, although the potential to alter mesostriatal transmission via optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation of the hippocampus is known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, further study should clearly delineate the exact circuitry that is implicated in this phenomenon and shows vulnerability towards AD pathology. Finally, we only used male rats and these findings need to be reproduced in female animals, given the impact of sex on AD pathology itself and on the phenotype of glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P41">In conclusion, our work suggests that hippocampal neuronal and astrocytic stimulation have widespread effects on regional rat brain activity. Hippocampal neuronal and astrocytic activation also stimulates dopaminergic signalling to the striatum both acutely and chronically, although these brainwide and striatum-specific effects are blunted in a rat model of AD pathology. Stimulation of neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampus locally stimulates a protective, Aβ-limiting phenotype of microglia, which surrounds Aβ plaques and limits Aβ concentration more efficiently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental table
