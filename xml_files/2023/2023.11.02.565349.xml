Currently, 24 mosquito-borne viruses affecting different animal hosts classified in several families have been documented in Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Mayanja et al., 2021</xref>). The majority have been identified using traditional cell-culture, PCR or serological methods. Although such experimental approaches have been successful in documenting a proportion of viral species, they have important limitations. Some viruses may be challenging to culture, and PCR-based methods rely on prior knowledge of the target nucleotide sequences (Kayiwa et al., 2018; Steinhagen et al., 2016). Unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing (MNGS), now a well-established technique, has been used in the discovery and tracking of viruses from different animal host and vector species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Marklewitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Ramesh et al., 2019</xref>), including in Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">McMullan et al., 2012</xref>).

Nucleotide pairwise distance between Emibwa phenuivirus and Badu virus was 31.61% as shown in the figure below. Anopheles phasvirus another novel virus closely related to Phasi Charoen-like virus (MN866220.1) with 44.29% pairwise distance was detected in pool 5 of <italic>Anopheles coustani</italic> from Arua district. This was distantly related to the Phasi Charoen-like viruses previously detected in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in Karnataka, India and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in Brazil (Aguiar et al., 2016 (Munivenkatappa, 2021 #341).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Uganda is a hotspot for viral pathogens and a site of high viral diversity. In this study, we employed next generation sequencing to highlight the extent of viral richness in Uganda and to identify pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. The last decade has witnessed the identification of several emerging viruses using this method, which could not be identified using traditional PCR-based or culture-based methods, including Ntwetwe virus, Nyangole virus and Kibale virus all from the family <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>. This approach is therefore highly likely to lead to the identification of previously uncharacterised viruses, some of which are likely to have the potential to cause disease in human and animal populations. Despite an increase in studies, virus species present in mosquito populations in Sub-Saharan Africa are largely undocumented. This study aimed to investigate the mosquito virome in two geographically distinct areas of Western and North Western Uganda. Virus species diversity was significantly different in the two regions with a richer mosquito virome registered in North western Uganda. A total of 173 viruses in all sampled mosquito genera from multiple virus families including the <italic>Chuviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Nairoviridae</italic> and <italic>Orthomyxoviridae, Iflaviridae, Phasmaviridae, Nodaviridae and Alphatetraviridae, Iridoviridae, Mesoniviridae, Nudiviridae, Parvoviridae, Permutotetraviridae, Picornaviralsidae, Retroviridae</italic> and <italic>Xinmoviridae</italic> were detected. Out of these, viruses were identified in families known to infect human and animals including <italic>Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Phenuviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Togaviridae</italic>. Other viruses identified during the study clustered with mosquito borne viruses already described in other parts of the world including Europe, Asia and America. The majority of the sequence contigs detected represent novel species, with unknown potential to cause disease.</p><p id="P28">This study, carried out in Western and North West Uganda illustrates the scale of richness and virus diversity in the region and the need to further characterise the virome in mosquitoes, especially those with a propensity to feed from human and animal hosts. Out of the 13 novel viruses 10 (76.9%) were from families (<italic>Orthomyxovirida</italic>e, <italic>Phenuiviridae, Rhabdoviridae</italic>) associated with disease in humans or animals. Majority (9/13) of the novel viruses were detected in <italic>Culex</italic> species which are previously known vectors of a number of viruses of known medical importance.</p><p id="P29">Novel viruses identified in family <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> included Ensuna phenuivirus from Culex species (pool MosP36 and MosP38), Emibwa phenuivirus from <italic>Culex antennatus</italic> (pool MosP76), Anopheles phasivirus from <italic>Anopheles coustani</italic> (pool MosP5). Those identified in family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> included Anopheles orthomyxo-like virus from <italic>Anopheles spp</italic> (pool MosP61) from Kasese district, Coquillettidia orthomyxo-like virus from <italic>Coquillettidia species</italic> (pool MosP11) in Arua district, Emibwa orthomyxo-like virus from Culex and <italic>Anopheles spp</italic> (pool MosP63, MosP85 AND MosP91) and Mansonia orthomyxo-like virus from <italic>Mansonia uniformis</italic> (pool MosP51 and MosP95) in Arua and Kasese districts. To our knowledge this is the first report of a large-scale study in which NGS is used to characterize viruses from diverse mosquito species in Uganda.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Limitations to the study</title><p id="P30">There were several limitations to this study. While we detected near full genomes of viruses in many virus families, metagenomic sequencing can lack sensitivity which can be increased by employing a semi-agnostic target enrichment approach to increase the detection and documentation of novel species. Further studies employing such an approach are indicated. Further, we sampled from two regions of Uganda only. While these areas have varied ecological characteristics (Arua district has an arid climate with lower rainfall while Kasese district has a milder climate with increased rainfall), further sampling in Uganda and indeed in the region is indicated. Finally, while the majority of the viruses described are likely to replicate in mosquitoes and some may be arboviruses, we did not demonstrate vector competence in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS190623-supplement-Supplementary_Table.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Funding information</title><p>This work was supported through the Wellcome Trust-funded ArboViral Infection (AVI) study (102789/Z/13/A), the UK Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12014/8) (E.C.T.), the Makerere University/UVRI Infection and Immunity (MUII) Research Training program and the DELTAS Africa Initiative (Grant No: 107743).
