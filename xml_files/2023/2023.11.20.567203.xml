Approaches relying on affinity tagging and antibodies have important limitations that can lead to artificial results. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of AGO2 have been shown to be important for correct activity and yet the consequences of appending tags to either terminus have not been fully investigated. N-terminal tags are frequently used to study AGO2 biology. Recently, an N-terminal <italic>HaloTag-Ago2</italic> fusion was reported and examined in mice. While the versatile HaloTag provided new opportunities to study RISC biology, the tagged construct showed certain activity changes compared to unmodified AGO2. CRISPaint, a new CRISPR-Cas9 technique, permits the creation of endogenous C-terminal tag fusions. We used CRISPaint to generate the first reported recombinant AGO2 construct with a C-terminal tag: an endogenous C-terminal HaloTag fusion to AGO2 (<italic>AGO2<sup>HALO</sup></italic>) in human (A549) cells. We found that the AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> fusion protein has a reduced capacity to interac with the key protein binding partner TNRC6A and that the C-terminal HaloTag does not affect cell viability. However, the <italic>AGO2<sup>HALO</sup></italic> fusion significantly impairs RNA cleavage and RNA silencing activity compared to control cells and reduces nuclear localisation of the fusion protein. Using plasmid constructs and transient transfection, we compared AGO2 tagged with EGFP at the N- or C-terminus in siRNA and miRNA reporter gene assays, and cellular localisation. N-terminally tagged AGO2 functioned and localised similarly to WT untagged AGO2, whereas C-terminally tagged AGO2 was impaired in siRNA and miRNA silencing and exhibited poor nuclear and P-body localisation. We conclude that the fusion of a C-terminal HaloTag to AGO2 is not appropriate for studying AGO2 and RISC. Our results assert the importance of comprehensively validating recombinant tagging strategies to ensure that any experimental results generated do not arise from, or are not obscured by, critical functional defects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The four human Argonaute proteins (AGO1-4) are key components of the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), which is critical for the correct regulation of gene expression through miRNA-mediated silencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Due to the considerable scientific and clinical interest in RNA silencing, exemplified by the recent Nobel Prizes to Ambrose and Ruvkun, a significant body of work has been performed to develop experimental tools for the study of AGO protein function. However, assay design has been limited by methods that rely on antibodies and affinity/auto fluorescent tags, which can be technically challenging and often lack the sensitivity or specificity required to generate appropriately robust results.</p><p id="P4">Recombinantly tagging a protein of interest is a widely used strategy in molecular biology and biotechnology to purify, visualise, and manipulate target proteins. To overcome challenges related to antibody specificity and pull-down efficiency attempts to study RISC have often used overexpressed, recombinantly-tagged AGOs. Such approaches, however, carry the risk of generating artefacts. For example, a N-terminal Flag-tagged AGO2 construct resulted in five-fold over-expression compared to endogenous AGO2 levels, altered AGO2 sub-cellular localisation, and resulted in the identification of potentially false binding partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Such artefacts might arise from either over-expression of the transgene or the presence of the Flag tag itself. Moreover, it has been shown that recombinantly-tagged, over-expressed proteins can non-specifically localise to processing (P) bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Caution should therefore be applied to any study that uses recombinantly-tagged proteins to show that both AGO and TNRC6 proteins are strongly localised to P bodies.<sup>0</sup> Consequently, approaches that tag endogenous proteins are often deemed more desirable. However, this too can disrupt normal protein function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> In rapidly proliferating cell lines, endogenously tagged AGOs have been shown to elute in complexes of more variable size than native AGOs have, which primarily elute as components of high molecular weight complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> An endogenous N-terminal EGFP-AGO2 fusion protein was not recognised by a pS387-AGO2-specific antibody in immunofluorescence assays, conceivably due to the tag altering AGO2 conformation and therefore reducing pS387 antibody binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Even in cases where endogenous tags have been shown to retain core RISC activity, these tagged proteins should only be used to study known RISC functions under specific experimental conditions and periods of expression. The use of novel tags and tagging strategies in different cell models may affect the target protein to unpredictable extents. Nevertheless, protein tagging can expand our ability to study RNA silencing and RISC proteins, albeit with (manageable) technical biases which are inevitable when probing complex biological systems. Thus, to confidently exploit the potential benefits that recombinant tagging of endogenous proteins offers it is important to ensure that the core functionalities of the proteins of interest are sufficiently retained - primarily through considered design and stringent validation - and that technical biases should be considered and minimised when designing experiments and interpreting results.</p><p id="P5">The HaloTag protein fusion platform is a modular protein tagging system that can be programmed for different functions, proving a versatile technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> The modified 33 kDa haloalkane dehalogenase HaloTag protein can covalently bind to synthetic chloroalkane ligands (collectively known as HaloTag ligands) which comprise a chloroalkane linker attached to a variety of useful molecules, such as fluorescent dyes, affinity handles, or solid surfaces. Covalent bond formation between the protein tag and the chloroalkane linker is high affinity, rapid, specific, and irreversible. This enables efficient purification of HaloTag fusion proteins and means this single genetic construct can have multiple capabilities to comprehensively analyse protein function and interaction. Importantly, an endogenous fusion of HaloTag to the N-terminus of <italic>Ago2</italic> (HaloTag-Ago2) has enabled the high-resolution identification of Ago2-miRNA and -mRNA interactions in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Applying UV crosslinking to cells expressing HaloTag fusion proteins enables efficient identification of RNA targets of RNA-binding proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> Of note, HaloTag-Ago2 fusions have been used to investigate the association of Ago proteins with RNA in a process termed Halo-Enhanced Ago2 Pulldown sequencing (HEAP-seq).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> The HaloTag ligand conjugated to a resin can be used to pull down HaloTag-Ago2 in cells or tissues expressing the fusion. High-throughput sequencing of RNA extracted from purified AGO-miRNA-mRNA complexes then enables the identification of miRNA-mRNA networks under physiological (and/or pathological) conditions. In addition to bypassing the need for radiolabelling, immunoprecipitation, and gel purification, the covalent nature of the interaction between the HaloTag and its ligand simplifies the isolation of AGO-miRNA-mRNA complexes, removing the intrinsic variability of antibody-based approaches. Moreover, as the strong covalent bond permits more stringent washing, there is less potential for non-specific RNAs to be captured. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Accordingly, HEAP-seq was demonstrated to enable both more sensitive and specific identification of AGO protein-RNA interactions than conventional methods which rely on the use of antibodies to precipitate AGO-containing complexes (i.e. CLIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). Furthermore, the HaloTag labelling capacity can also be used to perform live-cell single-molecule imaging to observe dynamic activity and high-resolution investigation of protein-protein interactions through mass spectrometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Endogenous fusion of AGO2 to HaloTag should therefore facilitate a thorough investigation of AGO2/RISC in human cells at physiologically relevant abundancies, in near-native cellular background, and to greater resolution than antibody-based approaches. Future HaloTag:AGO1-4 fusions would also enable comparative analysis of AGO1-4 biology in different contexts, with the mutual HaloTag overcoming the key limitations of CLIP-based methods that result from variable antibody performance.</p><p id="P7">AGO2 comprises four domains (N-terminal (N), PIWI/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ), middle (MID), and P-element-induced wimpy testes (PIWI)), each with known roles in RISC formation and RNA silencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> When designing a recombinantly-tagged AGO2 protein, it is critical to consider the impact on both N- and C-terminal domains. The PIWI domain is located at the C-terminus of AGO2. This domain contains six loops along the nucleic acid-binding cleft and is similar in function to an RNase H domain, harbouring the catalytic tetrad (DEDH) essential for the slicing activity of AGO2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Mutation of the conserved glutamate residue in the DEDH motif abolishes the ability of AGO2 to induce RNAi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Many post-translational modifications (PTMs) of AGO2 are found in the C-terminal PIWI domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> These PTMs impact various aspects of AGO2 function, influencing both RISC and miRNA activity. The C-terminal half of human AGO2 is also responsible for the interaction with TNRC6A, which is crucial for miRNA-dependent silencing function and the localization of AGO2 in cytoplasmic foci.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> The N domain of AGO2 is fundamental to RISC functionality, facilitating ATP-independent unwinding of small RNA duplexes, a critical step for RISC assembly in human cells. Both slicer-dependent and slicer-independent unwinding require efficient function of the N domain of AGO2, highlighting its importance in passenger-strand cleavage. Moreover, two specific motifs (residues 44–48 and 134–166) in the N-terminal region of AGO2 are vital for optimal catalytic activity. It is postulated that, due to their proximity to the PIWI domain in the tertiary structure of AGO2, these motifs are essential for the accurate positioning of the guide:target. Alterations within these motifs hinder the activation of RISC and obstruct mRNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> Deletion of the N-terminal, Linker 1 and PAZ domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic> AGO2 resulted in decreased target RNA binding and constitutive activation of the cleavage activity of the PIWI domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> These studies highlight the collective importance of both the N- and C-termini in the normal function of AGO2 and emphasise the need for consideration and due diligence when adding and validating tags at either terminus, as each may disrupt normal protein function.</p><p id="P8">We set out to develop human cell lines endogenously expressing AGO2 fused to a reporter tag to enable comprehensive study of AGO2 function and RISC biology in cells relevant to our research interests. Due to the stated versatility of HaloTag technology and advantages over traditional methods used to study AGO complexes and RISC, we sought to generate a AGO2-HaloTag fusion protein. A previous study that used N-terminal fusion of HaloTag with Ago2 reported diminished ability to rescue RNAi in <italic>Ago2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared to WT Ago2, de-repression of a subset of highly expressed miRNA targets, and reduced viability of <italic>HaloTag-Ago2</italic> homozygous mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> indicating some loss of functionality due to the N-terminal HaloTag-Ago2 fusion. A series of functional validation experiments did, however, demonstrate core functionalities were retained after N-terminal HaloTag-Ago2 fusion. Pull-down assays established physical interaction between HaloTag-Ago2 and the core miRISC component Tnrc6a, while size-exclusion chromatography showed co-elution of HaloTag-Ago2 with WT Ago2 in high molecular weight complexes (though, notably, complexes were of more variable size in tagged cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>). Encouragingly, Dual-Luciferase reporter experiments using three constructs with well-characterized miRNA binding sites, as well as a sensitive two-colour fluorescent reporter system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> showed no detectable differences in miRNA-mediated repression between <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Ago2<sup>Halo/Halo</sup></italic> MEFs. These findings are an example of orthodox tag validation and, overall, indicate endogenous N-terminal fusion of HaloTag to AGO(2) is a valuable model to study miRISC <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, despite some reported functional limitations. However, the tagging approach used by Li <italic>et al</italic>. raises important points of consideration when designing tags. N terminal fusion of HaloTag to Ago2 was achieved by insertion of a conditional knock-in allele containing the HaloTag upstream of a loxP-STOP-IRES-FLAG-loxP cassette in mouse ES cells to express Cre recombinase which fuses the HaloTag to the first exon of <italic>Ago2</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> This is a relatively complex method of gene tagging which can be time-consuming and challenging to precisely reproduce. The approach also disrupts the 5’ UTR of the <italic>Ago2</italic> gene, risking unknown effects on the regulation of expression of AGO2, which is critical when considering true <italic>in vivo</italic> endogenous functionality. These challenges therefore prompted us to look for alternative methods to generate an endogenous HaloTag fusion to AGO2 in human cells.</p><p id="P9">CRISPaint is a gene editing system which allows the precise creation of C-terminal tag fusions of endogenously encoded proteins in human cells with high efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> Unlike homology directed repair (HDR)-directed tagging, CRISPaint does not require generation of a site-specific donor template with homology arms but integrates heterologous genetic material via canonical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) in CRISPR-Cas9-accessible cellular systems. This reduces the overall time required to obtain genetically tagged cells compared with HDR-directed tagging.</p><p id="P10">The lack of data on the validity of C-terminal AGO2 tagging, the non-trivial nature of endogenous N-terminal AGO2 tagging using the method used by Li <italic>et al</italic>, the importance of the 5’ UTR, and the critical motifs at both the C- and N-termini of AGO2 together make a preferred strategy for generating tagged variants of endogenous AGO2 tags challenging to predict. We therefore employed CRISPaint to create cell lines expressing a C-terminal AGO2-HaloTag fusion protein (AGO2<sup>HALO</sup>) for the future comprehensive study of AGO2 in human cells. Due to the addition of the tag potentially impairing normal protein function and therefore invalidating any future results, as well as the lack of published evidence on the effect of C-terminal tagging of AGO2, we sought to validate the functional activity of endogenous AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> robustly and diligently against native AGO2 in UnTagged CRISPaint controls lines and <italic>WT</italic> A549 cells.</p><p id="P11">By interrogating the core functional activities of AGO2 (protein localisation and binding, cleavage, and silencing capacity) in <italic>WT</italic>, UnTagged, and <italic>AGG2<sup>HALO</sup></italic> cells, we aimed to define the impact of the C-terminal fusion of AGO2 with HaloTag. Our results led us to conclude that <italic>AGG2<sup>HALO</sup></italic> cells have significantly impaired silencing function compared to control UnTagged and <italic>WT</italic> AGO2 cells, as well as distinct sub-cellular localisation. We therefore do not consider C-terminal AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> as a suitable model for further study of AGO2 and RISC function. Although we only considered a single configuration for a single type of C-terminal fusion tag of the relatively large (33 kDa) HaloTag to AGO2, comparison of our data with previously published N-terminal HaloTag-AGO2 does indicate that N-terminal tagging is favourable. Following this, we directly compared the effect of N- vs C-terminal tagging on AGO2 function. Addition of an EGFP tag to the C-terminus of AGO2 resulted in a loss of silencing function comparable to complete AGO2 ablation, whereas addition of the same tag at the N-terminus had no such effect with silencing function maintained. Together, these data indicate C-terminal tagging of AGO2 severely impairs normal AGO2 function and is less suitable than N-terminal AGO2 tagging approaches for study of AGO2/RISC in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P12">A549 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma, D8437) supplemented with 10% qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, 10270106), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) in a humidified 37 °C incubator and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Protein termini are typically solvent exposed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> however, the C-terminus of AGO2 is an uncommon example where the last residue is buried (only 20% of the surface area of A859 is accessible to a solvent probe with radius 1.4 Å). The buried carboxylate group of A859 also forms functionally relevant interactions (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref></italic>), including hydrogen bonds with several residues (e.g. K556 and R792) that themselves interact with the phosphate groups of residues 1 and 3 of the miRNA. Moreover, in some of the reported structures, the carboxylate groups of Y857 and A859 interact with a buried water molecule that also interacts with the 5’ terminal phosphate group of the miRNA. Evidently, modification of the sequence in this region of the protein via deletion of native residues and addition of a HaloTag will likely perturb the RNA binding properties of AGO2 (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref></italic>). Indeed, prediction of the AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> structure using AlphaFold2 shows the linker region between AGO2 and the HaloTag exiting AGO2 via the miRNA binding site (data not shown).

However, every tag added to a protein has the potential to impede functionality, which may invalidate any experimental conclusions. As a result, careful tag design together with reliable and reproducible validation experiments are essential for advancing (miRNA-silencing) research. This is especially important for proteins like AGO2, which often function as part of larger complexes and have numerous and diverse roles and activities. Concerningly, several previous studies that have used tagged forms of AGO2 to investigate AGO2/RISC have not adequately demonstrated, either through published tag validation or the lack thereof, that core functions of tagged AGO2 are sufficiently maintained. As even small modifications can have functional consequences, this shortfall in validation casts doubt on the validity of some of these findings. Additionally, the paucity of AGO2 antibody validation presents a risk of artificial results arising from non-specific binding of antibodies used to probe AGO2. Therefore, to ensure the validity and robustness of future AGO2/RISC investigational findings, we recommend more comprehensive protein-tag (and antibody) validation work to be performed and published in detail alongside investigational findings.</p><p id="P62">We constructed C-terminal <italic>AGO2<sup>HALO</sup></italic> fusion cells to investigate if AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> was a suitable model for studying RISC biology in human cells. Our research revealed that, while AGO2<sup>HALO</sup> retained some capacity to form native protein-protein interactions, <italic>AGO2<sup>HAL</sup>O</italic> cells displayed distinct sub-cellular localization and significantly reduced silencing function compared to normal AGO2. This loss of function led us to conclude that C-terminal fusion of <italic>AGO2<sup>HALO</sup></italic> was not appropriate for further research into the biology of AGO2/RISC. Moreover, we showed that similar loss of silencing function and aberrant localisation occurs in cells transfected with a C-terminal AGO2-EGFP plasmid, but not N-terminal EGFP-AGO2, suggesting C-terminal tagging of AGO2 in general is inappropriate and N-terminal tagging is more desirable.</p><p id="P63">While this study establishes important insights into the consequences of C-terminal HaloTag fusion on AGO2 functionality, several limitations should be noted. First, the endogenous tagging data focussed exclusively on the HaloTag — a relatively large (33 kDa) tag — in a single C-terminal configuration, while the N- vs C-terminal AGO2 exogenous tag comparison data is directly relevant for EGFP only (27 kDa). Given AGO2’s complex domain structure and critical roles within RISC, alternative tags or placements may yield different functional outcomes. Exploring smaller tags or N-terminal fusions could potentially mitigate some of the disruptions observed here and is a recommended avenue for future study.</p><p id="P64">Ultimately, we hope that our work serves as a valuable case study to underscore the importance of careful validation of all core protein competencies of recombinantly tagged proteins. We strongly encourage future research using N-terminal (or any) AGO2 tag fusions to conduct and publish comprehensive validation assays. It is crucial to avoid relying on any single assay and, instead, perform a combination of experiments (e.g., Luciferase reporter assays, <italic>miR-451α</italic>/slicing assays, co-immunoprecipitation/protein-interaction experiments, and localization studies) to validate the range of core protein functionalities, thereby increasing confidence in investigational findings.. A community-wide effort to ensure only the most robustly validated reagents and methods are used to characterise AGO2 and RISC biology would enable the miRNA community to gain valuable insights into RNA silencing biology of greater scientific rigour. More broadly, the availability of AlphaFold models for 220 million proteins means that the design of fusion proteins can now be guided by atomic resolution predictions of protein structure in the absence of experimental data. We therefore strongly recommend well-thought-out design and validation strategies to enhance our understanding of the impact of specific tags and tagging strategies on protein function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS191473-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the advice and helpful discussions and additional editorial suggestions of this work/investigation from Prof. Dimitris Lagos, Dr Faraz Mardakheh and Dr Paulo S.
