The majority of what we know about XCI and <italic>XIST</italic> is from data in the mouse which is developmentally anomalous in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ramos-Ibeas et al. 2019</xref>).

This is essential to equalise the expression of genes on the X chromosome between males and females.

HnRNPU binds <italic>Xist</italic> in mouse Neuro2A (neural crest-derived) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hasegawa et al. 2010</xref>) and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lu, et al. 2020</xref>), contributing to XCI by localising <italic>Xist</italic> on the X chromosome. Mouse Ciz1 binds <italic>Xist</italic> repeat E enabling anchoring of <italic>Xist</italic> to the nuclear matrix (nuclear periphery) and to the inactive X chromosome (Xi), facilitating gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ridings-Figueroa et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sunwoo et al. 2017</xref>). Lbr was also identified as a bona fide interacting partner of mouse <italic>Xist,</italic> interacting via its repeat A region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">McHugh, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lu, et al. 2020</xref>) and tethers <italic>Xist</italic> in the cell’s nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen, et al. 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is clear that effector proteins are necessary for <italic>Xist</italic> to initiate and establish XCI in mouse. However, details of which protein partners are involved in XCI in other mammals is currently lacking and for human <italic>XIST</italic> interactions described have only been characterised in less relevant cell lines (HEK293, K562, HepG2, GM12878 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P5">LncRNAs have diverse functions depending on where the lncRNA is localised and also on what molecule they interact with, including protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tsagakis et al. 2020</xref>). Contrary to most lncRNAs, which exhibit rapid evolution and thus low levels of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pang, Frith, and Mattick 2006</xref>), <italic>XIST</italic> has moderate conservation among the eutherian clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yen et al. 2007</xref>). Yet our current knowledge regarding the role of <italic>XIST</italic> and its interaction partners in XCI comes from either <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models, mouse or human stem cells or generic human tissue culture cell lines (e.g. HEK293), which are unlikely to be representative of the entire eutherian clade. For instance, certain XCI milestones such as temporal <italic>XIST</italic> expression and X-linked gene silencing are achieved at different time-points in different placental mammal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Okamoto et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Vallot, Ouimette, and Rougeulle 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The timing of implantation differs among placental mammals with the mouse and human embryo implanting in the uterus five and seven days after fertilisation respectively, whereas pigs and cattle could take up to two to three weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Berg et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bou et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the nature of XCI varies (imprinted vs random) along with the extent of XCI escape across placental mammals. In mice, there is a wave of imprinted XCI where the paternal X is preferentially briefly inactivated from the 4-cell stage to the blastocyst until the paternal X is reactivated transiently in preparation for the second wave of random XCI (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Vallot, Ouimette, and Rougeulle 2016</xref>)). In contrast, humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Petropoulos et al. 2016</xref>) and pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Zou et al. 2019</xref>) experience a single wave of random XCI whereas the picture is unclear in cow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen, et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Xue et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dindot et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Couldrey et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">A statement of sequence homology between genes describes shared ancestry but does not directly transfer functional information. Even single gene orthologs can have divergent functions through time and in different lineages (e.g. (Gharib and Robinson-Rechavi 2011)). By comparing alignments of homologous sequences across species we can gain insight into variation in selective pressure acting in site and/or lineage specific ways which can underpin species/lineage-specific divergence in function of the corresponding protein products. The vast majority of protein coding regions evolve under a strict selective constraint to maintain organismal fitness where substitutions that emerge are actively purged by natural selection (i.e. purifying or negative selection). On the contrary, substitutions that increase fitness are “positively selected” and increase in frequency in the population through time. In general, observations of positive selection are considered synonymous with functional shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Levasseur et al. 2006</xref>). Rational mutagenesis experiments and functional assays designed to assess the impact of residues under positive selection support this thesis. For example, the vertebrate umami taste receptor has been co-opted in hummingbirds to function as a sweet taste receptor, and in mammals the evolution of the unique chlorination activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (an innate immune enzyme produced by neutrophils) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baldwin et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Loughran et al. 2012</xref>). By assessing the selective pressure variation across species for a given set of orthologs we can therefore predict whether there is evidence for positive selection and hence protein functional shift. Here we test the hypothesis that homologs of protein interacting partners of <italic>XIST</italic> are under the similar selective constraints across species with different morphology and timing of XCI.</p><p id="P7">Therefore, under the prism that eutherian mammals have diverged in terms of their early development, XCI timing, and reproductive morphologies, it is possible that their mechanisms of XCI have diverged as well, perhaps co-opting new protein partners. We tested the hypothesis that the protein partners that <italic>XIST</italic> interacts with, are different in species with different morphology and timing of XCI. Given XCI only occurs in females and the expression of <italic>XIST</italic> is higher in female reproductive tissues we selected to dissect the <italic>XIST</italic>-protein interactions in a human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (Ishikawa) and bovine stromal cells from the endometrium. Our aim was to characterise <italic>XIST</italic>-protein interactions within the context of the human and cow endometrium and to provide insight into XCI within the context of reproductive tissue and placental mammals other than mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P8">Unless stated otherwise, all consumables were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Analysis of sequence conservation of <italic>XIST</italic> and its protein partners</title><p id="P9">We sought to determine how conserved the sequences of <italic>XIST</italic> and its protein partners were in selected mammalian species with different developmental morphologies.

The models we employed are a set of standard nested models which are automatically compared by Vespa using likelihood ratio tests with significance calculated using the appropriate degrees of freedom. More specifically, the models used were the neutral model M1Neutral, and its lineage-specific extensions model A, and the null model for model A. M1Neutral allows two site classes for dN/dS (referred to as ω throughout): ω0=0 and ω1=1. Model A assumes the two site classes are the same in both foreground and background lineages (ω0=0 and ω1=1) and ω2 for the foreground is estimated from the data and free to vary above 1. Model A null estimates a ω2 value also, but here it is restricted to below 1 thus allowing sites to be evolving under either purifying selection, or to be neutrally evolving but not permitting positive selection. Sequences were considered to exhibit lineage-specific selective pressure if the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for ModelA is significant in comparison to both ModelA null and M1Neutral. The lineages labelled as foreground were human, mouse, cow and pig.</p><p id="P24">In all cases where models allowed for the estimation of positively selected sites, the contributions of individual sites to the signal for positive selection was estimated using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach.

There are also some amino acid differences within the RNA binding domain of CIZ1, which could provide an explanation for a difference in binding specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary S9</xref>). Another potential explanation for the lack of cross-species interaction is that human CIZ1 could require cooperative binding with other, unknown factors, that are not necessary or present in cow. Additionally, the evolution of the <italic>XIST</italic> RNA across placental mammals was coincident with the gain, expansion and exaptation as well as the loss of repetitive elements of various origin (i.e. retroviral or TE elements) across its sequence, which might contribute to differences in motifs within the E repeat between human and cow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yen et al., 2007</xref>, Elisaphenko et al., 2008, Carlevaro-Fita et al., 2019). Given the substantial peri-implantation differences in embryo/conceptus morphology between human and cow it is likely that some of the <italic>XIST</italic> interactions are not expressed co-ordinately in these species.</p><p id="P41">The mouse specific signature of positive selection for <italic>CIZ1</italic> is within the known RNA binding zinc finger domain of the protein, suggesting an altered function for Ciz1 unique to the mouse lineage. Specifically, 4 out of 25 aa indicated to be under positive selection are within this zinc-finger domain. The observed functional divergence in mouse may be driven by divergent <italic>Ciz1</italic> function rather than <italic>Xist</italic> repeat E. CIZ1 has an array of other functions outside XCI, which could impact the selective pressures it is under (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nishibe et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pauzaite et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stewart et al. 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the repeat E sequence is more similar between human and cow than with mouse. This might likely indicate that mouse <italic>Xist</italic> does not bind to human or bovine repeat E elements. This is also consistent with the observation that the mouse is an outlier in terms of mechanistic output from XCI, with far fewer genes that escape compared with 18 other mammals, including human, cow and pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Balaton et al. 2021</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that differing levels of CIZ1 protein will lead to differences in its ability to generate RNA-protein assemblies in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sofi et al. 2022</xref>). Therefore, differences in the levels of CIZ1 across species and cell types might contribute to differing functional outputs.</p><p id="P42">We show that regardless of the rapid rates of change we observe in the lncRNA <italic>XIST</italic> across mammals, the underlying interactions between <italic>XIST</italic> and a subset of its protein partners are largely maintained between human and mouse. Indeed, in the case of CIZ1 we report that the conservation of partners is maintained across human, mouse and bovine. However, the precise biochemical basis of this interaction may be different. Despite differences in timing of XCI and early embryo morphologies between mouse, human and cow, CIZ1-<italic>XIST</italic> interaction is maintained. Future work will look to understand how a difference in the nature of CIZ1 binding contributes to the difference in functional output from <italic>XIST’s</italic> role in XCI and how this contributes to timing and type of XCI. Leading on from this work it will be important to understand how differences in timing of XCI linked to differences in embryo morphology are linked to differences in <italic>XIST</italic>-protein complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189394-supplement-Supplemental_Information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was undertaken on ARC3, part of the High-Performance Computing facilities at the University of Leeds, UK.
