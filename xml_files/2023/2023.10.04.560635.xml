Radiation responses of GBM cells in this system were highly reproducible and comparable to those observed in low-throughout 3D assays. The screen methodology provided quantification of candidate drug single agent activity (EC<sub>50</sub>) and the interaction between drug and radiation (radiation interaction ratio, RIR). The PARP inhibitors talazoparib, rucaparib and olaparib, each showed a significant interaction with radiation by ClonoScreen3D and were subsequently confirmed as true radiosensitizers by full clonogenic assay. Screening a panel of DNA damage response inhibitors revealed the expected propensity of these compounds to interact significantly with radiation (13/15 compounds). A second screen assessed a panel of compounds targeting pathways identified by transcriptomic analysis and demonstrated single agent activity and a previously unreported interaction with radiation of dinaciclib and cytarabine (RIR 1.28 and 1.90, respectively). These compounds were validated as radiosensitizers in full clonogenic assays (sensitizer enhancement ratio 1.47 and 1.35, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">The ClonoScreen3D platform was demonstrated to be a robust method to screen for single agent and radiation-drug combination activity.

Even with trimodal therapy comprising surgery, radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], prognosis remains dismal owing to marked chemo- and radioresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Multiple molecularly targeted agents exploiting pathways commonly dysregulated in GBM, including the receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], Î±v integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], p53 and retinoblastoma pathways, have shown therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of GBM. However, all these agents have failed in the clinic, either alone or in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These results emphasise the need for improved experimental models that translate effectively to the clinic. We developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) <italic>in vitro</italic> GBM culture system that better reflects patient response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and has been extensively characterized in terms of cell morphology, mRNA and protein expression, and response to therapies including radiation, chemotherapy (temozolomide) and clinically-relevant molecular targeted agents (e.g. erlotinib, bevacizumab). Comparison of the 3D system with conventional 2D or neurosphere models has confirmed its superiority for drug discovery in GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Radiotherapy is a central component of GBM treatment and while its efficacy in terms of overall survival has been proven in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], tumour recurrence occurs in nearly all patients. Radiation dose escalation has not improved clinical outcomes and most patients experience disabling neurocognitive toxicity. Enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy will therefore require the use of radiosensitizing drugs that potentiate cytotoxicity in a tumourspecific manner. Radioresistance in GBM has been linked to a subpopulation of cells termed GBM stem-like cells, which display preferential activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and increased DNA repair capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Pharmacological disruption of the DDR therefore offers an attractive strategy to overcome radioresistance and enable radiation therapy to eliminate this problematic population of tumour cells.</p><p id="P7">Identification of radiosensitizers <italic>in vitro</italic> is best achieved using the gold-standard clonogenic survival assay (CSA), but this is currently labour-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, difficulties in compressing 2D CSAs to small growth area formats (e.g. 96-well plate) due to colony size has presented a barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, in addition to non-clonogenic screening methods, efforts to establish clonogenic or pseudoclonogenic platforms have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] in addition to non-clonogenic screening methods. However, development of a medium or high-throughput screen to identify radiosensitizers using primary GBM cells cultured in 3D conditions has not previously been reported.</p><p id="P8">To overcome these obstacles, we modified our clinically-relevant 3D clonogenic system to 96-well plate format and observed that the high surface area of the 3D-Alvetex scaffold supported growth of sufficient numbers of colonies for large-scale compound screening. To identify novel, clinically exploitable targets for radiosensitization, we performed RNAseq analysis of GBM cells grown in 3D before and after radiation treatment. In addition to the expected DDR candidates, we identified novel potential targets in pathways including cell cycle progression, mitosis, and DNA synthesis. Our novel screening tool, the ClonoScreen3D platform, represents an improved experimental strategy for streamlining identification of novel radiosensitizers and has potential to transform the landscape of GBM therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p id="P9">Patient-derived G7 and E2 GBM cells were obtained from Professor Colin Watts, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].

Accordingly, further assay development was performed using G7s cells. Seeding density and colony growth times were optimized to obtain sufficient countable colonies under control and irradiated conditions. To validate the screen with radiation, G7s cells were exposed to 3 Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), a dose selected based on survival responses to radiation alone and in combination with various compounds (rucaparib example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

For drugs exhibiting SAA, comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> values for drug alone and in combination with IR is indicative of radiosensitizing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, this approach is not applicable when drugs lack SAA or do not conform to a classical dose response, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> (0 Gy), where EC<sub>50</sub> cannot be estimated with meaningful confidence. In such situations, statistical comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> values fails to capture even marked shifts in dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> P=0.129). To address this issue, we determined areaunder-the-curve (AUC) values for control and irradiated samples, an approach inspired by the widely used âmean inactivation doseâ parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This generated a novel value, which we termed the âradiation interaction ratioâ (RIR), that is defined as the ratio of AUCs and captures the relative shift in dose response curves, thus providing a quantitative readout of radiosensitizing potential.

The ATM inhibitor AZD1390 exhibited a marked interaction with IR (RIR 2.98 P&lt;0.001), while the less potent ATM inhibitor KU55933 showed limited (non-significant) activity only at 10 Âµmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The next highest ranked compound was SCH 900776, an inhibitor of Chk1/2 (RIR 1.85 P=0.013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), while another Chk1/2 inhibitor AZD7762 was also identified as a hit (RIR 2.47 P=0.017). Two ATR inhibitors, AZD6738 (RIR 2.16 P=0.017) and VX970 (RIR 2.33 P=0.017), were also identified as interacting significantly with IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). The DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 exhibited the greatest absolute interaction with IR (RIR 3.99 P=0.016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), although its ranking was reduced by inter-replicate variability. By contrast, a second DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7026 showed no significant activity. Two homologous recombination (HR)-targeting inhibitors exhibited limited radiation interaction, which was statistically significant only for B02 (RIR 1.23 P=0.017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>); this may be explained by their low drug potencies, having EC<sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range.</p><p id="P27">Of the fifteen DDR inhibitors tested, eight compounds showed a significant interaction with radiation in both G7s and G7m cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and D</xref>-G, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. SF4</xref>). A further five compounds showed radiosensitizing potential in a single cell line.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Identification of novel targets for radiosensitization of GBM cells</title><p id="P28">To identify novel radiosensitization targets, we performed RNAseq analysis on samples obtained from two patient-derived GBM cell lines, E2 and G7m, that had been cultured in 3D and treated with IR (5 Gy) or sham-irradiated four hours previously. The timepoint of RNA extraction was chosen to identify early response genes regulating radioresistance in GBM. Since only modest changes in gene expression were observed in E2 cells, we focused on G7m cells. In this context, exposure to IR significantly altered expression of multiple DDR genes (e.g. BRCA1, RAD51, XRCC2) as expected, and also included genes associated with: (<italic>i</italic>) reduced cell cycle (CDC25C, CDKN1B, CDK18) and mitotic progression (BUB1, PLK1, CDC25A); (<italic>ii</italic>) NFÎºB signalling (NFKBIE, NFKBIA and NFKB2); (<italic>iii</italic>) cytokine and growth factor signalling (CXCL10, CXCL6, VEGFA); and (<italic>iv</italic>) stem cell regulation (FOS, WNT2, WNT5A, ID4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A full list is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary File 1</xref>.</p><p id="P29">Commercially available inhibitors targeting pathways and gene products identified in this experiment were selected for evaluation as potential radiosensitizers using ClonoScreen3D. Where several genes from the same biological pathway were identified, additional compounds targeting the pathway were included, such as the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 to target mitosis and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor dinaciclib for cell cycle progression.</p><p id="P30">In this prospective screen, inhibitors targeting cell cycle regulation, in particular the G2/M checkpoint, demonstrated marked SAA in G7s cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S5</xref>). Dinaciclib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of CDK1, CDK2, CKD5 and CDK9, exhibited the highest SAA (EC<sub>50</sub> 13 nmol/L, 95% CI 4 to 21 nmol/L). Inhibitors targeting mitotic progression (AZD1775, PD0166285) also showed potent SAA as did cytarabine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that inhibits DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. A similar pattern of SAA was observed in G7m cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Targeting DNA synthesis and cyclin-dependent kinases induces radiosensitization of GBM cells</title><p id="P31">In keeping with previous 3D CSA and clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] erlotinib exhibited no SAA or radiosensitizing activity in G7s (RIR 0.94 P=0.872; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) or G7m cells (RIR 1.06 P=0.104; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S6</xref>). Of the compounds targeting radiation-response processes identified by transcriptomic analysis, only two exhibited a robust interaction with radiation, following correction of P-values for multiple comparison. Resveratrol, an NFÎºB inhibitor, demonstrated a modest interaction with IR in G7s cells (RIR 1.26 P=0.047, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). In addition to potent SAA, dinaciclib exhibited an interaction with IR in G7s cells (RIR 1.28 P=0.047). Despite failing to achieve statistical significance due to inter-replicate variability, the DNA synthesis inhibitor cytarabine exhibited the highest RIR value in this screen, in both G7s and G7m cells (G7s RIR 1.90 P=0.303; G7m RIR 1.76 P=0.104, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S6</xref>). Because the RIR magnitude was high, the interaction with IR was additionally tested by statistical comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> values between the combination and radiation-only samples. A significant reduction in EC<sub>50</sub> was observed when cytarabine was combined with IR in G7m (P=0.017) but not G7s (P=0.119) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S7</xref>). This result and the SAA of cytarabine justified its selection for further investigation.</p><p id="P32">To confirm the ability of the ClonoScreen3D platform to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> novel radiosensitizers, gold-standard full radiation dose response CSAs (12-well) were performed for the novel hit compounds dinaciclib and cytarabine. Dinaciclib significantly radiosensitized G7s (SER 1.47 P=0.010), G7m (SER 1.25 P=0.002) and E2 (SER 1.55 P=0.001) cells at 10 nmol/L, with E2 cells also radiosensitized at 1 nmol/L (SER 1.17 P=0.031, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

E2 cells were significantly radiosensitized by cytarabine at 50 nmol/L (SER 1.35 P=0.001). These studies confirmed concentration-dependent radiosensitizing activity of dinaciclib and cytarabine in primary GBM cells cultured in 3D.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Preclinical research is urgently required to identify therapeutic strategies for GBM that will translate into the clinic. Radiotherapy is a mainstay GBM treatment but does not achieve cure, and radiation dose-escalation is prohibited by lack of efficacy and normal brain toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The development of combination strategies to selectively sensitize GBM cells to IR is an attractive approach but has been severely limited by the low-throughput and/or low-fidelity of the preclinical models currently available.</p><p id="P35">We have successfully refined an <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D model of GBM with demonstrable clinicalrelevance for use as a screening platform for novel radiotherapy-drug combinations, with goldstandard clonogenic survival as the readout. This is a major advance on existing screens involving IR, which generally rely on cell proliferation or short-term viability as readouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. These assays have limitations: (<italic>i</italic>) viability readouts fail to discriminate cells that have lost their capacity to reproduce indefinitely; (<italic>ii</italic>) they are performed at early time-points, measuring responses after only one or two mitoses, whereas radiation-induced damaged cells may divide several times before becoming succumbing to reproductive death. The CSA is the only <italic>bona fide</italic> long-term reproductive integrity assay, and hence the most clinically-relevant.</p><p id="P36">Increasing the throughput of radiosensitizer identification experiments required reformatting of the CSA. Importantly, conversion of the ClonoScreen3D platform to 96-well format did not significantly influence treatment responses â a limitation reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This enabled the platform to compare a broad range of DDR inhibitors as well as enabling screening of expansive drug libraries in 3D cultures of primary GBM cells, for this first time.</p><p id="P37">A novel analytical parameter, the RIR, was developed based on established radiobiological approaches to enable flexible, reproducible and statistically quantifiable assessment of the interactions between radiation and drugs, even when drug activity is not known <italic>a priori</italic>. Although modestly overestimating magnitude (reducing the likelihood of false-negative results), the RIR values for PARPi correlated with SER values determined using full CSA, confirming the utility of this novel parameter. In contrast to EC<sub>50</sub> comparison, well-defined SAA drug activity is not required for RIR computation, rendering it highly advantageous for screening applications. This parameter accurately predicted activity of known radiosensitizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and discriminated non-active compounds (e.g. PDD00031704 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], erlotinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]).</p><p id="P38">Pragmatically, the relative probabilities of false-negative and false-positive findings can be tuned through P-value adjustment methodology. For example, the significance of dinaciclibâs interaction with radiation was not maintained after P-value correction in G7m cells, but it was subsequently validated as a true radiosensitizer. To ensure robustness, hits identified in the ClonoScreen3D assay should be subject to full radiation dose CSA, to confirm and quantify radiosensitizing activity.</p><p id="P39">A recently published 2D CSA screening methodology included an established GBM cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Comparison of this system with ClonoScreen3D suggested several advantages of our platform, in addition to the notable improvement in clinical relevance offered by 3D culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The method of Gomes <italic>et al.</italic> required viral transduction for colony detection, which may have consequences for cell behaviour. The assay also used high radiation doses (9 Gy) and a single drug concentration, meaning that narrow therapeutic combination windows may be missed. Furthermore, a secondary round of screening was required to distinguish between single agent and combination activity, whereas ClonoScreen3D quantifies both simultaneously and informs on drug concentrations for validation experiments. Lastly, the use of RIR to quantify drugradiation interactions may be more intuitive and familiar to radiation biologists or oncologists than Z-score based metrics.</p><p id="P40">Given their critical role in the radiation response, inhibition of DDR proteins is expected to potentiate treatment efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. As quantified by RIR, 13/15 (87%) of the DDR inhibitors tested showed a significant interaction with IR in at least one GBM cell context, confirming the assayâs ability to detect potential radiosensitizing activity. The ClonoScreen3D platform also confirmed therapeutic interactions mediated by drugs targeting other pathways previously suggested to radiosensitize GBM cells, albeit in 2D conditions, for example NFÎºB signalling (resveratrol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P41">ClonoScreen3D also identified novel radiosensitizing compounds including the FDA approved compound dinaciclib. Dinaciclib is a selective and potent inhibitor of CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK9 with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 1-4 nmol/L across the target CDKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. This compound has been well tolerated in clinical trials, exhibiting efficacy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] and relapsed multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Consistent with our findings, SAA of dinaciclib has been previously reported in 2D and 3D GBM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. A second FDAapproved drug, cytarabine, was also identified as a radiosensitizer. Cytarabine has exhibited clinical activity in two patients with astrocytoma following intraventricular administration of a liposomal formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Regrettably, this study was terminated prematurely because of slow recruitment. Crucially, following identification by ClonoScreen3D, dinaciclib and cytarabine were validated as true radiosensitizers in the gold-standard radiation dose response 3D CSA.</p><p id="P42">The work presented here describes a novel drug-screening methodology for identification of radiosensitizers using cell culture technology that reproduces clinical treatment responses. This technology allowed comparison of multiple compounds undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. Our findings support the notion that targeting the DDR is likely to provide multiple opportunities for radiosensitization of GBM, for example with inhibitors of PARP (talazoparib), ATM (AZD1390), DNA-PK (NU7441) and Chk1 (SCH900776 and AZD7762), as long as they exhibit sufficient tumour penetration and do not exacerbate neurotoxicity.</p><p id="P43">Inhibitors of other DDR proteins, for example PARG, interacted with IR in a cell contextdependent manner, confirming the need to validate compounds in multiple primary cell lines. Finally, the paucity of translatable inhibitors of HR repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] was highlighted by the screen. The majority of non-DDR targeting drugs included in our initial screen showed little radiosensitizing potential highlighting the strategic importance of DDR modulators. Advantageously, ClonoScreen3D allows newly identified candidate drugs to be benchmarked against established radiosensitizers.</p><p id="P44">The current dismal prognosis despite aggressive treatment suggests that novel combination approaches will have a crucial role in GBM therapy. Our results validate the ClonoScreen3D assay platform for identification and comparison of novel radiosensitizers for GBM and has clear potential for extension to other cancer types. This assay provides a new technology that will underpin an improved drug development pipeline, accelerating development of lead compounds to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS189152-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d94aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary File 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS189152-supplement-Supplementary_File_1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d94aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a NC3Rs grant (Grant Ref: NC/P001335/1) awarded to N.Gomez-Roman and A.J.Chalmers.
