According to the predominant model in the field, AA sufficiency drives the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface by the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, from where it coordinates the majority of cellular processes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>). Importantly, however, 15 years after its initial discovery, the teleonomy of the proposed lysosomal regulation of mTORC1, and where mTORC1 acts on its effector proteins remain enigmatic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Here, by using multiple pharmacological and genetic means to perturb the lysosomal AA sensing and protein recycling machineries, we describe the spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and downstream functions in mammalian cells, with lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 phosphorylating distinct substrates in response to different AA sources. Moreover, we reveal that a fraction of mTOR localizes at lysosomes due to basal lysosomal proteolysis that locally supplies new AAs, even in cells grown in the presence of extracellular nutrients, whereas cytoplasmic mTORC1 is regulated by exogenous AAs. Overall, our study substantially expands our knowledge about the topology of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, and hints at the existence of distinct, Rag-and lysosome-independent mechanisms that control its activity at other subcellular locations. Given the importance of mTORC1 signalling and AA sensing for human ageing and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, our findings will likely open new directions toward the identification of function-specific mTORC1 regulators, and suggest new targets for drug discovery against conditions with dysregulated mTORC1 activity in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>Rag GTPases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cell growth is a crucial and tightly regulated process. Cells take up nutrients, like AAs, from their environment and use them to synthesize complex macromolecules, which they incorporate to increase their mass and grow. As growth is very energy consuming, cells have developed mechanisms to sense nutrient availability and to adjust their metabolism accordingly, so that they only grow when conditions are optimal. These mechanisms are of great importance, as dysregulation of growth can be detrimental for cellular and organismal health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The mechanistic/mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. It functions as a sensor and a molecular rheostat that links information from the cellular milieu to the physiological and metabolic properties of the cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The availability of AAs, in particular, is one of the most powerful signals for mTORC1 activation. In fact, AA signalling can override other stimuli, e.g., growth factor availability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Because AAs are the building blocks to make proteins, and mTORC1 controls protein synthesis, this mechanism ensures that cells produce proteins only when AAs are available. In addition to protein synthesis, mTORC1 activity affects the majority of cellular functions, and, as a result, it can influence organismal health, lifespan and ageing. Hyperactivation of mTORC1—caused mainly by mutations in its upstream regulators—is of clinical relevance and a common feature of most cancer types and several metabolic disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, AA signalling to mTORC1 is medically relevant too, as nutritional AA overload has been linked to obesity and diabetes via hyperactivation of mTORC1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, how AAs regulate mTORC1 is an important question, relevant for both basic and clinical research.</p><p id="P4">Work over the last 15 years has built a lysosome-centric model of mTORC1 regulation by AAs, based on which, AAs control the subcellular localization of mTORC1 via regulating the activity of the lysosomal heterodimeric Rag GTPases, composed of RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD. Under conditions of AA sufficiency, an ‘active’ Rag dimer (GTP-bound RagA/B and GDP-bound RagC/D) recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface where it is activated by another small GTPase called Rheb <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In contrast, AA starvation leads to inactivation of the Rags (GDP-bound RagA/B and GTP-bound RagC/D) and the subsequent release of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface, which has been linked to an impairment of its activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Following the original discovery of the Rag GTPases as a central hub in AA sensing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the quest to understand how cells sense the availability of AAs over the following years has led to the identification of a large number of lysosomal and cytoplasmic proteins that modify Rag dimer activity in an AA-dependent manner (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P5">According to this model, mTORC1 is exclusively activated by AAs on the lysosomal surface, from where it controls all cellular processes, while dissociation of mTORC1 from lysosomes is linked to its inactivation. However, scattered evidence in the literature suggests that the cell biology of AA signalling to mTORC1 likely is more complex than currently appreciated. Indeed, although a fraction of mTORC1 does localize to lysosomes in cells grown under AA-replete conditions, a substantial amount of this complex is found away from lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Whether this non-lysosomal mTORC1 pool is active or inactive is an important open question. Furthermore, many of the canonical mTORC1 effectors are known to be non-lysosomal proteins, hence where and how mTORC1 acts on its various substrates is, so far, unclear. Finally, because mTORC1 activity (as assessed by the phosphorylation of its most-commonly-used substrate, S6K) acutely responds to changes in exogenous AA sufficiency, the teleonomy of the exclusively lysosomal regulation of mTORC1 by AAs remains enigmatic. Taken together, a model where mTORC1 is exclusively present and regulated on the lysosomal surface appears counterintuitive.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Basal lysosomal proteolysis and local AA production is responsible for the lysosomal recruitment and regulation of mTORC1</title><p id="P6">Previous efforts to study how AAs signal to regulate mTORC1 have focused on the lysosomally anchored Rag GTPases and revealed a complex network of proteins that regulate Rag activity and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, the reason for the lysosomal localization of mTORC1 in cells grown in the presence of AAs has been a long-standing question in the field. Given that lysosomes are the main degradative organelles in cells, we intuitively hypothesised that local AA production, due to basal protein recycling inside lysosomes, may be playing an important role in this process. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) is a macrolide antibiotic that blocks lysosomal function by targeting the V-ATPase (vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase), causing alkalinization of the lysosomal lumen and preventing protease activity, AA efflux, and autolysosome formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Consistent with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, treatment of human embryonic kidney HEK293FT cells with BafA1 caused strong accumulation of LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext. Data Fig. 1a</xref>) and increased the levels of the macro- and micro-autophagy adaptor proteins TAX1BP1, NBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext. Data Fig. 1a</xref>), and p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext. Data Fig. 1b,c</xref>), confirming that basal lysosomal proteolysis is robustly active in these cells, even when they are grown in the presence of exogenous AAs. Similar results were obtained in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext. Data Fig. 1d,e</xref>), showing that this phenomenon is not cell-type- or species-specific.</p><p id="P7">mTORC1 localization and activity respond acutely and dynamically to changes in extracellular AA availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-g</xref>). Notably, although mTORC1 can be active and is found on lysosomes under either basal or AA add-back conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-g</xref>), our previous work suggested that the mechanistic details of its activation (as indicated by the phosphorylation of its best-described substrate, S6K) may differ depending on the specific treatment strategy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref> in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>). Most importantly, the involvement of virtually all components of the lysosomal AA sensing machinery, including the Rags—as well as the upstream network that signals AA sufficiency via the Rags—has been studied using very consistently an ‘add-back’ treatment strategy, originally introduced by the Sabatini lab (50 minutes of AA starvation, followed by 10 minutes of AA re-addition). Apparently, this protocol only studies the acute re-activation of mTORC1, while overlooking the basal mTORC1 activation in unchallenged cells. Therefore, for subsequent experiments, we studied the regulation of mTORC1 under all aforementioned nutritional conditions (basal, starvation, add-back of AAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In control HEK293FT cells, mTOR showed a mixed localization pattern with part of the signal colocalizing with LAMP2 (used as a lysosomal marker) and part being diffusely cytoplasmic. As opposed to control cells, mTOR no longer colocalized with lysosomes in cells treated with BafA1, regardless of the treatment regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>), thereby supporting our initial hypothesis about basal protein recycling and local AA production in lysosomes being the cause for the lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1. Next, we assessed the effect of BafA1 on the dynamics of mTORC1 activation by AAs. Unlike most previous studies that focused on specific substrates like S6K to assay mTORC1 activity, we here tested multiple mTORC1 substrates. Interestingly, these experiments showed that phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1, two canonical substrates of mTORC1, was largely unaffected by BafA1 under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). In contrast, the re-activation of mTORC1 upon AA re-addition was compromised in BafA1-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), in line with a previous report using concanamycin A (ConA) to block lysosomal function and AA efflux from these organelles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Strikingly, unlike for S6K and 4E-BP1, the phosphorylation of TFEB, a lysosomal non-canonical mTORC1 substrate, was abolished by BafA1 under all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), paralleling the loss of lysosomal mTORC1 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Of note, culturing cells in starvation media specifically lacking AAs readily caused the dephosphorylation of all mTORC1 substrates in both control and BafA1-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Similar results were obtained by i) using concanamycin A (ConA), an independent v-ATPase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Ext. Data Fig. 2a-c</xref>); ii) using chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic weak base that alkalinizes the lysosomal lumen independently of v-ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Ext. Data Fig. 2d-f</xref>); iii) specifically inhibiting the activity of lysosomal proteases with a combination of pepstatin A (PepA) and E64 that does not affect lysosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>); or iv) by preventing the delivery of lysosomal enzymes to this compartment via transient knockdown or knockout (KO) of GNPTAB (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta), a protein responsible for proper lysosomal enzyme sorting at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-h</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To test if the persistent phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 in BafA1-treated cells is due to sustained activity of non-lysosomal mTORC1 or due to slower dephosphorylation kinetics, we performed BafA1 time-course experiments looking both at mTOR localization and activity, using S6K, 4E-BP1, and TFEB phosphorylation as read-outs. These experiments showed that mTOR lysosomal accumulations disappear already after 2 hours of BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), closely correlating with the kinetics of TFEB dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). In stark contrast, phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 stayed largely unaffected for the whole duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,e</xref>). Dephosphorylation kinetics typically depend on the counteracting activities of a kinase and the respective phosphatase. Accordingly, by blocking mTORC1 kinase activity in control and RagA/B KO cells (in which mTOR is no longer lysosomal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, like in BafA1-treated cells; see also below) with rapamycin for different times, we looked at the rate of S6K dephosphorylation as a means to assess phosphatase activity. Notably, these experiments showed that phosphatase activity toward S6K is comparable between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>), further supporting that the persistent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic mTORC1 substrates in cells with non-lysosomal mTORC1 is not due to slower or impaired dephosphorylation (i.e., due to compromised phosphatase activity).</p><p id="P9">In sum, using an orthogonal validation scheme, our data from five independent pharmacological and genetic perturbations that block basal lysosomal protein degradation i) indicate the local AA production as the reason why a proportion of mTOR localizes to lysosomes, ii) reveal that non-lysosomal mTOR retains its activity toward its canonical substrates, but not toward its lysosomal substrates, under basal culture conditions, and iii) show that the activity of this non-lysosomal mTORC1 pool is still regulated by exogenous AA availability.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The lysosomal Rag GTPases are substrate- and location-specific regulators of mTORC1</title><p id="P10">Because mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes is mediated by the Rag GTPases, to genetically dissect the lysosomal from the non-lysosomal mTORC1 regulation, and to study the functional consequences of lysosomal delocalization of mTORC1, we generated various Rag loss-of-function cell line models, lacking RagA/B or RagC/D expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As expected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, the lysosomal mTOR localization was diminished in RagA/B KO cells, under all nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). To independently validate our microscopy data, we generated control or RagA/B KO cells stably expressing HA-tagged TMEM192 as a lysosomal anchor (or FLAG-tagged TMEM192 as a negative control), and developed a modified anti-HA lyso-IP protocol (original version described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>) that allowed us to isolate fractions enriched for intact lysosomes as well as non-lysosomal fractions. These experiments confirmed that a fraction of mTORC1 (shown by the presence of mTOR and Raptor) is specifically co-purified with lysosomes in a Rag-dependent manner, while both wild-type (WT) and RagA/B KO cells contain non-lysosomal mTORC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Interestingly, despite mTORC1 being non-lysosomal in RagA/B KO cells, phosphorylation of its canonical substrate S6K was largely unaffected in unchallenged cells, grown under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), similar to our results using cells with perturbed lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1-4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext. Data Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">2</xref>). Confirming the well-established role of the Rags in the acute re-activation of mTORC1 toward S6K phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, RagA/B KO cells showed blunted recovery of mTORC1 activity upon AA re-supplementation, following AA depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Moreover, these cells demonstrated a partial resistance to AA starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), which we and others have described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and is due to loss of the Rag-mediated lysosomal recruitment of TSC (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex; a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity) upon starvation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast to the behaviour of canonical substrate phosphorylation, that of the lysosomal TFEB/TFE3 substrates was completely abolished in RagA/B KO cells under all conditions of AA availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Further strengthening the Rag-dependent separation of mTORC1 activities, and showing that this is not a clonal artefact or a cell-type-specific characteristic of the RagA/B KO HEK293FT cells, similar data were obtained using RagC/D KO HEK293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Ext. Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>), RagA/B KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Ext. Data Fig. 3d-f</xref>), and RagA/B KO SW-620 colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Ext. Data Fig. 3g</xref>). Moreover, the observed Rag- and AA-dependent effects were specific for mTORC1, as phosphorylation of AKT, a <italic>bona fide</italic> mTORC2 substrate was unaffected upon AA starvation or re-addition in control, RagA/B or RagC/D KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Ext. Data Fig. 3h,i</xref>). Finally, to assess the intrinsic activity of mTORC1, we immunopurified endogenous mTOR complexes from control or RagA/B KO cells and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase (IVK) assays, using recombinant 4E-BP1 as a substrate. Strikingly, not only the phosphorylation of the non-lysosomal mTORC1 substrates in cells, but also <italic>in vitro</italic> mTORC1 kinase activity was largely unaffected by Rag loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In support of our model that the Rags are involved primarily in the regulation of the lysosomal mTORC1 substrates, exogenous expression of an active-locked RagA (Q66L) mutant in RagA/B KO cells caused a striking increase in TFEB phosphorylation, while it only marginally increased the phosphorylation of S6K. Re-expression of WT RagA also rescued TFEB phosphorylation, albeit to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Ext. Data Fig. 3j</xref>). These data are in line with a recent study from our group showing that stable reconstitution of a different Rag KO model with cancer-associated, activating RagC mutants (as a dimer with RagA) strongly increased TFEB/TFE3 phosphorylation, without affecting that of S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>). In sum, neither loss nor re-expression of the Rags influences mTORC1 activity toward S6K, while TFEB phosphorylation is fully dependent on the presence and the activation status of the Rag dimer.</p><p id="P13">The Rag GTPase dimer is tethered to the lysosomal surface indirectly, via protein-protein interactions with the LAMTOR complex (also referred to as ‘Ragulator’) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next transiently knocked down the LAMTOR1/p14 subunit of the LAMTOR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext. Data Fig. 4a</xref>) as an additional means to dissociate mTORC1 from lysosomes, without perturbing the Rag dimer itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext. Data Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, siLAMTOR1 cells showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization of mTOR with no lysosomal accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext. Data Fig. 4c,d</xref>). In agreement with our findings from Rag KO cells, <italic>LAMTOR1</italic> knockdown strongly diminished the phosphorylation of TFEB, without affecting S6K or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation under basal culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext.

Indeed, by lyso-IP experiments, we confirmed that S6K is found in the non-lysosomal fraction and does not co-purify with lysosomes of WT or RagA/B KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), in contrast to phosphorylated TFEB which is found strongly enriched in the lysosomal fraction specifically of WT cells, but not Rag KOs. The absence of S6K localization to lysosomes is also supported by a previous proteomic study showing that the vast majority of p70-S6K1 interaction partners are cytosolic (or nuclear) proteins, and not associated with lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In sum, our data from multiple independent approaches show that both mTOR and S6K localize to the cytoplasm of Rag-deficient cells, where S6K phosphorylation likely takes place. This is consistent with the role of S6K in protein synthesis, a process that takes place primarily in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P15">In line with our data on S6K and 4E-BP1, the phosphorylation of additional non-lysosomal mTORC1 substrates and downstream effectors like ULK1, GRB10, and S6 was largely unaffected in BafA1-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) or RagA/B KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), two conditions where mTOR is non-lysosomal and the lysosomal substrates like TFEB are completely dephosphorylated.

We have recently demonstrated that, when active, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates GRASP55 on Thr264 at the Golgi to inhibit UPS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. As with the other non-lysosomal substrates, the specific GRASP55 phosphorylation by mTORC1 was not affected by loss of the Rags, and only mildly affected by BafA1 treatment, as assayed with a custom-made phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d-g</xref>). Finally, a recent study identified RagC as a direct mTORC1 substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. As its primary localization is on the lysosomal surface, we tested whether RagC phosphorylation requires lysosomal function or it behaves similarly to the cytoplasmic substrates. To achieve this, we made use of an anti-RagC antibody that is raised against the N-terminus of the protein and preferentially recognizes non-phosphorylated RagC, therefore the signal in immunoblots anti-correlates with RagC phosphorylation. Accordingly, either Torin1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>) or AA starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3) increased RagC signal. Notably, blocking lysosomal function and inhibiting lysosomal mTORC1 activity with BafA1 also led to a strong increase in RagC signal, indicating strongly decreased RagC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>), similarly to what we observed for the other lysosomal mTORC1 substrates TFEB and TFE3. The dephosphorylation of RagC occurred despite the fact that its localization to lysosomes remained unaffected by BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j,k</xref>), which indicates this is due to the delocalization of the kinase (i.e., mTORC1) and not the substrate (i.e., RagC) away from the lysosomal surface.</p><p id="P16">Overall, these data showed that, not only the Rags, but the complete lysosomal mTORC1 recruitment machinery is important for the regulation of the lysosomal mTORC1 substrates, and that the spatial and functional separation of mTORC1 activities can be achieved, not only by perturbing the expression of the Rags, but also their anchoring to the lysosomal membrane. Moreover, we find that the Rags are largely dispensable for basal mTORC1 activity in unchallenged cells, while the re-activation of mTORC1 is Rag-dependent, as reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

Indeed, by treating RagA/B or RagC/D KO cells with Torin1, a catalytic mTOR inhibitor, we confirmed that this persistent S6K phosphorylation is indeed mTOR kinase-activity-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext.

As mentioned above, albeit partially resistant at the early time points of AA starvation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, these cells do respond to AA starvation, with complete mTORC1 inactivation achieved at slightly later time points, thus showing that non-lysosomal mTORC1 can be regulated by exogenous AA availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext.

Transient downregulation of TSC2 in control or RagA/B KO cells—that leads to hyperactivation of Rheb—robustly elevated mTORC1 activity in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext. Data Fig. 5d</xref>), showing that these upstream regulators are relevant also for the activity of non-lysosomal mTORC1 toward S6K. Consistent with this, blocking growth factor signalling by using a pharmacological Akt inhibitor decreased S6K phosphorylation in RagA/B KO and control cells to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext.

Accordingly, serum starvation and FBS or insulin re-supplementation experiments in Rag KO MEFs confirmed that mTORC1 activity properly responds to growth factor or insulin stimulation in Rag-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext.

However, in line with previous work on the role of the Rags in glucose signalling to mTORC1 on lysosomes (see e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>), its activity (assayed by the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1) did not respond to glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext. Data Fig. 5h</xref>, compare lanes 6 &amp; 7), while it was readily downregulated by AA starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Ext. Data Fig. 5h</xref>, compare lanes 6 &amp; 9). Importantly, this demonstrates that non-lysosomal mTORC1 specifically senses the absence of exogenous AAs, but not of glucose.</p><p id="P19">The fact that the non-lysosomal activity of mTORC1 is under the control of exogenous AA sources hints at the existence of Rag- and lysosome-independent regulatory mechanisms via which different AA pools signal to mTORC1. The Sestrin1/2 and CASTOR1/2 proteins are cytoplasmic sensors for leucine and arginine, respectively, signalling AA availability to the Rag GTPases via the GATOR2 complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext. Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Therefore, we performed transient knockdown experiments targeting Mios, a key component of the GATOR2 protein complex, as a tool to study the possible involvement of the cytoplasmic AA sensors in the regulation of non-lysosomal mTORC1. Although downregulation of Mios strongly decreased lysosomal mTOR localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext. Data Fig. 6b,c</xref>), consistent with its previously described role in AA sensing upstream of the Rags <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, and suppressed TFEB phosphorylation under all nutritional conditions, the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 was unaffected in cells grown under basal conditions (Ext Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). As observed also for cells with Rag loss-of-function, Mios knockdown potently blunted the re-activation of mTORC1 upon AA re-addition (Ext Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Therefore, although this complex was described to integrate information from proteins that sense AA sufficiency in the cytoplasm, it still signals through the lysosomal Rag-related machinery to regulate mTORC1. These data suggest that extracellular AAs likely signal to non-lysosomal mTORC1 via mechanisms that have not been resolved yet. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that RagA/B KO cells respond to different AA groups, compared to their wild-type counterparts. In particular, while mTORC1 activity in Rag-proficient control cells is sensitive to depletion of hydrophobic (methionine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, valine; ‘– MLIGV’) or positively-charged (histidine, arginine, lysine; ‘–HRK’) AAs from the culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>), RagA/B KO cells do not respond significantly to removal of these AA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with starvation media specifically lacking serine, threonine and cysteine (‘–STC’) downregulated mTORC1 activity in RagA/B KO, but not in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext. Data Fig. 7a-d</xref>). In addition, each of the AAs within the ‘–STC’ mix was necessary for mTORC1 to stay active in Rag KO cells, as treating cells with media lacking serine, threonine, and—to a lesser extent—cysteine, singly, downregulated mTORC1 comparably to the combined removal of S+T+C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>). Because Rag-deficient cells (in which mTORC1 is non-lysosomal) demonstrate differential sensitivity of mTORC1 activity to distinct AA subgroups—compared to Rag-proficient cells that show predominantly lysosomal mTORC1—it is intriguing to predict that different sensing mechanisms exist to regulate mTORC1 in the two subcellular locations. Importantly, whereas the lysosomal Rag-related AA sensing machinery has been described extensively, the proteins and pathways that signal the availability of specific exogenous AAs to non-lysosomal mTORC1 are completely unknown. Future endeavours will be necessary to put together this AA sensing network.</p><p id="P20">Glutamine and asparagine re-supplementation was recently reported to re-activate mTORC1 (toward its canonical substrates) via the Golgi-localized Arf1 GTPase and independently from the Rags <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext.

Therefore, we next tested if Arf1 is involved in the regulation of non-lysosomal mTORC1, by performing transient knockdown experiments in RagA/B KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext. Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Although Arf1 was indeed important for full re-activation of mTORC1 upon AA add-back, it did not influence its activity under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext. Data Fig. 7c</xref>). Similarly, treatment with Golgicide A (GA) or Brefeldin A (BFA), two drugs that target the ArfGEF GBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext.

These treatments did not alter mTORC1 activity in either RagA/B KO or control cells, toward any of its substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Ext. Data Fig. 7e</xref>). Therefore, like the Rags that are dispensable for basal mTORC1 activity, Arf1 is seemingly also involved only in the re-activation of mTORC1 upon re-supplementation with specific AAs, like e.g., glutamine. Similar results were obtained previously in yeast cells, in which glutamine can regulate TORC1 in the absence of the yeast Rag homologs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 complexes regulate different cellular processes via the phosphorylation of distinct effectors</title><p id="P21">We describe here the spatial separation of mTORC1 activities toward different substrates and downstream effectors.

To investigate whether this mTORC1-dependent gene expression program depends on the presence of the Rags, we performed RNA-seq experiments and tested the expression of selected target genes for each of these TFs, comparing WT and RagA/B KO HEK293FT cells. As a control, we also re-analysed our recently published RNA-seq dataset from Rapamycin-vs. DMSO-treated HEK293FT cells, in which mTORC1 is inhibited and S6K is dephosphorylated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.

Taken together, we report here that the lysosomal and non-lysosomal mTORC1 entities regulate distinct cellular functions via the differential phosphorylation of distinct mTORC1 substrates at these subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8l</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">The reason for a lysosome-centered regulation of mTORC1 has been a major field of discussion since its introduction in 2008 (discussed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>). mTORC1 re-activation ‘makes sense’ to happen at lysosomes, where bulk macro-autophagy takes place upon amino acid starvation, degrading proteins to supply cells with fresh AAs, which in turn re-activate mTORC1. Therefore, mTORC1 is meaningfully localized in the vicinity of AA re-supplementation—following nutrient starvation—and posed for re-activation. However, this model does not sufficiently explain why mTORC1 should be activated on lysosomes in non-starved, unchallenged cells. Indeed, although the Rag GTPases localize primarily on lysosomes and regulate mTORC1 by recruiting it there <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, recent studies by us and others provide evidence that the lysosomal localization of mTORC1 and its activity (assayed by phosphorylation of S6K in most cases) are not always interrelated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, the relocalization of mTORC1 to lysosomes in response to AA re-supplementation is seemingly transient, dynamic, and involves only a fraction of the total mTOR cellular pool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, our study supports a model whereby the regulation of mTORC1 signalling by AAs also involves non-lysosomal locations and, thus, Rag-independent mechanisms that function in parallel to the lysosome-based, Rag-related AA-sensing network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8l</xref>). Based on these previous data, we hypothesize that these mTORC1 ‘pools’ are not strictly separated from each other in wild-type cells, but instead the complexes likely dynamically relocalize between the lysosomal surface, the cytoplasm and presumably other organelles (e.g., the Golgi) too, in response to local AA stimuli. Such a spatial separation of mTORC1 regulation and activities, with mTORC1 phosphorylating different substrates at distinct, functionally-relevant subcellular locations, would intuitively confer specificity and compartmentalization of its function.</p><p id="P25">Previous attempts to identify novel regulators of dTOR (<italic>Drosophila</italic> TOR) activity in a genome-wide manner in untreated <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, using the phosphorylation of S6 (a direct S6K substrate) as a read-out, failed to identify any Rag GTPase or LAMTOR orthologs among the hits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Furthermore, animal models lacking Rag activity also support the notion that additional, Rag-independent mechanisms play an important role in regulating mTORC1.

In line with this, MEFs extracted from RagA-null mice grow similarly to their WT counterparts and exhibit persistent mTORC1 activity (assayed by phosphorylation of its canonical substrates), despite having blunted mTORC1 lysosomal localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In another mouse model, deletion of both RagA and RagB slightly reduced (approx. 30%) but did not abolish mTORC1 activity in MEFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> or in cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. Genetic studies in zebrafish also showed that TORC1 signalling is apparently normal in RagA-mutant larvae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>.
