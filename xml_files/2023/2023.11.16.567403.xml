Electron microscopy provides the necessary resolution, yet - as electrons penetrate samples for only a few 100s of nm - requires physical sectioning or ablation, which strongly challenges anatomical investigations of entire organs such as mammalian brains. As demonstrated for the engineering and physical sciences, X-ray nanotomography represents a promising alternative for ultrastructural 3d imaging without physical sectioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Leveraging the high brilliance of 4th generation synchrotron X-ray sources, it has the potential to non-destructively image mm<sup>3</sup>-sized samples at ultrastructural resolution within a few days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A fundamental barrier to application to the life sciences is that, when irradiated with high-intensity X-rays, biological samples deform and ultimately disintegrate, prohibiting reaching sufficient resolution. Here, we introduce a combination of engineering solutions which defeat this barrier for X-ray ptychography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, a coherent diffractive X-ray imaging technique. The solutions include a cryogenic sample stage with high stability, high-precision interferometric positioners and tailored non-rigid tomographic reconstruction algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, adapting an epoxy resin developed for the nuclear and aerospace industry, we demonstrate radiation resistance to X-ray doses exceeding 10<sup>10</sup> Gy. The resulting sub-40 nm isotropic resolution makes it possible to densely resolve axon bundles, boutons, dendrites and reliably identify synapses without physical sectioning. Moreover, we validated the X-ray technique using the current gold standard, namely focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to demonstrate intact ultrastructure in tissue volumes first imaged by X-rays. This unlocks the potential of X-ray tomography for high-resolution tissue imaging, coinciding with the transformative advancements of next-generation synchrotrons worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Current gold-standard methods for dense tissue reconstruction rely on volume electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. As electron penetration depth into tissue is limited to at most a few 100 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, obtaining 3-dimensional information requires tissue sectioning or milling either before preparing samples for imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or during image acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Such workflows present significant challenges for reliable continuous image acquisition, with the risk of information loss during month-long experiments, and experimental analysis which requires reconstruction and alignment of multimodal datasets.</p><p id="P3">X-rays can penetrate samples of several mm to cm, allowing for largely non-destructive imaging of tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Laboratory X-ray sources can resolve cell bodies and even large neurites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> but their limited brilliance makes high-resolution imaging extremely time-consuming. Large scale synchrotron facilities can provide high-brilliance X-rays at wavelengths in the Ångstrom range, and are therefore driving the development of imaging methods capable of providing 3D resolution down to 10s of nanometres for hard, inorganic nanostructures with high density contrast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Application of these methods to biological imaging has enabled reliable identification of various biological features including blood vessels, cell bodies and large neurites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. More recently, thin neurites were identified at a resolution of ∼100 nm using nano-holotomography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Fundamentally, however, the resolution in X-ray tomography scales with the 4th power of the radiation dose, i.e. to increase the resolution by a factor of 5 in the same sample, the X-ray dose needs to be increased by a factor of 5<sup>4</sup>=625-fold. X-ray imaging of soft biological tissue was previously thought to be limited by tissue contrast and by the radiation dose that can be employed before the tissue is damaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and it remained unclear whether key ultrastructural features could be examined with X-rays at sufficient resolution.</p><p id="P4">To overcome the limited X-ray image contrast inherent to soft tissues, we combine heavy-metal staining protocols developed for volume electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> with high-resolution ptychographic tomography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Radiation damage is minimised by imaging samples under cryogenic conditions using a recently developed cryogenic ptychographic tomography instrument<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and by embedding them in a newly identified highly radiation-resistant resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Residual sample deformations will introduce inconsistencies between the acquired projections, for which we compensate computationally, in order to avoid loss of 3D reconstruction quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. By combining these techniques, we obtain an isotropic 3D resolution of 38 nm for neural tissue, sufficient for resolving synapses, while simultaneously maintaining tissue integrity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">X-ray ptychography is performed by scanning a sample across a confined, coherent beam a few µm in diameter and measuring diffraction patterns in the far field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Using iterative reconstruction algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, these diffraction patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>) are then used to produce phase images, which are proportional to the projected electron density of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1(b)</xref>). To perform ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PXCT), the projections are acquired at multiple sample rotation angles from 0 to 180 degrees, followed by tomographic reconstruction of a 3D sample volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1(c)</xref>). Resolution in X-ray ptychography is limited not by the beam size but by the angular acceptance of the detector, which determines the maximum observable spatial frequencies, and the applied X-ray dose, which determines the signal-to-noise ratio of the spatial frequencies within the recorded diffraction patterns. Since the imaging geometry can be adjusted relatively easily, radiation damage and weak intrinsic scattering of biological tissues are the main factors limiting the attainable resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We therefore employed a recently developed cryo-tomography stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> to cool samples to &lt;95 K and to reduce the structural changes caused by ionising radiation, in combination with a staining and embedding protocol to maximise contrast. Additionally, we applied a new non-rigid tomography reconstruction algorithm, designed to compensate for radiation-induced deformation of the sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In the following, we present tomograms from mouse brain tissue (the radiatum layer of hippocampus, the external plexiform and glomerular layers from the olfactory bulb, and upper layers of neocortex as structures rich in neurites and dendritic shaft and spine synapses) at different radiation doses.</p><p id="P6">To assess what brain structures PXCT can resolve, we stained external plexiform layer tissue from mouse olfactory bulb with a ROTO stain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> embedded it in a ‘hard Epon’ resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (hard epon resins A and B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 5.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Table 3</xref>, see resin descriptions in the section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>) and prepared pillars with a diameter of 10-30 µm. At a dose of 1.8×10<sup>7</sup> Gy we were able to readily resolve dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(a1)</xref>); using Fourier shell correlation (FSC, solid line in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(c)</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> we estimated an isotropic 3D resolution of 84 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(c1, d)</xref>). Cryo-cooling is thought to reduce structural changes that limit resolution in X-ray imaging due to radiation damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Consistent with this notion, acquired tomograms did not show any indication of significant blurring or other signs of structural changes due to radiation damage. Irradiating a sample with an increased radiation dose of 8.4×10<sup>7</sup> Gy resulted in a 3D resolution of 69 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(a2, c2, d)</xref>). However, contrary to theoretical predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, an even higher dose of 3.8×10<sup>8</sup> Gy did not enable an enhanced resolution (70 nm; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(a3, c3, d)</xref>). In particular, the sample deformed, presumably due to “softening” of the embedding resin, as seen when comparing low resolution tomograms acquired with ∼2.6×10<sup>8</sup> Gy intermittent irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.1</xref>). As a result, the resolution of the combined tomogram decreased based on visual blurring in the 3D volume and the decrease of the correlation at several spatial frequencies, as determined by FSC analysis <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(a3, c3)</xref>. To take these sample changes into account, we applied a non-rigid tomography reconstruction approach that estimates the deformations between the subtomograms and includes them into the tomographic reconstruction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.1</xref>). This deformation correction method requires tailored data acquisition where the whole angular range from 0 to 180 degrees is split into multiple equally spaced angular ranges to acquire multiple subtomograms. In doing so, each subtomogram provides a low-resolution snapshot of the sample at a given time point. By calculating the 3D optical flow between these subtomograms, the deformation fields can be estimated across a range of time points and interpolated to describe the changes between all collected projections. Accounting for radiation-induced changes in this manner recovered higher spatial frequencies (as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(b)</xref> and from the FSC in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(c)</xref>) which translated into an improved 3D resolution of 49.7 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2(b,d)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(b3,c3,d)</xref>), i.e., close to the theoretical predictions of resolution improving with the fourth power of dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The use of non-rigid tomography consistently improved the expected scaling between the radiation dose and attainable resolution across the measured samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2(d)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2(d)</xref>). Measured at a temperature of ∼90 K, tissue was radiation-stable at doses up to 6×10<sup>8</sup> Gy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.4</xref>) when embedded with either of the traditional EM-embedding resins EMbed812 or Epon812<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">methods</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Using this improved approach with imaging ROTO-stained samples at cryogenic temperatures with non-rigid tomographic reconstructions we obtained 3D tomograms for ROTO-stained and either Epon812 or EMbed812-embedded tissue from a variety of brain regions, including olfactory bulb external plexiform layer, glomerular layer, hippocampus stratum radiatum, and layer 2-3 of somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This allowed us to visualise e.g. neurites, mitochondria, myelin, or nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">A critical feature for connectomics is the detection of synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(c)</xref>). Thus, we assessed whether PXCT would allow the identification of such structures. Indeed, for a dose of 3.8×10<sup>8</sup> Gy in Epon-embedded olfactory bulb samples, structures resembling synapses became apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(a)</xref>). PXCT being a largely non-destructive technique, we subsequently processed the same specimen using focused ion beam milling combined with scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). This allowed us to obtain insights into potential ultrastructural alterations induced by the X-ray irradiation as well as obtain a “ground truth” for structure identification and further quantification. The FIB-SEM reconstruction showed a mild curtaining effect that might be the consequence of radiation-induced changes to the embedding medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.1</xref>). However, the overall ultrastructure was not noticeably impacted by prior X-ray radiation dosage of ∼4×10<sup>8</sup> Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(b)</xref>). In particular, membranes were left intact, as were subcellular features such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula or vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.1</xref>). Aligning the FIB-SEM with the PXCT dataset allowed us to directly compare structures identified in PXCT with the ground truth data obtained from FIB-SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(a,b,c)</xref>). To quantify the reliability of synapse identification, we performed two approaches: Firstly, we traced individual dendrites in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(d)</xref>) and performed independent manual labelling of synapses in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(d)</xref>). More than two-thirds of synapses identified in the FIB-SEM dataset were recognized in a blind analysis of PXCT images (225/338 synapses, 70±6%, n=5 dendrites <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(d,e)</xref>). Additionally, to obtain true estimates of precision and reliability, three annotators were presented with randomly sampled 1 µm<sup>3</sup> volumes of the FIB-SEM or PXCT datasets and asked to indicate whether or not a synapse was present in the volume with a confidence score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>). Using the FIB-SEM dataset as ground truth again, PXCT annotation showed a recall of synapse presence of 60% with a precision of 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(f)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Increasing resolution further would benefit in particular automated reconstruction methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> but this would require an even higher X-ray dose. Epon-embedded samples started displaying deformations consistent with mass loss possibly compromising ultrastructural features. In agreement with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, significant radiation damage such as widespread mass loss was consistently observed at doses &gt; 6×10<sup>8</sup> Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(b,c,d)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.4</xref>). In order to improve radiation resistance, we turned to resins previously developed for nuclear reactors or the aerospace industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, optimised for stability in the presence of ionising radiation. Screening a battery of such resins, we identified a low viscosity epoxy with good infiltration properties consisting of triglycidyl para-aminophenol (TGPAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(e)</xref>), a triglycidyl ether of para-aminophenol. Like Epon812, TGPAP monomers are tri-functional, i.e. they contain three epoxy groups, but additionally also a benzene ring and a tertiary amine group. For curing, we used the 4,4’-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM), a well-known hardener with two primary amine groups that react with the epoxy groups of TGPAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 5.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). The three epoxy groups per molecule allow for increased crosslinking during curing, leading to superior mechanical strength, chemical and radiation resistance, as well as thermal stability. Moreover, the benzene rings in both the monomer and the hardener are thought to further increase radiation resilience. To assess radiation resistance, we exposed samples embedded in Epon812 or TGPAP to a broad bandwidth beam with an average energy of 25 keV, generated by a bending magnet at ESRF’s beamline BM05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. While Epon samples disintegrated at &lt;10<sup>9</sup> Gy (based on measurements with a monochromatic 6.2 keV beam at SLS), TGPAP samples showed little sign of mass loss or compromise of cellular features even with prolonged exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(f)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp Video 5.1</xref>). When we reconstructed PXCT tomograms from Epon812 at different total doses we noticed visible damage and mass-loss in the irradiated areas once total dose exceeded ∼6×10<sup>8</sup> Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(c,d)</xref>). Using TGPAP for embedding (with the same ROTO staining and mouse olfactory bulb tissue) we found no indication of mass loss and only localised sub-micron punctae that seemed to emerge with a total dose of &gt;10<sup>9</sup> Gy but did not impact on relevant tissue features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(g,h)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 5.2</xref>). Importantly, TGPAP tissue penetration is comparable to commonly used Epon and the ultrastructure is well preserved (even after irradiation with a total dose exceeding 2×10<sup>9</sup> Gy) as verified by FIB-SEM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(i,j)</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Embedding heavy-metal stained tissue in TGPAP therefore allowed us to significantly increase the cumulative radiation dose for PXCT. This in turn enabled us to further increase the resolution to 38 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(j)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2(c,d)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp Video 5.2</xref>).

Importantly, FIB-SEM milling confirmed that the ultrastructure was intact after irradiation with a dose exceeding 10<sup>10</sup> Gy.

While employing sub-nm wavelengths, resolution in X-ray imaging of biological soft tissue is generally limited by contrast. Furthermore, the softness of embedding materials raises susceptibility to radiation damage, which ultimately limits the maximum attainable resolution. When heavy metal stains are employed, they increase contrast and X-ray absorption. Absorption, however, underlies radiation damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

However, none of these alterations resulted in any significant ultrastructural changes. We have also shown that non-rigid tomography reconstruction algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> can largely compensate for radiation-induced deformations and improve resolution by modelling the tissue expansion explicitly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.1</xref>). Moreover, the OMNY stage, which we have developed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, allows for cooling to liquid helium temperatures.

To enhance radiation resilience, we therefore turned to the aerospace and nuclear industry that critically depends on epoxies resistant to ionising radiation. We identified one resin (TGPAP-DDM, referred to as ‘TGPAP’ and ‘Resin E’ for simplicity) that penetrated tissue well, preserving ultrastructure, and showed significantly improved radiation resistance. In fact, we could not observe substantial mass loss or significant damage to tissue samples at radiation levels that caused macroscopic holes and widespread damage in Epon812 embedded samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5(f)</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp Video 5.1</xref>).

Ultrastructure (e.g. membranes, protein clusters) seem to be largely unimpacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4(b,h)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5(i)</xref>); however, such deformations result in blurred tomographic reconstructions, limiting resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 2.2</xref>).

For the estimation of the 3D resolution of a tomographic dataset, we compute the 3D Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of two subtomograms, each computed using half of the tomographic projections. In this way, we obtain two datasets acquired independently, albeit each with double angular sampling. We then compare the FSC with a threshold according to the ½-bit criterion, which corresponds to a signal to noise ratio of 0.4 for the full tomographic dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Synapse identification</title><p id="P40">The synapse identification tasks were performed on the sample for which both FIB-SEM as well as ptychography data were available.</p><p id="P41">Two synapse identification approaches are presented: a dendrite-centric one and a randomised “captcha”-like detection.</p><p id="P42">For the dendrite-centric synapse identification task, five dendrites evolving in straight trajectories in distinct directions were chosen and traced (in a skeleton format) from the ground truth FIB-SEM dataset. The dendrites chosen all presented a pale cytoplasm, straight trajectory, no branches and consistent thickness of around 2 µm, to ensure they could be followed in the datasets of both imaging modalities. Since the sample this dataset belongs to was extracted from the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, these dendrites are likely to be lateral (and possibly apical) dendrites of projection neurons (mitral or tufted cells). Each dendrite skeleton was followed three times independently looking at one orthogonal plane only, and every time all features resembling synapses were annotated by seeding single nodes. This operation was performed for both the FIB-SEM as well as the ptychography dataset (n = 725 initial nodes in FIB-SEM, 576 initial nodes in PXCT). All nodes seeded in the FIB-SEM dataset were assumed to be pointing to true synapses. Based on previous studies, synapse density was estimated to be of 1-2 synapse / µm<sup>3</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. First, we obtained a census of synapses by looking at the FIB-SEM data alone: nodes seeded ≤ 300 nm away from each other were assumed to be pointing to the same synapse, which lead to a total census of 338 synapses in all 5 dendrites. Most synapses (273/338, 81%) were detected on the first pass in the FIB-SEM dataset, and only a small fraction of the final census was only found at the 3rd and last pass (65/338, 19%), consistent with the assumption that synapses are well resolved in the FIB-SEM data. Next, the nodes seeded in the ptychography dataset were matched with the previously defined census of synapses through a similar process: FIB-SEM-validated synapse locations receiving a tag from the ptychography dataset within a 300 nm euclidean distance were marked as ‘detected’. Most detected synapses in X-rays (148/225, 66%) were already detected on the first pass in the ptychography dataset, and only a small fraction were only detected at the 2nd and last passes (77/225, 34%). A number of annotations of putative synapses in the ptychography datasets were not matched to any synapse. These annotations were further used to detect robust confounding factors when annotating synapses. Locations in the dataset receiving ≥ 2 tags within a ≤ 300 nm distance were defined as ‘hot spots’ for confusion. A total of 36 hotspots were detected, and their ultrastructure was revisited in the FIB-SEM dataset. Features providing the confusion were then identified by toggling the view of the ptychography and FIB-SEM dataset in the browser, and ultimately the nature of the feature leading to false positive detection in the ptychography dataset was annotated categorically. After revisiting the ultrastructure of all 36 false positive hotspots, we quantified the prevalence of the different feature categories.</p><p id="P43">For the “captcha”-like synapse detection task, we generated 250 non-overlapping and randomly located 1*1*1 µm<sup>3</sup> regions of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>). These regions could be displayed as cubes with 3 red faces and 3 green faces in the webknossos environment. The task consisted in determining whether a given region contained a synapse or not, by assigning a confidence score of [1 = clearly not containing a synapse, 2, 3, 4 = clearly containing a synapse]. If the synapse was only partly contained inside the region, it would only be taken into account if it exits the region through a green boundary. Additionally, ten locations known to contain a synapse (extracted from the previous dendrite-centric analysis) were chosen as training data. Finally, the task was encoded within the webknossos ecosystem such as one would be navigated from region to region after each answer was being recorded, and only one dataset (the one being tested each time) would be presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>). The task, overall, consisted on exploring the X-ray and FIB-SEM appearance of 10 training synapses, then assess the presence of synapses in the 250 regions in the ptychography dataset, and then assess the presence of synapses in the 250 regions in the FIB-SEM dataset. Three independent annotators, all experts in the appearance of synapses when their fine ultrastructure is resolved (e.g. by FIB-SEM) ran the task. The analyses returned therefore a 250 regions x 3 annotators x 2 imaging modalities array of responses, each with a value of either [1, 2, 3, 4]. In some cases, some annotators did not log a response before switching to the next task, which provided a value of 0. Only regions with correct assessments from all 3 annotators were kept, providing a cleaned up array of 240×3×2 responses. By matching region IDs, this array was represented in a 240×6 table and complemented with other regional metadata in additional columns. For every region, the average score from each imaging modality was calculated from all scores given by the three annotators. All 4 possible values were well represented in both imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>). At this point, table rows were split into 4 groups according to the average FIB-SEM scores of each region (rounded to the closest integer). This allowed plotting the scores assigned in the ptychography data depending on the score given in the FIB-SEM data at the same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4(f)</xref>). The average responses of all regions in both modalities were later binned into two categories (average score ≤2 categorised as ‘no synapse’; average score &gt; 2 categorised as ‘synapse’). This allowed extracting a confusion matrix on the detectability of synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig. 4.2</xref>).</p><p id="P44">The segmentation and renderings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp Video 5.2</xref> have been generated using the image analysis services of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ariadne.ai">https://ariadne.ai</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><caption><title>Tomogram series.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d118aAcFbC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary table 2</label><caption><title>Monomers used in all resins.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d118aAcFcC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><caption><title>Monomer ratios used in each resin.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d118aAcFdC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><caption><title>Imaging parameters of selected datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d118aAcFeC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Video 5.1</label><caption><title>Radiation-sensitivity of Epon812 and TGPAP embedded stained olfactory bulb tissue.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Video_5_1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d118aAcFfC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Video 5.2</label><caption><title>Tomogram of a TGPAP embedded sample with a resolution of 38 nm.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Video_5_2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d118aAcFgC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Video 5.3</label><caption><title>3D rendering of tomogram with segmented features.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Video_5_3.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d118aAcFhC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS191291-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d118aAcFiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the biological research and scientific computing science technology platforms of the Francis Crick Institute.
